IRABU'S EFFORT SEEMS LACKING, SO YANKEES PUSH PITCHERS HARD 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. _ Hideki Irabu's lackadaisical play on Saturday
spurred coaches to conduct the Yankees' version of boot camp
Sunday, and 14 pitchers, including Irabu, went through an hourlong
series of drills in single file, some bending over and gasping.
</P>
<P>
   Irabu would have been first in line if the coaching staff had
had its way _ the first in line to acknowledge responsibility for
an approach that infuriated many of his teammates. First in line to
demonstrate aggressiveness the coaching staff would love to see all
the time. First in line to show them that his appalling body
language in Saturday's exhibition game was an aberration.
</P>
<P>
   But when the pitchers stepped forward to practice covering first
base, Irabu was last in line. He was last in line when they fielded
bunts, last in line when they backed up third, last in line when
they ran bases, moving with great deliberation all the while. Mel
Stottlemyre, the Yankees' pitching coach, said later that he wished
Irabu went through the drills ``with a little more enthusiasm.''
</P>
<P>
   Irabu is not immediately in jeopardy of losing his place in the
Yankees' rotation. But with his play Saturday, when he failed to
cover first base or hold runners and appeared to others within the
organization as if he just did not care, according to one teammate
who did not want to be identified, Irabu is on the verge of
alienating other Yankees who compete desperately and daily. Irabu
next pitches Thursday, and Stottlemyre said he needed to improve.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, we'll see a big turnaround in his next outing,''
Stottlemyre said, ``because the same kind of outing would create a
lot of doubts _ not for me, but in the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Stottlemyre likes pitchers, empathizes with them, rarely utters
a negative word about them. When he gently suggested that Irabu
``may have quit a little bit'' Saturday, it had the same shock
value as any George Steinbrenner blast.
</P>
<P>
   Irabu, however, did not seem to understand the criticism Sunday,
at one point laughing at the implication of reporters' questions to
him. Asked if he would do anything different in his outing Saturday
if he had the chance, Irabu said, ``Nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course he tries hard all the time, he insisted. Of course he
concentrates all the time. ``I pitched in 30 games over the course
of the season last year,'' Irabu said through an interpreter,
George Rose, ``and I did my best in every game.''
</P>
<P>
   Irabu tired of inquiries about the appearance that he stopped
competing, about body language that indicated to others that he did
not care _ that he ``quit a little bit.'' With measured sarcasm,
Irabu said: ``Sometimes I feel like I should stand up straight and
put on a silk necktie. Maybe that will make them feel I'm
concentrating.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, the Yankees were thrilled with Irabu's effort. He
had taken to following the example of Roger Clemens, working out
diligently, and he lost about 10 pounds in a week. Joe Torre, the
Yankees' manager, had said at the start of camp that Irabu needed
to step up his effort this year, and that is what Irabu did.
</P>
<P>
   But Irabu has gained most of that weight back, and the era of
good feelings evaporated quickly when teammates saw him fail to
cover first base Saturday, lob pickoff throws and ignore base
runners, which meant catcher Jorge Posada had little chance to
throw them out. Posada all but refused to comment Sunday on Irabu's
performance, saying only, ``You saw it.''
</P>
<P>
   Irabu is surrounded by teammates like Paul O'Neill, who is
dedicated to getting hits in every at-bat, and David Cone, who is
respected because he competes ferociously even on the days his arm
feels terrible.
</P>
<P>
   Stottlemyre said the reliever Jeff Nelson did ask him if all the
pitchers were running Sunday only because of Irabu's performance
Saturday, and Stottlemyre assured him that recent fundamental
mistakes had contributed to the convening of the one-day boot camp
as well. Other than that, ``I haven't heard anything from the
players'' directly about Irabu, Stottlemyre said. ``But I don't
need to. They're a demanding bunch.''
</P>
<P>
   Irabu is mostly a loner on this team. Without established
relationships, teammates do not view his outings through the prism
of some personality trait. O'Neill throws a bat and teammates chalk
that up to his intensity. Andy Pettitte struggled last spring and
others figured he was worried about his pregnant wife. If something
is bothering Irabu _ and he said no personal issues were nagging at
him _ nobody will know it.
</P>
<P>
   His second-half slump last year drew down his reservoir of good
will with teammates, and now many judge him strictly on what he
does on the field. On Saturday, they did not like what they saw.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is hopefully a one-day setback,'' Stottlemyre said,
``from where he was before.''
</P>
<P>
   INSIDE PITCH:
</P>
<P>
   Reggie Jackson, the Hall of Fame slugger, who had a falling-out
with the Yankees' principal owner, George Steinbrenner, last week,
was here Sunday and met with Steinbrenner, in a first step to
normalize relations. ... Andy Pettitte pitched two shutout innings
in a Class AAA exhibition Sunday, his latest push toward a return
to the big leagues. Pettitte, coming back from a strained elbow,
will probably pitch in a minor-league exhibition Thursday and open
the season on the disabled list. ... David Cone pitched five
innings and Orlando Hernandez four in the Yankees' 8-5 exhibition
loss to the Tampa Bay Devil Rays. Both Cone and Hernandez struggled
with their command at times. ... The Yankees gave outfielder Jerome
Walton his unconditional release and assigned a highly touted
prospect, Alfonso Soriano, to their minor-league camp.

BOOKS MAY CHANGE HANDS, BUT STORE'S BEEN AVENUE FOR 25 YEARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA YOST  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. _ Changing Hands Bookstore has lasted longer than
most marriages and some countries.
</P>
<P>
   It has witnessed book trends from home improvement to
self-improvement, from Eastern philosophy to neurolinguistic
programming.
</P>
<P>
   It has survived the onslaught of big chains and urban renewal.
</P>
<P>
   With a philosophy of customer service and community involvement,
Changing Hands endures in a world beset by retail metamorphosis. On
Thursday, the Tempe landmark will celebrate its 25th anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   That news may make some faithful customers feel a little ancient
themselves. Has it really been a quarter of a century since a
cubbyhole on Fifth Street opened its door to bibliophiles seeking a
reading refuge?
</P>
<P>
   Believe it.
</P>
<P>
   Not only has the store survived, it has become something of a
minichain itself. Last year, a second store opened at 6428 S.
McClintock Drive in Tempe as a sister to the 414 Mill Ave. store,
which replaced the original location in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   No one is more surprised with the store's longevity than its
owners.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think it was going to last,'' says Gayle Shanks, who
launched Changing Hands with husband Bob Sommer and their friend,
Tom Broderson. ``I didn't see 25 years in it.''
</P>
<P>
   But, Sommer says, ``The moment I got into the bookstore, I felt
I'd come home.''
</P>
<P>
   His sentiments are echoed by long-time customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like it's a place of nostalgia in terms of my roots
here,'' says Walt Richardson, lead singer of the Tempe-based
Morning Star Band and Tempe resident since 1974. ``Changing Hands
has always been a landmark where people would meet.''
</P>
<P>
   Carla Elling, director of the Creative Writing program at
Arizona State University, has been a Changing Hands loyalist since
the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been captivated by the wild seat-of-the-pants
energy and ingenuity of their co-op beginnings, their amazing
growth as a business and as an extended community/family of book
lovers,'' Elling says.
</P>
<P>
   Those legions of book lovers have increased from a trickle to a
flood. In the beginning, Changing Hands clerks were lucky to see
three customers a day. By 1998, the number was up to about 160,000
a year.
</P>
<P>
   In 25 years, millions of books have sold, and rent has risen
from $125 a month to an astounding $10,000.
</P>
<P>
   The philosophy of the shop remains the same: Keep the customer
satisfied.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're always willing to go out of our way to order a book,
even if we don't make a profit on it,'' Sommer says.
</P>
<P>
   Such notions would send shivers through a conventional
corporation. Changing Hands has never been conventional.
</P>
<P>
   Flip back through the pages of the Changing Hands biography and
you find the story of three hippies who made good turning their
passion for reading into an American enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   In 1973, Sommer and Shanks were married and living in converted
Army barracks, where they paid $55 a month in rent and tended a
small garden in their back yard. Shanks was finishing her teaching
certificate at ASU, while Sommer taught math there and ran a
hand-loom workshop, crafting looms for local weavers.
</P>
<P>
   The three twentysomething friends also were teaching at an
alterative school called the Free Learners Society at Third Avenue
and Roosevelt Street in Phoenix. After school let out, they would
sit on the porch and daydream about opening a bookstore.
</P>
<P>
   The fantasy seemed like nirvana _ becoming intimate with the
bestseller list, rubbing elbows with famous authors. Tempe needed
another bookstore, they believed. The neighborhood had only Hill's
at the Tempe Center and nearby Books, Etc.
</P>
<P>
   A tiny bookstore on Mill Avenue, Caveat Emptor, was faltering.
Broderson, who had finished high school but was not in college,
seized the opportunity. With $500 borrowed from his father, he
bought the store lock, stock and paperback and watched the former
owner grab his check and gleefully race out the front door.
</P>
<P>
   Broderson had himself a bookstore. But it seemed doomed.
</P>
<P>
   With rent scheduled to increase to $300 from $125 a month, he
hung on through the next Mill Avenue Fair with help from Shanks,
then closed the business. Shanks helped him cart the leftover books
to his parents' house in Tempe.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't long before Broderson showed up at Sommer and Shank's
house and interrupted their gardening to ask a favor: Would they go
into the book business with him? He had found a new building at 9
E. Fifth St. where he could sublease 500 square feet of affordable
space.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said yes,'' Shanks says. ``It took me 12 seconds.''
</P>
<P>
   Sommer remained committed to his teaching and his loom workshop
but joined the book business the next year.
</P>
<P>
   With an additional $300 borrowed from Broderson's father and a
$1,500 loan from First National Bank, Broderson and Shanks went to
work building book shelves and ordering books.
</P>
<P>
   The most popular titles then were signs of the times: ``The
Whole Earth'' ``Catalog, Finding and Buying Your Place in the
Country, Zen Mind Beginner's'' ``Mind''.``''
</P>
<P>
   Because many of the books were used, recycled and traded,
Broderson gave the store its appropriate name. Changing Hands
opened April 1, 1974.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one came in, that's my memory,'' Shanks says with a laugh
about their first day of business.
</P>
<P>
   Those slow days gave her time to read, weave textiles on a small
loom and chat with friends. She rode her bike to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was fun,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   But fun didn't pay the bills. The store didn't turn a profit for
six months.
</P>
<P>
   Success came gradually. Broderson and Shanks expanded their
stock, buying much of it at swap meets. They began carrying more
new books, heeding customer requests.
</P>
<P>
   Early customers were denizens of the Age of Aquarius. They ate
sprouts, defied authority, preserved the environment and expanded
their consciousness. They wore love beads and Birkenstock sandals.
</P>
<P>
   Shanks looks down at her own feet and laughs. She's still
wearing Birkenstocks.
</P>
<P>
   A list of Changing Hands' first neighbors is a blast from the
past: The Armadillo Wax Shop (candles), the original Gentle
Strength co-op (wheat germ), Earthen Joy (whole-grain sandwiches),
Happy Trails head shop (water pipes).
</P>
<P>
   Tempe officials welcomed Changing Hands. When the city began
downtown redevelopment in 1978, architects designed the space at
414 E. Mill with the store in mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to keep them there,'' says Harry Mitchell, who was
Tempe mayor from 1978 to 1994 and a City Council member for eight
years before that. ``Changing Hands symbolizes what we've tried to
do in downtown Tempe - businesses that are unique.''
</P>
<P>
   ASU professors sent their students to the store, which carried
texts assigned in Creative Writing classes and the then-new Women's
Studies program. One customer set up a subsection on feminist works
and non-sexist books for children.
</P>
<P>
   ``For years, Changing Hands was the only bookstore in the Valley
that took women's literature and feminist studies seriously,'' says
Mary Rothschild, director of Women's Studies at ASU.
</P>
<P>
   By May 1978, Changing Hands had outgrown its little Fifth Street
location and abandoned it for the location on Mill. Boxes of books
were transported via a human chain of 50 friends, family, customers
and ASU professors that stretched 500 feet between the two stores.
</P>
<P>
   Workers stocking the new shelves ate pizza and sang an African
chant, ````Dumaah abutay,'''' recalls Pinna Joseph, who came on
board just before the relocation. Joseph now is a partner and
director of marketing and promotion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were just ecstatic,'' Shanks says. ``We thought we were in
heaven. It was three times the space.''
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, they outgrew that space, too. By 1983, says Susie
Brazil, partner and manager of the McClintock store, ``we had no
room; there was no space where we could even set a card rack.''
</P>
<P>
   In the same week that Sommer and Shanks received notice that
their soon-to-be-adopted son had been born, they were knocking down
walls and expanding to the south.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, they expanded north.
</P>
<P>
   Broderson had left the business by then to open a bookstore in
Prescott called the Satisfied Mind. He still leases a small section
of the Mill Avenue store, offering out-of-print and collectible
books.
</P>
<P>
   Though Changing Hands continues to thrive, downtown Tempe has
changed around it, shifting focus from retail businesses to
entertainment. Restaurants and bars attract a younger crowd that
would rather hang out than shop.
</P>
<P>
   New parking procedures can be frustrating. Walk-by traffic has
declined.
</P>
<P>
   Changing Hands hopes to ride out the storm.
</P>
<P>
   ``If rent stays reasonable, we will stay on Mill,'' Sommer says.
</P>
<P>
   Store owners are hedging their bets with the McClintock
location, situated in a strip mall. The Mill Avenue store is
returning to its used-book roots and reducing its size by a third.
</P>
<P>
   Changing Hands faithful need not despair.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a return to our roots in a positive way,'' Shanks says.
``It's a huge challenge. We are so committed to staying downtown
and being a community bookstore.''
</P>
<P>
   The McClintock outlet is a big, beautiful shop filled with new
and used books, cards, candles and gift items and staffed by clerks
who know and love books.
</P>
<P>
   In late April, the Wildflower Bread Co. moves in next door with
access to Changing Hands, giving readers something to snack on
after they've selected their reading material.
</P>
<P>
   One thing that won't change is the Changing Hands philosophy. As
they once hoed their garden of tomatoes, broccoli and lettuce,
Sommer, Shanks and now Joseph and Brazil say they continue to
cultivate a clientele that shares their passion for literature.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love it,'' Sommer says of his work. ``It's great when you
order a book and then you shelve it, and you show a customer the
book and you recommend it. Then you meet the author. You've felt
the complete cycle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It actually feels like you're doing the right thing.'' &QL;

ROCKET BOY WINS FAVOR OF SPACE ENTHUSIASTS, WHO SLAM SCHOOL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM GINTONIO  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ The ``Rocket Boy'' of the Phoenix's Deer Valley School
District is quickly becoming a cult figure among space wonks around
the country.
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen-year-old David Silverstein, a seventh-grader who was
suspended for the rest of the school year for bringing a homemade
rocket to Desert Sky Middle School, has caught the attention of
scientists, a Ph.D. from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and just
plain folks who were surprised that school officials would take
such drastic measures.
</P>
<P>
   David's parents, who will home-school their son, are in the
process of appealing the suspension. The matter likely will come up
during an April 13 school board meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The groundswell of support for David began with NASA engineer
Homer Hickam. Hickam's high school interest in rocketry is
portrayed in the movie ``October'' ``Sky,'' which inspired David to
build his rocket.
</P>
<P>
   The youngster last &UR; week accepted an invitation from Space
Adventures to attend an Astronaut Rocketry Workshop in Washington,
D.C., over the Fourth of July weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Applying my creativity without breaking the rules is great and
being able to build a rocket that might really work is a fantastic
dream come true,'' David said in responding to the Space
Adventures' offer.
</P>
<P>
   David acknowledges that he showed bad judgment in bringing the
rocket to school, but his plea didn't sway the district hearing
officer. The hearing officer refused to comment on the case, as did
the vice principal who ordered the locker search at the school.
</P>
<P>
   But people around the country haven't been so reticent, starting
with Hickam, who called and sent an e-mail to David. His advice to
the school board: ``Lighten up.''
</P>
<P>
   He suggested that David join a rocket club and invite the
school's principal and assistant principal to the first launching.
</P>
<P>
   Others in the business chimed in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard about this nonsense concerning this kid and his rocket
and the aftermath,'' said Frank Sietzen, editor in chief of ``Ad
Astra'' magazine in Washington. It's published by the National
Space Society, the world's oldest space education and advocacy
organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not a week goes by when I don't get a message from somebody
telling me that we need more education for kids about the promise
of spaceflight and space technology in their lives. Not only their
life today but their future. How in some communities the economic
boom has busted and school dropout rates in some locales are
soaring.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can we expect to keep our future's promise intact if we
slap down kids like this every time they demonstrate a little bit
of initiative?''
</P>
<P>
   Dave Walker, a former astronaut and mission commander, suggested
that school authorities could be flexible and give David
``penance,'' such as demonstrating his rockets for other students.
</P>
<P>
   ``In any case,'' he said, ``I hope David realizes that
intellectual curiousity leads to knowledge.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the guidelines of the school district, the rocket was
classified as a firearm, a major violation in its zero-tolerance
policy.
</P>
<P>
   School officials have maintained that they had no option but to
suspend David. &QL;

 ARIZONA'S SEN. JOHN McCAIN TALKS OF REAGAN-STYLE PRESIDENTIAL (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF BARKER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. John McCain is planning to announce early next
month that he is launching a full-blown campaign for the White
House that will draw upon former President Reagan's advisers and
Reagan's ``feel good'' brand of politics.
</P>
<P>
   Like Reagan, the Arizona Republican is banking that his personal
appeal, enhanced by his war hero status and a reputation as a
political maverick, can elevate him above the Republican field.
</P>
<P>
   McCain will formalize his candidacy in early April with a
three-day tour that illustrates some of the states he plans to
emphasize. He will make tour stops in New Hampshire, South
Carolina, Arizona, California, Utah and Massachusetts. He plans to
begin the tour with a breakfast with Naval Academy midshipmen in
Annapolis, Md.
</P>
<P>
   He will visit Iowa later in April.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than seeking a niche within the GOP, McCain, 62, is
seeking to pull in backers from all wings of the party, as Reagan
did, based as much on personality as on ideology. His strategy
suggests the third-term senator will not be courting the party's
religious conservatives the way some other Republicans historically
have in the early primaries.
</P>
<P>
   McCain formed an exploratory presidential committee in December,
enabling him to raise funds and set up a campaign office in an old
printing shop in suburban Alexandria, Va. Some supporters have
already printed up some bumper stickers and sent them to McCain.
``McVote for McCain,'' says one.
</P>
<P>
   As he prepares now to formally enter the race, McCain
acknowledged that he and the rest of the field trail Texas Gov.
George W. Bush in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was convinced that he (Bush) would be the odds-on
front-runner, and in many respects he deserves to be,'' McCain said
in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain insists he's not intimidated.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, McCain says his own campaign _ emphasizing, as it will,
the overhaul of campaign finance laws and curbing government
``pork'' projects _ will fare just fine as a reform-minded,
underdog alternative. ``I think, with the appeal that we would
have, we'd be far better off not to campaign in the lead,'' McCain
said.
</P>
<P>
   So who will vote for McCain? Leaning back in a chair in his
Senate office, the white-haired senator ticks off a list of issues
and groups to which he can lay claim: ``National defense, veterans,
reformers, independent-minded (voters).''
</P>
<P>
   It's no coincidence that McCain's core of campaign advisers
during this interim period has included Ken Duberstein, a former
chief of staff in the Reagan White House, and Michael Deaver, a
Reagn adviser and spinmaster.
</P>
<P>
   While Reagan made Americans feel good about themselves in his
1980s speeches, McCain will bill himself as a political reformer
and a Vietnam veteran who twice escaped death, first aboard an
aircraft carrier engulfed in flames, and then in a Hanoi prison
camp.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's campaign, like Reagan's, is designed to appeal directly
to the gut.
</P>
<P>
   It's a message intended to elevate McCain above the realm of
politics and to make his rival candidates seem mundane by
comparison.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think being a war hero has given him the inward strength to
do things that the ordinary politician wouldn't do,'' former
Secretary of State Henry Kissinger said in a McCain profile
televised recently by the A&AMP;E Network as part of its ``Biography''
series.
</P>
<P>
   Kissinger's quote could practically serve as McCain's campaign
slogan.
</P>
<P>
   The program contained footage of McCain scrambling out of a
plane in 1967 after it was hit by a rocket that misfired on the
deck of the USS Forrestal. McCain is also shown lying, critically
wounded, in a Hanoi prison camp after his plane was shot out of the
sky.
</P>
<P>
   It is telling that McCain's campaign mailed thousands of
postcards to friends and potential donors alerting them to the
program, which premiered Feb. 10. His former Naval Academy
classmates, some of whom are now volunteering for his campaign,
held a reception for McCain on the evening of the broadcast. His
presidential committee Web site on the Internet
(www.mccainforpresident.org) invites supporters to contact the
staff to obtain a videotape of the program.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, McCain and aide Mark Salter are collaborating on a
book about the senator, his father and grandfather, who were both
admirals. The book ends with McCain returning home from Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   With the nation tired of White House campaign finance and sex
scandals, McCain believes the time is right for a campaign based
largely on character.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things in my campaign is to restore respect to the
office of the presidency and the institutions of government, which
I think this administration debased in '96 with their campaign
finance violations,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain knows he faces a risk.
</P>
<P>
   Jabs at President Clinton's leadership could be delicate at
times for McCain who, like the president, has been accused of
marital infidelity in his past. McCain has not denied that he
wrecked his first marriage with ``inappropriate'' behavior.
</P>
<P>
   McCain may also be subject to renewed barbs for his rebuke by a
Senate ethics panel for exercising ``poor judgment'' in his
relationship with former Phoenix financier Charles H Keating Jr.,
who became a symbol of reckless investments by the savings and loan
industry during the 1980s. McCain took campaign contributions from
Keating (later returned) and vacationed with him.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said he is counseling fellow Republican candidates to
avoid personal attacks _ not to protect his own image, but because
negative campaigning hurts the party's prospects of regaining the
White House in the 2000 race.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, McCain said he had decided to borrow from Reagan's
legacy in part because Reagan made people feel positive and
welcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have talked at length about some of the difficulties that
the Republican Party is experiencing, and it's not so much got to
do with the message we're sending, but how we send the message,''
McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ronald Reagan had this great ability to sound and act
inclusive. And even though people may disagree on specific issues,
he was an inclusionary president. He'd display kind of a gentleness
about him and project an image of pleasantness rather than having a
hard edge about him,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's one of the areas where I've tried to be more like
Ronald Reagan, sending out an inclusive message rather than an
exclusive message.''
</P>
<P>
   Next up for McCain: raising about $20 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'm going to find 14,000 or 15,000 of my closest
friends. When you combine that with about $5 million in (federal)
matching funds, I think you could do it for $20 million,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While this will be McCain's first run for president, he was
seriously considered in 1996 to be Bob Dole's running mate. Dole
eventually chose Jack Kemp instead.
</P>
<P>
   This time around, McCain said he is convinced he doesn't want to
be anybody's vice president.
</P>
<P>
   It is standard for presidential contenders to disavow interest
in the No. 2 spot for fear of trivializing their White House
ambitions. Still, McCain's dismissal of the vice presidency seems
to go further than most.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went through that kind of routine and got together all of
our background and tax returns and all that stuff, and so I had
time to think about it then (in 1996),'' McCain said. ``I'm
convinced that I would not want to do that. It would mean moving my
family to Washington. Remember, I would be 64 years old by the time
that took place. I would much rather serve in the Senate and be
chairman of the Commerce Committee,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   No matter who wins, McCain said, the nomination is likely to be
wrapped up in less than a year. McCain is already looking ahead to
such early primary states as New Hampshire, Iowa, South Carolina
and California.
</P>
<P>
   ``California, on March 7, is really going to be almost of
transcendent importance, because we've got one-fifth of the
delegates elected from one state on the same day,'' he said. ``For
all intents and purposes, from what I can see now on March 7 in the
year 2000, it's over. The nominee is decided.'' &QL;

CHILD OF ADVERSITY: BOY RESILIENT DESPITE INJURY, HARDSHIP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KARINA BLAND  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ P.J. Constance's right arm ends just below his elbow,
chopped off piece by piece by doctors after he snapped his forearm
falling 20 feet into a stairwell.
</P>
<P>
   Though he lives in a tough neighborhood where gunshots ring out
regularly on weekend nights, it was a seemingly routine childhood
injury _ a broken arm _ that so barbarously interrupted his life.
</P>
<P>
   But this is a little boy who has grown up in adversity and knows
nothing else. So, he takes it well.
</P>
<P>
   He had been homeless, living in a shelter for a year and a half
before moving with his father, two sisters, brother and uncle into
his grandmother's humble but immaculate two-bedroom Phoenix
apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Cater-cornered from that apartment near 16th Street and McDowell
Road is Resurrection Lutheran, the red-brick church where P.J. was
playing Nov. 29 when he fell into an outdoor stairwell. His friends
scattered.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard my arm crack,'' the 8-year-old says.
</P>
<P>
   An elder at the church heard crying and followed the sound to
P.J. A former emergency medical technician, he put a splint on
P.J.'s arm. Pastor Ted Bodjanac called 911.
</P>
<P>
   At Good Samaritan Regional Medical Center, doctors put a cast on
the arm. The radius and ulna had snapped.
</P>
<P>
   Three days later, his family took him back to the hospital. His
entire right hand had turned black, blue and red. He was
transferred to St. Joseph's Hospital and Medical Center, where the
state's unit for children's rehabilitative services is based.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Del Worthington, the orthopedic surgeon who heads pediatric
orthopedics there, knew the boy was in bad shape as soon as he saw
him. P.J. had somehow contracted streptococcus _ a dangerous,
flesh-eating bacteria that can lead to gangrene.
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, Worthington removed the tips of P.J.'s fingers.
Two days after that, he cut off more. And a little more.
</P>
<P>
   In all, P.J. had 13 surgeries. He left the hospital Christmas
Eve.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes,'' P.J. whispers, ``my arm feels like it's still
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Gangrene is relatively common, Worthington says, especially
among diabetics and people whose blood vessels are damaged by
smoking. It is not so usual in children.
</P>
<P>
   There is no telling whether P.J.'s arm _ or more of it _ could
have been saved if he had been brought back to the hospital sooner,
Worthington says. The bacterium is so aggressive that he has known
two people who died of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had waited any longer, it would have killed him,''
Worthington says.
</P>
<P>
   P.J. was just 6 when Karen Ryan met him at a homeless shelter in
Sunnyslope. She is his mentor through a program run by the Mental
Health Association of Arizona. She sees the boy at least once a
week, taking him to doctor's appointments, swimming and to
bookstores.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look in P.J.'s face, you can see he's lived more
lives than a lot of adults,'' Ryan says.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; P.J.'s mother hasn't been around in more than a year. His
parents' separation has been ugly.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been up and down with his folks' problems,'' Ryan says.
``Now, he has this one.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a heavy load for one little boy.
</P>
<P>
   But, already, his Uncle Freddie has taught him to wrestle, and
P.J. can take down his brother, 6-year-old Marc, with one arm.
</P>
<P>
   His father taught his once right-handed son to flick a yo-yo
with his left.
</P>
<P>
   And someone else in the neighborhood taught him to do one-handed
wheelies on his bike.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want him to be strong,'' P.J.'s uncle, Alfredo Hernandez,
22, says.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez was hit by a car when he was almost 3, his right arm
crushed and put back together with metal pins and skin grafts. He
remembers being taunted as a kid and doesn't want that for his
nephew.
</P>
<P>
   This family has been through hard times, including the shooting
of one of P.J.'s uncles, who accidentally walked into a
neighborhood dispute. He was hit in the head but survived.
</P>
<P>
   P.J., too, will survive, says his maternal grandmother, Maria
Hernandez. She adds, ``He has a lot of family, and everyone loves
him.''
</P>
<P>
   At the doctor's office a month ago, P.J. had his pick of
prostheses. On the table were a hand-shaped piece of pink rubber
and a metallic hook.
</P>
<P>
   While Ryan and his father talked with the doctor, P.J. picked up
the metal hook and studied it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will this hold onto the monkey bars?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   It will probably be a few more weeks before his arm is healed
enough to wear the prosthesis. Without it, P.J. already has learned
to write, dress and eat.
</P>
<P>
   ``He used to be better at cooking,'' his sister, Monica, 11,
says. ``He can still make Top Ramen, but he needs help for macaroni
and cheese.''
</P>
<P>
   P.J. missed a month of classes at Squaw Peak Elementary School,
but he is catching up with the help of a tutor. He also gets
counseling and physical therapy there.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, it's OK if the kids at school call me handicapped
because I am,'' P.J. says.
</P>
<P>
   He rarely looks at his stump of an arm. He bathes each night
with it covered by a white cotton stocking. Afterward, his father
cleans and rebandages it.
</P>
<P>
   ``P.J. was real afraid of people not accepting him for what he
was,'' says his father, Paul Constance, 36. ``At the hospital, he
had gone so far to say he didn't want to be alive.''
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't talk like that anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``P.J.'s known from the start that he didn't lose his hand,''
Constance says. ``He kept his life.''
</P>
<P>
   He admits that P.J.'s life _ all of the children's lives, really
_ have been turbulent with frequent moves, financial struggles and
spells away from their parents. But Constance says what happened to
P.J. has made him a better, more devoted father.
</P>
<P>
   It was Constance, Worthington says, who sat endlessly by his
son's bedside, taking a leave from his job at an automotive
air-conditioning business.
</P>
<P>
   These days, P.J. spends his afternoons riding his bike and
flying his kite. On Sundays, he goes to church. He likes pizza and
says that girls have cooties.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what I want to be when I grow up, but I can be
whatever I want,'' he says, climbing onto the hood of a parked car
and settling next to his father.
</P>
<P>
   The boy could need more surgery as he grows, though nothing
compared to what he has already been through.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought you wanted to be an FBI agent,'' Constance says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, yeah,'' P.J. says, grabbing his little brother in a
headlock. ``An FBI agent.'' &QL;

ARRESTS DROP AND SHOOTINGS RISE AS THE POLICE, GIULIANI SAYS, ARE
DISTRACTED 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With police statistics showing the rate of violent
crime creeping up again in New York City, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani
suggested Sunday that the trend might be the result of a less
active police force distracted by the uproar over the killing of
Amadou Diallo seven weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to reporters on the first day that officers in the
department's embattled Street Crime Unit reported for duty in
uniform _ one of several changes imposed on the unit by
Commissioner Howard Safir in the wake of the shooting _ Giuliani
said: ``The street crime arrests are down 62 percent since the
concentration on the Diallo case. And here's what we have to be
concerned about: in the places that street crime arrests are down,
shootings and murders are up.
</P>
<P>
   ``While everyone else in the media is concentrating just on one
shooting in New York City for the last two months,'' the mayor
said, ``I have to concentrate on 130 other people who died and were
killed and try to find a way to reduce that. So I have asked the
police commissioner and the Police Department not to be distracted,
to keep its focus on how we save lives in New York City and how
people are actually murdered and killed in the vast majority of
times in the city are by other citizens of the city.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor was citing statistics released by Safir on Friday
showing that from Feb. 4 to March 24, officers from the Street
Crime Unit made 291 arrests, down from 705 arrests during the same
period in 1998 and 775 in 1997. The number of stop-and-frisk
reports filled out by officers from the unit has also fallen
precipitously. The unit stopped and frisked 18,023 people in 1997
and 27,061 last year, the police said. Through March 14, though,
the unit has stopped and frisked 3,502 people, putting it on pace
to end the year with many fewer.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The number of shooting incidents and shooting victims,
meanwhile, is creeping up in neighborhoods usually policed by the
Street Crime Unit, statistics show. There have been increases in
the 47th Precinct in the Eastchester section of the Bronx, the 46th
precinct in upper Manhattan, the 113th Precinct in Jamaica, Queens,
and the 110th Precinct in Elmhurst, Queens, among other areas.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent statistics show that through March 21, there
were 136 homicides in the city, up 8 percent from the same period
last year.
</P>
<P>
   Drawing meaningful conclusions from these statistics is
difficult, given the brief span of time involved, said Dr. Andrew
Karmen, a criminologist and sociologist at the John Jay College of
Criminal Justice.
</P>
<P>
   He pointed out that on March 7, when homicides were reported to
be up by 5 percent during the first nine weeks of this year
compared with the same period last year, the police said that the
biggest jump was in homicides stemming from domestic disputes. At
that time, Safir said there was no way to know whether the citywide
increase was statistically significant.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to really know what these shootings are about,''
Karmen said. ``If they're domestic shootings, that's something the
street crime unit can't do much about.''
</P>
<P>
   Karmen said that it appeared that the police might be trying to
lay the groundwork for an explanation for a broader increase in
crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe they're seeing that crime is bottoming out,'' he said,
``and they're preparing for criticism by developing this
fingerpointing argument, that you the critics have ruined
everything and caused crime to go back up.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Safir attributed the increase in shootings to a drop
in morale amid relentless media scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can only speculate to the fact that the individuals in
Street Crime are concerned about taking enforcement action for
being criticized,'' Safir said.
</P>
<P>
   Black and Hispanic officers dismissed that contention.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been telling the commissioner for years that street
crimes has been just searching people at will, all in minority
neighborhoods,'' said Detective Terrance Wansley, of 100 Blacks in
Law Enforcement. ``The reason the arrests are going down is that
all of a sudden, they have to play by the same rules as everyone
else. The Constitution.''

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ This time there wasn't an opening-lap
fender-fest, or a mind-numbing rain delay, or three dozen drivers
complaining about the state of the speedway's asphalt.
</P>
<P>
   This time, there was simply a race, a race with a Texas-sized
ending. This time, the Terry Labontes, the Dale Jarretts and the
Ward Burtons of the world finally showed us what this fuss called
NASCAR was all about.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt there have been better Winston Cup races. But none
heretofore in this neighborhood come to mind.
</P>
<P>
   The stretch duel between Labonte and Jarrett, on the heels of
Jeff Gordon crashing, of Burton pitting two laps early and of
whatever other histrionics the day could muster, made for an
afternoon at Texas Motor Speedway unlike any other.
</P>
<P>
   And when it was over, the winner, Labonte, did a most amazing
thing. He praised the day, instead of calling for the bulldozers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a great day for us,'' said the Corpus Christi native,
after his 21st career Winston Cup victory. ``To me, this is the
biggest race I've ever won. To be able to come down here to Texas
and win _ I was just thankful. I was just happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, they complained about Turn 2. Too tight. And they bemoaned
the lack of a second groove to race in.
</P>
<P>
   Few drivers ever traveled two abreast. And passing opponents is
still somewhat of an Indiana Jones adventure.
</P>
<P>
   But it didn't spoil the show. Rather, let me suggest, the
track's contrariness enhanced it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The changes they've made here were a big improvement,''
Labonte said. ``You saw people race real good today, compared to
what we saw the first two years.''
</P>
<P>
   The layout of the TMS track, pre-$3-million facelift, had
invited caution. But yesterday the field raced at 180 mph through
an incident-free first 30 laps and the NASCAR equivalent of a TV
timeout had to be called _ a mandatory caution flag.
</P>
<P>
   The next 200 miles produced mostly a long, single-file conga
line, but so be it. Lapped cars add obstacles. Pit stops under a
green flag add drama.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon's misfortune hinted at the early indecision that was
taking place in the pits. The sport's biggest name had a right
front tire cut down and veered into the Turn 4 wall with a
molar-jarring thud. The intermittent tire problems prompted
Goodyear people to remind pit crews of the tires' recommended air
pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, in other words, this baby is growing up. Two years ago,
one of its larger ``problems'' was that the delivery men picked up
the grand piano but not the world-class pianist.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, with Gordon suddenly whisked from the spectacle, we
were reminded that the show goes on.
</P>
<P>
   There was Burton, whose No. 22 Caterpillar Pontiac looked like a
winner for 56 of the day's laps. His crew made the costly decision
to pit on Lap 214 under a green flag _ the yellow flag brought
things to a crawl just three laps later. Burton never could make up
the missing lap.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were as good as anybody out there,'' he said later. ``Were
we good enough to win the race? Shoot, yeah. We were racing winning
material.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are going to pick up the paper in the morning and think
we had a bad day. But we know that, except for one break, we had a
heck of a run. Give us one more shot. I think we'd win this
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The show went on. There was Martin, who had laid down his own
personal driving groove into the TMS winner's circle. A tire
problem sent him, too, into the wall.
</P>
<P>
   And suddenly, it was Jarrett and the two Texas Labontes, Terry
and Bobby. Among them, there were a combined 45 Winston Cup
first-place trophies and 23 top-10 series finishes.
</P>
<P>
   In the No. 18 Interstate Batteries Pontiac pit, a mini-drama
played itself out. Bobby Labonte, who broke his right shoulder in
practice at Darlington (S.C.) Raceway a little more than a week
ago, didn't know how long he was going to be able to drive.
Designated driver Matt Kenseth was ready to take over at any time.
</P>
<P>
   But the younger Labonte never relinquished the wheel. ``I've got
this big ol' coconut shell \Ra cast\S on my back, and it's pretty
sore right now,'' Bobby Labonte said. ``It just didn't lay right
with me for the most part of the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was more or less giving out at the end. My neck was hurting
because we had changed some stuff in the seat, and it wasn't
normal. I've never been this uncomfortable before.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the threesome rolled on to the end, weaving and darting
past lapped cars, ignoring the gray clouds, not worried about the
track or who sang the Anthem, but focused only on the checkered
flag.
</P>
<P>
   It made for an engaging finish. It reminded us, in this third
try, that a NASCAR Winston Cup race is more than a week-long
gripe-fest and a four-hour traffic jam.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, there have been better stock car races. But not here.
</P>
<P>
   The change was more than refreshing.

</P>
<P>
   Gordon's misfortune hinted at the early indecision that was
taking place in the pits. The sport's biggest name had a right
front tire cut down and veered into the Turn 4 wall with a
molar-jarring thud. The intermittent tire problems prompted
Goodyear people to remind pit crews of the tires' recommended air
pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, in other words, this baby is growing up. Two years ago,
one of its larger ``problems'' was that the delivery men picked up
the grand piano but not the world-class pianist.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, with Gordon suddenly whisked from the spectacle, we
were reminded that the show goes on.
</P>
<P>
   There was Burton, whose No. 22 Caterpillar Pontiac looked like a
winner for 56 of the day's laps. His crew made the costly decision
to pit on Lap 214 under a green flag _ the yellow flag brought
things to a crawl just three laps later. Burton never could make up
the missing lap.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were as good as anybody out there,'' he said later. ``Were
we good enough to win the race? Shoot, yeah. We were racing winning
material.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are going to pick up the paper in the morning and think
we had a bad day. But we know that, except for one break, we had a
heck of a run. Give us one more shot. I think we'd win this
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The show went on. There was Martin, who had laid down his own
personal driving groove into the TMS winner's circle. A tire
problem sent him, too, into the wall.
</P>
<P>
   And suddenly, it was Jarrett and the two Texas Labontes, Terry
and Bobby. Among them, there were a combined 45 Winston Cup
first-place trophies and 23 top-10 series finishes.
</P>
<P>
   In the No. 18 Interstate Batteries Pontiac pit, a mini-drama
played itself out. Bobby Labonte, who broke his right shoulder in
practice at Darlington (S.C.) Raceway a little more than a week
ago, didn't know how long he was going to be able to drive.
Designated driver Matt Kenseth was ready to take over at any time.
</P>
<P>
   But the younger Labonte never relinquished the wheel. ``I've got
this big ol' coconut shell \Ra cast\S on my back, and it's pretty
sore right now,'' Bobby Labonte said. ``It just didn't lay right
with me for the most part of the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was more or less giving out at the end. My neck was hurting
because we had changed some stuff in the seat, and it wasn't
normal. I've never been this uncomfortable before.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the threesome rolled on to the end, weaving and darting
past lapped cars, ignoring the gray clouds, not worried about the
track or who sang the Anthem, but focused only on the checkered
flag.
</P>
<P>
   It made for an engaging finish. It reminded us, in this third
try, that a NASCAR Winston Cup race is more than a week-long
gripe-fest and a four-hour traffic jam.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, there have been better stock car races. But not here.
</P>
<P>
   The change was more than refreshing.

<TEXT>
<P>
   PONTE VEDRA BEACH, Fla. _ After nearly a year of chasing Tiger
Woods for the honor of being the top-ranked golfer on the planet,
David Duval finally ascends to No. 1 in the world, then has to
fight to claim No. 1 in his family.
</P>
<P>
   Duval on Sunday won the tournament he grew up watching as a kid.
And even though he didn't win The Players Championship as much as
he survived it better than anybody else, Duval's greatness rubbed
off on his father, who was winning the Emerald Coast Classic on the
other end of the state.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Duval's victory near Pensacola, Fla., meant the Duvals
became the first father-son combination to win PGA Tour events on
the same weekend. All that's left now is for David's mom to go out
and win on the LPGA circuit.
</P>
<P>
   It was a banner day for the younger Duval, whose perseverance
was crucial in shooting a 1-over-par 73 that gave him a 3-under 285
total for the tournament, two shots ahead of runner-up Scott Gump.
He secured the victory with a pinpoint wedge shot to the island
green on the par-3 17th. His eight-foot birdie putt gave him a
two-stroke margin for error on the treacherous 18th, which he
parred.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a wonderful week,'' Duval said. ``I'm very proud of
myself for the way I played. I'm kind of anxious to watch the tape
of this tournament. It must have looked brutal out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Tournament Players Course at Sawgrass was a beast.
But after he was done, Duval knew he not only had beaten one of the
strongest fields ever assembled but also a course that was
heartless during a weekend when only one round below 70 was posted.
</P>
<P>
   His win, coupled with Woods finishing in a tie for 10th, meant
Duval will be elevated today to the top of the official World Golf
Rankings. Woods' reign of 41 consecutive weeks on top is over.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Duval also won his third tournament of the year.
It's the third consecutive year he has won at least three, a feat
that hadn't been done since Tom Watson won three or more each year
from 1977-82.
</P>
<P>
   As has been his custom, Duval deflected talk about being the
best player in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to be No. 1, but it's not a concern of mine,'' he
said. ``I'm the best this week. Maybe not next week. But this week,
yep.''
</P>
<P>
   That Duval was able to ascend to No. 1, pair with his father to
win on the same weekend and get his 10th career victory at The
Players was all the more sweet. Duval, 27, estimated he has been
coming to the tournament for at least 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was born and raised in Jacksonville, and we moved out to the
beach when I was a junior in high school,'' Duval said. ``My dad
used to work in the scorer's tent on Saturdays. I always had a hat
for him, and all the players would sign it when they got done.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I don't know if I ever thought I was going to win here.
Obviously, I dreamed about it and thought about it. But I don't
know if I ever really thought it would happen.''
</P>
<P>
   It happened, he said, because of a combination of things. Duval
took three weeks off before the tournament and also practiced a lot
the week before the event. He knew he was playing well and putting
well. And when the course was set up so difficult, with hard, fast
greens and dicey rough, he knew he would be comfortable in the
surroundings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew that there would be some bogeys,'' he said. ``And I
knew I would make a few birdies. I didn't make a double bogey all
week, which is a pretty good stat.''
</P>
<P>
   Only 11 players in the field avoided making at least one double
bogey or worse during the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   The key to victory for Duval, who started the day with a
one-shot lead over Skip Kendall and Phil Mickelson, came when he
hit a bunker shot into the cup on No. 9 for birdie. Earlier, it
looked like he might be headed for a much higher score.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was swinging OK, but I was probably being a little tentative
up to then,'' he said. ``I had 100 yards to the front of the green,
and the ball was in the first cut of rough. I had to kind of go
under one tree and over another one. The gap was right there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to my caddie and told him there were two plays. We
could either go sideways and punch out or try to hit the gap and go
for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just decided it was time to play golf. If I didn't make that
shot, I could have made double or triple bogey easily.''
</P>
<P>
   Duval hit the gap and put the ball in the pot bunker just to the
right of the green. His blast rolled into the cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a lot of players who live here can attest, I put in a lot
of time in the bunkers here, and it paid off,'' he said. ``I hit a
great little shot. That really kind of settled me down.''
</P>
<P>
   It also got him to 3 under par, which put him back in the lead,
a position he would not surrender the rest of the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just hung in there,'' Duval said. ``I knew that if I could
make 18 pars, I'd win for sure, unless they soaked the greens
(which they didn't). I knew everybody was going to make some
bogeys. It's impossible to avoid them in these conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   The only player who made a serious charge on the back nine was
Gump, who actually made a move by merely staying at 1 under par
over the last eight holes, overcoming a double bogey at the 17th.
</P>
<P>
   Duval birdied the 12th but bogeyed the 14th and 15th,
coincidentally, after finding out in the 14th fairway that his
father had just won his tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Duval's second bogey cut his lead to one shot over Gump. But he
clinched the tournament with his gutsy shot at the 17th.

EX-OFFICIAL AT U.S. EMBASSY IN CHINA VIO LATED RULES IN ACCEPTING
FA VORS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY KAMMER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHONEIX _ A former official at the U.S. Embassy in Beijing
repeatedly violated State Department rules by accepting favors from
a large corporation owned by the Chinese government, ``The Arizona
Republic'' has learned.
</P>
<P>
   When Charles M. Parish Jr. accepted free lodging at corporate
apartments in Las Vegas and Norwalk, Calif., in 1995 and 1996, he
was in charge of the visa section at the embassy.
</P>
<P>
   In that position he provided visa assistance to Elizabeth Mann,
a Chinese-born Phoenix woman who is an executive with a corporation
directed by the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Trade.
</P>
<P>
   That corporation, COFCO, owns the new Chinese Cultural Center on
44th Street.
</P>
<P>
   While COFCO has not been tied to allegations that Chinese
government money was used to influence the 1996 U.S. elections, the
Parish story illustrates the same underlying issue _ the potential
vulnerability of government officials to foreign interests.
</P>
<P>
   Parish's free stays at the Chinese-owned properties in 1995 and
1996 were forbidden by the State Department's Standards of Conduct.
</P>
<P>
   Those standards prohibit taking ``gifts, favors, entertainment
or loans'' from ``anyone who is seeking official action'' from the
State Department.
</P>
<P>
   Parish, 52, acknowledges that he stayed free of charge at the
COFCO properties. But he said the visits did not affect his
decisions on visas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did I ever abuse my position? No,'' he said in a telephone
interview from his parents' home in Las Vegas. ``I'm very emphatic
about that. I'm very clear about that.''
</P>
<P>
   But Parish, who retired from the State Department last year,
expressed regret about his use of the apartments. He acknowledged
that it raised a question of a conflict of interest between his
duties as a government official and his relationship with a
corporate executive.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clear to me now that this is regrettable, that it creates
the appearance of at least a conflict of interest,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It's unclear what action the State Department might take against
Parish. The department's investigative arm, the Office of the
Inspector General, said he could face criminal prosecution if his
relationship with COFCO involved a quid pro quo. Parish insists
there was none.
</P>
<P>
   Parish's title at the embassy was first secretary and consul. He
said that in his position as chief of the visa section, he was the
``ultimate arbiter'' of applications for visas, which are highly
coveted in China and often difficult to obtain.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Asked if he had known he was violating State Department rules
by staying at the COFCO properties, he said, ``I really can't
recall my state of mind at the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Parish said Mann was ``a very warm, gracious, hospitable
person,'' whom he met through business at the embassy.
</P>
<P>
   He said he didn't think Mann had offered him the apartment to
influence his decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not looking looking for anything sinister behind that, and
to this day, I'm convinced, we're friends,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mann is the president of BNU, a Phoenix subsidiary of COFCO.
</P>
<P>
   COFCO is the China National Cereals, Oils and Foodstuffs Import
&AMP; Export Corp. ``Fortune'' magazine last year placed the
corporation, which is directed by the Chinese Ministry of Foreign
Trade, 309th on its list of the world's 500 largest companies. It
ranked ahead of such American giants as Time Warner and Alcoa.
</P>
<P>
   BNU manages the center and Chinese-owned real estate in Phoenix,
Las Vegas and Los Angeles. It also provides auto loans and owns
three shoe factories in China.
</P>
<P>
   The Norwalk property where Parish stayed was the Palm Country
Club, a six-building apartment complex comprising 249 units that
rent for $885 to $1,085 per month. Until last month it was owned by
a partnership consisting of COFCO and the Chinese People's
Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   The PLA, which has branched out into a wide range of business
ventures in China and the United States, bought into the property
in 1992 through a U.S. subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
   State Department spokeswoman Maria Rudenski said she could not
comment on Parish's use of the COFCO apartments. She would only
confirm that he was a visa officer at the embassy.
</P>
<P>
   Caroline Custer, former manager of the Palm Country Club, &UR; said
Parish stayed at the two-bedroom corporate apartment that was
normally reserved for COFCO employees. She estimated that he stayed
there between four and six times.
</P>
<P>
   Custer said she received instructions about Parish's visits from
Mann.
</P>
<P>
   ``Elizabeth would call me and let me know that he was coming in
and to be sure that the corporate apartment was available and
cleaned and ready for him,'' Custer said.
</P>
<P>
   Custer said Parish usually stayed at the apartment in the
company of young Chinese women. Parish said the women were
``friends or acquaintances.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He would come and stay two, three, four days at a pop, and we
would have a fruit basket or something delivered there for him,''
Custer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember times when he would be in the corporate suite and
our own employees would have to stay in a hotel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did think it was kind of strange that we would be paying for
a hotel for (COFCO) employees and he'd be staying in a corporate
apartment. That surprised me. So I realized it must have been
something important.''
</P>
<P>
   Custer said Mann ``always wanted to make sure that he was
treated well.''
</P>
<P>
   Mann did not return calls about Parish's stays at the Norwalk
property. But she had earlier acknowledged that Parish had stayed
at another COFCO apartment complex, Gloria Park Villas in Las
Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `It's a beautiful place,' and we said, `If you'd like
to stay, you can stay for a night,' '' Mann said. ``He didn't have
to. His parents live in Las Vegas.''
</P>
<P>
   Mann acknowledged that Parish, as head of the visa section at
the embassy, provided assistance to COFCO.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we have a problem, we consult him on certain issues: how we
apply,'' she said. ``But we never ask him to issue visas blankly.
We never have to. Why should we?''
</P>
<P>
   Parish attended Arizona State University from 1968 to 1974. He
later earned a degree from Chapman College in Orange, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Mann is a native of China whose given name is Ning Yu. She took
her American name around 1992, when she and her husband, Frederic,
became U.S. citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Mann said Parish had visited COFCO's Phoenix offices several
times during his tenure at the State Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just wanted him to visit our company, that's it,'' she
said. ``Like many other people visit our company, he's just one of
those people. We want to promote Phoenix.'' &QL;

CHILD OF ADVERSITY: BOY RESILIENT DESPITE INJURY, HARDSHIP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KARINA BLAND  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ P.J. Constance's right arm ends just below his elbow,
chopped off piece by piece by doctors after he snapped his forearm
falling 20 feet into a stairwell.
</P>
<P>
   Though he lives in a tough neighborhood where gunshots ring out
regularly on weekend nights, it was a seemingly routine childhood
injury _ a broken arm _ that so barbarously interrupted his life.
</P>
<P>
   But this is a little boy who has grown up in adversity and knows
nothing else. So, he takes it well.
</P>
<P>
   He had been homeless, living in a shelter for a year and a half
before moving with his father, two sisters, brother and uncle into
his grandmother's humble but immaculate two-bedroom Phoenix
apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Cater-cornered from that apartment near 16th Street and McDowell
Road is Resurrection Lutheran, the red-brick church where P.J. was
playing Nov. 29 when he fell into an outdoor stairwell. His friends
scattered.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard my arm crack,'' the 8-year-old says.
</P>
<P>
   An elder at the church heard crying and followed the sound to
P.J. A former emergency medical technician, he put a splint on
P.J.'s arm. Pastor Ted Bodjanac called 911.
</P>
<P>
   At Good Samaritan Regional Medical Center, doctors put a cast on
the arm. The radius and ulna had snapped.
</P>
<P>
   Three days later, his family took him back to the hospital. His
entire right hand had turned black, blue and red. He was
transferred to St. Joseph's Hospital and Medical Center, where the
state's unit for children's rehabilitative services is based.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Del Worthington, the orthopedic surgeon who heads pediatric
orthopedics there, knew the boy was in bad shape as soon as he saw
him. P.J. had somehow contracted streptococcus _ a dangerous,
flesh-eating bacteria that can lead to gangrene.
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, Worthington removed the tips of P.J.'s fingers.
Two days after that, he cut off more. And a little more.
</P>
<P>
   In all, P.J. had 13 surgeries. He left the hospital Christmas
Eve.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes,'' P.J. whispers, ``my arm feels like it's still
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Gangrene is relatively common, Worthington says, especially
among diabetics and people whose blood vessels are damaged by
smoking. It is not so usual in children.
</P>
<P>
   There is no telling whether P.J.'s arm _ or more of it _ could
have been saved if he had been brought back to the hospital sooner,
Worthington says. The bacterium is so aggressive that he has known
two people who died of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had waited any longer, it would have killed him,''
Worthington says.
</P>
<P>
   P.J. was just 6 when Karen Ryan met him at a homeless shelter in
Sunnyslope. She is his mentor through a program run by the Mental
Health Association of Arizona. She sees the boy at least once a
week, taking him to doctor's appointments, swimming and to
bookstores.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look in P.J.'s face, you can see he's lived more
lives than a lot of adults,'' Ryan says.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; P.J.'s mother hasn't been around in more than a year. His
parents' separation has been ugly.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been up and down with his folks' problems,'' Ryan says.
``Now, he has this one.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a heavy load for one little boy.
</P>
<P>
   But, already, his Uncle Freddie has taught him to wrestle, and
P.J. can take down his brother, 6-year-old Marc, with one arm.
</P>
<P>
   His father taught his once right-handed son to flick a yo-yo
with his left.
</P>
<P>
   And someone else in the neighborhood taught him to do one-handed
wheelies on his bike.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want him to be strong,'' P.J.'s uncle, Alfredo Hernandez,
22, says.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez was hit by a car when he was almost 3, his right arm
crushed and put back together with metal pins and skin grafts. He
remembers being taunted as a kid and doesn't want that for his
nephew.
</P>
<P>
   This family has been through hard times, including the shooting
of one of P.J.'s uncles, who accidentally walked into a
neighborhood dispute. He was hit in the head but survived.
</P>
<P>
   P.J., too, will survive, says his maternal grandmother, Maria
Hernandez. She adds, ``He has a lot of family, and everyone loves
him.''
</P>
<P>
   At the doctor's office a month ago, P.J. had his pick of
prostheses. On the table were a hand-shaped piece of pink rubber
and a metallic hook.
</P>
<P>
   While Ryan and his father talked with the doctor, P.J. picked up
the metal hook and studied it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will this hold onto the monkey bars?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   It will probably be a few more weeks before his arm is healed
enough to wear the prosthesis. Without it, P.J. already has learned
to write, dress and eat.
</P>
<P>
   ``He used to be better at cooking,'' his sister, Monica, 11,
says. ``He can still make Top Ramen, but he needs help for macaroni
and cheese.''
</P>
<P>
   P.J. missed a month of classes at Squaw Peak Elementary School,
but he is catching up with the help of a tutor. He also gets
counseling and physical therapy there.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, it's OK if the kids at school call me handicapped
because I am,'' P.J. says.
</P>
<P>
   He rarely looks at his stump of an arm. He bathes each night
with it covered by a white cotton stocking. Afterward, his father
cleans and rebandages it.
</P>
<P>
   ``P.J. was real afraid of people not accepting him for what he
was,'' says his father, Paul Constance, 36. ``At the hospital, he
had gone so far to say he didn't want to be alive.''
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't talk like that anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``P.J.'s known from the start that he didn't lose his hand,''
Constance says. ``He kept his life.''
</P>
<P>
   He admits that P.J.'s life _ all of the children's lives, really
_ have been turbulent with frequent moves, financial struggles and
spells away from their parents. But Constance says what happened to
P.J. has made him a better, more devoted father.
</P>
<P>
   It was Constance, Worthington says, who sat endlessly by his
son's bedside, taking a leave from his job at an automotive
air-conditioning business.
</P>

 ARIZONA'S SEN. JOHN McCAIN TALKS OF REAGAN-STYLE PRESIDENTIAL (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF BARKER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. John McCain is planning to announce early next
month that he is launching a full-blown campaign for the White
House that will draw upon former President Reagan's advisers and
Reagan's ``feel good'' brand of politics.
</P>
<P>
   Like Reagan, the Arizona Republican is banking that his personal
appeal, enhanced by his war hero status and a reputation as a
political maverick, can elevate him above the Republican field.
</P>
<P>
   McCain will formalize his candidacy in early April with a
three-day tour that illustrates some of the states he plans to
emphasize. He will make tour stops in New Hampshire, South
Carolina, Arizona, California, Utah and Massachusetts. He plans to
begin the tour with a breakfast with Naval Academy midshipmen in
Annapolis, Md.
</P>
<P>
   He will visit Iowa later in April.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than seeking a niche within the GOP, McCain, 62, is
seeking to pull in backers from all wings of the party, as Reagan
did, based as much on personality as on ideology. His strategy
suggests the third-term senator will not be courting the party's
religious conservatives the way some other Republicans historically
have in the early primaries.
</P>
<P>
   McCain formed an exploratory presidential committee in December,
enabling him to raise funds and set up a campaign office in an old
printing shop in suburban Alexandria, Va. Some supporters have
already printed up some bumper stickers and sent them to McCain.
``McVote for McCain,'' says one.
</P>
<P>
   As he prepares now to formally enter the race, McCain
acknowledged that he and the rest of the field trail Texas Gov.
George W. Bush in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was convinced that he (Bush) would be the odds-on
front-runner, and in many respects he deserves to be,'' McCain said
in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain insists he's not intimidated.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, McCain says his own campaign _ emphasizing, as it will,
the overhaul of campaign finance laws and curbing government
``pork'' projects _ will fare just fine as a reform-minded,
underdog alternative. ``I think, with the appeal that we would
have, we'd be far better off not to campaign in the lead,'' McCain
said.
</P>
<P>
   So who will vote for McCain? Leaning back in a chair in his
Senate office, the white-haired senator ticks off a list of issues
and groups to which he can lay claim: ``National defense, veterans,
reformers, independent-minded (voters).''
</P>
<P>
   It's no coincidence that McCain's core of campaign advisers
during this interim period has included Ken Duberstein, a former
chief of staff in the Reagan White House, and Michael Deaver, a
Reagan adviser and spinmaster.
</P>
<P>
   While Reagan made Americans feel good about themselves in his
1980s speeches, McCain will bill himself as a political reformer
and a Vietnam veteran who twice escaped death, first aboard an
aircraft carrier engulfed in flames, and then in a Hanoi prison
camp.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's campaign, like Reagan's, is designed to appeal directly
to the gut.
</P>
<P>
   It's a message intended to elevate McCain above the realm of
politics and to make his rival candidates seem mundane by
comparison.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think being a war hero has given him the inward strength to
do things that the ordinary politician wouldn't do,'' former
Secretary of State Henry Kissinger said in a McCain profile
televised recently by the A&AMP;E Network as part of its ``Biography''
series.
</P>
<P>
   Kissinger's quote could practically serve as McCain's campaign
slogan.
</P>
<P>
   The program contained footage of McCain scrambling out of a
plane in 1967 after it was hit by a rocket that misfired on the
deck of the USS Forrestal. McCain is also shown lying, critically
wounded, in a Hanoi prison camp after his plane was shot out of the
sky.
</P>
<P>
   It is telling that McCain's campaign mailed thousands of
postcards to friends and potential donors alerting them to the
program, which premiered Feb. 10. His former Naval Academy
classmates, some of whom are now volunteering for his campaign,
held a reception for McCain on the evening of the broadcast. His
presidential committee Web site on the Internet
(www.mccainforpresident.org) invites supporters to contact the
staff to obtain a videotape of the program.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, McCain and aide Mark Salter are collaborating on a
book about the senator, his father and grandfather, who were both
admirals. The book ends with McCain returning home from Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   With the nation tired of White House campaign finance and sex
scandals, McCain believes the time is right for a campaign based
largely on character.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things in my campaign is to restore respect to the
office of the presidency and the institutions of government, which
I think this administration debased in '96 with their campaign
finance violations,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain knows he faces a risk.
</P>
<P>
   Jabs at President Clinton's leadership could be delicate at
times for McCain who, like the president, has been accused of
marital infidelity in his past. McCain has not denied that he
wrecked his first marriage with ``inappropriate'' behavior.
</P>
<P>
   McCain may also be subject to renewed barbs for his rebuke by a
Senate ethics panel for exercising ``poor judgment'' in his
relationship with former Phoenix financier Charles H Keating Jr.,
who became a symbol of reckless investments by the savings and loan
industry during the 1980s. McCain took campaign contributions from
Keating (later returned) and vacationed with him.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said he is counseling fellow Republican candidates to
avoid personal attacks _ not to protect his own image, but because
negative campaigning hurts the party's prospects of regaining the
White House in the 2000 race.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, McCain said he had decided to borrow from Reagan's
legacy in part because Reagan made people feel positive and
welcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have talked at length about some of the difficulties that
the Republican Party is experiencing, and it's not so much got to
do with the message we're sending, but how we send the message,''
McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ronald Reagan had this great ability to sound and act
inclusive. And even though people may disagree on specific issues,
he was an inclusionary president. He'd display kind of a gentleness
about him and project an image of pleasantness rather than having a
hard edge about him,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's one of the areas where I've tried to be more like
Ronald Reagan, sending out an inclusive message rather than an
exclusive message.''
</P>
<P>
   Next up for McCain: raising about $20 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'm going to find 14,000 or 15,000 of my closest
friends. When you combine that with about $5 million in (federal)
matching funds, I think you could do it for $20 million,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While this will be McCain's first run for president, he was
seriously considered in 1996 to be Bob Dole's running mate. Dole
eventually chose Jack Kemp instead.
</P>
<P>
   This time around, McCain said he is convinced he doesn't want to
be anybody's vice president.
</P>
<P>
   It is standard for presidential contenders to disavow interest
in the No. 2 spot for fear of trivializing their White House
ambitions. Still, McCain's dismissal of the vice presidency seems
to go further than most.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went through that kind of routine and got together all of
our background and tax returns and all that stuff, and so I had
time to think about it then (in 1996),'' McCain said. ``I'm
convinced that I would not want to do that. It would mean moving my
family to Washington. Remember, I would be 64 years old by the time
that took place. I would much rather serve in the Senate and be
chairman of the Commerce Committee,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   No matter who wins, McCain said, the nomination is likely to be
wrapped up in less than a year. McCain is already looking ahead to
such early primary states as New Hampshire, Iowa, South Carolina
and California.
</P>
<P>
   ``California, on March 7, is really going to be almost of
transcendent importance, because we've got one-fifth of the
delegates elected from one state on the same day,'' he said. ``For
all intents and purposes, from what I can see now on March 7 in the
year 2000, it's over. The nominee is decided.'' &QL;

ROCKET BOY WINS FAVOR OF SPACE ENTHUSIASTS, WHO SLAM SCHOOL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM GINTONIO  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ The ``Rocket Boy'' of the Phoenix's Deer Valley School
District is quickly becoming a cult figure among space wonks around
the country.
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen-year-old David Silverstein, a seventh-grader who was
suspended for the rest of the school year for bringing a homemade
rocket to Desert Sky Middle School, has caught the attention of
scientists, a Ph.D. from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and just
plain folks who were surprised that school officials would take
such drastic measures.
</P>
<P>
   David's parents, who will home-school their son, are in the
process of appealing the suspension. The matter likely will come up
during an April 13 school board meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The groundswell of support for David began with NASA engineer
Homer Hickam. Hickam's high school interest in rocketry is
portrayed in the movie ``October'' ``Sky,'' which inspired David to
build his rocket.
</P>
<P>
   The youngster last &UR; week accepted an invitation from Space
Adventures to attend an Astronaut Rocketry Workshop in Washington,
D.C., over the Fourth of July weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Applying my creativity without breaking the rules is great and
being able to build a rocket that might really work is a fantastic
dream come true,'' David said in responding to the Space
Adventures' offer.
</P>
<P>
   David acknowledges that he showed bad judgment in bringing the
rocket to school, but his plea didn't sway the district hearing
officer. The hearing officer refused to comment on the case, as did
the vice principal who ordered the locker search at the school.
</P>
<P>
   But people around the country haven't been so reticent, starting
with Hickam, who called and sent an e-mail to David. His advice to
the school board: ``Lighten up.''
</P>
<P>
   He suggested that David join a rocket club and invite the
school's principal and assistant principal to the first launching.
</P>
<P>
   Others in the business chimed in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard about this nonsense concerning this kid and his rocket
and the aftermath,'' said Frank Sietzen, editor in chief of ``Ad
Astra'' magazine in Washington. It's published by the National
Space Society, the world's oldest space education and advocacy
organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not a week goes by when I don't get a message from somebody
telling me that we need more education for kids about the promise
of spaceflight and space technology in their lives. Not only their
life today but their future. How in some communities the economic
boom has busted and school dropout rates in some locales are
soaring.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can we expect to keep our future's promise intact if we
slap down kids like this every time they demonstrate a little bit
of initiative?''
</P>
<P>
   Dave Walker, a former astronaut and mission commander, suggested
that school authorities could be flexible and give David
``penance,'' such as demonstrating his rockets for other students.
</P>
<P>
   ``In any case,'' he said, ``I hope David realizes that
intellectual curiousity leads to knowledge.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the guidelines of the school district, the rocket was
classified as a firearm, a major violation in its zero-tolerance
policy.
</P>
<P>
   School officials have maintained that they had no option but to
suspend David. &QL;

BOOKS MAY CHANGE HANDS, BUT STORE'S BEEN AVENUE FOR 25 YEARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA YOST  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. _ Changing Hands Bookstore has lasted longer than
most marriages and some countries.
</P>
<P>
   It has witnessed book trends from home improvement to
self-improvement, from Eastern philosophy to neurolinguistic
programming.
</P>
<P>
   It has survived the onslaught of big chains and urban renewal.
</P>
<P>
   With a philosophy of customer service and community involvement,
Changing Hands endures in a world beset by retail metamorphosis. On
Thursday, the Tempe landmark will celebrate its 25th anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   That news may make some faithful customers feel a little ancient
themselves. Has it really been a quarter of a century since a
cubbyhole on Fifth Street opened its door to bibliophiles seeking a
reading refuge?
</P>
<P>
   Believe it.
</P>
<P>
   Not only has the store survived, it has become something of a
minichain itself. Last year, a second store opened at 6428 S.
McClintock Drive in Tempe as a sister to the 414 Mill Ave. store,
which replaced the original location in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   No one is more surprised with the store's longevity than its
owners.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think it was going to last,'' says Gayle Shanks, who
launched Changing Hands with husband Bob Sommer and their friend,
Tom Broderson. ``I didn't see 25 years in it.''
</P>
<P>
   But, Sommer says, ``The moment I got into the bookstore, I felt
I'd come home.''
</P>
<P>
   His sentiments are echoed by long-time customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like it's a place of nostalgia in terms of my roots
here,'' says Walt Richardson, lead singer of the Tempe-based
Morning Star Band and Tempe resident since 1974. ``Changing Hands
has always been a landmark where people would meet.''
</P>
<P>
   Carla Elling, director of the Creative Writing program at
Arizona State University, has been a Changing Hands loyalist since
the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been captivated by the wild seat-of-the-pants
energy and ingenuity of their co-op beginnings, their amazing
growth as a business and as an extended community/family of book
lovers,'' Elling says.
</P>
<P>
   Those legions of book lovers have increased from a trickle to a
flood. In the beginning, Changing Hands clerks were lucky to see
three customers a day. By 1998, the number was up to about 160,000
a year.
</P>
<P>
   In 25 years, millions of books have sold, and rent has risen
from $125 a month to an astounding $10,000.
</P>
<P>
   The philosophy of the shop remains the same: Keep the customer
satisfied.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're always willing to go out of our way to order a book,
even if we don't make a profit on it,'' Sommer says.
</P>
<P>
   Such notions would send shivers through a conventional
corporation. Changing Hands has never been conventional.
</P>
<P>
   Flip back through the pages of the Changing Hands biography and
you find the story of three hippies who made good turning their
passion for reading into an American enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   In 1973, Sommer and Shanks were married and living in converted
Army barracks, where they paid $55 a month in rent and tended a
small garden in their back yard. Shanks was finishing her teaching
certificate at ASU, while Sommer taught math there and ran a
hand-loom workshop, crafting looms for local weavers.
</P>
<P>
   The three twentysomething friends also were teaching at an
alterative school called the Free Learners Society at Third Avenue
and Roosevelt Street in Phoenix. After school let out, they would
sit on the porch and daydream about opening a bookstore.
</P>
<P>
   The fantasy seemed like nirvana _ becoming intimate with the
bestseller list, rubbing elbows with famous authors. Tempe needed
another bookstore, they believed. The neighborhood had only Hill's
at the Tempe Center and nearby Books, Etc.
</P>
<P>
   A tiny bookstore on Mill Avenue, Caveat Emptor, was faltering.
Broderson, who had finished high school but was not in college,
seized the opportunity. With $500 borrowed from his father, he
bought the store lock, stock and paperback and watched the former
owner grab his check and gleefully race out the front door.
</P>
<P>
   Broderson had himself a bookstore. But it seemed doomed.
</P>
<P>
   With rent scheduled to increase to $300 from $125 a month, he
hung on through the next Mill Avenue Fair with help from Shanks,
then closed the business. Shanks helped him cart the leftover books
to his parents' house in Tempe.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't long before Broderson showed up at Sommer and Shank's
house and interrupted their gardening to ask a favor: Would they go
into the book business with him? He had found a new building at 9
E. Fifth St. where he could sublease 500 square feet of affordable
space.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said yes,'' Shanks says. ``It took me 12 seconds.''
</P>
<P>
   Sommer remained committed to his teaching and his loom workshop
but joined the book business the next year.
</P>
<P>
   With an additional $300 borrowed from Broderson's father and a
$1,500 loan from First National Bank, Broderson and Shanks went to
work building book shelves and ordering books.
</P>
<P>
   The most popular titles then were signs of the times: ``The
Whole Earth'' ``Catalog, Finding and Buying Your Place in the
Country, Zen Mind Beginner's'' ``Mind''.``''
</P>
<P>
   Because many of the books were used, recycled and traded,
Broderson gave the store its appropriate name. Changing Hands
opened April 1, 1974.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one came in, that's my memory,'' Shanks says with a laugh
about their first day of business.
</P>
<P>
   Those slow days gave her time to read, weave textiles on a small
loom and chat with friends. She rode her bike to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was fun,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   But fun didn't pay the bills. The store didn't turn a profit for
six months.
</P>
<P>
   Success came gradually. Broderson and Shanks expanded their
stock, buying much of it at swap meets. They began carrying more
new books, heeding customer requests.
</P>
<P>
   Early customers were denizens of the Age of Aquarius. They ate
sprouts, defied authority, preserved the environment and expanded
their consciousness. They wore love beads and Birkenstock sandals.
</P>
<P>
   Shanks looks down at her own feet and laughs. She's still
wearing Birkenstocks.
</P>
<P>
   A list of Changing Hands' first neighbors is a blast from the
past: The Armadillo Wax Shop (candles), the original Gentle
Strength co-op (wheat germ), Earthen Joy (whole-grain sandwiches),
Happy Trails head shop (water pipes).
</P>
<P>
   Tempe officials welcomed Changing Hands. When the city began
downtown redevelopment in 1978, architects designed the space at
414 E. Mill with the store in mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to keep them there,'' says Harry Mitchell, who was
Tempe mayor from 1978 to 1994 and a City Council member for eight
years before that. ``Changing Hands symbolizes what we've tried to
do in downtown Tempe - businesses that are unique.''
</P>
<P>
   ASU professors sent their students to the store, which carried
texts assigned in Creative Writing classes and the then-new Women's
Studies program. One customer set up a subsection on feminist works
and non-sexist books for children.
</P>
<P>
   ``For years, Changing Hands was the only bookstore in the Valley
that took women's literature and feminist studies seriously,'' says
Mary Rothschild, director of Women's Studies at ASU.
</P>
<P>
   By May 1978, Changing Hands had outgrown its little Fifth Street
location and abandoned it for the location on Mill. Boxes of books
were transported via a human chain of 50 friends, family, customers
and ASU professors that stretched 500 feet between the two stores.
</P>
<P>
   Workers stocking the new shelves ate pizza and sang an African
chant, ````Dumaah abutay,'''' recalls Pinna Joseph, who came on
board just before the relocation. Joseph now is a partner and
director of marketing and promotion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were just ecstatic,'' Shanks says. ``We thought we were in
heaven. It was three times the space.''
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, they outgrew that space, too. By 1983, says Susie
Brazil, partner and manager of the McClintock store, ``we had no
room; there was no space where we could even set a card rack.''
</P>
<P>
   In the same week that Sommer and Shanks received notice that
their soon-to-be-adopted son had been born, they were knocking down
walls and expanding to the south.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, they expanded north.
</P>
<P>
   Broderson had left the business by then to open a bookstore in
Prescott called the Satisfied Mind. He still leases a small section
of the Mill Avenue store, offering out-of-print and collectible
books.
</P>
<P>
   Though Changing Hands continues to thrive, downtown Tempe has
changed around it, shifting focus from retail businesses to
entertainment. Restaurants and bars attract a younger crowd that
would rather hang out than shop.
</P>
<P>
   New parking procedures can be frustrating. Walk-by traffic has
declined.
</P>
<P>
   Changing Hands hopes to ride out the storm.
</P>
<P>
   ``If rent stays reasonable, we will stay on Mill,'' Sommer says.
</P>
<P>
   Store owners are hedging their bets with the McClintock
location, situated in a strip mall. The Mill Avenue store is
returning to its used-book roots and reducing its size by a third.
</P>
<P>
   Changing Hands faithful need not despair.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a return to our roots in a positive way,'' Shanks says.
``It's a huge challenge. We are so committed to staying downtown
and being a community bookstore.''
</P>
<P>
   The McClintock outlet is a big, beautiful shop filled with new
and used books, cards, candles and gift items and staffed by clerks
who know and love books.
</P>
<P>
   In late April, the Wildflower Bread Co. moves in next door with
access to Changing Hands, giving readers something to snack on
after they've selected their reading material.
</P>
<P>
   One thing that won't change is the Changing Hands philosophy. As
they once hoed their garden of tomatoes, broccoli and lettuce,
Sommer, Shanks and now Joseph and Brazil say they continue to
cultivate a clientele that shares their passion for literature.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love it,'' Sommer says of his work. ``It's great when you
order a book and then you shelve it, and you show a customer the
book and you recommend it. Then you meet the author. You've felt
the complete cycle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It actually feels like you're doing the right thing.'' &QL;

BOOK TOUR BRINGING HER ALDED AUTHOR LESLIE MAR MON SILKO TO PHOENIX
AREA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA YOST  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ The rain-washed air of Durango, Colo., was refreshing
for Tucson author Leslie Marmon Silko last week after months of
choking on Arizona dust left by a dry winter.
</P>
<P>
   Silko had driven to Colorado from Flagstaff, Ariz., for a book
signing of her long-awaited novel, ``Gardens in the Dunes.'' Just
days before, she had been at the Northern Arizona Book Festival
alongside famous authors from all over the country.
</P>
<P>
   A full-blown book tour is under way. On April 6, Silko will
appear at Changing Hands Bookstore in Tempe. On April 10, she will
appear at the Arizona Book Festival in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is familiar,'' she said of Durango's St. Lewis College,
where she spoke to an audience that includes many of the young
Native Americans who make up much of the student body. It is her
third visit to the college since she began writing almost 30 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Although Silko herself is Native American, reared on the Laguna
Pueblo Reservation in New Mexico, her readers are multicultural and
span a wide age range. Senior citizens, she said, especially enjoy
her ``heartfelt, serious stories.'' They flock to her readings.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have inquisitive minds,'' she said. ``They are really
wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
   To call Silko simply a Native American writer is to diminish an
author whose style and themes transcend genre fiction. ``Gardens in
the Dunes,'' her third novel, is being compared to Henry James in
its scope, though it does not replicate his ponderous style.
</P>
<P>
   Modern readers will applaud that. Silko's prose is lyrical and
richly detailed. ``Gardens'' is the story of two sisters, their
mother and their Grandma Fleet. It begins at the turn of the
century in the ancestral gardens of their tribe and then travels
from America to Europe _ such a Jamesian locale and time period.
</P>
<P>
   Although Silko's previous novel, 1991's highly praised ``Almanac
of the Dead,'' took a laborious 10 years to write, she spent a
relatively speedy four years writing ``Garden,'' resisting pressure
from her publisher, Simon &AMP; Schuster, to write faster.
</P>
<P>
   ``Publishers want a book 18 months after the ink dries on the
contract,'' Silko said by phone from a Durango bed and breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   Fans also were eagerly waiting.
</P>
<P>
   Aided by her agent and her editor, Silko managed to hold the
howling wolves at bay long enough to write her novel the way she
wanted, crafting it so meticulously that she was still editing it
in her mind after publication.
</P>
<P>
   She's pleased with the results and with the reviews she has seen
so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's different,'' she said. ``I like to do different things.
It goes so many places.''
</P>
<P>
   Silko's grandfather, Grandpa Hank, inspired the novel, she said.
As a boy, Grandpa had attended a White-run Indian school in
Riverside, Calif., which educated many Hopi and Pueblo Indian
children.
</P>
<P>
   Silko began to think about a student mentored by a teacher and
destined for greater things than normally is planned for Native
American children. In ``Gardens in the Dunes,'' such a child is a
girl named Indigo.
</P>
<P>
   Silko's own life and work were shaped by the Laguna Pueblo and a
teacher who sparked her creativity. The nurturing environment in
which she was reared fostered the love of storytelling that would
become her career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was surrounded, maybe even in the womb, with a community
that maintains itself and its continuity in the spoken word and a
delight in the narrative,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Fifth grade provided an epiphany.
</P>
<P>
   Silko was transferred from a reservation school to a small,
private Anglo school in Albuquerque. Embarrassed to discover she
was behind the other students in math and science, she withdrew.
</P>
<P>
   But one day her teacher, a war bride from England who might have
empathized with the girl who was feeling like a foreigner, assigned
the class to use their spelling list to write a story.
</P>
<P>
   Silko came alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I escaped the unhappiness of school and being behind,'' she
said. ``That was the big breakthrough.''
</P>
<P>
   By eighth grade, she was writing poems and stories for Sister
Mary Agnes in a Catholic school where her Native American religion
was tolerated and her writing was encouraged.
</P>
<P>
   She graduated from the University of New Mexico and taught
college English and fiction writing before returning to her
heritage of storytelling. In 1977, after publishing several short
stories and poems, she wrote her first novel, ``Ceremony.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics loved it. But the pigeonholing also had begun. The ``New
York Times''labeled her as the ``most accomplished Indian writer of
her generation.''
</P>
<P>
   Silko is not so much offended by labeling as she is weary of it
_ for herself and other marginalized writers _ gay writers, lesbian
writers, Black writers, women writers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here comes the 21st century; maybe we could just talk about
`writers,' '' she said. ``We're such a multicultural society.
People on the street are far away from that (stereotyping).
Marketeers are behind the times.''
</P>
<P>
   She is perhaps ahead of her times and doesn't always like what
she sees. Silko, a human-rights activist in Tucson, said she
believes she is seeing an increase in infringement on civil
liberties by agents involved with the Border Patrol.
</P>
<P>
   Last September, their tactics hit home. Silko and a friend were
pulled over in Tucson by officers who said their car had faulty
headlights. She said that when the officers saw that she was
Indian, several additional units were called, including a canine
unit.
</P>
<P>
   Silko's friend, an Anglo man, was taken away with his car,
leaving Silko alone on a dark Tucson road, she said. She found
assistance at a Circle K.
</P>
<P>
   The officers, Silko said, turned out to be federal Border Patrol
agents who keep an eye on southern Arizona near Mexico. The
incident, she said, is being investigated.
</P>
<P>
   Silko, 51, speaks out for all oppressed Americans, not just
Indians. Her heart aches for displaced war veterans who roam the
streets. She fights for the rights of women and minorities.
</P>
<P>
   But her greatest enmity is reserved for the folks who patrol the
U.S.-Mexican border.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the way the powerful and the rich trample the Earth and
all people, women and people of color, . . .'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People need to know something Gestapo is going on in the
Southwest. The rights of Americans are being eroded.'' &QL;

SCHOOL STARTS MONDAY FOR KITNA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CLARE FARNSWORTH  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KIRKLAND, Wash. _ Jon Kitna is about to embark on a journey. His
ultimate destination is NFL stardom. His vehicle is the
quarterback-friendly offense of new Seahawks coach Mike Holmgren.
</P>
<P>
   But Kitna must begin by taking small steps, starting with
Monday's first practice in the team's four-day quarterback camp.
</P>
<P>
   The afternoon workout will provide the first opportunity for
Holmgren, offensive coordinator Mike Sherman and quarterbacks coach
Mike Sheppard to see Kitna operate the pass-oriented attack that
was made famous by Joe Montana and Steve Young in San Francisco and
helped Brett Favre achieve fame in Green Bay.
</P>
<P>
   The six practices this week also will be Kitna's initial chance
to show he can take the potential that has prompted comparisons to
Favre and Young in their NFL infancy and parlay it into
productivity.
</P>
<P>
   It won't be easy:
</P>
<P>
   For Kitna, who has started six games in his first three seasons
with the Seahawks.
</P>
<P>
   For new backup Glenn Foley, who was obtained 10 days ago in a
trade with the New York Jets.
</P>
<P>
   For Holmgren or his top offensive assistants, who also find
themselves in new roles _ Sherman becoming the coordinator after
two seasons as Holmgren's tight end coach in Green Bay; Sheppard as
the quarterbacks coach after being the offensive coordinator in San
Diego last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``To understand the offense, you have to be smart. It can be
overwhelming,'' Kitna said. ``I read Brett Favre's book, and he
said it took him two years to really get a grasp of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Holmgren continually refers to his offense as quarterback
friendly, but agrees that Favre's assessment is not only fair, it
is accurate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not brain surgery. But you've got to concentrate, and
you've got to be pretty heads up because it puts a lot on the
quarterback's shoulders,'' Holmgren said.
</P>
<P>
   It helps to have broad shoulders, not to mention a reinforced
resolve and skin thick enough to endure a Green Bay winter.
</P>
<P>
   Running Holmgren's offense is not as easy as Favre made it look
in being named league MVP in 1995, 1996 and 1997, when he threw for
112 TDs and more than 12,000 yards in leading the Packers to
back-to-back Super Bowls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember Brett coming up after a big win and sitting next to
me on the plane,'' Holmgren said, recalling a road game in 1994.
``He was really excited. He said, `I got it. It hit. Things are
slower. I see things better.'''
</P>
<P>
   Holmgren breaks into a smile just recounting the episode.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until you get from Point A to that point,'' he quickly added,
``you're going to have your moments where you couldn't make the
decision fast enough because you don't have enough experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Kitna is at Point A. That's A as in angst, but also anxious.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to take some time to learn the system. There will
be some little bumps along the way,'' he said, ``but I can't wait
to get started.''
</P>
<P>
   The best place to start understanding Holmgren's offense is at
the beginning. It is rooted in the 49ers attack he learned as an
assistant coach under Bill Walsh, but has branched out to include a
power running game; one-back, four-receiver sets; and a
preponderance of screen passes.
</P>
<P>
   The pass patterns Holmgren uses are not revolutionary. The
combinations in which he uses them and the formations from which he
deploys them are.
</P>
<P>
   Holmgren says it takes three things to play quarterback in his
system:
</P>
<P>
   -- Accuracy. Holmgren prefers a short pass to a running play
because it is easier to gain 6 yards through the air than on the
ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one, not even Barry Sanders, averages 6 yards a carry,''
said Holmgren, aware that Denver's Terrell Davis and San
Francisco's Garrison Hearst led the league last year by averaging
5.1 yards per carry, both in offenses similar to his.
</P>
<P>
   ``So a lot of times a short pass will be substituted for another
running play. It's easier,'' he said. ``But you have to have the
quarterback. You've got to have the guy so he's making good
decisions most of the time, and he's pretty accurate. If you don't
have that, then you might as well run the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   -- Agility. Not that all-out scrambling ability of Young, but
the necessary foot movement to avoid the pass rush.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even when the play breaks down, you have to be able to make
plays,'' Kitna said.
</P>
<P>
   -- Acceptance. Call this one ``Coach knows best,'' even when it
might not look that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have to be willing to accept and believe what you're
telling them, even if it's not real logical in the beginning,''
Holmgren said. ``If I say this works, this will work. But even
Steve and Brett would look at me in the beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   The offense has become synonymous with spawning great
quarterbacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at the guys who have succeeded in the offense,'' Kitna
said. ``Obviously you have to have tools. Those guys have tools.
But I tend to think I have a lot of those traits, too.''

NEIGHBORS TRAVEL FROM PLAYGROUND TO THE FINAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JUDY BATTISTA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ A time will come in Monday's National
Collegiate Athletic Association championship game when Duke's point
guard, William Avery, will try to penetrate Connecticut's defense
and the polished floor at Tropicana Field will feel like torn-up
blacktop; when Avery will find the Huskies' premier defender, Ricky
Moore, closing in on his personal space. Then, they will replay the
childhood showdowns from Oak Park in Augusta, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Avery, the sophomore, will try a move to get to the
basket and Moore, the senior, will recognize it as something he
taught him back when Avery was just leaving eighth grade and Moore
started dragging him along to pickup games. Perhaps then, on
college basketball's biggest stage, the boys who grew up a block
apart on Hazel Street in the Sand Hill neighborhood of Augusta will
take the game that has bound them together to its logical zenith.
</P>
<P>
   Although Duke is the favorite to win the title, it is Moore,
arguably the finest perimeter defender in the nation, who has the
advantage. ``I took him under my wing,'' Moore said. ``He was
younger than I was, so I was the teacher. Some of the moves he
makes, I do. He's gotten stronger and quicker, and my role is
different. I don't think Will has seen a defender like me all year.
It's going to be tough for him to do anything.''
</P>
<P>
   That was no disrespect. Moore and Avery smiled when they
reminisced about their days at Oak Park, playing pickup games with
guys from 15 to 45 years old, getting banged into the parking lot
if they tried to dunk. They delighted in the idea that the young
boys who used to walk to the playground together _ only to get on
opposing teams when they arrived _ would face off for a prize they
could scarcely imagine when the Reynolds brothers, local legends,
were doing crazy things to rule the court.
</P>
<P>
   Avery and Moore have not talked much recently, their travel
schedules making it difficult for them to find each other. They
have not played an organized game together in nearly four years,
since Moore was a high school senior, Avery was a sophomore and
Westside High went 33-1 and won a state championship with Moore at
the point averaging about 23 points, showcasing an offensive game
he has since set aside. But Moore's influence lingers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really looked up to him,'' Avery said. ``I can remember in
junior high I wanted to get the same number he wore. I even tried
to model my game after him for a little while. Definitely he feels
he has the advantage. He probably does. Some of my moves I got from
him. If anybody knows my game, he does.''
</P>
<P>
   That is because Moore's game was once so similar. But Khalid
El-Amin's arrival in Storrs, Conn., two years ago forced an
uncomplaining Moore to abandon the point and become a defensive
specialist. With suffocating closeness, he makes it nearly
impossible for his man to get off a shot. Even Moore did not know
today who he would guard, but Coach Jim Calhoun has repeatedly said
he likes Moore to chop the head off the dragon.
</P>
<P>
   Avery makes Duke go, but if Moore guards him, it leaves El-Amin
to give up almost half a foot to guard Trajan Langdon. Forward
Kevin Freeman compared Duke to a Cyclops with many eyes, and Moore
will most likely find himself facing almost all of them on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter who I'm guarding,'' Moore said. ``I'm going
to go out and cause havoc.''
</P>
<P>
   In the national semifinal, Moore neutralized Ohio State's point
guard, Scoonie Penn, pushing him further and further out of his
comfort zone with in-his-shirt defense and holding Penn to 11
points on 3-of-13 shooting. Michigan State's Mateen Cleaves got
just 6 points on 2-of-15 shooting in December against Moore, and
Arthur Lee of Stanford had 12 points on 4-of-13 shooting in
February.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if he's like any kid I've coached because he
doesn't really only guard a point,'' Duke Coach Mike Krzyzewski
said. ``He guards anybody on the perimeter.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore suspects that the folks from Sand Hill will be together
someplace watching Monday and that the trash talking has already
begun. Surely, when they are back on that beat-up court this
summer, Avery and Moore will reprise this game. But there is no
time for pleasantries on Monday. The defender will play his man,
even if it is his boyhood friend, like all the others _ closely and
mercilessly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to speak after the game,'' Moore said. ``We're
enemies right now.'' &QL;

PISTONS LAY PATCH ON PEP-LESS SONICS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RONALD TILLERY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUBURN HILLS, Mich. _ If the Sonics were a soap opera _ and this
has been one dramatic season _ an apt show title could be the ``As
the Sonics Turn.''
</P>
<P>
   One day they are an interesting and lively bunch, the next they
are a dull flashback that makes you want to turn the channel.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday at the Palace of Auburn Hills, the Sonics were tuned out
before NBC viewers barely could tune in the nationally broadcast
game against the Detroit Pistons. After a disturbing 104-87 loss,
Sonics coach Paul Westphal did not mince words in describing his
team's fourth loss in six games. To Westphal, the Sonics were ``The
Old and the Slumberous.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We were sluggish. We looked old and tired and slow. And the
Pistons took advantage of it,'' Westphal said. ``They did whatever
they wanted to in the first half, and the game was pretty much
over.''
</P>
<P>
   This was not how the Sonics wanted to start their toughest
stretch of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of bringing fire and enthusiasm into the first of five
road games in six nights, the Sonics brought only their luggage
into Detroit. From the start, the team looked weary, as though it
was at the end of this trip.
</P>
<P>
   But they must try to rebound against Dallas tonight before
taking on San Antonio Tuesday, Denver on Thursday and Portland on
Friday. The Sonics now have lost nine of the 12 games they've
played on the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to have individuals step up,'' Dale Ellis said. ``We
can't rely on Gary (Payton) to get it done for us every night. We
have to be more consistent as a team.''
</P>
<P>
   Payton finished with 10 points and seven assists in 32 minutes.
Detlef Schrempf shared a team-high 12 points with rookie Jelani
McCoy.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, the Sonics were doomed by a poor first quarter. They
fell behind 28-8 in the first 10 minutes and trailed by 20 points
at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   By the 4:29 mark in the third quarter, the Sonics were down 22
points, and Westphal went with his Sonic 2000 team. McCoy, Drew
Barry, Aaron Williams, Rashard Lewis and John Crotty played the
entire fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only bright spot was that our young guys played in the
fourth quarter and did a nice job. They played with some energy,''
Westphal said. `` ... We'll keep looking for something that works,
that's for sure.''
</P>
<P>
   The only other good that came out of the loss was that the
Sonics managed to rest their top seven players. Payton played the
most minutes of any starter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully they'll be ready to play (at Dallas tonight),''
Westphal said. ``... We have too many (slow starts) that's for
sure. We have to ask ourselves if we're not good enough. Maybe
we're not good enough. Maybe that's the reason we're having slow
starts. There's no reason to not be aggressive.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics, who never led, missed 13 of their first 17 shots.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit, meanwhile, benefited from Lindsey Hunter's hot hand
early. Hunter, who scored a game-high 20 points, made his first six
shots and finished with 13 points in the opening quarter. He mostly
picked apart the Sonics' trapping defense, which they use more with
the smaller lineup now that Vin Baker is sidelined with a torn
ligament in his right thumb.
</P>
<P>
   With Baker out, Payton must carry more of an offensive load. But
the Pistons took away Payton's post-up opportunities. They also
outran the Sonics up and down the court.
</P>
<P>
   ``They scored a lot of easy baskets on us by making simple
basketball plays,'' Ellis said.
</P>
<P>
   What Ellis referred to were the Pistons screening for each
other, cutting through the lane and making extra passes. The Sonics
were not as patient when they had the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once we stop fighting ourselves we'll be all right,'' center
Olden Polynice said. ``We're not playing together. We're not
working as a unit, and it frustrates everybody.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't do that at home. When we come on the road, we fight
each other. We're a better team than that. We should know how to
play together. We've got to play to each other's strengths, but we
bring each other's weaknesses out.''
</P>
<P>
   The stress of Sunday's game got to Payton just before halftime
when he was whistled for a technical foul. After being charged with
an obvious offensive foul, Payton unleashed a tirade at referee
Jess Kersey.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit went ahead 52-30 when Jerry Stackhouse made the free
throw.
</P>
<P>
   Payton, who has refused to talk to reporters after games for the
past several weeks, left again without comment.
</P>
<P>
   It is to the point, though, where there is little else to say.
The questions are the same. The answers seem simple enough. But the
Sonics are still a 1,000-piece puzzle spread about the court every
other night.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just one of the mysteries of basketball,'' Polynice said.
``We've tried so many things.''

LAKERS WIN BRAWLGAME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD _ A team disoriented by rapid change, distraught by a
spate of losses and in desperate search of an identity found one at
last Sunday. The Lakers became the Miami Heat.
</P>
<P>
   All the elements of an Eastern Conference playoffs rumble
between the New York Knicks and the Heat were on display at the
Forum. And the Lakers relished playing the role of bruising
provocateur.
</P>
<P>
   Elbows and various limbs flew in all directions beneath the
baskets. Bodies were slammed. A face was mashed. A ball became a
projectile. Two near-brawls erupted. Ejections and technical fouls
were handed out in batches, like cheap door prizes.
</P>
<P>
   And the Lakers, copping their best East Coast 'tude, muscled up,
stayed cool and pulled out a bruising 99-91 victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a big ballgame, it was a tough ballgame, and I like the
aggression that our guys played with,'' coach Kurt Rambis said.
</P>
<P>
   Breaking a two-game losing skid figured to take a gut check or
two. The Knicks provided the Lakers with a few dozen.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Ewing dealt Derek Fisher an elbow and a bruised
cheekbone.
</P>
<P>
   Kurt Thomas wrapped up Dennis Rodman's head and threw him to the
floor.
</P>
<P>
   Shaquille O'Neal jammed a thunderous dunk over Chris Dudley,
landed on him, then shoved him into a row of photographers.
</P>
<P>
   Dudley tossed a changeup halfway down the court, the ball
harmlessly dinking O'Neal's leg.
</P>
<P>
   Latrell Sprewell . . . well, he didn't hurt anyone unless you
count the team-high 25 points he scored against the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   The final mayhem tally: 51 fouls, five technicals, one type-two
flagrant, and ejections for Thomas in the third quarter and Dudley
in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, the Lakers baited and banged but managed to
avoid self-destructing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shows a lot of character,'' Kobe Bryant said, ``because
there's been a lot of quote-unquote distractions going around this
week. Coming out here and playing a smart basketball game, playing
a physical basketball game, and still keeping our cool and winning,
I think it shows a lot of character.''
</P>
<P>
   Or as Glen Rice aptly put it: ``We were able to handle what they
were dishing out, and dish it out ourselves. We weren't going to
back down, and we stepped up to the challenge and got the win.''
</P>
<P>
   They did so _ and avoided their first three-game home losing
streak in five years _ with the kind of consistent aggression on
defense and movement on offense that Rambis has been pushing.
</P>
<P>
   When it all came together, the results were anything but
aesthetic. Just effective. They shot 48.6 percent and committed
just 12 turnovers. They disrupted New York with five blocked shots
and eight steals, held Ewing to 9-of-25 shooting and held the
Knicks to 15 points in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   And their three big guns all fired _ Bryant delivering a
game-high 29 points, complemented by 21 from O'Neal and 19 from
Rice, who's finding his touch and his place in the crowded Lakers
offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think as of lately, I've been able to get into it a little
bit more,'' said Rice, who scored 11 points in a crucial
second-quarter run that expanded the Lakers' lead.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant had scored 14 in the first quarter, but the Lakers still
trailed by six heading into the second period. But Rice and Rick
Fox (eight points) paced a surge that gave the Lakers as much as a
14-point lead in the second quarter, and the Knicks didn't threaten
again until late in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   A Sprewell 3-pointer cut the gap to 78-75, but the Knicks came
unglued after that, as O'Neal slammed over Dudley, landed on him
like a stunt cowboy on a steed, then tossed him aside. O'Neal only
drew a technical foul, but Dudley was ejected after throwing the
ball. Rice scored three straight points and Derek Harper hit
back-to-back 3-pointers, and the Knicks were done.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always get up for the big teams, so I'm not surprised,''
O'Neal said. ``We matched their intensity and we played well. We
knew we needed this one today.''

MONAHAN TO START SEASON AT CLASS AAA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYLER KEPNER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEORIA, Ariz. _ A sloppy day-night doubleheader was three outs
from expiring Friday, and there was Shane Monahan, fouling off
fastball after fastball, shouting at himself when he missed his
pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Monahan got a breaking ball from Colorado's Jerry
Dipoto and rapped it through the right side for his fourth hit of
the game. He came around to score, pumping his fists as he charged
across the plate to send the game into extra innings.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, Monahan took his .326 spring average and cleaned out his
locker. He was optioned to Class AAA Tacoma, where he will play
regularly. Monahan, whose 43 at-bats this spring were more than
twice last spring's total, said he will take this demotion better
than last year's.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year I went down and had a crummy year in Triple-A
because I didn't want to be there,'' Monahan said. ``I felt like I
didn't really get a shot. But that was the wrong attitude to have.
I'm a year older, and you look back at last year and say, `God,
that was a wasted year until I got to the big leagues.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to cry about it. I'll go to Triple-A and handle
my business. Whatever happens, happens. I'm coming down full of
fire.''
</P>
<P>
   Monahan, who hit .242 after his midseason call-up to Seattle
last year, was a long shot to make the team after the M's acquired
veteran outfielders Butch Huskey, John Mabry and Matt Mieske. But
barring any trades, two young outfielders will survive: Charles
Gipson and Raul Ibanez.
</P>
<P>
   Those players fill more specific needs than Monahan _ Gipson as
a backup center fielder and shortstop with speed; Ibanez, who is
out of options, as a third catcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``We like him,'' manager Lou Piniella said of Monahan. ``But
it's a numbers game with him right now.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners' spring roster stands at 33, and Piniella expects
it to be finalized on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   GARCIA'S HOT: Right-hander Freddy Garcia earned his spot in the
rotation a week ago, and he's done nothing to make Piniella
second-guess himself. Garcia improved to 4-0 and lowered his earned
run average to 2.03 in Sunday's 4-2 win over the San Diego Padres.
Garcia struck out eight and allowed three hits in six shutout
innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's as good a pitched game as I've seen this spring,''
Piniella said.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia's fastball hit 96 mph, but the Mariners knew he threw
hard. They've been hoping to see him use his changeup more
effectively, and Sunday he did.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm more comfortable (with the pitch),'' Garcia said. ``When I
get behind in the count, I can throw the changeup for strikes.''
</P>
<P>
   FASSERO LOOKS SAFE: Although it seems unlikely the Mariners will
sign left-hander Jeff Fassero to a contract extension before
opening day, it's not because of his performance on Friday, when he
allowed 11 earned runs in 22/3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we're worried about him,'' said Lee Pelekoudas,
M's vice president for baseball administration. ``He'll be all
right.''
</P>
<P>
   The New York Mets have shown interest in trading for Fassero,
but the Mariners have shown no indications of shopping their
opening-day starter.
</P>
<P>
   BULLPEN QUANDARY: Piniella said he's more concerned with the
bullpen void left by Mark Leiter than he is about who will be his
fifth starter. He stopped short, however, of saying that Leiter's
injury makes Bobby Ayala more valuable to the team.
</P>
<P>
   Leiter, who figured to be a setup reliever, will start the
season on the 15-day disabled list with shoulder tendinitis.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got the experience,'' Piniella said of Ayala, who allowed
his first spring homer Sunday. ``He's pitched in that role before.
At the same time, it's a complicated situation for us, because we
basically had it mapped out. We've got to fill that spot, and we're
not exactly sure where that piece is coming from. It's here, it's
just a question of how to juggle it.''
</P>
<P>
   Right-handers Rafael Carmona and Eric Weaver are still in camp,
but Brett Hinchliffe is the favorite to assume Leiter's role.
</P>
<P>
   AROUND THE HORN: Right-hander Bill Swift, who still has an
outside chance to make the M's rotation, struck out 11 and walked
none over five innings in a minor league game Sunday. Pitching
coach Stan Williams said Swift ``looked like the old Billy.'' Swift
could make the rotation if Ken Cloude does not improve and
Hinchliffe works in relief. ... Roger Jongewaard, M's vice
president for scouting and player development, was in attendance
when the Baltimore Orioles played the Cuban national team
yesterday. ... What's the going rate on a souvenir T-shirt of a
non-roster outfielder batting .059? Thirty dollars. Garth Brooks,
whose No. 77 mock jersey is the hottest-selling item at Peoria
Stadium, struck out against Greg McCarthy to end yesterday's game.
The country singer is now 1-for-17.

COUCH POTATOES PULL IN HISTORY LESSON ON TV 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Saturday was yard day. Sunday was vegetable day.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not referring to the Sonic offense.
</P>
<P>
   For a sports follower, history came in torrents out of the TV.
</P>
<P>
   Venus and Serena Williams became the first sisters to play for a
pro tennis tournament title in 115 years. David and Bob Duval
became the first father and son to win PGA and Senior PGA tourneys
on the same day. And a major league team played a baseball game in
Cuba for the first time in 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   If you foolishly made Sunday yard day, you were all wet on
several counts. Here's some of what was missed, as well as some
rain for others' parades:
</P>
<P>
   -- The all-Williams, all-day matchup at the Lipton Championships
in Key Biscayne, Fla., was a splendid stunner on multiple fronts:
Family, skill, athleticism, race, freshness, tautness, beads.
</P>
<P>
   The matchup's potential had been possible for awhile, but Serena
had to beat three top-10 opponents to get to her sister, 15 months
her senior. Venus and Serena have knocked tennis upon its Wimbledon
whites in ways unseen since McEnroe, Connors, Navratilova and Evert
consumed newsprint by the forest.
</P>
<P>
   -- The Orioles nearly endured an exploding Cuban cigar before
beating their hosts 3-2 in 11 innings, once again making the world
safe for democracy and the American way. The success of the
breakthrough sports contest has inspired the NBA. Commissioner
David Stern is expected to send an NBA team to play at the Los
Angeles Sports Arena, which has not seen professional basketball in
nearly 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   -- Sitting side by side at the game in Havana were Fidel Castro,
the dictator who hijacked a nation in 1959, and baseball
commissioner Bud Selig, the used-car salesman who hijacked the
Seattle Pilots in 1970. Have there ever been two men who have
ascended so dubiously, accomplished so little, and stayed in power
so long?
</P>
<P>
   -- If there was debate about the world's hottest athlete, David
Duval chilled it when he won the Players Championship in Ponte
Vedra Beach, Fla. _ the 10th win in his last 33 tourney
appearances. Just to make sure it wasn't easy, the tourney had 49
of the world's 50 highest-ranked golfers, only two of whom finished
under par. The field Sunday put 18 balls in the water that
surrounds the diabolical island green of No.17, making the movie
``Tin Cup'' come to life for the whole PGA Tour.
</P>
<P>
   When Duval's father, Bob, a few hours earlier won the Senior
Tour event in Milton, Fla., the Duvals drained whatever was left
over in the national well of sports cuteness after the Williams
sisters.
</P>
<P>
   -- From the poignant to the pathetic: Mariner Ken Cloude's
spring-training flop puts him on the verge of winning the club's
Fleming/Wolcott Award for the annual squandering of youthful
pitching promise. Still intact is Mark Langston's claim to be the
Mariners' last farm-developed pitcher who was a major contributor
in Seattle. For kids who don't remember Langston, he pitched
shortly after Cy Young, and would be a nice fit for the Mariner
roster sometime this season. It would give the Mariners the oldest
staff since the one Moses took up the mountain.
</P>
<P>
   -- Longtime P-I baseball scribe Jim Street leaves shortly to
become public relations director for USA Baseball, the national
federation for the U.S. Olympic team and international amateur
teams. Not only does the job include baseball, but international
travel and year-round residence at federation headquarters in
Tucson, Ariz. It's a great job for a great guy, and here's the best
part: Street has volunteered to set up all future tee times and
pick up all bar tabs for Seattle-area rainbirds visiting spring
training. (Might as well put him on the spot. What's he going to
do: Claim his old newspaper misquoted him?)
</P>
<P>
   -- To all the column correspondents who skewered me for my
criticism of Bob Bender's coaching in Washington's NCAA tourney
loss to Miami of Ohio: I said he coached a bad game, I didn't say
he was a bad coach. Lots of coaches can look bad in the tourney.
I'm certain that next time, Bender will defend a Wally
Szczerbiak-type player as well as I can spell him.
</P>
<P>
   What isn't as certain is whether Bender can restore the UW's
reputation as a place for state high school stars. Since the forced
resignation of Marv Harshman, the Huskies haven't recovered the
in-state edge.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzaga star forward Casey Calvary, of Tacoma's Bellarmine, was
a steady attendee of the Husky basketball camps, yet was overlooked
in recruiting. This season, Grant Leep of Mount Vernon wasted his
freshman year with a five-minute average when he could have
redshirted. Mistakes like these leave indelible impressions on high
school coaches.
</P>
<P>
   -- Did the Sonics finish a five-games-in-six-days road trip
Sunday, or start one? By the looks of the 23-6 lead the Pistons
took in the opening minutes in Detroit, the Sonics have the guts of
Barney Fife and the leadership of Dennis Rodman.
</P>
<P>
   -- Dismay over the disclosure that new Husky football coach Rick
Neuheisel was seen partying at the L.A. home of a convicted mobster
not only is unfounded, the act should be seen as encouraging. Given
how severely the Huskies have been out-recruited in recent years,
UW fans should be heartened that Neuheisel may be getting tips from
an expert, Dominick ``Donny Shacks'' Montemanaro, on how to make
offers that can't be refused.

IN STREET FIGHT, RODMAN'S YOUR MAN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD _ This is why the Lakers need Dennis Rodman, warts and
all.
</P>
<P>
   Rodman got under the New York Knicks' skin like an ingrown hair
on Sunday afternoon. He left a rash of raw and irritated Knicks
bodies in his furrow while staying admirably above the fray.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers, with Rodman showing them the way to improved
physical phatness, prevailed 99-91 in front of a sellout Forum
crowd and a national television audience in the kind of game that
has given the team fits in the past. Or had you conveniently
forgotten those two really ugly marks on last year's record, 83-106
at Miami and 89-101 at New York?
</P>
<P>
   When they put the floor down for this one, the Forum workers
should have kept the hockey penalty boxes. Knicks center Patrick
Ewing deserved two minutes for elbowing Lakers point guard Derek
Fisher midway through the second quarter and Chris Dudley did
receive the hoops equivalent of a game misconduct midway through
the fourth for throwing the basketball at Lakers center Shaquille
O'Neal's backside after O'Neal dropped Dudley like a bath towel on
his way to a dunk.
</P>
<P>
   The worst of it occurred in the waning seconds of the third when
the Knicks' Kurt Thomas, in a pretty good goon impression,
clotheslined Rodman underneath the Knicks' basket (and then tried
to undress him) after he and Rodman had scuffled over a rebound of
a Ewing miss.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas won that battle but lost the war, his cool having
completely deserted him by that point. He made the follow to cut
the Lakers' lead to 71-64 and as part of his follow-through flung
Rodman to the ground and tried vigorously to separate the Lakers
forward from his jersey.
</P>
<P>
   For a split second it looked like a bench-clearing brawl might
ensue. O'Neal would later admit he thought about being the third
man in, but Rodman wasn't retaliating so O'Neal figured neither
should he.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dennis did a pretty good job of not reacting,'' O'Neal said.
``I don't know if I would have done that.''
</P>
<P>
   Knicks coach Jeff Van Gundy also showed more restraint than he
has in the past, somehow stopping himself from flinging himself
onto the court in protest and clinging on to Rodman like one of
those feather boas the flamboyant Lakers forward is fond of
wearing.
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say Van Gundy wasn't fuming. Afterward, he called
Rodman a ``dirty'' player. Which begs the question, what does that
make Thomas, downright filthy?
</P>
<P>
   ``It always amazes me,'' Van Gundy groused, ``that (Dennis) is
always the one involved, but it's always the other players that get
picked on.''
</P>
<P>
   Hey, sometimes you're the bruise and sometimes you're the fist.
As Rodman later reasoned: ``It's a game of wits. You just have to
be a lot smarter and a lot more cunning.''
</P>
<P>
   It was clear early on that the recalcitrant Rodman had decided
to test the patience of a team other than the Lakers for a change.
Poor Patrick. For a player, Ewing looked like a pretty good union
president by the time Rodman and O'Neal were through with him.
</P>
<P>
   Ewing, whose leadership during the protracted lockout was
harshly critiqued by O'Neal last week, missed 14 of his final 19
shots, fouling out in the final minute with 20 points. He had 13
rebounds, but he got six of his 12 defensive boards in the first
quarter, leaving the Lakers plenty of time to adjust.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever they did, worked. O'Neal appeared to raise his
defensive intensity a notch in the second quarter, coming out to
the high post to meet him. And Rodman and Glen Rice did a nice job
of boxing out.
</P>
<P>
   The result: Ewing had zero rebounds and zero points in the
second quarter as the Lakers turned a six-point deficit into a
14-point lead in a matter of 10 minutes. The Knicks chipped away at
the advantage, closing to 50-42 at the half. The closest they came
to the Lakers after that was 78-75 on a Latrell Sprewell 3-pointer
with 6:39 remaining in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Lakers fans could have been forgiven for worrying that the other
shoe was about to drop. Instead, O'Neal dropped a definitive dunk
on Dudley and Dudley retaliated with the half-court throw that
turned out to be the stake in his team's heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``You saw it, I got frustrated, I threw the ball,'' Dudley said.
``It was a physical game and it got a little out of hand.''
</P>
<P>
   As the game got wilder and weirder, Rodman got more repressed.
Go figure. He drew fouls twice in the closing two-and-a-half
minutes and sedately sank all four attempts to keep the Knicks at
bay. He finished with seven points and 12 rebounds, making everyone
forget his no-show at practice the previous day.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it's time to hit the big shot, the big free throw, I'm
always there,'' he said. ``I am always ready.'' &QL;

BRAND IS THE NAME OF DUKE'S GAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM MOORE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ With Elton Brand, you measure the size of
the hands as well as the heart. The frame already is apparent; it's
three-car-garage wide.
</P>
<P>
   And then, as Michigan State discovered, the frame moves and
catches, collecting passes, points and rebounds. The national
player of the year is expected to lead Duke to the national
championship Monday night when the Blue Devils take on the
Connecticut Huskies at Tropicana Field.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, Brand brought out more curiosity seekers than usual
after decimating Michigan State in one of Saturday's Final Four
semifinal games. The Spartans entered the game as supposed
scrappers who scratch, claw and like to get dirty. Essentially,
Brand rubbed their noses in it with 18 points and 15 rebounds,
carrying Duke to a 68-62 victory.
</P>
<P>
   If they are hoping for anything different, the Huskies won't
experience a Brand new ballgame _ it will be the same as always,
this unstoppable wall using his muscular body, active feet and soft
hands to floor his opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut plans to hamper him with foul-prone Jake Voskuhl and
a variety of double-teams sent from different directions. That's
exactly what Brand expects and encourages.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I see a man-to-man match-up, my eyes light up,'' Brand
said. ``But sometimes a double-team puts a team at a disadvantage.
I don't know if it's a good strategy or not. I just have to adjust
and play my game.''
</P>
<P>
   If doubled, Brand plans to kick the ball out to the perimeter,
where Trajan Langdon and William Avery await for open 3-point
shots.
</P>
<P>
   But Connecticut coach Jim Calhoun said: ``You have to pick your
poison.'' Aside from that one aberration in Alaska when the Blue
Devils lost to Cincinnati in December, all options are fatal.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation Sunday was that since Voskuhl is 6-foot-11 and 245
pounds, he might be better equipped to handle the 6-8, 260-pound
Brand. But Voskuhl is like ex-Sonic Jim McIlvaine in that neither
can avoid contact or a referee's whistle and usually end up on the
bench. Nonetheless, this is Connecticut's best shot even though
Voskuhl sounded helpless Sunday when asked about Brand's patented
post-up move, simultaneously lowering the shoulder and the boom.
</P>
<P>
   ``He seems to really try to bully people with that move,''
Voskuhl said. ``No one's seemed to stop it yet. It's hard to defend
something like that. You could try to take a charge, but with his
footwork and control of his body, you can't really do that. If you
fall down, he stops and shoots a layup.''
</P>
<P>
   Brand hopes to see the tall blond in front of him Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little tougher when someone's that big,'' he said.
``But I'll use my quickness and dribbling to go around him.''
</P>
<P>
   This could be Brand's final game at Duke. The sophomore was
asked Sunday about the possibility of playing in the NBA next year
and said he had not yet made a decision. If he leaves early, Brand
would be the first Duke player to turn pro before using up his
college eligibility.
</P>
<P>
   As an NBA player, he will be compared to Charles Barkley. Listed
at 6-8, he is more like 6-6. He plays with ferocity. He looks angry
and focused on the court, but is affable elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   During his interview with the media Sunday, Brand spoke through
a constant smile. He is an articulate young man who grew up in
Peekskill, N.Y., building body mass and confidence while developing
a reputation for toughness.
</P>
<P>
   In one of his first games as a freshman in high school, Brand
took an elbow to the head that knocked a tooth into the roof of his
mouth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know where it was,'' he said. ``I was bleeding when I
came over to the bench. Then I found it and straightened it out.
They wanted to take me to the dentist, but I wouldn't let them.''
</P>
<P>
   Brand returned to the game, grabbed a few more rebounds and
dislodged the opponent with 21 points.
</P>
<P>
   Last year at Duke, Brand fractured a bone in his left foot. He
was supposed to be out for four months. Brand returned in eight
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Resilient, he is also unusual. Besides the nimble manner for a
player his size, Brand has hands that match the size of the
foundation. From the base of his palm to the end of his middle
finger, Brand's hand is 10 inches long, a quarter-inch longer than
Michael Jordan's. A Raleigh, N.C., surgeon says the average male's
hand is 7{ inches long. Brand's hands are like a first baseman's
mitt.
</P>
<P>
   ``They help me getting rebounds, in trying to get steals and in
blocking shots,'' Brand said.
</P>
<P>
   ``God has given him some special gifts,'' said Duke coach Mike
Krzyzewski. ``He has a huge body, but he's very much finesse. He
has huge hands, he has long arms.''
</P>
<P>
   He has given the Huskies a quandary.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've just got to stick our chests out there and let him know
we're not going to be moved,'' said forward Kevin Freeman.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he has ever come up against anyone as big and quick as
he is, Brand said: ``I don't think so ... I'm getting a little
cocky right there.''
</P>
<P>
   At Cameron Indoor Stadium, Duke fans hold up signs that say:
``Branded for Life,'' and you get the feeling that Connecticut
could become fodder for slaughter Monday night.

GALAXY WINS AFFAIR NOT TO REMEMBER

<P>
   PASADENA _ Galaxy coach Octavio Zambrano was all but tarred and
feathered for attacking the way Chicago counter-attacked its way to
an MLS championship last season.
</P>
<P>
   Even though he would love to bite his tongue and stay away from
this topic _ he can't. Not after Sunday's 1-0 shootout victory over
the Burn after the two teams failed to score in regulation.
</P>
<P>
   Cobi Jones, Clint Mathis and Greg Vanney provided enough scoring
punch in the shootout to give L.A. a 3-2 edge and improve to 2-0 _
but it was hardly a positive result considering the Galaxy lost
four valuable points by failing to win in regulation in its first
two games at the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   The boring showing by both teams raised a philosophical debate
amongst the two coaches afterward. Of course, both Zambrano and
Dallas' Dave Dir claimed the other was responsible for most of the
boos from the 27,034 in attendance.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of attacking Dallas directly the way he did Chicago,
Zambrano chose a more careful approach this time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking at games in this league and I can tell you that
defending is the priority and that's a fact,'' Zambrano said. ``I
think it's different in years past when teams played open soccer.
But now most of them are falling back and defending. That's just
the way it is, unfortunately.''
</P>
<P>
   There were hardly any chances on either side. The Galaxy managed
only two shots on goal to the Burn's one, prompting Zambrano to
admit the game lacked character.
</P>
<P>
   ``Was it boring? Without a doubt,'' Zambrano said. ``If you
examine the game of soccer, the attack-minded philosophy should
prevail for the game to be attractive. If you have a
defensive-minded mentality, it won't be pleasant.''
</P>
<P>
   Dir, however, claimed the Galaxy plays a bigger
counter-attacking role than Zambrano admits. And despite the fact
L.A. shattered every scoring record imaginable last season, Dir
said the Galaxy does as much counter-attacking as anyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that whenever Octavio loses he talks about the same
thing,'' Dir said. ``When he wins he's fine with packing it in and
counter-attacking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not God's gift to soccer, but they (the Galaxy) pack it in
more than anybody. They make every attempt to win the ball behind
you when your player is in a good position. They use a lot of
elbows and they love to spring their guys with speed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We, on the other hand, like to play possession, knock the ball
around and create good chances.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones gave his own objective look.
</P>
<P>
   ``Soccer is always attractive as long as you're winning,'' he
said. ``If you play attractive as (heck) and lose all your games,
you're going to have zero fans out there. That's just the way it
is. It's a catch-22.''

NASCAR GIVES TMS RESOUNDING THUMBS UP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ After a relatively incident-free and
complaint-free racing weekend, NASCAR official Mike Helton said
Texas Motor Speedway has passed its final exam.
</P>
<P>
   Helton said TMS has fixed the water seepage problem that plagued
the racetrack a year ago. But minor concerns remain about a
``transition'' in the pavement in Turn 2 and traffic flow have been
brought to his attention, Helton said yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not as much complaining this year about the
racetrack,'' said Helton, NASCAR's senior vice president and chief
operating officer. ``The issue where the water was seeping up
through the track, all indications are that's been corrected. We
still have issues with traffic in Texas, and Atlanta, for that
matter. But the specific issues addressed last year, they
\Rmanagement\S have worked on and have gotten much closer to the
fix.''
</P>
<P>
   Following a weekend plagued by water seepage in Turn 1 and
chunking pavement in Turn 4 last April, NASCAR president Bill
France Jr., informed TMS developer Bruton Smith that he wanted the
glitches repaired before the NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series visited
for a night race in June.
</P>
<P>
   Smith responded with a $3 million renovation that included
installation of an elaborate drainage system, reconfiguring of the
entrance into Turn 1 and the exit of Turn 4 and a complete
repaving.
</P>
<P>
   ``Texas Motor Speedway is a grand facility, by even Texas
standards,'' said Helton, who assumed day-to-day operations of
NASCAR from France in February. ``The problem we had here last year
was water coming from underneath up. The problem we got this year
is water coming down.''
</P>
<P>
   That was a reference to Saturday's rain-shortened Coca-Cola 300
Busch Grand National race. Showers also washed out the final
Winston Cup ``Happy Hour'' practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``In regards to the transitions in Turn 4 and those things the
drivers commented about the first couple of years, the drivers are
a bit more comfortable now,'' Helton said. ``They talk about a
`transition' that might now exist in Turn 2. It might be a bump or
it might be from the fix the track went through last year _ having
left a little bit of a difference from the Turn 2 that existed the
first two years. We don't necessarily see that as a big issue,
though.''
</P>
<P>
   Dale Jarrett, who finished second in yesterday's race, said the
track was great.
</P>
<P>
   ``\RThe track\S allows us to race hard, it allowed us to race
side-by-side at times,'' Jarrett said. ``They did improve the
track. It was much better and it will continue to get better.''
</P>
<P>
   Helton said he also heard an earful about traffic, specifically
about a problem with crew members trying to exit the track at the
end of their work day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Friday night, for example, it took an hour and a half to get
out of the infield,'' Helton said. ``Traffic is an issue, and has
to be addressed.''
</P>
<P>
   As for TMS getting its much-desired second Winston Cup date,
Helton maintained the posture that NASCAR is looking to expand into
new markets before adding race dates to existing markets.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, however, Eddie Gossage, TMS vice-president
and general manager said this was a positive step for the speedway.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could have been better, but this was definitely a turning
point for Texas Motor Speedway,'' Gossage said. ``Race-wise, it
looked like a typical Winston Cup race, which is what we wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   As for getting a second date, Gossage added: ``Nothing was
discussed \Rtoday\S about the second date. Do we go knocking on the
door tomorrow for a second date? I don't think so.''
</P>
<P>
   Gossage also said TMS would make a ``concerted effort'' to land
a second Busch Grand National race. Saturday's Coca-Cola 300 drew
an estimated 115,000 fans, the largest crowd ever for a Busch
race.''

CIENFUEGOS' L.A. FINALE?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED J. ROBLEDO  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA -- If you listen to his agent, Corey Clemetson,
Sunday's 1-0 shootout victory over Dallas may have been the last
game for midfield playmaker Mauricio Cienfuegos -- at least in a
Los Angeles uniform.
</P>
<P>
   Cienfuegos, 31, agreed last week to end his holdout with Major
League Soccer following a friendly breakfast with MLS commissioner
Doug Logan.
</P>
<P>
   Cienfuegos has been at odds with the league over his contract
and told Logan last Saturday he would give the league 10 days to
make a reasonable offer. With Wednesday's target date approaching,
Clemetson said Cienfuegos could be on his way to El Salvador if
nothing changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me on Friday he would like to have Doug Logan promise
to be out here at the end of negotiations if thing's aren't going
well. At this point, they aren't going that well,'' said Clemetson.
``We are going to do what we can but as far as I know the deadline
Wednesday still stands.''
</P>
<P>
   Clemetson says the two sides are no closer than they were a week
ago, although some progress has been made.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dialogue has been good and cordial but that's about it,''
Clemetson said. ``We haven't had much movement at all.''
</P>
<P>
   (Bullet) Greg Vanney scored the deciding goal in Saturday's 3-2
shootout victory. He has had his share of good and bad luck as the
team's fifth kicker.
</P>
<P>
   In last year's Western Conference final against Chicago,
however, it was Vanney who missed L.A.'s final attempt, allowing
the Fire to reach the MLS championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always nice when you win and I'm not afraid of going
fifth. I think it's an advantage despite the pressure,'' said
Vanney. ``When you go fifth you get to see what their goalkeeper
does in the earlier rounds.''

 By JONATHAN FEIGEN  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ Having learned Kings star Chris Webber would
be out with the flu Sunday, Rockets coach Rudy Tomjanovich fretted
that it was the worst news for his team.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Kings would rally behind the loss of their leader. Someone
would have a career night. The Rockets, playing their fourth game
in five nights, could easily be suckered.
</P>
<P>
   He was right, too. But the Rockets answered in a way he never
would have dared consider. The Rockets rallied around the loss of
their own star power forward, surged past the Kings and then
brought Charles Barkley back to put away their eighth consecutive
win with a 107-93 knockout of the Kings at Arco Arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``Charles was suffering,'' Rockets forward Scottie Pippen said.
``But we really wanted to come out and maintain what we've been
building the last week and a half.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last week and a half, the Rockets have appeared
unbeatable, rallying from 19 points down in the second half to beat
the Warriors on Saturday, then a night later whipping the Kings
with Barkley playing just 10 second-half minutes in obvious back
pain.
</P>
<P>
   And if the Rockets left Houston as the NBA's hottest team, a
weekend in Northern California more than validated that streak: It
returned the Rockets to the ranks of the league's power teams. With
an eight-game winning streak and victories in 11 of their past 12,
the Rockets get a day off in Los Angeles to consider their sudden
place in the NBA standings. Just three weeks after they were sixth
in the Western Conference, they wake this morning tied for the
fourth-best record in the NBA, just one game behind the Utah Jazz
in the Midwest Division.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've really got it going,'' Tomjanovich said. ``We just have
to stay healthy.''
</P>
<P>
   But there's the rub. Barkley said he badly strained his back
when he overcompensated for an aching left knee. He had
arthroscopic surgery Feb. 4, and though he has gotten stronger, the
back has grown worse each of the past three games.
</P>
<P>
   ``My back is killing me,'' Barkley said. ``I'm in pain right
now, but as long as we win, the pain hurts less.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets came up with that analgesic with an
often-spectacular second half, rallying around the loss of Barkley
in the third quarter and then hopping on that sore back in the
fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Barkley had left the court with 3:24 remaining in the first half
and stayed in the training room for the start of the second half to
continue treatments. The decision to hold him out of the start of
the second half was based on the thought that if he started the
half, the back would stiffen when he had to leave the game. The
hope was that once in the game he could continue to play without
tightening up when resting.
</P>
<P>
   With Barkley out, Othella Harrington took care of the third
quarter until Barkley returned to start to the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Harrington shut down Lawrence Funderburke _ who had a
career-high 18 points in Webber's place _ and made four of five
shots for nine points in the quarter. He even added, of all things,
a nifty behind-the-back bounce pass to Hakeem Olajuwon for a dunk.
After a 12-point first half, largely against the pained Barkley,
Funderburke had just two points in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew with Charles out I had to give a lift, and especially
try to slow down Lawrence a bit,'' Harrington said. ``I was
disappointed in myself at Golden State, missing all those free
throws (he made three of eight). I wanted to come back.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time Barkley returned, the Rockets had withstood a
shooting barrage from Kings rookie Jason Williams and answered with
a run of their own. When Williams scored on one of his one-handed
high floaters, he had given the Kings a 61-60 lead midway through
the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   But the Rockets immediately regained the lead, Olajuwon scoring
on the Harrington pass as the Rockets closed out the quarter with a
14-4 run. When Cuttino Mobley ended the quarter by just beating the
shot clock with a 3, the Rockets had their largest lead, 75-66.
</P>
<P>
   From there, Barkley went to work. After a Matt Bullard jumper,
Barkley took a pass from Brent Price to a three-point play, then
hit a turnaround jumper. Having forced the Kings to double-team
him, he passed to Price at the 3-point line, and Price gave the
Rockets an 85-72 lead with 9:33 left.
</P>
<P>
   Barkley followed a Price miss with a layup, passed to Pippen for
a dunk and then beat Funderburke inside for two more layups, even
helping the fallen Funderburke up after driving past him on the
second. He had 11 points in five minutes, the pain never leaving
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Charles was heroic,'' Tomjanovich said. ``I would think that
would have a very positive effect on a team. It had an effect on
me. I think the guy is amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   When Michael Dickerson nailed a 3 with 6:20 left, the Rockets
led 96-80 and began to cruise. But as has so often been the case,
they cruised too soon. They made just one of their next eight
shots, and the Kings went on an 11-2 run to within 98-91 with two
minutes left.
</P>
<P>
   But just as he had Saturday at Golden State, Pippen put the win
away with a 3, taking a pass from Olajuwon to push the lead to
101-91 with 1:33 left. Olajuwon hit a 3 at the buzzer to give him
24 points. Pippen had 17, and Barkley added 15 points and 11
rebounds in 25 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're worn out,'' Tomjanovich said. ``That's four games in
five nights. We really need an off day bad.''
</P>
<P>
   But winning under such circumstances, Olajuwon said, ``is the
sign of a good team.''
</P>
<P>
   The way things are going, good might be an understatement.

 By MICHAEL MURPHY  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ It was just a matter of time before the Los
Angeles Lakers or the visting New York Knicks cracked under the
pressure their disappointing seasons.
<TEXT>
<P>
   RodmanTurns out it was the Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers and the Knicks, both in the process of being
undermined by chemistry problems, duked it out _ almost literally _
at the Great Western Forum on Sunday, the Lakers walking off the
floor with a 99-91 victory.
</P>
<P>
   The highlights will show the key plays _ Derek Harper's two huge
3-pointers in the final four minutes to stave off a Knicks rally,
Kobe Bryant's graceful spin move in the lane with 49 seconds to
play, capping a brilliant 29-point performance, and all of
Shaquille O'Neal's dunks in a 21-point game.
</P>
<P>
   But the key to the Lakers' 20th win was they were able to shove
aside Dennis Rodman's relentless sideshow while the Knicks were
not. The Knicks, faltering under their internal pressures, were
unable to deal with the throbbing headache that is Rodman.
</P>
<P>
   And Rodman mined that for all it was worth.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, everyone, the 17,505 in attendance and the honchos at
NBC, went home happy because the game was spiced with several
obligatory Rodman incidents, from the usual jersey-grabbing and
elbow-throwing to an all-out wrestling match with the Knicks' Kurt
Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd cheered and the New York bench griped every time he
elicited a response from the Knicks, so it was understandable most
of the postgame discussions focused on Rodman.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you understand the game, you ignore all the stuff Dennis
does,'' said the Lakers' Robert Horry. ``I know when I played
against him when he was in San Antonio, you just ignore him. A lot
of people get mad at the things he does, but you have to ignore it
and keep going. You have to be smarter. I'm surprised he still gets
away with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Also surprised was Knicks coach Jeff Van Gundy, who minced few
words when describing Rodman.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a dirty player,'' Van Gundy said. ``I mean he's a great
player, but he plays dirty. It always amazes me that he's always
the one involved but it's always the other players that get picked
on (by the officials).''
</P>
<P>
   Suffice it to say Van Gundy has been feeling a bit picked on
himself these days. About the only thing thinner than Van Gundy's
hairline is the ice on which he has been skating the past couple of
weeks with New York management. After sweeping changes to their
roster during the offseason, the Knicks thought they were going to
be among the Eastern Conference's elite.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Sunday's loss to the Lakers dropped them to 16-14, and
supposedly a step closer to a pink slip for Van Gundy, who has been
battling his team as well as opponents.
</P>
<P>
   His biggest fight remains Latrell Sprewell, who is quietly being
called ``Me-well'' by teammates because of his selfish play.
Sprewell is unhappy with his role as sixth man and wants to start,
a conflict that led to a meeting with Van Gundy last week.
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell led the Knicks with 25 points Sunday, but threw up
several ill-advised shots and often missed a wide-open Patrick
Ewing, who would finish with 20 points and 13 rebounds before
fouling out with 23.4 seconds to play.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, in many ways, Sunday's game represented a Twilight
Zone-like cautionary tale about being careful about what you wish
for. The Lakers and Knicks wanted to reinvent themselves, and went
to great _ and somewhat controversial _ lengths to do so.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers' problems with Rodman have been well-documented _ his
trip to Las Vegas, refusing to report back in for the fourth
quarter Friday in what turned out to be a loss to the Sacramento
Kings and then being 75 minutes late to practice Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one said it was going to be easy,'' said Lakers coach Kurt
Rambis of dealing with Rodman. ``I look forward to him being here,
being productive and focused on all the things we are doing now.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Sunday, when the ``good'' Dennis Rodman showed up. He
finished with seven points and a team-high 12 rebounds, even
knocking down four straight free throws in the final 2:35.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of guys always try to count me out of the free throws,''
Rodman said. ``At the beginning of the game I may screw around, but
when it is time to hit the big shot, the big free throw, I am
always there.''
</P>
<P>
   Just like he always seems to be there when there's a bit of
extracurricular activity. Rodman's one true gift is his ability to
tap into an opponent's frustrations and mine them for his own
purposes, as he did in his tussle with Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a game of wits,'' Rodman said. ``You've got to know when
to be aggressive and when not to. You show your aggression during
the play, but you do not show your aggression after the play. You
just have to be smarter and more cunning.''
</P>
<P>
   Something the Knicks were not.
</P>
<P>
   Not only was Thomas tossed for his set-to with Rodman, but Chris
Dudley was ejected with 6:13 left in the game for throwing the ball
at O'Neal after the 7-1, 325-pound center dunked over him and then
flipped Dudley aside with a twitch of his arm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't even know what happened,'' said O'Neal, grinning.
``There was so much power in my body that I didn't even feel it
(when the ball hit him in the backside).
</P>
<P>
   ``He (Dudley) just grabbed me. He was under me, and I just had
to get him off me. You know how it is with those Knicks guys _ you
don't know what their intention is, so I had to get him off me.''
</P>
<P>
   Could have been worse. It could have been Rodman under him.

 By TERRY BLOUNT  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
FORT WORTH _ Terry Labonte has an impressive list of
accomplishments in his NASCAR career, including two Winston Cup
championships and earnings of more than $19 million.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The 42-year-old Corpus Christi native has reached most of the
goals he hoped to achieve in his 21 seasons on the circuit, but one
thing that had eluded him was winning a race in his home state.
</P>
<P>
   Labonte, who now resides in North Carolina, finally grabbed a
checkered flag in Texas when he guided the Kellogg's Chevrolet to
victory Sunday in the Primestar 500 in front of a Texas Motor
Speedway-record crowd of 221,861.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, this is the biggest race I've ever won,'' said Labonte,
who has 21 victories in his career. ``To come here and win at home
is great. I looked up and saw the crowd standing at the end, and it
was an awesome feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   It was almost a perfect day for the Labonte family. Younger
brother Bobby _ driving with a broken right shoulder blade _
finished third in the Interstate Batteries Pontiac.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I have a big coconut shell on my back,'' Bobby
Labonte, 34, said. ``It's pretty sore right now. I've never been
that uncomfortable in the car. But it was fun racing with Terry
most of the day.''
</P>
<P>
   Dale Jarrett finished between the Labonte brothers as the race
ended under caution after Jimmy Spencer hit the wall on the
frontstretch with four laps remaining in the 334-lap event.
Teammates Rusty Wallace and Jeremy Mayfield were fourth and fifth,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Labonte, who led 124 laps, took the lead for good with 10
laps remaining when he managed to squeeze past Jarrett, who got to
the front thanks to an off-sequence pit stop late in the race.
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett kept Labonte behind him for 17 laps, but Labonte finally
got around him _ with a little help from Chad Little _ by going
outside at the start of lap 324.
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett had to slow down just a bit in the Quality Care Ford as
the two cars came up on Little, who was trying to stay on the lead
lap. Labonte made it past Little in turn 1, but Little stayed in
front of Jarrett for half a lap.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying to figure out how to pass Dale,'' Labonte said.
``I tried inside, and I couldn't do it, but I found out I could go
outside and get some grip.''
</P>
<P>
   Labonte was six car lengths ahead of Jarrett when the yellow
flag came out with three laps to go, so it was unlikely Jarrett was
going to catch him had the race ended under a green flag.
</P>
<P>
   Labonte and Jarrett battled the last time Labonte won a race, in
Richmond, Va., last June. Labonte bumped Jarrett from behind to
force his way to the front with two laps to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing I didn't want to do today was run into Dale, and
almost did once,'' Labonte said. ``I had to get out of the gas and
try again the next lap.''
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett was angry at Richmond when Labonte tapped him from
behind, but he had no complaints this time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Terry made a good, smart, clean pass today,'' Jarrett said.
``I had to get off the gas a little when he got by me, but he had
the better car. I wasn't going to catch him at the end.''
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett said he was happy he was able to stay in front of Bobby
Labonte.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know how tough Bobby is, so it didn't surprise me he went
the distance today with that injury,'' Jarrett said. ``He has that
determination and desire to compete. It shows the strong will and
mental strength he has to go through what he did out there and
finish third.
</P>
<P>
   ``But second was great for us if you look at the big picture. We
gained a lot of (championship) points on guys ahead of us (entering
the race) that had trouble today.''
</P>
<P>
   Terry Labonte earned $376,840 for the victory and moved up from
ninth to fifth in the Winston Cup points standings. The money and
the points are important to Labonte, but he said winning in Texas
is something he always will remember.
</P>
<P>
   Labonte raced three times at the start of his career (1979-81)
at Texas World Speedway before NASCAR stopped running at the
College Station track. He had to wait 16 years to get another
chance at a Texas victory, and he came close in his first two trips
to TMS. Labonte was third in 1997 and sixth last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We put a lot of effort into trying to win here this year,''
Labonte said. ``We tested two cars here. Before the season started,
we wrote down some things we wanted to accomplish. Winning here was
near the top of the list.''
</P>
<P>
   The only major goal that has eluded Labonte is a victory in the
Daytona 500.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't gotten Daytona yet, but we got the second-most
meaningful race for us,'' said Andy Graves, Labonte's crew chief.
``Terry doesn't always show how he feels, but I know how much it
means to him to win here.''
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Labonte, who has finished in the top 10 in all three TMS
races, hopes he can join Terry someday as a Texas winner. But Bobby
said he knew early in the race Sunday that his big brother was on a
mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``Terry was driving his heart out today,'' Bobby said. ``It's
never easy to pass that 88 car (Jarrett), but Terry was not going
to be denied.''

</P>
<P>
   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ They come in assorted sizes and all kinds of
packages, the ones who can take a routine ending to a predictable
season and turn it on its head.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes they are Danny Manning, an All-American in pedigree,
who can hoist an entire underdog team from Kansas onto his
shoulders with 31 points and 18 rebounds to knock off cocky
Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes they are Harold Jensen, an unassuming reserve, who can
pop up off the bench for Villanova and shoot a perfect 5-for-5 from
the field to take down snarling, powerful Georgetown.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes they are even Lorenzo Charles, who can become a folk
hero merely by standing in the right place at the right time,
turning a miss into a miracle as North Carolina State shocks
leaping, soaring, strutting, slam-dunking Houston and the world.
</P>
<P>
   They are the difference-makers, and you never seem to know their
names or what shape they'll take. But if it happens tonight for
Connecticut against mighty Duke in the NCAA championship game, the
most likely candidate will be a point guard who looks like the
product of a mating dance between a Cabbage Patch doll and one of
the Teletubbies.
</P>
<P>
   Khalid El-Amin is a well-rounded player, a well-rounded person
and, well, rounded. He is to the image of hummingbird-quick guard
what chicken fried streak (extra gravy) is to health food.
</P>
<P>
   El-Amin's idea of a six-pack is not a well-defined set of
stomach muscles but something you drink while resting the plate
with the burger and chips on your stomach. He's a muffin with legs.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I do eat a lot,'' he said. ``That's not a secret.''
</P>
<P>
   Not at 5-10 and 205 pounds. And certainly no secret to the
basketball world as the Huskies have posted a 65-7 record in the
two seasons since he joined the team.
</P>
<P>
   Fans at visiting arenas have called him ``Pillsbury Doughboy.''
They wave Domino's Pizza boxes at him when he's in the layup line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been small, always had this kind of body, and I
like it,'' El-Amin said. ``I know I don't look like your average
point guard. Which is why, I think, the out-of-shape segment of the
population takes me and embraces me.''
</P>
<P>
   That's it. He's a hero to the majority in the
soft-around-the-edges segment of society, the bunch of us who
figure we could jump up off the sofa and dribble the ball down the
court on the fast break and stick the jumper like the little
roly-poly dude, if only we'd remember to lick the nacho cheese off
our fingers first.
</P>
<P>
   ``Charles Barkley doesn't have the shape or size of your
big-time power forward in the league, but he's done all right,''
El-Amin said.
</P>
<P>
   He's a miniature Chuckster, motor mouth and all.
</P>
<P>
   But the truth is that he is a special kind of athlete,
possessing an unorthodox body and yet extraordinary skills to
succeed and a cocksure attitude. Which is why if Connecticut has
hope tonight, he is it. Not simply because El-Amin scored 18 points
against Ohio State and dealt six assists _ including that nifty
behind-the-back pass to Kevin Freeman _ but because he believes he
can.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never had fear of anybody on a basketball court,'' he
said. ``So I know I won't be afraid of Duke. If pressure got to me,
I wouldn't be who I am.''
</P>
<P>
   That is, the kid who started playing the game at age 4 in
Minneapolis when his father hung up a hoop over the garage for
Khalid and his older brother Makram and was always the smallest one
in every game. When he was in second grade, El-Amin was playing on
a seventh-grade team at a place called the Hospitality House.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't start, but I got my minutes,'' he said. ``They knew I
was there.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the talk of what UConn All-America guard Richard
Hamilton and center Jake Voskuhl must do for the Huskies to have a
fighting chance against Duke, El-Amin is precisely the kind of
player, the kind of hug-the-spotlight personality, who could feel
the heat and thrive.
</P>
<P>
   If you let yourself believe in the tooth fairy and all of those
past NCAA Monday nights, there is something about him that tells
you he is the kind of figure who could make things as interesting
as his own life.
</P>
<P>
   El-Amin is an orthodox Muslim who married at age 16, fathered a
daughter out of wedlock at 17 and now, two years later, has an
infant son with his wife. He prays five times a day. He is mouthy
yet devout. He is small yet plays big. He looks like a marshmallow
yet has 6 percent body fat.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's about 15 years old to 35, depending on the subject matter
and the moment,'' said UConn coach Jim Calhoun. ``But we wouldn't
be here without him.''
</P>
<P>
   He is the Huskies' heart, their soul, their hunger, maybe their
entree to another March miracle.
</P>
<P>
   Fat chance.
</P>
<P>
   Which, El-Amin will tell you, is different than no chance at
all.

DUKE CAN'T KEEP UP WITH PURDUE 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. _ The Purdue Boilermakers ended an almost
perfect season on an almost perfect note Sunday night, as they
defeated Duke, 62-45, in the NCAA Tournament final at San Jose
Arena.
</P>
<P>
   It's the first time Purdue (34-1) took home the national
championship in 10 trips to the tournament, and the first time a
Big Ten team won the title.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wow!'' said a beaming Purdue coach, Carolyn Peck, after the
game. ``I guess that's the best way to describe it.''
</P>
<P>
   The thrill was in the result but not the execution. It had the
dubious distinction of being the lowest-scoring championship game
in NCAA history (Louisiana Tech and Auburn totaled 110 points in
1988), and had the fewest first-half points (39, compared to 50 in
the '88 game). Purdue's 17 first-half points were also the lowest
total.
</P>
<P>
   Duke (29-7) has been to the tournament for the past five years
but never had gotten as far as the Final Four. It defeated
three-time defending champion Tennessee in the East Regional and
Georgia Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've come such a long way, and we've been playing our best
basketball,'' said Duke coach Gail Goestenkors. ``So this is very
disappointing. This is certainly not the way we envisioned the end
of the season.''
</P>
<P>
   Purdue, which had a very un-Purduelike first half, rebounded to
show why it suffered only one loss, to Stanford, all season. With
the game tied at 30, the Boilermakers went on a 10-1 run. Even
though Duke tried to come back with a 3-pointer by senior guard
Nicole Erickson (8 points), and two layups by Michele VanGorp, it
wasn't enough.
</P>
<P>
   When a 3-pointer by Katie Douglas landed to give the
Boilermakers a 45-38 lead, she jumped and raised her fist in the
air as the sellout crowd of 17,773 cheered. With six minutes to go,
Duke suffered a scoring drought, and 12 free throws in a row by
Purdue put the game away.
</P>
<P>
   Guard Ukari Figgs scored a game-high 18 points for Purdue, while
Camille Cooper and Douglas had 13 ach. Stephanie White-McCarty
added 12, but with four minutes left she severely sprained her
ankle.
</P>
<P>
   Early on, fans must have rubbed their eyes and wondered who they
were watching. Was this really top-ranked Purdue playing No. 10
Duke?
</P>
<P>
   In the first 7:10, the teams accounted for just 10 points. Duke
turned the ball over again and again (20 in the game), and was
charged with eight fouls. The Blue Devils shot 39.1 percent from
the floor in the first half, Purdue 28.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The half ended with Duke in front, 22-17.
</P>
<P>
   Figgs, who scored just 3 of her 18 points in the first half,
said, ``We were going for outside shots, and our outside shots
weren't falling. So in the second half we started attacking the
basket.''
</P>
<P>
   VanGorp, Duke's 6-foot-6-inch senior, who was held to just 4
first-half points, said her team wasn't executing on offense. Added
Hilary Howard, ``They play good pressure defense and we didn't make
adjustments.''
</P>
<P>
   But Purdue made all the adjustments it had to, and when the
buzzer sounded, it had the national title.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, I can't think of a better moment,'' Peck said.

THREE'S NO CROWD IN FROZEN FOUR

   MADISON, Wis. _ Hockey East is headed West. And Boston College
goalie Scott Clemmensen is ready for the ride.
</P>
<P>
   BC, playing tough defense once again, knocked off top-seeded and
No. 1-ranked North Dakota, 3-1, Sunday &UR;  &LR; night at the Dane County
Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles made it a Hockey East sweep of the rest of the
college hockey world.
</P>
<P>
   Three Hockey East teams _ BC, New Hampshire, and Maine _ made
the field and all three advanced to the NCAA's Frozen Four that
starts Thursday in Anaheim. It's the first time in the league's
15-year history that three teams have made it to the final round.
</P>
<P>
   BC and Maine square off in a rubber match in one semifinal. UNH
faces Michigan State.
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles, high-flying all year, did it with defense just like
they did Saturday night against Northern Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   Clemmensen and the Eagles shut down the Fighting Sioux, who
averaged five goals a game and were top-rated in the country most
of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got one more thing to say,'' Clemmensen said in a news
conference. ``I didn't pack my shorts for nothing on this trip. I
was real confident we were going on to Anaheim.''
</P>
<P>
   And he was a big part of the reason the Eagles will fly West
Tuesday instead of East this morning.
</P>
<P>
   For the second night in a row, Clemmensen allowed a single goal.
He had 31 saves, including 15 in the third period, as the Sioux
tried to cut into a 2-1 BC lead.
</P>
<P>
   After a scoreless first period, BC built the lead in a fast and
furious second. Senior Chris Masters opened the scoring, banging in
a rebound of a Mike Lephart shot that went off the crossbar for a
power-play goal at 10:26.
</P>
<P>
   North Dakota matched that one at 13:47 when Lee Goren held off
BC defenseman Mike Mottau and beat Clemmensen high, also on the
power play.
</P>
<P>
   BC freshman Jeff Giuliano scored his fifth goal of the year at
17:45 for 2-1 lead. Jeff Farkas, who was everywhere, and defenseman
Brooks Orpik assisted.
</P>
<P>
   The puck popped out front to Giuliano, and he blasted it past
North Dakota goalie Karl Goehring.
</P>
<P>
   ``The coaches had been saying shoot high, over his glove or
blocker, because he had been going down early,'' Giuliano said.
</P>
<P>
   So he did. And got the winner.
</P>
<P>
   Clemmensen and the defense bore down and made the goal stand the
rest of the way. Clemmensen held his ground while the Sioux tried
to jam the puck in at the eight-minute mark of the third. He
stopped David Hoogsteen midway through the period. And slid across
and made a super save on Brad Williamson with two minutes left.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, North Dakota had a chance to pull Goehring with time
running out.
</P>
<P>
   And soon, Brian Gionta pounced on the puck at mid-ice, skated
towards the boards, and fired it into the open net. With 15 seconds
left, BC had sealed the win.
</P>
<P>
   And its trip West. Seconds later the game ended. A couple of red
and yellow streamers _ hey, maroon and gold aren't in heavy supply
around here _ rained down into the rink.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hockey East rules,'' yelled a lone voice in a sparse crowd of
largely North Dakota fans.
</P>
<P>
   For this weekend, it certainly did.
</P>
<P>
   BC, given the toughest draw by being sent here to begin with,
more than did its share.
</P>
<P>
   And did it in a different manner than maybe many expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``We as coaches thought going in it would be a 5-4 type game,''
said BC coach Jerry York. ``It's awfully hard to hold us down as a
team. The same goes for North Dakota. But it was a case of good
pitching in baseball. There was good goaltending on both sides.''
</P>
<P>
   Sioux coach Dean Blais tipped his hat to BC.
</P>
<P>
   When his team got its only goal, he was looking for more.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was expecting a little momentum switch,'' Blais said.
``Usually when we score, we score in bunches. And usually we
generate things in transition.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Eagles, he said, limited that part of the game. And kept
the Sioux forwards from doing damage anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just did not get those opportunities,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And because of it Clemmensen and the Eagles are headed West.
With a couple of their Hockey East rivals.

VENUS WILLIAMS CLAIMS FAMILY FINAL 
</HEADLINE>
 CHAMPIONSHIPS-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KEY BISCAYNE, Fla. _ Not yet, little sister.
</P>
<P>
   Sisterly love was not evident Sunday within the prize ring,
actually a 78-by-36 foot asphalt tennis rectangle baked in high
noon sun, where Venus and Serena Williams threw brutal Sunday
punches at each other for two hours.
</P>
<P>
   Then the historic encounter was over, both still standing,
quickly hugging. Winner and yet champion at The Lipton by a
decision was big sister, Venus, 6-1, 4-6, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
   Female siblings have rivaled throughout the 123 years of the
tournament game. During the early days of the century it was said
in Southern California (where Venus and Serena originated): ``It
takes a Sutton to beat a Sutton.'' All four of them _ May, Violet,
Florence, Ethel _ were nationally prominent, and May, in 1905, was
the first foreigner to win Wimbledon.
</P>
<P>
   But whatever finals embraced them couldn't have enjoyed the
magnitude of Venus and Serena Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Even the last (and only) collision of sisters, the English
Watsons, in a major title bout _ Maud over Lillian at Wimbledon,
1884 _ wouldn't have rippled much beyond London.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the outcome that absorbed a full-house
congregation of 14,000 at Crandon Park plus planetary TV
eavesdroppers, the Williams beat went on. Although little sister
Serena, 17, hit the wall with her 16-match streak, Venus, 18,
extended hers to 10.
</P>
<P>
   It's becoming clear that the initials WTA (Women's Tennis
Association) may soon stand for Williamses Take All.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be more finals for the two of us,'' said Venus, who
stays at No. 6 in the universe, while Serena rises five levels to a
personal zenith of No. 11. But does big sister (3-0 in their
professional faceoffs) give little sister the whammies?
</P>
<P>
   Yes, believes Rick Macci, their coach of early formative teen
years. ``This is an unusual sister relationship, very, very close,
like two peas in a pod. It will be a while before Serena will be
able to fight all-out against Venus. But I think it will happen.''
</P>
<P>
   While this was a much better performance from both kids than the
two previous in 1998, won in straight sets by Venus at the
Australian and Italian Opens, both had sinking spells. And Serena's
came at the worst place, at the wire, after seizing big sister's
serve to get even at 4-4.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went for too much at the end, rushed my shots,'' sighed
Serena, loser of the last 6 points, 8 of the closing 9, 7 of them
on unforcederrors. Her error count unhappily outweighed Venus's,
66-41.
</P>
<P>
   The man who put rackets in their hands when each was 4, papa
Richard Williams, said, ``I think maybe they both focus more
intensely when they play other opponents. They can both play a lot
better. Serena got shaky because Venus ran down so many balls.
Nobody else can do that against her.''
</P>
<P>
   For a while he flashed handwritten signs (like ``Come on,
Serena!'') at TV cameras, but said he then had to leave his seat
``because I worried I was gonna cry. It was going through my mind
all the difficulties of getting out of the ghetto in Compton
(Calif.) and . . . to arrive at this with both my daughters in this
final . . . I could feel the tears coming.''
</P>
<P>
   He frowned at the suggestion that big sister had taken it easy
on beloved little sister just when it seemed the title was hers
with a winning 4-3 lead in the second. Venus faded inexplicably, as
Serena took three games to square it.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've been raised to win, not just be here, and I believe
they will be 1-2 in the world in time. I've always believed that.''
</P>
<P>
   Venus also frowned. ``I just lost it at 4-3. It happens. I don't
let up on anybody. I know how Serena comes back, and I didn't want
to be her victim like Martina Hingis was. It gives me great
satisfaction to have survived her onslaught.''
</P>
<P>
   Good choice of words _ the Sisters Sledgehammer did lay on
onslaughts. ``We try to kill each other,'' Venus said. It looked
that way. Never have two females on a tennis court combined such
awesome power and cheetah-like speed. Only the most severely
bludgeoned balls outdistanced them to become winners.
</P>
<P>
   Little sister and big sister pooh-poohed the psychological
aspect. ``I play the ball, not the opponent. But I've always
dreamed of a day like this,'' said Serena. ``I think you people
(reporters) attached more emotion to it than us. It's a game. We go
home and live life. The competition doesn't affect our
relationship. Family comes first.
</P>
<P>
   Ditto, pretty much for Venus, although, ``Of course I know it's
my sister over there. We've played so many times. We know what the
other's gonna do.''
</P>
<P>
   So do we, now that these relatively inexperienced phenoms are
leaning on the tour inexorably, stylish stormers reaching for the
top. Little sister's time will come, too.

RECRUITING TAKES ALL-AROUND SKILL 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ Jim Calhoun sat proudly on the podium
facing the national media for the off-day NCAA championship game
press conference Sunday. Seated to his immediate left were young
men _ the ``student-athletes'' as the NCAA insists they be called _
from Katy, Texas, (Jake Voskuhl); Augusta, Ga., (Ricky Moore);
Coatesville, Pa., (Richard Hamilton); Springfield, Mass., (Kevin
Freeman, who made a senior-year stop at Paterson, N.J.); and
Minneapolis (Khalid El-Amin).
</P>
<P>
   In other words, this was not Art Quimby's kind of UConn Huskies.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the first Eisenhower Administration, when young Mr.
Quimby twice was leading the nation by routinely hauling in more
than 20 rebounds a game, the Connecticut Huskies were like some
Appalachian families; i.e. seriously inbred. Connecticut basketball
pretty much meant just that, and if it had any remotely broader
scope, it meant New York or New Jersey. In Quimby's sophomore year
of 1952-53, for example, he was one of 12 Connecticut high school
products. The other three members of the team came from Brooklyn,
Yonkers, and Belmont, Mass. Throughout the 60s, 70s, and early 80s,
the Huskies really were Connecticut's team.
</P>
<P>
   There are many reasons why Calhoun will be taking a 33-2 UConn
team into Monday night's championship game against Duke (37-1), but
foremost among them is the fact that he has a true national
program. The typical Husky no longer comes from New Haven,
Hartford, Bridgeport, Waterbury, or, like Art Quimby, New London.
In the Calhoun era a Husky can come from South Carolina (Ray
Allen), Arizona (Brian Fair), Federal City, Wash., (Donny
Marshall), Los Angeles (Kevin Ollie), or Sandy, Utah (Travis
Knight). If a Chris Smith (Bridgeport) or Scott Burrell (Hamden) or
Edmund Saunders (Waterbury) wants to come, that's great, too.
Calhoun always will solicit the very best the Nutmeg State has to
offer. But he never will make the mistake of depending on it,
unless getting a National Invitation Tournament invitation is the
new goal of the UConn athletic program.
</P>
<P>
   Dom Perno, Calhoun's predecessor, already had figured things
out. He brought in such out-of-staters as Tim Coles (Baltimore) and
Ray Braxton (Daytona Beach), and his 1985 recruiting class featured
Jeff King (Lansing, Mich.), Eddie Williams (Magnolia, N.C.), and
future NBA mainstay Cliff Robinson (Buffalo). But he never got to
reap the benefits.
</P>
<P>
   When Calhoun coached at Northeastern, his idea of exotic
recruiting was to establish strong ties in Pittsburgh and the
Washington D.C./Baltimore areas. You didn't see Sun Belt kids
flocking to Huntington Ave. Arriving at Storrs in 1986, he knew
he'd have to broaden his recruiting horizons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say to (former assistant coach) Howie Dickenman, `Who are
we involved with?' and he'd tell me it was the sixth-best kid in
New Jersey, the seventh-best kid in New York, or the 10th-best kid
in Philadelphia. I said, `Men, we're sure going to have to coach
'em up a lot.' ''
</P>
<P>
   So the decision was made: UConn was going to start competing for
the best kids, period. But what exactly did UConn have to offer?
Calhoun wouldn't have had the job if anything good was going on in
Storrs (50-62 the four previous seasons).
</P>
<P>
   ``We said, a) we will go after the best athletes we can get and
b) we will sell the Big East first and UConn second,'' Calhoun
reveals. ``We'd say, `Would you like to play against Alonzo
Mourning? Would you like to play in the Carrier Dome?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Calhoun bagged a 6-foot-5-inch defensive specialist he still
raves about by the name of Lyman DePriest out of Detroit in 1987.
He got Rod Sellers from Florence, S.C., the following year. He went
international with Israel's Nadav Henefeld in '89 (along with
in-state bonanzas Smith and Burrell).
</P>
<P>
   The huge breakthrough came in 1991. Jim Calhoun, the kid whose
own game had been honed at French's Common in Braintree and who had
been the King of Huntington Ave. for 14 years, injected himself
forever into the national picture with a colossal six-man
recruiting class consisting of Ollie, Fair, Donny Marshall, Donyell
Marshall (Reading, Pa.), Rudy Johnson (Jacksonville), and Natambu
Willingham (Atlanta). Little ol' Storrs was now a place with true
cachet.
</P>
<P>
   Ollie was said to be the Player of the Year in LA and Fair was
the equivalent guy in Arizona, but the key player in this group,
according to Calhoun was Donyell Marshall, a 6-8 seriously big-time
All-American. ``Getting him gave us true national credibility,''
Calhoun maintains.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, the mentor knows whereof he speaks. ``I never
thought of Connecticut until Donyell Marshall went there,'' says
Hamilton, the feathery 6-6 scoring machine whose 24 points on
Saturday helped send Ohio State home. ``He lived about 20 or 30
minutes from my house in Coatesville, and I saw that if he could
fit in there and be happy, I could, too. I thought if I had the
opportunity I could go there, too.''
</P>
<P>
   The greatest X and O men still need players. The greatest
motivators still need players. No one is more acutely aware of this
than Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski, whose own talent core includes
kids from Georgia (William Avery), Alaska (Trajan Langdon), New
York (Elton Brand), Michigan (Shane Battier), Missouri (Chris
Carrawell), Illinois (Corey Maggette), California (Chris Burgess),
Washington, D.C. (Nate James), and New Mexico (Taymon Domzalski).
</P>
<P>
   You gotta do what you gotta do _ within the rules, of course.
``Coach K would fly 3,000 miles to see me in a pickup game,''
recalls ESPN commentator Jay Bilas (Duke '86), a Los Angeles native
and member of Coach K's first great Blue Devil recruiting class.
``I can still see him sitting on the steps of one of those portable
classrooms watching us on our outdoor court,'' he says. ``Of
course, now he wouldn't do that. If it were still legal, he'd send
an assistant.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Calhoun, I'm sure, would go himself. I mean, Coach K already
has won two national titles.

REVOLUTION BEGIN WITH SHOOTOUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. _ Walter Zenga still seems to have his
magic touch. Zenga stopped a penalty kick and stifled the Miami
Fusion for 88 minutes before Tyrone Marshall's goal spoiled the
Revolution's Major League Soccer season-opener Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The score finished 1-1 in regulation time, and the Fusion won
the shootout, 4-3, to earn their first point in two games. The
Revolution, who concluded last season with four shutouts in their
final six games under Zenga's coaching, visit Kansas City Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Zenga, returning as player-coach after a year of retirement from
goalkeeping, had his team prepared, and the Revolution's Giovanni
Savarese set a league record with a goal 22 seconds after the
opening kickoff.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution continued to threaten offensively in the first
half, but by the second half had retreated into a defensive mode,
eventually succumbing to the Fusion's pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the end of the world but it would have been better to
start with 3 points,'' Zenga said. ``I feel good about myself and
how the team played in front of me. We know our problems and we
will work to improve.''
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution displayed a compact defensive scheme, impeding
the effectiveness of Fusion fullbacks Mario Gori and Jay Heaps, and
using former Fusion midfielder Kris Kelderman to shadow Carlos
Valderrama. They showed that they will emphasize defense, but
judging by the speed of the opening goal, will try not to ignore
offense.
</P>
<P>
   Zenga noted that the formation included two strikers, along with
Joe-Max Moore, whose role was intended to be a withdrawn striker.
And pressure by the Revolution led to a misplay by Heaps on the
edge of the penalty area that Moore pilfered and shot off the left
post. Savarese roofed the rebound into the far right corner of the
net for his 42d MLS goal.
</P>
<P>
   But the Revolution failed to generate attacks from midfield
after the opening minutes, and their second-half counterattack
attempts failed, despite the addition of forward Carlos Rocha, who
was cautioned for dissent by referee Noel Kenny in the 82d minute.
</P>
<P>
   Fusion coach Ivo Wortmann made two key substitutions in the
second half, adding Tyrone Marshall and Nelson Vargas, as Miami's
sense of urgency increased. Vargas added a dimension of creativity
and, along with Valderrama and Henry Gutierrez, helped Miami
dominate midfield possession.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, after the Revolution's Richard Goulooze surrendered a
penalty in a clash with Diego Serna in the 81st minute, Vargas
squandered the penalty kick. Then, the Revolution seemed destined
to win, as Zenga's save climaxed a spectacular performance in his
first competitive game since October, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Zenga had stopped Vargas twice in the opening minutes of the
second half, and midway through the half had stymied Marshall from
point-blank range, and collected Carlos Parra's point-blank
rebound.
</P>
<P>
   But with four minutes remaining in a 92-minute contest, the
Revolution failed to clear a corner, and Valderrama chipped to the
far post, where both Gori and Marshall were unmarked, and Marshall
tapped a header inside the post.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution, playing without three starters _ Imad Baba
(groin), Edwin Gorter (suspended), and John Harkes (knee) _ went
into a defensive formation after defender Brian Dunseth replaced
Johnny Torres seven minutes into the second half and Mike Burns
moved into midfield.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy could be justified, since this was the Revolution's
opening match and the team needed to boost morale after a
disastrous 1998 season. And it might have succeeded, but the
85-degree heat and the size of one of the country's best playing
surfaces were to Miami's advantage. And, after Jair suffered an
ankle injury after being taken down from behind by Gutierrez in the
72d minute, the Revolution's midfield creativity diminished.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Italy, we would say that a tie was the right result,''
Zenga said.

FORMER STAR IS NOW BIRD OF PREY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Some things do change. Whoever thought you'd see the
day when Larry Bird showed up for a game wearing lavender?
</P>
<P>
   The way things are going for his former franchise, he could show
up in Boston wearing an Old Navy ensemble, cargo pants, or one of
those hideous golf shirts (``they're free!'') he used to wear and
it wouldn't matter. Beating the Celtics is a requirement if you
play for the Pacers. The alternative is, well, still unknown
because Bird is now 6-0 against the team that let him slip away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boston is a must win for us,'' Reggie Miller said after the
Pacers had executed an efficient 101-93 decision over the Celtics
Sunday. ``We know that. It's the Finals, Game 7, you name it. We're
no fools. I know that someday they're going to beat us, but I just
hope that comes when I'm retired and he's not coaching anymore.
He's not a man of many words, but I can just imagine what he'd
say.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's game was a lot like the previous five with Bird's boys,
games that were decided by 6, 4, 7, 7, and 3 points. The Celtics
always seem to play Indiana hard, and to the end, but the result is
the same. That's Indiana's persona.
</P>
<P>
   Of the Pacers' 20 wins, almost half _ nine _ are by 5 or fewer
points. Thirteen are by 8 points or fewer, including both Celtics
conquests. They don't really have that blowout mentality, only two
of their wins have been by 15 or more, which should make them an
NBC favorite because they retain viewers. (The Celtics, by
contrast, have won games by 32 and 34 points.)
</P>
<P>
   Bird, of course, makes no pretense about how much he enjoys
sticking it to the team he once led and carried. They thought
enough of him to go out and court potential head coaches. They
didn't think enough of him to turn the whole enterprise over to him
and let him run it. We had M.L. Carr for that.
</P>
<P>
   All he's done since leaving town is preside over an Indiana
resurgence. The Pacers were within one jump ball of the NBA Finals
last year. This year, picked as the favorite and expected to win,
they are doing just that. They are 20-8 and battling Miami and
Orlando for Eastern Conference muscle-flexing rights.
</P>
<P>
   And Bird? He is 78-32 as a head coach. The six Ws against the
Celtics are easily the sweetest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never want to lose to anybody _ especially those guys,'' he
said. Asked later how it felt to be 6-0 against Pitino, he said,
``I don't care who's coaching that team. I just want to beat
them.''
</P>
<P>
   He still insists he'd have trouble if the Celtics were playing
in the Garden. That was his place and there are too many musty
memories, too many things he could identify with, like obstructed
view seats, the 1920s locker rooms, the lack of air conditioning,
the smell of circus animals, the exit ramp that always looked like
it was going to collapse. They paved paradise and put in a parking
lot is what Joni Mitchell once wrote. That's how Bird felt.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough coming back here,'' he said. ``Thank God I'm in
this building. I honestly think that if the Boston Garden was still
standing, I wouldn't want to go in there and coach in that
building.''
</P>
<P>
   He sensed trouble for this one. He arrived in town after a good
win in New Jersey and picked up all the turmoil talk surrounding
the Celtics. He and eight of his closest friends dined in the North
End Saturday, but there were no visits to Clarke's or any of his
former hangouts. He's almost boring these days (lavender?) although
he did get a good yuk when he said that Rick Robey was his mentor
as a rookie.
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics, meanwhile, finally had gotten a road win in
Philadelphia. They are more athletic than Indiana, they press, they
were hungry, and with national television and the Pacers as the
opponent, well, you get the picture.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we'd be in for a bloodbath,'' Bird said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he was concerned about all the extracurricular stuff
going on with the Celtics, Bird said he was. He talked it over with
his team. He needn't have bothered. By now, his players know that
there are some select regular-season games that matter to their
coach, like the ones where he gets a five-minute standing ovation
and fans still chant his name.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big thing. We all know how much this means to him,''
Jalen Rose said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's so much hype over these games,'' Miller said, ``but
we're the ones out there playing. As it is, we have to come here
one more time. That's scary enough.''
</P>
<P>
   That would be Patriots Day, Reg. The little guys won that day.
Just make sure Bird doesn't show up wearing a red coat.

PIERCE PERKS UP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE BURRIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It happens all too often in the NBA. A newcomer gets
off to an exceptional start, making himself an early candidate for
rookie of the year. Then comes the initial setback: Perhaps the
folks who make a living discovering players' weaknesses target his.
Or maybe it's an injury, or a slump, or something that damages his
confidence. How the young player responds will determine whether he
has a solid future for the season or if he's merely a one-month
wonder.
</P>
<P>
   Celtics rookie Paul Pierce is trying to overcome a March filled
with setbacks, which followed a February in which he earned rookie
of the month honors and was considered among the leading candidates
for rookie of the year.
</P>
<P>
   In Boston's 101-93 loss to Indiana Sunday, Pierce had his best
game in weeks, scoring 18 points on 5-for-11 shooting in helping
the Celtics stay close before the Pacers pulled away down the
stretch.
</P>
<P>
   Pierce Sunday scored more points in the second half (12) than
any of his single-game totals over the previous five contests.
</P>
<P>
   He had a team-high 9 points in the third quarter to help the
Celtics, who trailed, 51-42, at halftime, pull within 3 before
trailing after the third, 79-74.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the last five to six games, I haven't been aggressive on
offense. Hopefully, I can get back in the right direction now,''
said Pierce. ``(Sunday) was the best I've played for a while.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I play aggressively, I play better on the offensive end
and the defensive end. Finally, I scored in the second half. I
looked at the past two or three games and I didn't even score in
the second half.''
</P>
<P>
   Pierce entered Sunday's contest tops among NBA rookies in
rebounding, second in points per game, steals, and 3-point field
goal percentage, and third in blocked shots. His averages of 20.4
points, 7.1 rebounds, and 2.7 steals in February earned him rookie
of the month honors.
</P>
<P>
   Then came March 1, when Pierce missed two free throws in the
closing seconds of Boston's 99-97 loss to New Jersey. Though he
Sunday denied reports coach Rick Pitino criticized him for costing
the team the game, Pierce did admit the misfires damaged his
confidence.
</P>
<P>
   On March 9, against Charlotte, he sprained his right ankle in
the first half and did not return. He missed the next two games. In
his return from the injury, Pierce scored 15 points on 5-for-8
shooting against Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   But then he began struggling. He said since the ankle injury, he
has been reticent to drive to the hoop and added the opposition is
working harder to shut down his game, playing him more aggressively
and often double-teaming him.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday that wasn't a problem. Over the last 3:17 of the third
quarter, Pierce scored 6 points _ a 2-foot jumper and four free
throws. Pierce's other 3 points in the quarter came on a 3-foot
jumper and a free throw. Against tougher defenses, he spent the
quarter attacking the glass and either got a basket or went to the
line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still trying to get my head back to where it was at the
beginning of the season,'' said Pierce, who said the ankle is no
longer a problem. ``I've been looking at tape, and I see a lot of
things I do offensively.
</P>
<P>
   ``Defenses are picking up on me on my drives. On my first step,
I'm seeing a lot of double-teams and they're really coming at me.
When I dribble into the middle, I can see another guy running at me
and a post man getting down getting ready to block shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a game of adjustments, and if I can adjust and recognize
that, and find my open teammates and swing the ball and do the
little things to help this team win, I can be successful.''
</P>
<P>
   Pierce said he believes the adjustments will make him a smarter
player, one who could last after other newcomers have faded. ``I
know teams aren't going to give me the same thing they gave me the
last game, and I have to recognize that and adjust to it,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a learning process for me. I think I'm going to be in
this league a long time, so it's something I have to adjust to,
especially during the first couple of years.''

SOX' TROT IS HOT TO SUCCEED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT MYERS, Fla. _ He was so upset when he popped out against
the kids from Boston College _ in the second exhibition of spring _
that he marched through the clubhouse and went straight to the
weight room.
</P>
<P>
   Jimy Williams has called him in for a soothing chat. So has
bench coach Grady Little. His dad called from home, with some tips
on what he was doing wrong at the plate. So did his brother. The
guys he played with at Pawtucket, Donnie Sadler and Lou Merloni,
they weighed in, too. That's in addition to the daily sessions with
Jim Rice, the batting coach.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the day John Valentin pulled him aside and said
that if he doesn't start to take it a little easier, it will be a
long season.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm so much of a doggone perfectionist,'' Trot Nixon said
Sunday, ``it will be a long season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to get a hit on every at-bat. I want to make every
play.''
</P>
<P>
   A week from Monday, the Red Sox season begins in earnest, as
they like to say in the sports pages. Nixon, rookie right fielder,
hardly will notice the difference. A practice game in Florida in
March, Opening Day in Kansas City in April, a game of Wiffle Ball
in the backyard with his wife, Kathryn. It's pretty much all the
same to Nixon, the 24-year-old North Carolinian bent on proving to
God, family, and Red Sox Nation that he has earned the right to be
here.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a good player,'' Williams said Sunday. ``He knows we like
him. He's doing fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Nixon had a nice game in Sunday's 9-8 win over the Minnesota
Twins. A single over the second baseman's head to drive in a run in
the second. A hit-and-run single through the vacated left side in a
textbook three-run fourth inning. A lovely bunt to move the runners
over in a four-run sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Satisfied with his afternoon? ``If I hadn't gotten that bunt
down, I would have been upset with myself,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Which would have placed him right back where he was last week,
when he was in the midst of a 1-for-19 slide that had dropped his
average to .205 entering the weekend. Until Sunday, Nixon had
collected as many as two hits in a game just once this spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``A week ago,'' he said, ``I wasn't feeling comfortable at all.
I was doing a lot of thinking about what I was doing wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon enough he figured it out, with the help of family, friends,
and Rice. ``I was falling back, instead of shifting my weight
forward,'' he said. ``I'd start forward, then go back.'' The effect
was to produce an awkward uppercut that wasn't producing the home
runs Nixon was trying to hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were few times,'' he said, ``that I wanted to jack the
ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Rice finally suggested that Nixon slide his hands about an inch
up the handle of his 35-inch, 32-ounce bat. ``Stupid me, that I
didn't think of it myself,'' Nixon said. ``When I was going bad in
Pawtucket in '97, I choked up, and it turned my whole season
around.''
</P>
<P>
   He'll leave the hands up, he said, until he is satisfied that
he's back to swinging down on the ball, generating line drives.
``Then I'll slide my hands back, so I can use all 35 inches,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon has found ways to contribute even when he wasn't hitting.
He made a diving catch here after a long run to the foul line last
week, and Friday in Port Charlotte scored from second base on a
sacrifice fly, a rare feat.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be times when he struggles,'' general manager Dan
Duquette said that day in Port Charlotte. ``All rookies do. But
he's making the adjustments. He's going to help our team.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if Nixon might be the last person to believe that. His
locker here is adorned with handwritten signs, which feature the
liberal use of exclamation points. Dare to Be Great! says one.
Don't Give Away Any At-Bats! says another. And a third: It's Time
to Make Baseball More Important Than Your Workouts! Get Focused!!
Have a Nice Day!!
</P>
<P>
   The signs come courtesy of Rich Zawacki, the team's physical
therapist. It started out as fooling around, Nixon said. It has
come to mean more. He knows now where he can go when he needs a
pick-me-up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to contribute,'' he said. ``I want the guys on this
team to say, `He can hit.' I don't want to go up there in a
pressure situation and guys thinking, `Oh, no. Game's over.' ''
</P>
<P>
   He knows that in baseball, especially, where failure is
built-in, to impose such unrelenting pressure on himself can be
highly flammable. Yet at the same time, it's what has driven him to
reach the level he has.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can change it,'' he said. ``But I can't change it all the
time.''
</P>
<P>
   The struggles he endured in the minors have made him more
accepting of setbacks, he said. ``It helped me learn how to deal
with it,'' he said, ``but I wish I didn't have to deal with so much
of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``At times, when I was hitting .230, .240., .250, I questioned
myself. There's no way I can be this bad. I wasn't having fun.''
</P>
<P>
   For Nixon, the fun comes only in excelling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to prove myself every day,'' he said. ``Not just to
these guys, but to prove I can play.''

IT'S LIKE, NO WAY: GALLERIA'S CLOSING MARKS DEMISE OF '80s TEEN(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY STEVE CARNEY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Once a sacred temple of consumer culture and known
worldwide as the ultimate teen hangout, the Sherman Oaks Galleria
is now vacant as a stereotypical Valley girl.
</P>
<P>
   The storied shopping mall will close Thursday, the victim of
changing tastes, troublesome parking and the 1994 Northridge
Earthquake. But like the trendy teens who once prowled its
boutiques, the Galleria is growing up.
</P>
<P>
   It will reopen in November 2000 as an office complex teamed with
a collection of upscale shops and restaurants, with an outdoor
plaza and fountain at the entrance.
</P>
<P>
   No department stores, no food court, no video-game arcade.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a monument to the Valley is coming down,'' said
Martha Coolidge, who in 1983 directed the movie ``Valley Girl,''
which featured the mall prominently. ``It makes me sad, because it
is sort of a California cultural monument. Everyone in the country
knew what the Galleria was.''
</P>
<P>
   Trouble is, it was the folks in suburban Sherman Oaks who had to
live with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one wants to see a white elephant in their community,''
said Richard H. Close, president of the Sherman Oaks Homeowners
Association. ``This reconfiguration will take something that's sort
of an embarrassment and turn it into a jewel of the community.''
</P>
<P>
   Mee Lee, vice president of Douglas, Emmett &AMP; Co., the developer
that bought the mall in 1997, said the Garden Office Building in
front of the mall will be scaled back, and a pedestrian plaza built
on the corner.
</P>
<P>
   She said the renovation will add office space and cut back on
retail but improve the caliber of the shops and eateries. Mainly,
though, it will open up the complex to lure people walking off the
street.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now it's sort of a closed-in box,'' she said. ``It
wasn't very inviting for people to come in.''
</P>
<P>
   She said they want the new Galleria _ yes, the name will remain
_ to be a place where families can come on the weekends, or where
office workers can stay after 5 p.m., to have a nice dinner and
catch a movie.
</P>
<P>
   What used to be a Robinsons-May store at the north end of the
mall will become offices with high ceilings. The south end will
have restaurants and shops. The cinema will expand from five to 16
screens.
</P>
<P>
   And though Lee said she couldn't discuss specific businesses
that might come to the new Galleria, she said residents have asked
for shops like Crate &AMP; Barrel and restaurants like the Cheesecake
Factory.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're making an investment in the community, because we're
hoping to stay there a long, long time,'' she said. ``There are
some people who may be nostalgic, but we have a lot more people
excited about what it's going to be.''
</P>
<P>
   The Galleria no longer wants to be a haven for teen-agers, but
ironically hopes to lure the same kids who went there in its heyday
in the early 1980s. Those kids are now 25 and older, with families,
disposable incomes and jobs in the neighboring office towers.
</P>
<P>
   April Carter, 27, works as an assistant down the street at LMNO
Productions. She said she and her friends in high school considered
themselves Valley Girls, even though they lived in Alhambra, eight
miles east of downtown. And the Galleria was their weekend hangout.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of, like, hard to believe it's been around so
long,'' said Carter, who lives in Los Angeles now. ``It's hard to
believe it's, like, really closing.''
</P>
<P>
   After it opened in October 1980, the Galleria starred in
``Valley Girl'' and in ``Fast Times at Ridgemont High,'' was
mentioned in the Frank and Moon Zappa song, ``Valley Girl,'' and in
various ``Saturday Night Live'' skits.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was kind of an innocent and almost naive place. It's so
funny how fast it became quaint,'' said Cameron Crowe, who wrote
``Fast Times at Ridgemont High.'' ``Pop culture moves so fast it
became a sweet little ghost town.''
</P>
<P>
   In the '80s, the rest of the country emulated the
style-conscious teens who crowded the Galleria's walkways, playing
Pac-Man, wedging themselves into Sergio Valente jeans, sporting
spiked or feathered hair, peppering their sentences with ``fer
sure'' and ``omigod.''
</P>
<P>
   Crowe said the mall, any mall, was a place where kids could work
_ in the shops and fast-food outlets, where they could spend their
money _ on records and clothes, and where they could meet each
other and socialize.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he said, teens have more options and can meet at cafes,
all-ages nightclubs, even online. Who needs the Galleria?
</P>
<P>
   ``It got caught being a minute behind the times. There are more
groovy, more elegant places to go mall shopping,'' Crowe said.
``Maybe it was meant to be disposable. It's not like Mozart
composed there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I suppose it's the vagaries of competition,'' said Alexander
Moore, a University of Southern California anthropology professor
who has studied pop culture and shopping malls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Icons pass. Look at Bullock's Wilshire,'' Moore said,
referring to the downtown department store, a Los Angeles landmark
that closed in 1994 after 65 years. ``It shows how ephemeral our
culture is.''

BRUINS ARE INTO SELF-HELP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY L. MARRAPESE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Before their game even started against the Maple Leafs
in Toronto Saturday night, the Bruins already knew that the New
York Rangers had been defeated by the Philadelphia Flyers, further
dimming the league's chances for a Manhattan entry come the start
of the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   Even though this is the time of year for scoreboard watching,
with the Bruins having 10 games remaining, Boston players say they
don't care what the Rangers or Florida Panthers are doing, though
it's impossible not to be tempted to look up at the out-of-town
results. The bottom line is if the Rangers or Panthers are going to
get in, they need help from others. Boston, in sole possession of
the eighth and final Eastern Conference spot, only has to help
itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's one thing I don't like to do is look to see if the
Rangers lose,'' said defenseman Kyle McLaren. ``I like to win
ourselves and take care of things. When (coach Pat Burns) said the
Rangers lost, guys wanted to win. Guys always want to win and it
gives a little more incentive to win and push more in front of
them.''
</P>
<P>
   That incentive was certainly evident for the first 52 of the 60
minutes of regulation against Toronto. The Bruins had built a 2-0
lead with stifling defense and opportunistic offense and looked on
track to play a nearly flawless road game. But the wheels fell off
in the third and Boston had to settle for a 2-2 tie.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second consecutive deadlock for Boston and what made
it most aggravating is that the Bruins gave up leads late in the
game. They were ahead, 3-2, Thursday against the Blackhawks in the
third period but Chicago tied it with 1:24 left in regulation. The
Bruins had a two-goal lead against the Maple Leafs heading into the
third. After surrendering a goal with 7:18 left, they couldn't hang
on and watched the lead evaporate with just under a minute left as
the Leafs pulled goalie Curtis Joseph for an extra attacker.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to be disappointed with the point we lost but I'm
satisfied with the point we got,'' said Burns. ``On their tying
goal, we can't puck-watch. Everybody was puck-watching, but they're
young, they're going to make mistakes like that. We have to live
with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Forward Steve Heinze said what was most frustrating was just how
close the Bruins came not only to a victory but to a shutout of the
highest-scoring team in the league. Once the Leafs got a sniff that
they could come back, they did with a vengeance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did it all by the book, all the way everyone was supposed
to play,'' said Heinze. ``Chipping it in, chipping it out. Simple
stuff, patient. Then it just wasn't our game in the third period.
We pride ourselves on not giving away leads and that's exactly what
we did.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every point is huge for us right now, but that's a sour way to
tie a team like that when you have them down by two. It's like
you've got them so frustrated and they're thinking, `We can't
score, we can't score' and then it's `Oh, geez, we got one. We can
score.' It gives them a little boost, puts us back on our heels, we
tighten up, and they took it to us and got that second one.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins, who had Sunday off, finished playing five games in
eight days, a tall order. But the good news is they finished
unbeaten in that span with a record of 2-0-3, earning 7 of a
possible 10 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to win, we need to win,'' said McLaren. ``We need
points at this time of year. It doesn't matter to me what other
teams do, it might matter to some guys to get them going. But we
need points no matter what. We're not going to change our style if
they lose or win.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't be looking that there are 10 games left. We want to
do it now, in the next five games, and make sure.''
</P>
<P>
   Heinze, and many of his teammates, said the
five-games-in-eight-nights excuse doesn't hold any water in terms
of explaining why they finished the way they did the last two
games.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Leafs played the night before and got home late,'' he
said. ``I think we're in pretty good shape as a team. We have
pretty tough practices that keep us on our toes. Conditioning
shouldn't be a factor. If anything, we should outplay teams in the
third period.''
</P>
<P>
   McLaren said he thought it was less the Bruins collapsing in the
final seven-plus minutes and more the fact that Toronto turned up
the heat after the club was able to score its first one.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're a good team, I give them credit for battling back and
coming on strong,'' he said. ``I think our guys played a hell of a
game. We played our system to a T for 50 minutes. The puck was
bouncing our way, and for the last 10 it wasn't, and those are the
breaks sometimes you get. Any time you have a 2-0 lead on any team,
you want to close the door and take the 2 points home. Guys are a
little bit disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, it's disappointing to get a 2-2 tie but it's a point and
it moves us up a little bit.''

<P>
   For the Galleria, the fatal blow came from the Northridge
Earthquake in January 1994, which closed the mall for 11 days. Its
anchor department store, Robinsons-May, didn't reopen until July,
and seismic retrofitting at the mall deterred nervous customers.
</P>
<P>
   Less than three years ago, the mall still had 90 shops, a
five-screen movie theater and a Robinsons-May at both ends. But as
shoppers went elsewhere, so did the businesses _ vanishing one by
one until the exodus became a stampede.
</P>
<P>
   Today only one store remains _ a card and gift shop on the third
floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember when I first came to America in 1985, I used to
come to this mall,'' said Jack Lodhia, co-owner of the lonely
Nicole's Hallmark. ``It was all carpeted, beautiful. I walked in, I
went, ooh. It was real fancy, a beautiful mall.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the rest of the tri-level shopping center is eerily quiet,
with only the comforting hum of the air conditioning overhead. Of
course it's cranked to the max.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of sad,'' said Anna Castillo, 30, of nearby Burbank,
who said she grew up at the Galleria. ``I was totally the Valley
Girl.''
</P>
<P>
   Castillo, who also works at LMNO Productions, said she and her
friends would spend weekends doing ``the typical girl things to do
_ hang out, shop, look for boys, buy shoes, go have Hot Dog on a
Stick.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bummer. Well, there goes the Sherman Oaks Galleria.''

DUVALS HISTORIC TWOSOME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE CONCANNON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PONTE VEDRA BEACH, Fla. _ They reside in Duval County, which
encompasses the nearby city of Jacksonville, but Sunday they could
claim they did what they did for all of golf in the Sunshine State.
Bob Duval won the PGA Senior Tour's Emerald Coast Classic in
Pensacola, and son David followed the lead to win The Players
Championship.
</P>
<P>
   He did it with a heroic finish on the final two holes at the TPC
at Sawgrass, knocking his tee shot on the par-3 island hole to 6
feet and fluffing a wedge shot from the back of the green on the
18th to within 1 foot to lock up a two-shot victory over Scott Gump
with the highest winning score (73_285) since the tournament moved
here 17 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The double victory was the first time a father and a son won on
the same weekend. Dave Stockton Sr. and son Dave nearly did it four
years ago. The father won that Sunday in the Senior TPC
Championship at the TPC of Michigan, and son Dave finished tied for
second in the Greater Hartford Open. This time it happened on a
course where a teenage David Duval watched the tournaments and
dreamed his dreams.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's only a couple of events I'd rather win,'' said Duval,
who finished at 3 under par and climbed to the No. 1 world ranking
over Tiger Woods with his 10th win in the last 18 months on the PGA
Tour, and third win this season. Duval closed with a remarkable 59
to win the Bob Hope Classic Jan. 24.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is turning into a dream year already,'' said Duval, ``and
it's only March.''
</P>
<P>
   This was the conclusion of an arduous weekend in a competition
that included 49 of the top 50 players in the world rankings. It
was a test of survival with Saturday winds, rock-hard greens, and
difficult rough around the greens that had players grumbling. Fred
Couples shot the low round of the day (68) and vaulted from a tie
for 40th into a tie for fourth. Nick Price (73_288) was solo third.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was survival of the fittest,'' said Gump, whose 71_287 was
one of just five rounds below par-72. He was in contention until he
saw his 8-iron shot on the par-3 17th go into the water. He revived
with a 5-iron to 15 feet on the 18th to set up a birdie and
squarely put the pressure on Duval, who had the 17th and 18th holes
left to play.
</P>
<P>
   The wedge Duval hit on the 17th was the shot of the tournament.
It settled within 6 feet of the pin, and he made it. The tee shot
was so demanding, Duval said he remembered the year Price won and
just walked up to the shot and hit it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just walked up, grabbed his club, and hit it,'' said Duval.
``I kept that in mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Duval's birdie at 17 gave him a two-shot lead and all he had to
do was stay away from the water that cuts into the fairway on the
left side of the green at 18. Duval's tee shot kicked into the
light cut of rough, his second shot rolled off the back side of the
green, and he hit a soft, lofted wedge to within 1 foot to the
roars of the partisan crowd cheering for the neighborhood kid.
</P>
<P>
   It was Duval's to win or lose, and as he played out the 14th
hole to the first of two consecutive bogeys, somebody informed him
his father had won the Emerald Coast Classic. Now it was the son's
turn to perform on the First Coast.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to him last night,'' said Duval, ``and I told him not
to think about winning. You're going to think about that tomorrow
so don't waste energy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been coming to this tournament for years. I've played in
it five times. I was born and raised in Jacksonville. We moved out
to the beach when I was a junior in high school. I've been here as
a spectator for 15 years, and my dad used to work in the scoring
tents. I'd always have a hat for him, and he'd have the players
sign it when they finished with the scorecards. I dreamt about
winning it, but I don't know if I ever thought I was going to win
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Duval won because he survived, holing out from a trap on the
par-4 ninth to set things in motion after missing the green on the
par-3 eighth and making a bogey.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started out a little tentative,'' he said after yanking his
first two tee shots to the left and starting out with a bogey. ``I
said, `I have two options. I just said it's time to play golf and
let's go and see what happens.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The $900,000 first-prize money lifted his earnings for the year
to more than $2.1 million and he became No. 1 on the world list
after Woods held the ranking for the last 41 weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew starting out that if I made 18 pars I'd win for sure,''
said Duval who at one point Saturday led by five shots before the
severity of the course set in.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were nerves all day, but I think you just learn to know
what they feel like and accept them and move on.''

   SAN JOSE, Calif. _ Quite often, even a veteran actor or actress
can come a little unraveled when the curtain goes up.
</P>
<P>
   No. 1 Purdue, in its first trip to an NCAA Tournament
championship, can empathize.
</P>
<P>
   After playing tentatively and being unable to put the ball in
the basket through the first 20 minutes, the Boilermakers were
taking curtain calls Sunday night after a 62-45 victory over the
Duke Blue Devils.
</P>
<P>
   They had rebounded from the most dismal performance in a half in
the 17-year-old tournament to claim the first NCAA women's title
for the Big Ten.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and Purdue accomplished that feat playing the final 4:01
without its star player, All-American Stephanie White-McCarty.
</P>
<P>
   The senior from West Lebanon, Ind., was helped off the floor
after spraining her left ankle during a fight for a rebound under
the Purdue basket. She left on crutches after the game but paused
before leaving San Jose Arena long enough to express joy over
finishing her collegiate career a winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're just really excited,'' she said. ``I'm so happy
for this team. We've come so far. Everybody just stepped up. And
Ukari (Figgs) carried us.''
</P>
<P>
   Figgs, who had only four points during a first half in which the
Boilermakers shot 28.6 percent and scored a tournament-record-low
17 points, broke out for 14 points in the second half as Purdue
outscored Duke 45-23.
</P>
<P>
   Figgs, who had 24 points in a 77-63 semifinal win over Louisiana
Tech on Friday, was named the Most Outstanding Player of the Final
Four.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew in the first half I was tentative going to the
basket,'' she said. ``I was settling for outside shots. But I came
out more aggressively in the second half because I just wanted us
to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Figgs and White-McCarty have become close friends over the past
three years. With her chum sitting on the sideline nursing the
ankle sprain, Figgs went over during a timeout and delivered a
short inspirational speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just told her, `We've been through this before. I'm just
going to go out and put everything on the line for us,''' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Sunday's victory came on the same arena floor where
the Boilermakers (34-1) suffered their only defeat, 73-72 to
Stanford in mid-November.
</P>
<P>
   Purdue might not have gotten to the winner's circle had it not
been for Figgs, Katie Douglas (13 points, five rebounds) and a
solid defensive effort that held Duke in check.
</P>
<P>
   But sophomore center Camille Cooper's steady play was crucial.
</P>
<P>
   ``Camille played very big for us,'' said Figgs. ``She knew she
had a big assignment going up against (6-6) Michele VanGorp, a
sophomore going against an All-American. But she played well for
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooper was 5-for-9 for the night and had 13 points, seven
rebounds and a blocked shot.
</P>
<P>
   As might have been expected, the Blue Devils were on the
opposite end of the emotional spectrum from the Boilermakers by the
end of the night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very disappointed for our team,'' said Duke coach Gail
Goestenkors. ``We'd come such a long way. We had been playing our
best basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ``So it's a disappointment when your last game doesn't come up
to what you've been doing before. But it's been a wonderful
journey. I'm very proud for my team.''
</P>
<P>
   Duke finished its most successful season at 29-7.
</P>
<P>
   Purdue broke the game open with a 10-1 run near the start of the
second half. Figgs had six points during the run as Purdue mounted
a 40-31 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to the locker room disappointed at halftime,'' said
Figgs. ``I felt like I had let my team down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had been tentative; I wasn't attacking the basket. I knew
that I had 20 minutes left to either win or lose.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I didn't want to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Duke, also in the national championship round for the first
time, was almost as jittery as Purdue during the first half.
</P>
<P>
   Turnovers and missed shots in bunches by both squads probably
had TV viewers channel surfing long before halftime.
</P>
<P>
   Purdue was 8-for-28 from the floor in the opening period, Duke
an almost-as-dismal 9-for-23.
</P>
<P>
   But despite that and 11 turnovers, the Blue Devils led 22-17 at
the break.
</P>
<P>
   The combined point total (39) was the lowest for a half in the
history of the tournament, surpassing the 50 by Auburn and
Louisiana Tech in the 1988 title game.
</P>
<P>
   The 17 points by Purdue were a record low, beating the 19 by the
Lady Techsters in '88.
</P>
<P>
   But Figgs caught fire as Purdue broke out of a 30-all tie to go
up 40-31 with 9:53 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   The Boilermakers were ahead only 47-42 when White-McCarty was
taken to the sideline.
</P>
<P>
   But they used 10 straight free throws and a steal by Figgs in
the final 3:09 to take home the Sears Trophy symbolic of their
national title.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team is just so special,'' said Figgs. ``Any time you win
a championship is special, but this one means so much more because
of the closeness on this team.
</P>
<P>
   ``If somebody goes down, we rally for them. I think we did that
at the end of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   VanGorp had 15 points to lead the Blue Devils. No other Duke
player reached double figures.
</P>
<P>
   VanGorp was selected to the Final Four first-team squad along
with teammate Nicole Erickson, the team scoring leader who was held
to eight points, and Figgs, Douglas and White-McCarty of Purdue.

UCONN HAS DATE WITH DEVILS
</HEADLINE>
 FINAL-BOS (For use by New York Times News Service clients) 
By MARK BLAUDSCHUN 
c.1999 The Boston Globe 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ Rarely has a college basketball season
had such a tidy ending.
</P>
<P>
   Duke, No. 1 now, No. 1 at the start of the season.
</P>
<P>
   UConn, No. 1 for 10 consecutive weeks in the middle of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   Duke, chasing its third national championship in this decade.
</P>
<P>
   UConn, seeking its first national championship and looking to
become the first New England team since Holy Cross in 1947 to win a
national title.
</P>
<P>
   Combined, the teams are an astonishing 70-3. No other team has
been ranked No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night at Tropicana Field, the Blue Devils and Huskies
will play for the 1999 NCAA title.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not going to be any `this' or `that' '', said UConn
forward Kevin Freeman, who appeared tired of hearing all the talk
of Duke's invincibility. ``Duke has 40 minutes to prove it. We have
40 minutes to prove it.''
</P>
<P>
   Or longer.
</P>
<P>
   Duke, a winner of all its games since losing in the last second
to Cincinnati in a tournament in Alaska in November, is the
favorite, which puts UConn (33-2) in the role of underdog for one
of the few times in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Even Huskies coach Jim Calhoun concedes Duke (37-1) deserves the
accolades. ``Clearly, what they've done during the season, by not
only the quantity of wins, but quality of wins and the way they
played, they played as the most dominant team in college basketball
in a number of years.''
</P>
<P>
   But Calhoun is not conceding anything. ``We are 33-2,'' he said.
``We've had a reasonably decent season ourselves. We've been
brilliant at times. We have been pragmatic at times. We've survived
at times.''
</P>
<P>
   Duke has done more than survive. It has glided over, pushed
through, and run past everyone since that loss to Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday someone suggested that carrying the role of a favorite
might have added to the Devils' burden Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us, it has not been taxing,'' said Duke coach Mike
Krzyzewski, ``because we don't talk about it. We just talk about
getting better and having fun playing.''
</P>
<P>
   Duke has done that and done it easily, until Saturday night's
68-62 win over Michigan State in the semifinals. So physical was
the game that Coach K reportedly gave his team Sunday off.
</P>
<P>
   In a strange way, Duke's excellence and dominance has energized
the Huskies.
</P>
<P>
   UConn guard Khalid El-Amin said he has been focused on the
Devils for a long time. ``Ever since the season started, we have
been hoping to have the opportunity to play Duke,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One wonders why. If there is a weakness in the Devils' game, no
one has found it. Most people think there will be two key battles.
Underneath, where UConn's Jake Voskuhl and assorted friends will
attempt to handle Duke's Elton Brand, college basketball's Player
of the Year. And in the backcourt, where Duke's William Avery and
UConn's Ricky Moore, high school teammates in Augusta, Ga., could
face off.
</P>
<P>
   It also will be a game of similar styles. Both teams excel at
the transition game. Krzyzewski calls the Huskies the best
offensive transition team in the country.
</P>
<P>
   The odds say Duke will become the first team to win a national
championship with one or no losses since Indiana did it in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   The matchups suggest that Duke is a little stronger, a little
quicker, a little more talented.
</P>
<P>
   But UConn, when it plays the way it did against Stanford during
the regular season and against St. John's in the Big East
tournament championship game, has some things going for it in the
tenacity of Moore on defense, the immense skill and smoothness of
Richard Hamilton, and the toughness of El-Amin.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we started the season,'' said El-Amin, ``we felt we were
on the road to the national championship. Now we're here.''
</P>
<P>
   And Duke is waiting.

VOSKUHL WILL BE KEY FOR UCONN 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ If, as Kevin Freeman suggested, the task
the University of Connecticut's basketball team faces in Monday
night's NCAA championship game against Duke is akin to the blinding
of a cyclops, then it likely will fall upon more than one Husky to
lead the charge against the one Blue Devil who poses the same
threat as the mythical goliath: Elton Brand, a 6-foot-8-inch,
260-pound sophomore center.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's like a big cyclops,'' Freeman said, drawing
laughter from the assembled media during Sunday's Final Four press
conference at Tropicana Field, ``and you've got to just try to take
the eye out of him and beat them, the entire team. You can't just
take the head off.''
</P>
<P>
   But who will provide UConn's first line of defense in the
frontcourt?
</P>
<P>
   Who likely will draw the assignment of going eyeball-to-eyeball
against Brand?
</P>
<P>
   Meet Jake Voskuhl.
</P>
<P>
   He stands 6-11, weighs 245 pounds, has a disarming smile, a
soft-spoken manner, and blond surfer-boy looks (with a moptop to
match) that belie his Katy, Texas, roots (the same town that
sprouted Roger Clemens). In short, Voskuhl's choirboy image
inspires so little fear in opponents that when he jogs out onto the
court Monday night, Brand will not be inclined to want to run home
to momma.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't really see any advantages I have over him yet,'' said
Brand of Voskuhl. ``We didn't get a chance to watch any film. I
just watched him two or three times on TV during the season. In the
game (Saturday) night, he was in foul trouble like I was, so he
didn't really play that much. So I have not really had a chance to
look at him as a player.''
</P>
<P>
   Ditto for Voskuhl. Monday night will be the first time they lay
eyes on each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't seen him or even run into him in the halls here,''
said Voskuhl. ``I didn't get a chance to see him a lot (Saturday)
night, but throughout the year they've been on TV so much that I've
seen him a lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``But with a player like him, he's so really good, you can't
really say you're going to stop him and that he's not going to do
anything,'' he added. ``You just try to contain him and hope that
he really doesn't go off on you. But I feel like I'm really
fortunate to have a teammate like Kevin Freeman, who is a great
help defender. So, I'll be counting upon Kevin.''
</P>
<P>
   But Freeman, like the rest of the Huskies, will be counting on
Voskuhl to stay out of foul trouble and play more than the 19
minutes he logged in UConn's 64-58 victory over Ohio State
Saturday. Voskuhl's line vs. the Buckeyes: 2 points, 5 rebounds, 1
assist, 1 turnover, 1 blocked shot, 1 steal and, oh yes, 5 fouls.
</P>
<P>
   It was only Voskuhl's second disqualification of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very important for me to be out there longer than 19
minutes,'' Voskuhl said. ``I've just got to play smarter, really.''
</P>
<P>
   So, in a game in which he no doubt will have to battle Brand
fiercly, Voskuhl expressed some concern about how flexible the
officials were going to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to say, with the NCAA Tournament it's like the
officiating is different,'' said Voskuhl, who averages 5.6 points
and 6.5 rebounds, but ranks as the runaway team leader in fouls
(103). ``You really have to try and adjust to the officiating,
because they are all getting watched by everybody.
</P>
<P>
   ``Throughout the year, you normally get the same officials, but
you kind of know how they're going to call it, and they know how
you play. Sometimes we've had the same officials, but it seems like
in the NCAAs things are a little bit different, so it's just a
matter of adjusting.''
</P>
<P>
   Voskuhl, however, did say there was one Big East official he
hoped to see calling the championship game. ``Tim Higgins,''
Voskuhl said, unabashedly. ``He and I really get along well. I
haven't seen him yet, so maybe he'll be there.''
</P>
<P>
   Brand also was plagued by foul trouble in Duke's 68-62 victory
over a physical Michigan State squad, but still scored 18 points
and grabbed 15 rebounds (13 in the first half).
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a great number, 13 in one half, '' Voskuhl marveled.
``But we just have to try and box him out. I have to play solid.
He's proven he can score on anybody in the country. Just to foul
him is not going to be the most intelligent thing to do. It's
important to make players play both ends of the court. He's kind of
the heart of their team, and when he's playing well they're really
at the top of their game.''

MICHIGAN STATE STUNS COLORADO COLLEGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALLEN LESSELS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MADISON, Wis. _ Live by the quick strike, perish by the quick
strike.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado College rode a three-goals-in-42-seconds explosion to a
first-round win over St. Lawrence in the NCAA hockey tournament
West Regional Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   And the Tigers were sent back to Colorado Springs Sunday when
Michigan State pulled a similar trick.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing, 3-2, with under two minutes left to play, the Spartans
stunned the Tigers with two goals _ both of them reviewed on video
_ in 32 seconds for a 4-3 win in their regional final.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan State improved to 29-5-7 and earned a berth in the
Frozen Four in Anaheim. The Spartans take on the University of New
Hampshire in a semifinal game Thursday at Arrowhead Pond. Colorado
headed for home 29-12-1.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Michigan State found success in the NCAA Tournament.
The Spartans are back in the Frozen Four for the first time since
1992. They had lost six straight tournament games.
</P>
<P>
   ``The burden hasn't been bad for me,'' said Michigan State coach
Ron Mason. ``I've been there lots of times before and had won a
bunch and I won a championship, fortunately they can't say you
can't win the big one. But it's nice for the players.''
</P>
<P>
   The burden might have been there for them, he said. And it
looked that way from the way the Spartans celebrated on the ice and
as they came off it.
</P>
<P>
   The Spartans appeared headed for a seventh straight loss when
Colorado College took a 3-2 lead on a Trent Clark goal with 8:39
left in the third period.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers were still on top when Paul Weaver was called for
interference with 3:01 left, a call CC coach Don Lucia did not
like.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first of a series of bad breaks for the Tigers.
</P>
<P>
   First, Spartan freshman Andrew Hutchinson shot the puck toward
traffic and the net and it beat a screened Jeff Sanger. The play
was reviewed to see if a Spartan was in the crease, and was allowed
to stand.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-two seconds later, the Spartans struck again. Freshman
Adam Hall took a shot that bounced off the glove of Sanger and
popped slowly into the net for his second goal of the game. That
score, too, was reviewed to make sure the puck went over the goal
line. It also counted.
</P>
<P>
   The way the Colorado College folks figured it, it was a fitting
end to a tough, injury-filled season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just didn't get any breaks today,'' said senior defenseman
Scott Swanson. ``It's kind of been the way it's been all year. We
haven't gotten key bounces or key calls to go the right way.''

MAINE RELYS ON MICHAUD

<TEXT>
<P>
   WORCESTER, Mass. _ Alfie Michaud's name is not listed on the
Hockey East All-Star team, but more importantly for the University
of Maine junior goaltender, it most definitely is inscribed on a
plane ticket to Anaheim, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Michaud, who backstopped Maine to a pair of victories over the
weekend, 4-2 over Ohio State and 7-2 over Clarkson in the NCAA
Tournament East Regional in Worcester, is heading west with his
teammates for hockey's Frozen Four and a shot at the national
championship.
</P>
<P>
   About Michaud's 22-save performance against Ohio State, which
included a perfect 11 for 11 in the second period when Maine was
nursing a 2-1 lead, Black Bears coach Shawn Walsh noted that
``Alfie made some great saves. He's led the Hockey East Tournament
in save percentage the past two years and he showed why against
Ohio State. He didn't even get a vote for honorable mention (in
Hockey East) and I was stunned at that. But he's a positional
goalie. He doesn't look flashy.''
</P>
<P>
   Walsh showed his appreciation for Michaud's play the following
night, when, with the Black Bears in front of Clarkson by five
goals with 90 seconds to play, he took Michaud out so Maine fans
could give him an ovation.
</P>
<P>
   It was well-deserved because Maine was in a tight spot after
Clarkson's Paul Evans beat Michaud on a penalty shot at 16:52 of
the middle period to close the gap to 4-2. Maine still had to kill
two penalties called even before Evans's score.
</P>
<P>
   That's when Michaud stood his ground, blanking Clarkson for the
rest of the period and the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's past is past and I can't change the past. That's been
my thinking all season. There are 3,600 seconds in a hockey game
and 500 more in (regular-season) overtime and all you can do is
play for each moment,'' said Michaud, who as a youngster in
Selkirk, Manitoba, faced some unusual family pressure.
</P>
<P>
   His dad and nine uncles toughened him up by shooting tee-balls
at Alfie in the basement of his home. ``They made me stay in there
even if I cried,'' he recalled with a smile and a bit of a wince,
``and I stayed with it because I wanted to be a goalie.''
</P>
<P>
   When a friend urged him to give junior hockey a try, the pair
traveled to Saskatchewan, where Michaud was his league's rookie of
the year for the Lebret Eagles. A scholarship to Maine soon
followed.
</P>
<P>
   Michaud had a respectable 32-20-5 record at Maine entering this
season, but there were no trips to the NCAA Tournament until this
year. Michaud's save percentage improved from .864 and .890 his
first two years to .906 this season, a reflection of the goalie's
and team's commitment to defense and Michaud's steadier play.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played excellent defensively all year. That's been our
backbone,'' said Walsh. Added standout defenseman David Cullen,
``Our defensive style is our bread and butter. We try not to allow
any odd-man rushes and play a smart game. We try to let Alfie make
the long saves and take away the second shots.''
</P>
<P>
   The formula has worked so well that entering the Frozen Four,
Michaud, whose record this season is 26-6-3 (Maine is 29-6-4), has
been forced to make 30 or more saves only twice this season _ and
he responded well on both occasions.
</P>
<P>
   The first was Jan. 3 at Colorado when his 33 stops were key in a
3-3 overtime tie. The second came five days later as Michaud's 38
saves were the difference in a 2-1 victory at Boston College.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting to the big games and now the tournament games are what
you play hockey for,'' he said. ``Listening to tapes on mental
toughness have helped me. Last year, I was very inconsistent. I'd
lose my confidence quick and it was like being on a roller-coaster
ride. Now nothing gets to me. I really take it one second at a
time. I'm enjoying the game. I'm playing for the moment. I listened
to the tapes before I went to bed the night before the (Clarkson)
game and twice before it and that helped me relax and focus at the
same time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a rough start last year, but now he's the epitome of
consistency,'' said Walsh. ``And he's able to bounce back. When we
beat UNH (4-3) in February, Alfie gave up two questionable goals.
But when it was a 3-3 game in the third period, he made two
scintillating saves. He's getting better and somebody's going to
enjoy picking him and I hope he gets a shot (in the pros) after
college because he's such a wonderful kid. I want whatever's best
for him.''
</P>
<P>
   But as calm and cool as Michaud was during the regionals, there
was a moment of personal emotion immediately after the Clarkson
game.
</P>
<P>
   Michaud's immediate thoughts were of Rich Britt, the team's
assistant trainer and equipment manager, who died last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dickie said the week before he passed away that his dream was
for the team to get to Anaheim and we wanted to get there for him.
I think he was looking down on us and smiling on us tonight,''
Michaud said with a shaky voice. Michaud helped set the tone for
the victory when he spread-eagled in the first minute to snag a
Clarkson drive with his glove 6 inches off the ice.
</P>
<P>
   Michaud expects his immediate family, which drove 22 hours to
Denver in January to see him play, to hop in the car for the
Manitoba-to-California trip this week. ``But,'' he said with a
laugh, ``it's a long ride, 10 hours more than to Denver. They're
probably in the car now.''
</P>
<P>
   With some tee-balls in the trunk, just in case Michaud wants
some extra practice.

   MINNEAPOLIS _ For the 24 new national champs, the night had been
too short to fit in all the joy; too fleeting to replay all the
special moments; too brief to accommodate that much happiness.
</P>
<P>
   First, the Crimson needed overtime to defeat the University of
New Hampshire, 6-5, Saturday night to win the American Women's
College Hockey Alliance Division 1 title in a game that didn't end
until 11:18 EDT.
</P>
<P>
   Then, just eight bleary hours later, they and their coaches were

overhead racks bursting with bouquets and a treasured trophy
ensconced safely, and appropriately, in First Class.
</P>
<P>
   Sleep? ``Not a wink,'' said A.J. Mleczko, who ended her Harvard
career with an assist on Jen Botterill's game-winning goal. ``I
don't think any of us did. We had a lot of celebrating to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Which they went about doing until 20 minutes before the buses
left for the airport, thanks to a party thrown by the same local
Harvard Club that feted the men's hockey team when it won the NCAA
title in St. Paul 10 years ago. Even the pep band got in the act,
until the nice people at the Radisson Metrodome had to invoke a
trumpet curfew.
</P>
<P>
   It was only fitting the party go on all night: There was a lot
to celebrate in a season that not only saw Harvard win its first
conference tournament game in the 20-year-old program, but go on to
win the ECAC tournament and national title after winning a
team-record 33 games (the previous best was 19) and scoring more
goals (218) in a season than any previous Crimson squad, men's
(191) or women's (118).
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew we had the foundation,'' said coach Katey Stone of her
team, which went 14-16 last season for the most wins in nine years.
``I knew we could make a run for the national championship. To say
we'd be 33-1? No.''
</P>
<P>
   But to that foundation returned Mleczko, back from a two-year
absence training for the 1998 US Olympic team, and Tammy Shewchuk,
a Canadian national team member who just missed making that
nation's Olympic team. Add to that incoming freshmen Botterill, a
Canadian Olympic-team forward, and Angela Ruggiero, an intimidating
defenseman for the US squad, and you've got, well, you've got the
new national champions. Of the nation's top six scorers, Mleczko,
Shewchuk, Botterill, and Ruggiero went 1,2,3,6.
</P>
<P>
   In that company, sophomore winger Angie Francisco often was
overlooked, even though she, too, cracks the Top 10. ``Angie's
clutch,'' said Stone after Francisco came through with a hat trick
and an assist in the title game. ``She's a bulldog.''
</P>
<P>
   All season, Stone had emphasized that the Crimson were more than
just the Fab Four, and on Saturday night they proved it again _
again, because in the first round of the ECAC playoffs, they beat
Cornell, 3-2, without either Ruggiero or Botterill, who were
playing for their national teams in the Women's World Championship
_ when Francisco and backup goaltender, freshman Alison Kuusisto,
shared the spotlight. Kuusisto was playing in place of Crystal
Springer, who Friday night against Brown broke the same collarbone
that kept her out for six weeks earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great, because it puts a punctuation mark on everything
we tried to tell the kids and convince them of,'' said Stone, who
still barely had snoozed late Sunday afternoon. ``The egos were
parked at the door, and it was all about team.''

US SKATERS NEED TO GET SHARPER 
</HEADLINE>
 FIGURE SKATING-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HELSINKI _ They came here during slush-and-gravel season with
modest expectations. Tara Lipinski is a pro. Todd Eldredge is on
``active rest'' and was here purely as a spectator. Last year's top
pair and dance couples have split up or moved on.
</P>
<P>
   The US figure skating team was filled with rookies and a
13-year-old who made the roster through a loophole. In other words,
the usual post-Olympic reconstruction project. ``This was a
developing team,'' said Audrey Weisiger, who coaches Michael Weiss.
And with the Winter Games in Salt Lake City still three years off,
the Americans are still a hardhat zone.
</P>
<P>
   When the world championships ended here Saturday night, the US
had won two medals but golden girl Michelle Kwan had lost her crown
to 26-year-old Maria Butyrskaya. And the Russians had the best week
that they or anybody else have had at this annual all-skate.
</P>
<P>
   They were the first to win all four events, going 1-2 in men's
with teenagers Alexei Yagudin and Evgeni Plushenko and 1-3 in
women's with Butyrskaya and 17-year-old Julia Soldatova.
</P>
<P>
   The Yanks, who failed to win a gold medal for the first time in
four years, could only observe that three of the four Russian
champions were made, or at least polished, in America. Yagudin and
the pair of Elena Berezhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze train in New
Jersey, dancers Anjelika Krylova and Oleg Ovsyannikov in Delaware.
Maybe some of the Russian gold dust will rub off on their hosts.
</P>
<P>
   For consolation prizes the Americans had Kwan's silver and
Weiss's bronze, but they weren't as concerned about winning medals
as they were about losing spots for next year's championships in
Brisbane. All but four of their 16 skaters were either here for the
first time or came with new partners. But when the count was done,
the slippage wasn't as bad as feared.
</P>
<P>
   Though the US dropped from three to two entries in men's and
pairs as expected, it retained two in dance when Naomi Lang and
Peter Tchernyshev cracked the top 10. And the women, who were on
the bubble after Kwan crashed in the short program, pulled through
when 13-year-old Sarah Hughes, the youngest skater in the field,
finished a serendipitous seventh.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more than I ever could have imagined,'' said Hughes,
who's two years under the age limit but qualified because she's a
world junior medalist. ``It was just so much fun. I don't know what
to say.''
</P>
<P>
   Hughes and fellow 13-year-old Naomi Nari Nam, who beat her at
the US championships but isn't a world junior medalist, are both
good enough to make the 2002 Olympic team. The question is how long
the 18-year-old Kwan will stick around. ``She's never said one word
about stopping,'' says coach Frank Carroll. But Kwan is planning on
starting college in the fall and will be hearing this week from
Harvard, Stanford, Cal-Berkeley, and UCLA, among others.
</P>
<P>
   Kwan insists she'll be able to balance skating and academics.
``I will compete,'' she says. ``I can't walk out of the rink and
not want to go back. This is what I love doing. I love the
pressure. I love the stress. I love going backstage after the
warmup and going `arrrgghhh.' ''
</P>
<P>
   But can Kwan be a full-time coed and still keep her skills at an
Olympian level? It's a hazy forecast all around for the Yanks. Will
the 27-year-old Eldredge, the former world and five-time US champ,
come back? Or will he decide that he no longer fits in a world
where men are doing a quadruple jump in the short program and two
in the long?
</P>
<P>
   Will Weiss be able to juggle fatherhood and skating for three
more winters? Will 18-year-old Tim Goebel, who landed the first
quad salchow-triple toe combination at a world event, develop the
artistry he needs to be a global contender? Can the pairs and
dancers get anywhere near a podium before Salt Lake comes around?
</P>
<P>
   For the rebuilding Yanks, last week was an introduction to the
ozone _ and an initiation. ``This is big,'' concluded Danielle
Hartsell after she and brother Steve, the new US pairs titlists,
finished 10th in their world debut. ``But we have one under our
belt now. Next year, we'll know what to expect.''

</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-RDP (Washington) _ Allied warplanes braved bad weather
Sunday night to step up attacks on Yugoslav troops while NATO
officials repeatedly accused Serbian forces of large-scale
atrocities in Kosovo. On both sides of the Atlantic, officials were
being asked what they would do if air power failed to halt the
violence against Kosovo's Albanians. Clinton administration
officials, as well as those at NATO headquarters, insisted they had
no intention of committing ground troops. By Adam Clymer. With

</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-BELGRADE (Belgrade, Yugoslavia) _ Defiant as ever and
proud of his nation's resistance to NATO's air attacks, Slobodan
Milosevic staged an eerie celebration Sunday: a rock concert in the
center of Belgrade to show solidarity with the soldiers facing down
the allied assaults. By Steven Erlanger.
</P>
<P>
   CUBA-BASEBALL-FANS (Havana, Cuba) _ It was a sunny event laced
with nationalism and patriotic feeling, but in the end, the
historic game between the Baltimore Orioles and a team of Cuban
stars played here Sunday was about baseball, and the 50,000 Cubans
who attended walked out with their heads high. By James McKinley.

</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-ALBANIA (Tirana, Albania) _ Their Kosovo villages in
flames behind them, tens of thousands of ethnic Albanians were
hounded by Serb forces into Albania in long lines of battered cars
and tractors and on foot, threatening to overwhelm the scant
resources of this desperately poor country and the hasty efforts of
Western aid workers. By John Kifner. With map of refugee movements
out of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   EXCLUSIVE-PILOT-RESCUE (Washington) _ Shortly after 8:45 p.m.
Saturday in the Balkans, a secretive search-and-rescue team based
with American forces in Bosnia received an urgent phone call: An
F-117 stealth fighter, the premier attack plane in America's
arsenal, was down in Yugoslavia. The fate of the pilot was unknown.
Within minutes, a recovery mission was underway, tapping the
talents of an elite special operations unit poised to pluck downed
pilots from storming seas or from behind enemy lines. By Eric
Schmitt.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-BUDAPEST (Budapest, Hungary) _ Warning that NATO's
bombing of Yugoslavia had severely damaged Russia's reationship
with the United States, a Russian delegation met here Sunday with
U.S. special envoy Richard Holbrooke before attempting to travel by

Slobodan Milosevic. By Blaine Harden.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-SERB-TV (Undated) _ For Serbs watching
government-controlled Serbian television, the world of the Balkans

will fight to the last man. By Anthony Ramirez.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-EMAIL (Undated) _ This is the first instance of warfare
where a small but significant slice of the population has Internet
access. The Yugoslavs, a technically savvy group for decades, have
used the Web to create an entire news network consisting of e-mail
exchanges, chat rooms and bulletin boards _ where no rumor is too
small to dissect at length and almost no hamlet too remote to
mention. By Neil MacFarquhhar.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-HOOPER (Washington) _ The first NATO missiles and bombs
were only a few hours from striking Yugoslavia when James Hooper,
once the State Department's senior dissenter on Balkan policy,
sipped his coffee a few blocks from the White House and talked of
ground troops likely to follow. It has been two years since Hooper,
the very model of an earnest Foreign Service careerist, quit the
government in frustration after 26 years of toiling at diplomacy.
He joined a handful of pioneer State Department dissenters who left
across two administrations protesting Balkan policy. By Francis X.
Clines. With photo.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-MEDIA (Undated) _ As NATO bombers pummel Yugoslavia,
President Slobodan Milosevic pummels the country's independent
press. Seeking to tighten an official near-monopoly on what Serbs
are told about the war, Milosevic responded to the bombing by
shutting down virtually all the independent newspapers and
silencing the nation's most prominent independent radio station,
B-92. By James Brooke.
</P>
<P>

republic that has peacefully retained an ethnically-mixed society.

   CAPETOWN-WAR (Capetown, South Africa) _ Cape Town is in a
three-way war between criminal gangs, the police and a Muslim
anti-crime group calling itself People Against Gangsterism and
Drugs. Donald G. McNeil Jr.
</P>

feast of sacrifice, one of the most important festivals on the
Islamic calendar, it's a bad time to be a sheep. By Douglas Jehl.
</P>
<P>
   JOURNALISTS-KILLED (Montego Bay, Jamaica) _ As dictatorships
disappear from the map of Latin America, leaving Cuba as a holdout,
violence against reporters has dropped correspondingly, to 23
journalists killed last year from 41 in 1989. At the same time, as
democratic institutions have taken root in Latin America's big
cities, violence against reporters has shifted to the rural areas,
according to advocates for press freedom gathered here for a
meeting of the Inter American Press Association. By James Brooke.

   INTERNET-MARKETPLACE (New York) _ During the next few months
there are likely to be a lot of delirious executives and employees

   MAGAZINES-SPINOFFS (Undated) _ In the last two years, publishers
have come to see the spinoff as the future of magazines. Spinoffs

<P>
   COMPUTER-HUNTING (Undated) _ The business mastermind behind one
of the hot trends in computing today is not Bill Gates or Michael
Dell, and not some Internet whiz kid from Silicon Valley or

Robert Westmoreland of Wal-Mart Stores Inc., has been the driving
force behind the phenomenal success of computer hunting games, led

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. _ As Purdue's Ukari Figgs and Stephanie
White-McCarty hugged with tears in their eyes at one end of the
court, a similar embrace was taking place several feet away in
front of the Duke bench.
</P>
<P>
   There, a tearful Nicole Erickson and Michele VanGorp _ teammates
of Figgs and White-McCarty before transferring from Purdue to Duke
two years ago _ met. Arm in arm, the two Duke seniors then turned
and left the San Jose Arena court.
</P>
<P>
   Figgs and White-McCarty, who was on crutches because of an ankle
sprain, remained to celebrate Purdue's first National Collegiate
Athletic Association women's basketball championship, a product of
a 62-45 victory over Duke in Sunday night's title game.
</P>
<P>
   In a spirited game that reflected both the championship stakes
and the unique personal history between the teams, top-ranked
Purdue overcame White-McCarty's late injury with a second-half
surge.
</P>
<P>
   The total points in the game (107) was the lowest for a women's
NCAA final. In 1988, Louisiana Tech and Auburn combined for 110
points.
</P>
<P>
   Purdue's victory also means the Duke men's and women's
basketball teams will not win a double championship, something that
has never happened in Division I college basketball.
</P>
<P>
   The injury to White-McCarty, which occurred after she missed a
turnaround jumper near the foul line with four minutes left in the
game, actually appeared to spark Purdue, which scored the next 13
points to put the game away.
</P>
<P>
   As White-McCarty _ an all-American and a player of legendary
status in Indiana _ was helped from the court before a hushed
Purdue bench and cheering section, Duke Coach Gail Goestenkors knew
the game had reached a pivotal stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `O.K., this is it,' '' Goestenkors said. ``It's going
to go one way or the other right now. And they tend to rally around
each other.''
</P>
<P>
   On the Purdue bench, there were a few seconds when things
appeared to be in disarray. White-McCarty's face was twisted with
pain and her teammates were in a circle trying to console her. But
Purdue's players said they soon found a resolve to close out the
game and win.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steph means so much for this program and to all of us,''
Camille Cooper said. ``When she went down, we all knew right there
that we can't lose this ball game now.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Duke had led by 5 points at halftime, Figgs, who would
score all of her game-high 18 points in the second half, rallied
Purdue to a 47-39 lead just before White-McCarty slumped to the
court.
</P>
<P>
   But as White-McCarty lay on the court, Duke's Hilary Howard sank
a 3-point shot at the other end. Duke's players, who appeared out
of sync for most of the second half, could sense this might be
their last opportunity to keep Purdue from its 32nd consecutive
victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could see the emotion on the court at that point,'' Howard
said. ``Their star was down, we were making a little run. I was
hoping we get it together for a last, good stretch. But it didn't
happen that way.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Duke wouldn't score again until the game was one minute
from ending, and by then Purdue had a 60-45 lead. In that stretch,
Purdue made 12 consecutive free throws and 15 of 17 it attempted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm disappointed because we've come such a long way,'' said
Goestenkors, whose team burst into the college basketball national
spotlight with its upset of Tennessee in the East Regional final
last week. ``It wasn't even close to one of our best games so it's
not the way we envisioned the season ending.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it was a wonderful journey.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Purdue Coach Carolyn Peck, who is resigning from Purdue to
become coach and general manager of the Orlando franchise in the
Women's National Basketball Association, said Sunday's victory
would have a big impact on her school's program.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's our first national championship and the first national
championship for a women's Big Ten program,'' Peck said. ``Those
are nice accomplishments. Back home on campus, we have a picture
frame we've been reserving for Purdue's first national championship
team. And these players are going in that picture frame.''
</P>
<P>
   White-McCarty said: ``This is what we stayed for, we stayed for
the opportunity. The group we have on this team makes it special.
It's been a lot of fun and it means a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   From the opening tip, each team played with a fervor that seemed
the byproduct of the closeness of the most pivotal players on the
court _ White-McCarty, Figgs, Erickson and VanGorp.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the intensity was the impact of the game on each
school's program. Neither Duke nor Purdue had ever played in the
national championship game of women's college basketball.
</P>
<P>
   But all this led to some nervous play and sloppy basketball.
Halfway through the first half, Duke led, 9-8.
</P>
<P>
   The Duke guards were harassed and appeared disorganized as they
attempted to run their offense.
</P>
<P>
   Purdue had larger guards, and the 6-foot-1-inch forward Katie
Douglas, an unsung star of Purdue's defense, also seemed to be
causing size problems for Duke's hottest player in the tournament,
Erickson, who is 5-6.
</P>
<P>
   But whatever problems Erickson was having, they were not as
noticeable as the troubles Figgs was having in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   Figgs, who led Purdue with 24 points in its semifinal victory
over Louisiana Tech, was 0 for 7.
</P>
<P>
   The game officials contributed to the helter-skelter nature of
the first half when they called 15 fouls on the teams.
</P>
<P>
   Despite her struggles in the first half, Figgs sparked Purdue's
rally at the midpoint of the second half, scoring 8 points during a
12-1 run that gave the Boilermakers a 40-31 lead.
</P>
<P>
   During this span, Duke turned the ball over on three consecutive
trips down the court as Purdue pulled away.
</P>
<P>
   A 3-point shot by Erickson and two strong post moves by VanGorp
that led to easy baskets cut Purdue's lead to 42-38 with eight
minutes to play.
</P>
<P>
   But Douglas sank a 3-point basket from the wing that extended
Purdue's lead to 7 points. Peppi Browne made one of two free
throws, but Purdue's Cooper converted a short jumper to increase
its lead to 47-39 with 4:29 to play. &QL;

CHANGES IN STREET CRIME UNIT MAY HURT ITS EFFECTIVENESS  
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS lede to delete ``plain clothes'')  (rk) 
 By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As officers in the Street Crime Unit reported _ in
uniform _ for duty Sunday, many law enforcement officials said that
Police Commissioner Howard Safir's decision to overhaul the unit's
operations would make it less controversial, but also less
effective.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with mounting criticism in the seven weeks since the
Amadou Diallo killing, Safir announced Friday that he would require
Street Crime Unit officers to work in uniform and that he would
replace 50 members of the overwhelmingly white unit with minority
officers.
</P>
<P>
   He also said he would try to attract candidates by elevating the
unit's status with promotions and annual raises of $1,500, and by
making the assignment part of a career path leading to the
prestigious detective bureau.
</P>
<P>
   Those moves may ease the criticism from those city residents who
charge that the Street Crimes Unit has produced impressive arrest
and gun seizure statistics by being too aggressive and infringing
on the civil rights of residents in minority neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   But tactically, the new dress code that began last night will
deprive the unit of one of its most valuable weapons _ stealth _
and will limit the squad's ability to perform surveillance in
high-crime neighborhoods, officers and former commanders said.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the changes said they amounted to tampering with a
proven formula. During the last five years, the Street Crimes Unit
has functioned as a kind of rapid deployment force, a platoon of
gung-ho officers dispatched to high-crime neighborhoods with a
mandate to aggressively search for illegal guns and violent felons.
</P>
<P>
   The unit's results were so impressive _ it makes up less than 2
percent of the police force but confiscated 40 percent of all the
illegal weapons seized in the city _ that Safir tripled its
manpower from 130 to nearly 400 in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Former Deputy Inspector Richard F. Savage, who was relieved of
his command of the Street Crimes Unit when he opposed Safir's
expansion plans in 1997, said the changes would prevent officers
from posing as decoys in areas where a mugger or rapist had been
carrying out a series of attacks. Savage said the uniform
requirement would also force officers to be more careful when they
approach people suspected of carrying weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're still going to be looking for people with the bulge in
the waistband and the heavy pockets, and they're still going to pop
out of the car when they see someone who's wanted or who may be
carrying a weapon,'' Savage said. ``But in the past, they could
have parked the car, maybe gone around the block and found the
safest way to approach the situation. Now, the minute they leave
the vehicle, the bad guys immediately know who they are, and the
cops don't know who they're dealing with.''
</P>
<P>
   Det. Terrance Wansley, a spokesman for the group 100 Blacks in
Law Enforcement, and other black officers said that the decision to
make the unit more racially diverse is so long overdue that it will
do little to change the suspicion that its officers and many
residents of minority neighborhoods feel toward each other.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Diallo shooting, the department has ordered every
member of the Street Crimes Unit to attend racial sensitivity
classes, which have been taught by a community affairs sergeant who
is also a member of 100 Blacks in Law Enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   The sergeant, who discussed the meetings on the condition of
anonymity, said they were surprisingly tense, marred by icy stares
and in one case a shouting match, leaving black officers stunned by
the depth of the alienation that some street crimes officers
expressed toward minority residents and their black and Latino
colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's such deep racial divisions in that unit, that it's
going to take a lot more than just throwing a few raisins into the
milk bowl to change things,'' said Eric Adams, the president of 100
Blacks in Law Enforcement.

KARIYA, SELANNE SPARK DUCKS AGAIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREG CHRISTENSEN  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM _ The Mighty Ducks are more of a team than they have
ever been, but there's no doubt that as Paul Kariya and Teemu
Selanne go, so go the Ducks.
</P>
<P>
   Right now the two Anaheim stars are going pretty good. Two
nights after combining for three goals and seven points in a win
over Dallas, Kariya and Selanne combined for three more goals and
seven points in a 5-1 win over the Calgary Flames before 15,975 at
the Pond on Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``That line has been excellent, especially in the last two
games,'' said Ducks coach Craig Hartsburg. ``They have been playing
a great team game and are being rewarded. They aren't cheating for
chances. They are forcing mistakes and turning them into goals.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past four games, Kariya and Selanne have combined for 21
points _ 11 by Selanne and 10 by Kariya.
</P>
<P>
   Two victories, after a 1-3-2 slump, give the fifth-place Ducks a
four-point cushion on sixth-place St. Louis and move them six in
front of San Jose. The Ducks' 100th win at the Pond also moves them
five games over .500 (33-28-5) for the second time in franchise
history.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a huge two points for us,'' said Hartsburg. ``With
the win we are 10 (ahead of the eighth-place Flames, who are
battling Edmonton for the final Western Conference playoff spot),
otherwise we'd only be six ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   With a rugged five-game road trip around the corner, the Ducks
gladly took advantage of a tired Calgary team that played Saturday
night in Phoenix, just as they took advantage of a Dallas club that
played the Kings the evening before coming to Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew they were tired, we wanted to keep the tempo up,''
Selanne said.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks scored the first goal of the game when Selanne set up
Kariya at 15:25 of the first period. Kariya got just enough on his
shot from the slot to beat Fred Brathwaite on the stick side for
his 32nd goal of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks needed nine minutes to record a shot in the second
period, but they needed only a club-record 12 seconds to score
twice and take a 3-0 lead into the third period.
</P>
<P>
   Selanne scored his NHL-leading 43rd goal of the year when he
turned defenseman Tommy Albelin inside out and ripped a slap shot
past the helpless Brathwaite at 18:07.
</P>
<P>
   Albelin then was victimized by Kariya, who beat him to the puck
behind the net and centered to Jeff Nielsen. Alone in the slot,
Nielsen had little trouble beating Brathwaite for his fourth of the
season at 18:19.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously that was huge,'' Selanne said. ``Right now it's just
nice to be playing with the chemistry clicking.''
</P>
<P>
   After Selanne set up Kariya for a breakaway goal at 7:10, the
Flames seemed determined to go after the Anaheim winger.
</P>
<P>
   Selanne was hit hard twice before Hartsburg countered by putting
Stu Grimson on the ice. Grimson had one thing on his mind, and that
was goading Dave Roche into a fight. A slash by the Ducks enforcer
finally did the trick.
</P>
<P>
   Grimson picked up an extra two minutes on the play and when Ted
Drury received a double-minor for high sticking the Ducks were two
men down, and Guy Hebert's shutout was in jeopardy. Anaheim killed
off all but four seconds of the two-man disadvantage before Valeri
Bure beat Hebert with a shot that bounced off the post and in.
</P>
<P>
   Hebert lost his shutout, but his 29th victory of the season tied
his own club record set in the 1996-97 season.

   ZAGREB, Croatia _ If anyone has ever wondered how wars begin,
they begin like this: Two sides, starting from different principles
and world views, back one another into a trap of their own rhetoric
and mythologies.
</P>
<P>
   If the West miscalculated President Slobodan Milosevic's
willingness to invite NATO-led troops into Kosovo, the southern
Serb province, the Yugoslav leader may at the same time have
miscalculated his own freedom to solve the problem he created.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic rose to power on the issue of the minority Serbs in
Kosovo, the province from which Serbs derive their defining myths
of nationalism, victimization and endurance.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, he promised Kosovo's Serbs that ``no one will be
allowed to beat you'' and that Kosovo would remain in Serbia
forever. When he did that, said Slavko Curuvija, a Yugoslav
journalist who was standing next to a shaking Milosevic at the
time, ``he suddenly became the leader of all Serbs and the Serb
nation.''
</P>
<P>
   But that path led Milosevic and the Serbs toward widespread
ethnic cleansing and killing through much of what once made up
Yugoslavia. The Serbs certainly misjudged how much revulsion this
would stir in the West. On the other hand, the notion of martyrdom
in Kosovo is so deeply ingrained in Serbian mythology that the West
likewise seems to have miscalculated Milosevic's ability to walk
away from Kosovo once the battle there had been joined.
</P>
<P>
   For the Serbs, Kosovo is their Jerusalem, the holy touchstone
and center of their existence as a nation despite all the defeats
and travails of history. It was in Kosovo, in 1389, on the Field of
Blackbirds, that Serb forces lost a mighty battle to the Ottoman
Turks, who then ruled Serbia for the next 500 years.
</P>
<P>
   But the Serbs regard themselves as having kept the flame of
their nation alive, with Kosovo as its bleeding heart. They
regained Kosovo by force in 1912, in the First Balkan War, when the
crumbling Ottoman empire was defeated.
</P>
<P>
   Serb nationalism was the distant spark that touched off World
War I, and the Serbian nation that resurfaced in this century still
has enormous complexes. Serbs still consider themselves a
misunderstood Christian nation on the edges of Western
civilization, patronized, mistreated and pushed around by more
powerful states, even as they bravely draw the line today against a
new Muslim expansionism in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's current bombing campaign to protect Kosovo's Albanians
feeds into all those Serb mythologies, and for now, at least, has
strengthened Milosevic's support at home. Again and again over the
last week, Serbs of widely differing backgrounds have said they
have no great love for Milosevic, who is bringing destruction to
the country, but that they support his refusal to allow foreign
troops into Kosovo as an intolerable infringement of Serbia's
sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   Over time, Milosevic has drawn the wagons more closely around
himself, firing critics in the army and elsewhere who express
dissent even privately, and not always getting the best
information, Western negotiators and Yugoslav officials say.
</P>
<P>
   ``He may not have believed until the end that NATO really meant
to bomb him,'' said a Yugoslav official with ties to the
presidency. ``But Kosovo is too big a prize for him and for all of
us, and the West really offered us nothing in return, only this
pretense that we would remain legally sovereign.''
</P>
<P>
   A senior U.S. negotiator long involved with the effort to
negotiate a peaceful solution for Kosovo expressed some wonderment
when the final visit to Milosevic by the U.S. diplomat Richard
Holbrooke produced no movement. ``We thought that faced with the
choice of having NATO-led troops in Kosovo and getting bombed, that
he would prefer the troops.''
</P>
<P>
   This miscalculation was a part of the larger U.S. assumption
about Milosevic, based on the experience in Bosnia, that he would
always bend to superior force to preserve his power. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright has long argued that ``the only language
Milosevic understands is force.''
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic was able to walk away from Sarajevo when it was
included in the Bosnian Muslim zone under the Dayton accords of
1995, and he could survive the cleansing of Serbs from the Krajina
region when Croatia's forces drove them out earlier that year.
</P>
<P>
   But Kosovo is different. Bosnia was never an integral part of
the Serb nation or myth, as Kosovo is, and it was independent, as
Kosovo is not. The Serbs were losing anyway by the time the
Americans got around to trying to stop that war in 1995, and
Milosevic had a lot to gain by suddenly turning into the West's
crucial partner in peace.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic may yet bend, says a Yugoslav analyst, Bratislav
Grubacic, who has close ties to part of the regime. But he notes
that Milosevic's wife, Mira Markovic, is a more nationalistic and
ideological figure than her husband and is fond of saying, ``You
can defeat us, but you cannot convince us.''
</P>
<P>
   Her logic, which Milosevic seems to accept, is that to
effectively give away Kosovo by signing the peace accords would
destroy their claim to leadership, Grubacic said. ``But if we lose
Kosovo in a war, we have the legal basis to reconquer it in 100
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Yugoslav army is doing its best to destroy the
Kosovo Liberation Army and leave ethnic Albanians a calling card
they will long remember.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Milosevic may have outsmarted himself, Curuvija suggested.
Having ridden Kosovo to power and having set that genie free, it
may have turned out to be his captor. ``After all Milosevic has
said and done since 1987 to bind Kosovo to Serbia, if now he said,
`To hell with all that,' and signed the deal, he'd be dead,''
Curuvija said. ``I told American officials that a policy intended
to push Milosevic to the wall over Kosovo, to act as they want or
to be killed, is the worst policy, that they had to find another
way with him, to find a way to make him a partner.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, says Grubacic, the West has pushed Milosevic into
embracing his isolation to preserve his power at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a suicidal policy, and he may finish like Hitler in the
bunker,'' Grubacic said. ``But he will be remembered in Serb
mythology history as someone who said `no' to the dissolution of
the nation.''

Having ridden Kosovo to power and having set that genie free, it
may have turned out to be his captor. ``After all Milosevic has
said and done since 1987 to bind Kosovo to Serbia, if now he said,
`To hell with all that,' and signed the deal, he'd be dead,''
Curuvija said. ``I told American officials that a policy intended
to push Milosevic to the wall over Kosovo, to act as they want or
to be killed, is the worst policy, that they had to find another
way with him, to find a way to make him a partner.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, says Grubacic, the West has pushed Milosevic into
embracing his isolation to preserve his power at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a suicidal policy, and he may finish like Hitler in the
bunker,'' Grubacic said. ``But he will be remembered in Serb
mythology history as someone who said `no' to the dissolution of
the nation.''

   WASHINGTON _ If the candidates are to be believed, the unfolding
presidential campaign will be a high-toned, polite affair.
</P>
<P>
   Among Republicans, Sen. John McCain of Arizona, in a mailing to
prospective supporters, pledged never to lambaste ``my friends and
colleagues'' in the race. Former Vice President Dan Quayle made the
same vow. Gov. George W. Bush of Texas said he has never run an
attack commercial _ and is not about to start now. Among Democrats,
former Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey has no plans to resort to
biting rebukes to catch up to the favorite, Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Will debates, therefore, more resemble tea parties? Instead of
those commercials featuring grainy, villainous images of their
rivals, will politicians promote themselves frolicking through
clover?
</P>
<P>
   Don't put away your television clicker just yet.
</P>
<P>
   While candidates sense that people are repulsed by the vitriolic
discourse in Washington _ and pollsters warn that attacks can
boomerang _ virtually no one in politics believes that the days of
dark, dirty presidential campaigns are over. There will always be
one candidate who is winning and one candidate who is losing. And
the candidate who is behind almost invariably will seek to alter
the dynamic by discrediting his or her opponent.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the impeachment imbroglio, politicians are
especially sensitive to the accusation that they would rather
slaughter their enemies than save the republic. So the trick now is
to deploy attack strategies without seeming to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Nicholson, chairman of the Republican National Committee,
recently warned his party's contenders that they risk ``a
bloodbath'' unless they abide Ronald Reagan's 11th Commandment:
``Thou shalt not speak ill of a fellow Republican.''
</P>
<P>
   But David Axelrod, a veteran Democratic strategist in Chicago,
said that may be for naught. ``We've heard about the 11th
Commandment for a decade,'' he said, ``but the First Commandment of
politics is: `Thou shall not lose!'''
</P>
<P>
   Politicians can promise not to go negative and then go negative
anyway because they hold divergent views of what constitutes an
out-of-bounds remark or advertisement. Asked to define negative
campaigning, Rep. John Kasich of Ohio, who is seeking the
Republican nomination, was not entirely joking last week when he
replied, ``Any attacks made on me!''
</P>
<P>
   No candidate, of course, likes to fess up to going too far after
an opponent. A prime example is Steve Forbes, who pumped roughly
$35 million of his personal fortune into commercials that bashed
his opponents in 1996. His attacks were so thermonuclear that his
brief burst of support in the polls began to hemorrhage, leaving
opponents (using his given name) to deride Forbes as ``Malcolm the
Mudslinger.''
</P>
<P>
   In New Hampshire in February 1996, Forbes conceded that he had
``spent too much time talking about the inconsistencies and
shortcomings of my opponents.'' He added, ``When you make a
mistake, you learn from it.''
</P>
<P>
   But last week Forbes, who is making a second try for the
nomination, was at it again: He began running radio commercials in
the pivotal states of Iowa and New Hampshire, accusing Gore of
``hiding while his liberal friends do his dirty work'' _ attacking
Republicans on abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Upon reflection, Forbes insisted that he was not out of line
last time. ``To me, the 11th Commandment means no personal attacks,
talking about rumors, drinking, that sort of thing,'' he said.
``Our ads were about issues, particularly the tax issue. And unlike
other campaigns, which should remain nameless, we never did phone
calls in the middle of the night, `If you vote for Mr. X, you know
he poisons cats.''' (Forbes' commercials also delved into such
matters as raising questions about the financial practices of his
opponents.)
</P>
<P>
   While Kasich said he would never make personal attacks, he
pleaded ignorance when asked whether the Forbes commercials in 1996
were appropriate. ``What my problem is, is I don't watch a lot of
television,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain argued that Forbes served as a case study in negative
campaigning. ``What's the definition of a negative ad?'' he asked.
``I remember the Forbes campaign commercials: `August something,
1991. Bob Dole voted for a gondola in Idaho!' When asked, the
Forbes campaign said, `Well, that's his voting record.' Well, it
wasn't his voting record. It was an omnibus goddamn appropriations
bill that had nothing to do with the gondola!''
</P>
<P>
   For all of McCain's indignation, Darrell West, a professor of
political science at Brown University, said he was not convinced
that the senator would stay on the high road. ``I'll believe it
when I see it,'' West said.
</P>
<P>
   Recalling how George Bush ridiculed Michael Dukakis in the 1998
campaign _ and Dukakis never responded _ West said: ``Nobody wants
to get Dukakis-ized. Nobody wants to be the candidate who is
attacked but doesn't respond, because the risk in that situation is
that the negatives will stick.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Since elections are inherently comparative exercises, the
question always comes down to how much comparing a candidate should
do. Tone is important, too; Does ominous music transform a
commercial into a negative commercial?
</P>
<P>
   By promising not to engage in negative campaigning, candidates
try to persuade voters that they are above sinking into mud. Former
Gov. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee cultivated such an image, but he
has not ruled out running negative advertisements in his current
campaign, arguing that his failure to respond to attacks cost him
the New Hampshire primary in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander neglects to tell people that he ran the first negative
advertisement in New Hampshire in 1996, attacking then-Gov. Pete
Wilson of California on the radio for increasing taxes and pledging
to serve a second full term as governor.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic contest has the potential to get nasty as well.
Gore has a Boy Scout reputation, but he first raised the issue of
Massachusetts' prison furloughs in a debate in the 1988 primaries.
Bush's supporters picked up the idea and cited the furlough of
Willie Horton in perhaps the most devastating commercials against
Dukakis in the general election.
</P>
<P>
   Kyle McSlarrow, Quayle's campaign chairman, said that maybe
campaigning will be cleaner in 2000. ``All of us watched what
happened to Bob Dole when he was running out of money as he was
getting pounded right and left _ he couldn't get off the mat for
months,'' he said. ``Nobody wants whoever the nominee is to get
wounded again.''
</P>
<P>
   But those who cling to Reagan's approach should be mindful that
he was no shrinking violet. In scathing remarks about President
Gerald Ford's foreign policy in March of 1976, Reagan accused him
of ``a timid, vacillating and divided leadership.'' The father of
the 11th Commandment had violated it.

FOR CAR THIEVES, A TECHNOLOGICAL ARMS RACE 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.) (The Week in Review) 
(lb) 
 By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ The end of the Cold War has had many unexpected
effects, but few are as surprising as the arms race that has
developed between the people who make cars and the people who steal
them.
</P>
<P>
   Discouraging car thieves used to be relatively simple. Until the
late 1980s, the biggest problem involved youths who hot-wired cars
for joy rides. Even small alterations in vehicle design, like
changing door locks, could dissuade some of these thieves, or at
least prompt them to choose another car to steal.
</P>
<P>
   But tearing down the Berlin Wall and loosening totalitarian
controls across Eastern Europe and the former Soviet republics
changed the auto-theft business by opening up an enormous new
market for stolen cars. Thieves supplying this international
business have become more sophisticated, and so have the
countermeasures designed by automakers to stop them.
</P>
<P>
   While criminals have been stealing cars in the United States and
selling them in Latin America for years, the growth of an Eastern
European market has attracted criminal organizations with the
ability to ship large quantities of cars across oceans, according
to U.S. insurance officials.
</P>
<P>
   In New York City and elsewhere on the East Coast, expensive cars
and sport utility vehicles that are stolen and not recovered are
usually on their way to the Baltic ports of Estonia for resale
across the former Soviet Union, said Kim Hazelbaker, the senior
vice president of the Highway Loss Data Institute, which is
financed by auto insurers.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is even worse in Western Europe, where hot-wired
cars can be quickly taken across borders. In Germany, insurers will
provide theft coverage for only two-thirds of a car's value unless
it is equipped with the latest theft-deterrence equipment.
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, automakers responded to the fall of the Berlin Wall
by redesigning their cars during the early 1990s to make them
harder to steal. The design changes are now spreading to the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   The main design change has been the placement of a tiny radio
transponder inside the base of each key. When the key is turned in
the ignition, a weak electrical current from the car battery flows
through the lock, allowing the key to broadcast a coded signal with
a range of just 2 inches. The signal is detected by a sensor in the
steering column, which then permits the engine to be turned on.
Without the signal, even a hot-wired engine will not start.
</P>
<P>
   Thieves responded to the first such keys in the mid-1990s by
trying to transmit all of the available codes, which for some
models meant as few as a dozen combinations. But technology has
leaped ahead since then. Ford's keys now have 10 quadrillion
combinations, and engines will accept the correct combination only
if it is received within 0.0007 seconds after the electrical
current flows through the lock.
</P>
<P>
   Ford says it is not aware of any successful criminal efforts to
override this system, but it plans to start encrypting the codes
anyway for the next generation of Lincolns.
</P>
<P>
   When automakers add these engine-immobilizing devices to cars,
the theft rate drops by as much as two-thirds from one model year
to the next, according to insurers. But the rapid spread of the
technology has prompted thieves to up the ante, too. Professional
criminals increasingly rely on tow trucks and flatbed trucks.
Thieves replace the immobilizing devices on expensive stolen
vehicles destined for export with $400 worth of replacement parts.
</P>
<P>
   Some criminals simply resort to carjackings. ``If it's not going
to run without the key, they're going to walk up and put a gun to
your head and demand the key,'' said Edwin Sparkman, the senior
manager for vehicle theft at the National Insurance Crime Bureau,
an industry group.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department said this month that its surveys found
there were about 49,000 attempted carjackings a year from 1992 to
1996, and in half of those cases the criminal got away with the
car. This figure is twice as high as criminologists had expected,
but because of insufficient data the department was unable to
conclude whether the annual totals were rising or falling.
</P>
<P>
   Carjackings are a much bigger problem in some poorer countries,
notably South Africa, where one entrepreneur sells flame throwers
that are attached below a car's doors and are designed to
incinerate nearby assailants. U.S. auto engineers say they have no
plans to make any devices that would injure car thieves, pointing
out that such devices are illegal in the United States anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Carjackings still account for a tiny portion of all car thefts.
Federal statistics show that 1.35 million vehicles were stolen in
1997, the most recent year available, down 16 percent from the peak
in 1992, because less serious criminals have lost interest in car
theft. But the recovery rate for stolen cars has plunged as more
are shipped overseas.
</P>
<P>
   The National Insurance Crime Bureau estimated last week that
about 200,000 stolen vehicles were shipped out of the United States
in 1997, or nearly half of the 450,000 cars that were stolen that
year and never recovered. By comparison, the United States legally
imports about 2 million cars a year, and there are more than 200
million registered vehicles on the nation's roads.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Most of the vehicles stolen for export are hidden in the big
steel containers commonly seen now on trucks and flatbed rail cars
as well as cargo ships. Customs agents focus mostly on stopping
illegal imports, not exports, although the government has been
stepping up its efforts to find stolen vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   The stolen vehicles in greatest demand overseas are luxury sport
utility vehicles, like the Mercedes M-class and Lexus RX-300, which
can handle the bad roads in places like Russia, Colombia and China,
said Julie Rochman, a spokeswoman for the Insurance Institute for
Highway Safety, another industry group. Some foreigners even order
the theft of specific vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some drug lord in Colombia says, `I want a Mercedes
M-class,''' Ms. Rochman said, ``and poof, a Mercedes disappears in
San Antonio or San Diego and it shows up in Colombia in a crate.''
</P>
<P>
   There are many lists issued each year of the most frequently
stolen cars, but most fail to adjust for the number of each type of
vehicle already on the road. As a result, such lists tend to show
that Honda Accords and Toyota Camrys are stolen most often simply
because there are so many of these vehicles on the road.
</P>
<P>
   But when the number of registered vehicles of each model is
taken into account, a different picture emerges. ``If you don't
have a luxury car, a sports car or a sport utility vehicle, you're
not really at risk,'' except in high-crime neighborhoods,
Hazelbaker said.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest loser in the arms race has been the teen-ager who
used to be able to hot-wire a car for a quick joy ride but now has
little hope of success.
</P>
<P>
   A once-popular theory of history held that Rome fell because
China built a wall. In other words, the construction of the Great
Wall of China forced nomadic peoples outside the wall to turn their
attention westward, eventually destroying the Roman Empire. The
peculiarity of auto theft in the United States today is that joy
riding is disappearing partly because Berliners tore down a wall.

if it is received within 0.0007 seconds after the electrical
current flows through the lock.
</P>
<P>
   Ford says it is not aware of any successful criminal efforts to
override this system, but it plans to start encrypting the codes
anyway for the next generation of Lincolns.
</P>
<P>
   When automakers add these engine-immobilizing devices to cars,
the theft rate drops by as much as two-thirds from one model year
to the next, according to insurers. But the rapid spread of the
technology has prompted thieves to up the ante, too. Professional
criminals increasingly rely on tow trucks and flatbed trucks.
Thieves replace the immobilizing devices on expensive stolen
vehicles destined for export with $400 worth of replacement parts.
</P>
<P>
   Some criminals simply resort to carjackings. ``If it's not going
to run without the key, they're going to walk up and put a gun to
your head and demand the key,'' said Edwin Sparkman, the senior
manager for vehicle theft at the National Insurance Crime Bureau,
an industry group.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department said this month that its surveys found
there were about 49,000 attempted carjackings a year from 1992 to
1996, and in half of those cases the criminal got away with the
car. This figure is twice as high as criminologists had expected,
but because of insufficient data the department was unable to
conclude whether the annual totals were rising or falling.
</P>
<P>
   Carjackings are a much bigger problem in some poorer countries,
notably South Africa, where one entrepreneur sells flame throwers
that are attached below a car's doors and are designed to
incinerate nearby assailants. U.S. auto engineers say they have no
plans to make any devices that would injure car thieves, pointing
out that such devices are illegal in the United States anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Carjackings still account for a tiny portion of all car thefts.
Federal statistics show that 1.35 million vehicles were stolen in
1997, the most recent year available, down 16 percent from the peak
in 1992, because less serious criminals have lost interest in car
theft. But the recovery rate for stolen cars has plunged as more
are shipped overseas.
</P>
<P>
   The National Insurance Crime Bureau estimated last week that
about 200,000 stolen vehicles were shipped out of the United States
in 1997, or nearly half of the 450,000 cars that were stolen that
year and never recovered. By comparison, the United States legally
imports about 2 million cars a year, and there are more than 200
million registered vehicles on the nation's roads.
</P>

<P>
   Most of the vehicles stolen for export are hidden in the big
steel containers commonly seen now on trucks and flatbed rail cars
as well as cargo ships. Customs agents focus mostly on stopping
illegal imports, not exports, although the government has been
stepping up its efforts to find stolen vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   The stolen vehicles in greatest demand overseas are luxury sport
utility vehicles, like the Mercedes M-class and Lexus RX-300, which
can handle the bad roads in places like Russia, Colombia and China,
said Julie Rochman, a spokeswoman for the Insurance Institute for
Highway Safety, another industry group. Some foreigners even order
the theft of specific vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some drug lord in Colombia says, `I want a Mercedes
M-class,''' Ms. Rochman said, ``and poof, a Mercedes disappears in
San Antonio or San Diego and it shows up in Colombia in a crate.''
</P>
<P>
   There are many lists issued each year of the most frequently
stolen cars, but most fail to adjust for the number of each type of
vehicle already on the road. As a result, such lists tend to show
that Honda Accords and Toyota Camrys are stolen most often simply
because there are so many of these vehicles on the road.
</P>
<P>
   But when the number of registered vehicles of each model is
taken into account, a different picture emerges. ``If you don't
have a luxury car, a sports car or a sport utility vehicle, you're
not really at risk,'' except in high-crime neighborhoods,
Hazelbaker said.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest loser in the arms race has been the teen-ager who
used to be able to hot-wire a car for a quick joy ride but now has
little hope of success.
</P>
<P>
   A once-popular theory of history held that Rome fell because
China built a wall. In other words, the construction of the Great
Wall of China forced nomadic peoples outside the wall to turn their
attention westward, eventually destroying the Roman Empire. The
peculiarity of auto theft in the United States today is that joy
riding is disappearing partly because Berliners tore down a wall.

<P>
   President Clinton's argument, enticing in its simplicity,
packages the bombing of Yugoslavia's armed forces as a humanitarian
mission: It is meant, he says, to halt a murderous campaign against
innocent ethnic Albanians who make up 90 percent of the 2 million
people living in the Serbian province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But in trying to bring the Serbs to heel, NATO has unwittingly
married itself to a new partner. It is the Kosovo Liberation Army,
an armed group whose goals include not only independence but the
expulsion of Serbs from the province. A little more than a year ago
it was dismissed by a senior U.S. diplomat, Robert Gelbard, as a
``terrorist group'' and its insistence on armed resistance has
deepened the crisis and propelled Kosovo into warfare.
</P>
<P>
   In the catalog of horrors that have befallen Yugoslavia, the
Kosovo Liberation Army is one of the lesser plagues. The danger to
stability presented by President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia
is far greater than anything within its power.
</P>
<P>
   But the fact that this group has emerged to speak for Kosovo's
Albanians, and the bombing by NATO of Serbian targets on their
behalf, reveals a great deal about the moral ambiguities
confronting outsiders who wade into the Balkans to halt the killing
and ethnic cleansing begun a decade ago by Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   The KLA began on the radical fringe of Kosovar Albanian
politics, originally made up of diehard Marxist-Leninists (who were
bankrolled in the old days by the Stalinist dictatorship next door
in Albania) as well as by descendants of the fascist militias
raised by the Italians in World War II.
</P>
<P>
   It has no ideology beyond a drive to liberate Kosovo from Serb
rule, but its leaders have long championed the quixotic goal of a
``Greater Albania'' reaching into Albania, Macedonia, Serbia and
Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   Though its atrocities pale next to the rampages of the Serbs, it
has shown little tolerance for its ethnic rivals, carrying out
random kidnappings and executions and burning Serb villages.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic embarked on his nationalist drive, stoking hatreds
between Serbs and other ethnic groups in the former Yugoslavia, in
Kosovo in 1987. Yet it took a decade, with the Serbs running Kosovo
like a colonial outpost, before Kosovar Albanians turned to
violence.
</P>
<P>
   Even after Milosevic revoked the province's autonomy in 1989, a
moderate leadership under a self-styled president, Ibrahim Rugova,
maintained a fragile peace. It did so by pretending to exercise
autonomy, delivering some services and forbidding street protests,
while the Serbian government pretended to have full control.
</P>
<P>
   The Kosovo Liberation Army, whose very existence was in dispute
among U.S. diplomats until the uprising last year, consisted of a
few ragtag bands that walked around remote villages in motley
uniforms and shot the odd police officer.
</P>
<P>
   Then, a year ago, Milosevic set out to eradicate the armed
bands, and his security forces surrounded Prekaz, a town where Adam
and Hamza Jashari, founding members of the KLA, were holed up with
dozens of armed supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Double-barreled 20-mm anti-aircraft guns and .50-caliber machine
guns pounded the stucco and brick homes for three days. More than
50 people were killed, nearly half of them women and children.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities in Belgrade naively assumed they had wiped out
the resistance group. In fact, the raid triggered a province-wide
rebellion. Suddenly, it seemed, everyone in Kosovo was a charter
member of the KLA. Most of Rugova's local officials, tired of
international indifference to Serb repression and abuse, became
village commanders. His party disintegrated.
</P>
<P>
   Commanders seemed to sprout like mushrooms and nominal leaders
had no control over forces acting in the name of the guerrilla
group in the next village. The chaos was aggravated by a flood of
weapons that poured over the border from northern Albania, where
armories had been looted after an economic meltdown in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Volunteers from among the 600,000 ethnic Albanians who send home
money from abroad left their menial jobs as dishwashers and
construction workers in Germany and Switzerland and flocked to
northern Albania. They were handed uniforms and weapons and sent
over the mountains to join the fight.
</P>
<P>
   There are now an estimated 30,000 automatic weapons in the hands
of the force of several thousand fighters, plus anti-tank weapons
and light mortars. But while some special fighting units have been
set up, there remains no central command. The Kosovo Liberation
Army is a state of mind, not a tight organization.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, this is not simply a rebellion by Albanians against
Serbs, but by a new generation of Kosovar Albanians against the
intellectuals and urban elite in Pristina. Kosovo has the highest
birth rate in Europe, and 70 percent of the population is under 30.
Couple this with the 70 percent unemployment rate and the result is
a vast pool of disenchanted youth from which the guerrilla army can
recruit.
</P>
<P>
   These fighters, by and large, differ from their elders in that
they do not speak Serbo-Croatian, have no loyalties to the Serbian
state and have contact with Serbs only at checkpoints or jails.
</P>
<P>
   Last winter, when international negotiators sought a peace
agreement between Milosevic's government and the Kosovar Albanians,
they turned to the Kosovo Liberation Army, hoping to blunt its
drive for independence.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually it signed on to the terms, which include a three-year
period for Kosovo to be a NATO protectorate. But it has not given
up its central goal of eventual independence _ a goal the Clinton
administration has steadfastly said it does not agree with.
</P>
<P>
   And while the group accepted a phased plan to disarm once NATO
forces can be deployed to safeguard a truce, it is unlikely that
after three years of preparation for war, many weapons would be
turned over.
</P>
<P>
   One reason the international community had to turn to the Kosovo
Liberation Army was that by the time the world woke up to the
conflict in Kosovo, there was no political center left.
</P>
<P>
   So U.S. officials have been left trying to portray the Albanians
as innocents, when in fact their leaders are nationalists who have
retreated very little from positions once described as extreme. In
the long history of Balkan nationalist movements, pressure has
sometimes nudged such militants from more extreme tactics, but it
has rarely if ever extinguished their goals of building nationalist
states.
</P>
<P>
   So, as happened in Croatia and Bosnia before, the West now has
no choice but to make common cause with one such nationalist group
to oppose another nationalist group, Milosevic's government, that
is clearly more destructive.

 By YOUSSEF M. IBRAHIM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   VIENNA, Austria _ When Arabs united in 1973 to slap an oil
embargo on the United States because it had supported Israel, the
international oil cartel known as OPEC fell into line and shock
waves reached every continent.
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, Iran's Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini launched a second
oil shock when he telegraphed his consuming wrath at the ``Great
Satan'' by slashing oil production in half. Again, the political
passion behind the action drew OPEC's cooperation. Oil prices
quadrupled in months.
</P>
<P>
   But for the next 20 years, the oil-producing countries fell into
disunity, losing their ability to panic the world by boosting oil
prices at will.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, all of that seemed to change _ or at least the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries tried to give that
impression _ as OPEC's members rediscovered the appeal of political
unity.
</P>
<P>
   Pushing aside technocrats and oil ministers who wanted
production kept high, they decreed a cut in production of about 3
percent. They hope this will lift the rock-bottom prices to which
oil has fallen in recent years, savaging the economic hopes of
once-haughty countries like Saudi Arabia and Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
   Why now? The answer, in large measure, is in the political
climate. In the 1970s a measure of anti-American sentiment could be
counted on in virtually all of the Middle East, which dominated
OPEC. Then, in the 1980s and 1990s, divisions among the Middle
Eastern oil producers (and alliances with the United States after
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait) became much more important, even as new
non-OPEC oil production came on line in Alaska and the North Sea.
</P>
<P>
   But now a new political factor is at play _ the political cost
of low oil prices. This is uniting OPEC's members, overcoming at
least some of their rivalries, and attracting new allies like
Norway and Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The price fall has been so steep that it has become, in the
words of an OPEC minister, ``a matter of state.'' The 11 countries
of OPEC saw their collective revenues from oil drop by a third last
year. Oil companies laid off hundreds of thousands of workers
worldwide as their profits sank by 40 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
   In Mexico, Nigeria, Venezuela, Algeria, and even in the world's
largest oil producer, Saudi Arabia, shrunken budgets are straining
social and political cohesion. Even in the United States, oil
companies dismissed 50,000 employees last year and U.S. oil
production fell by 500,000 barrels a day to a new low of 5.9
million.
</P>
<P>
   Driven by this unraveling, foreign ministers and heads of state
from Saudi Arabia, Iran, Mexico, Algeria, Norway and Russia engaged
last January in a whirlwind campaign of phone calls and meetings.

<P>
   The result was a carefully choreographed meeting in Vienna,
lasting less than an hour, to announce a 2.1 million-barrel-a-day
reduction in the world's oil production for a year. This comes on
top of an earlier reduction last year of 3 million barrels a day.

   The ascension of Mohammed Khatami to the presidency of Iran and
the rising power of Crown Prince Abdullah in Saudi Arabia as the
ailing King Fahd slips into the background have brought two
pragmatic figures to the fore.
</P>
<P>
   For the prince, the notion of having two powerful enemies, Iraq
and Iran, nearby was becoming intolerable at a time when lower
revenues had forced Saudi Arabia to cut defense spending by some 22
percent. And the fall in revenues had weakened Khatami's hand in
his tug-of-war with sterner clerics who do not agree that Iran
should interact more with the outside world.
</P>
<P>
   One result of these two leaders' efforts to talk was that Saudi
Arabia moved away from a production level of 8 million barrels a
day that it had considered nearly sacrosanct since 1990. And Iran
stopped obstructing a deal within OPEC by agreeing to a cut of
300,000 barrels a day.
</P>
<P>
   Once this was worked out by their foreign and oil ministers, the
deal was sealed in telephone negotiations in which other OPEC
members and Mexico, Norway and Venezuela were brought on board.
</P>
<P>
   As always, there are wild cards in this deal. One is forlorn,
angry Iraq, which said it would not take part. Under the United
Nations' oil-for-food sanction regime, Iraq has nearly tripled its
oil production in the last year to 2.7 million barrels a day. The
Iraqis say they will continue to pump more oil, but their ability
to do so may be limited by their inability to get cash and spare
parts.
</P>
<P>
   There is also the temptation for many of poorer countries to
break ranks once oil prices start to rise. And there is the Asian
economic crisis, which may keep demand for oil down.
</P>
<P>
   But OPEC says if more cuts are needed, it will decree them. And
its members say they have learned the lesson of drowning oil
markets in oil.

CHEAP OIL FOCUSES MINDS

<P>
   VIENNA, Austria _ When Arabs united in 1973 to slap an oil
embargo on the United States because it had supported Israel, the
international oil cartel known as OPEC fell into line and shock
waves reached every continent.
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, Iran's Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini launched a second
oil shock when he telegraphed his consuming wrath at the ``Great
Satan'' by slashing oil production in half. Again, the political
passion behind the action drew OPEC's cooperation. Oil prices
quadrupled in months.
</P>
<P>
   But for the next 20 years, the oil-producing countries fell into
disunity, losing their ability to panic the world by boosting oil
prices at will.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, all of that seemed to change _ or at least the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries tried to give that
impression _ as OPEC's members rediscovered the appeal of political
unity.
</P>
<P>
   Pushing aside technocrats and oil ministers who wanted
production kept high, they decreed a cut in production of about 3
percent. They hope this will lift the rock-bottom prices to which
oil has fallen in recent years, savaging the economic hopes of
once-haughty countries like Saudi Arabia and Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
   Why now? The answer, in large measure, is in the political
climate. In the 1970s a measure of anti-American sentiment could be
counted on in virtually all of the Middle East, which dominated
OPEC. Then, in the 1980s and 1990s, divisions among the Middle
Eastern oil producers (and alliances with the United States after
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait) became much more important, even as new
non-OPEC oil production came on line in Alaska and the North Sea.
</P>
<P>
   But now a new political factor is at play _ the political cost
of low oil prices. This is uniting OPEC's members, overcoming at
least some of their rivalries, and attracting new allies like
Norway and Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The price fall has been so steep that it has become, in the
words of an OPEC minister, ``a matter of state.'' The 11 countries
of OPEC saw their collective revenues from oil drop by a third last
year. Oil companies laid off hundreds of thousands of workers
worldwide as their profits sank by 40 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
   In Mexico, Nigeria, Venezuela, Algeria, and even in the world's
largest oil producer, Saudi Arabia, shrunken budgets are straining
social and political cohesion. Even in the United States, oil
companies dismissed 50,000 employees last year and U.S. oil
production fell by 500,000 barrels a day to a new low of 5.9
million.
</P>
<P>
   Driven by this unraveling, foreign ministers and heads of state
from Saudi Arabia, Iran, Mexico, Algeria, Norway and Russia engaged
last January in a whirlwind campaign of phone calls and meetings.
</P>

   WASHINGTON _ The most expensive warplane ever built, the $2
billion B-2 stealth bomber, made its combat debut against
Yugoslavia last week after more than a decade of controversy over
its costs and abilities. But the truly remarkable aircraft taking
part in NATO's strikes was not the newest but the oldest: the B-52.
</P>
<P>
   Eight of the long, lumbering B-52H Stratofortress bombers have
been pounding targets across Yugoslavia from a base in England.
Three months ago, B-52s hammered Iraq from the Indian Ocean. During
the Persian Gulf war in 1991, B-52s dropped a third of the total
tonnage of bombs.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-seven years after the last of them rolled off the
production line, the B-52 remains the workhorse of the Air Force,
old and slow, but still able to deliver a punch. And incredibly,
the last of the 76 B-52s still flying are not expected to retire
until 2044. Those that make it that long will be 82 years old.
</P>
<P>
   The key to the bomber's longevity has been its ability to adapt.
The first of them, known as B-52Bs, entered service in 1955. Their
original mission was to fly high enough to avoid Soviet air
defenses as they waged nuclear war. When the Soviets built missiles
that could shoot them down, later models were adapted to fly low
instead.
</P>
<P>
   The latest and last model _ the B-52H _ has undergone constant
remodeling since being built between 1960 and 1962. These B-52s
have new engines, new avionics, new electronics and, most
important, new weapons. Imagine having a '57 Chevy with all the
latest automotive innovations.
</P>
<P>
   Today's B-52s are outfitted with as many as 20 air-launched
cruise missiles, each weighing a ton. These missiles _ used in last
week's raids _ allow the bombers to attack far from their targets.
</P>
<P>
   That limited role has led some to question the Air Force's plans
to rely on them for another four decades. ``It only works if you
can essentially keep it a couple hundred miles out of harm's way,''
said Michael O'Hanlon, an analyst at the Brookings Institution in
Washington. ``It's a bus.''
</P>
<P>
   But in a day of outrageously expensive projects, B-52s have a
tremendous advantage. Built for only $74 million apiece, they are a
bargain.

NOUGH ABOUT FEMINISM _ SHOULD I WEAR LIPSTICK? 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.) (The Week in Review) 
(lb) 
 By ALEX KUCZYNSKI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the January issue of Glamour magazine reached its 2.2
million readers, some may have been surprised to find this line
blaring from the cover: ``New for '99: You asked for it!
Horoscopes. Psychic details you need for your love, lust and work
life. Big Decisions!''
</P>
<P>
   The magazine _ once an influential voice in the feminist
movement because its gospel of modulated assertiveness appealed to
a large audience that was put off by the stridency of Ms. magazine
_ had dumped its ``Women in Washington'' column, which covered
political activity concerning women's issues. It had added
astrology.
</P>
<P>
   Glamour commonly ran articles like ``Let's Stop Lying About Day
Care'' and ``Excuse Me, Are Women Equal Yet? 18 Reasons Why We
Still Need Affirmative Action.'' Recently it featured an editorial
on e-mail privacy titled ``Why We Should All Get Down on Our Knees
and Thank Monica Lewinsky.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the sexual advice, a staple of women's magazines since the
heyday of Helen Gurley Brown at Cosmopolitan, has changed _ from
instruction on maximizing female or mutual pleasure, to guidance on
pleasing men.
</P>
<P>
   The change in Glamour, echoed in other women's magazines, is
part of a larger retreat _ not a backlash of men against women but
of women against feminism _ that vexes feminist theorists and
cheers conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   By virtue of the articles they choose to publish, youthful
women's magazines like Cosmopolitan, Glamour and Marie Claire seem
to argue that their reader doesn't want or need feminism; that she
doesn't care much about Washington or affirmative action, and that
she isn't terribly angry about being cheated out of day care.
</P>
<P>
   At the top of its March cover, Cosmopolitan features ``His
G-Spot.'' On its February cover: ``Be the best sex of his life.''
And this one: ``He Needs His Space? Why Guys in Love Say Scary
Things.'' (It would seem logical to think that the guy in question
is probably not in love if he needs his space, but in the world of
women's magazines, determination _ and learning about those G-spots
_ always wins out.) From January's Cosmopolitan: ``10
Make-Him-Throb Moves So Hot You'll Need a Firehose to Cool Down the
Bed.''
</P>
<P>
   Good Housekeeping features Maria Shriver on its current cover
promising that she will discuss ``Why forgiveness matters so much
in her marriage.''
</P>
<P>
   Marie Claire, which began publishing in 1996 with a modified
feminist tone and regular features on women's issues, now runs
articles like these: ``How Do Men See You?'' (September 1998);
``Sex Appeal: Do You Know Who He Finds Attractive?'' (December
1998); ``Men, Sex and You'' and ``What Men Think About Your Look''
(the current issue). One headline announces, ``Get a Better Body _
for Sex.'' Tellingly, Marie Claire is one of the great circulation
successes of the women's magazine categories, shooting up from
400,000 in 1996 to more than twice that now.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that American women seem to be buying these magazines
in increasing numbers points to an unsteady postfeminist
convergence in American attitudes toward feminism. The convergence
brings together magazine editors _ mostly liberal-leaning women who
consider themselves feminists _ and anti-feminists like the authors
of two recent books that argue that feminism has made women
unhappy.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the books, ``A Return to Modesty: Discovering the Lost
Virtue'' (Free Press), which was widely praised by conservatives,
the 23-year-old author Wendy Shalit argues that the sexual liberty
championed by the feminist movement is responsible for eating
disorders and other female troubles, and that men respect women who
won't accede to their sexual advances without putting up a fight.
</P>
<P>
   In the other book, ``What Our Mothers Didn't Tell Us: Why
Happiness Eludes the Modern Woman''(Simon &AMP; Schuster) 35-year-old
Danielle Crittenden, who studied decades of women's magazines in
preparation for her book, argues that if the truth about women can
be found in the magazines they read, feminism was a bad career
move. It taught women to expect to live freewheeling sexual lives,
which was a poor choice, she says, that has left her contemporaries
``even more miserable and insecure, more thwarted and obsessed with
men, than the most depressed, lithium-popping suburban readers of
the 1950s.''
</P>
<P>
   The political conservatives say the path to feminine fulfillment
lies within the orderly rows of family, child-rearing and
husband-pleasing. That view is starkly different from the one that
emerges from the pages of the women's magazines, which hold up Ms.
Lewinsky as the embodiment of the modern woman _ an
independent-minded odalisque, unshackled from sexual modesty and
constantly celebrating her zaftig sensuality.
</P>
<P>
   Yet authors like Ms. Shalit and Miss Crittenden, who attack the
gains of feminism by saying it promoted some sort of female
priapism, have become unlikely comrades-in-arms against feminism
with the magazine editors whose work they deplore. The editors
concede they are products of feminism, while the conservatives say
they are not. Yet both have dismissed it.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, some of the editors insist that feminism is alive
and well in their pages.
</P>
<P>
   Bonnie Fuller, 42, the editor in chief of Glamour, argues that
the lessons of feminism are now so densely woven into the cultural
fabric that readers don't need to revisit them, and that the
mainstream magazines no longer need to provide monthly monitoring
on the state of women's rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't speak for all women's magazines,'' Ms. Fuller said,
``but there are an enormous number of thought-provoking articles in
women's magazines and very much so in Glamour. We assign
investigative reporters, who do major articles on women's health
issues every single month.''
</P>
<P>
   This month, for example, there is an editorial about domestic
violence. And she pointed out that sexual advice is a product of
the women's movement. ``It would be unempowering for women not to
be able to read about sex as much as they wanted,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But Gloria Steinem, the editor of Ms. and arguably the last
reigning symbol of 1970s feminism, said she has been observing what
she considers to be a decade-long anti-feminist shift in women's
magazines away from coverage of women's issues and politics, and
even high-quality fiction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Advertisers in women's magazines have more influence than
ever, and don't want their ads to appear next to anything but
stories about celebrity and sex,'' she said. (Ms., which Ms.
Steinem reintroduces this month, does not carry advertising.)
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Steinem said such magazines offer sexual advice about
pleasing men as part of a larger movement toward making women feel
bad about themselves, and then fixing those imagined ills in the
pages of the magazines.
</P>
<P>
   ``So reading them becomes this self-fulfilling prophecy,'' she
said.

there were serious interviews and good writing.'' She added:
``Magazines today, especially under an editor like Bonnie Fuller,
sell beauty and sex and sex and more sex. That's all there is.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Shalit argues in her book that such magazines diminish
female power by advocating sexual helplessness and round-the-clock
availability.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're all breasts and lipstick and your performance in
bed,'' said Ms. Shalit, whose book cites articles in a half-dozen
women's magazines, including Glamour and Mademoiselle. ``There's
something so desperate about it. The thinking is that if you're not
currently in a sexual relationship, you're a real weirdo.''

   Miss Crittenden said Ms. Lewinsky is ``a total product of Cosmo
and Glamour. She goes in there and does what she did and thinks
she's a liberated woman, when she is, in fact, an unpaid hooker.''

   So while conservatives may be pleased that women's magazines
have backed away from overt feminism, the Lewinsky-ization that has
replaced it is not exactly what they had in mind.

CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE, NEGOTIATED 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.) (The Week in Review) 
(lb) 
 By DAN BARRY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For the last two weeks, Police Headquarters in New
York City has provided an austere backdrop for a recurring drama:
the daily noontime engagement between police officers in protective
gear and protesters decrying police misconduct and brutality. Each
session ends with the arrests of dozens of people for participating
in the time-honored act of civil disobedience.
</P>
<P>
   The protests, prompted by the death last month of an unarmed
black man struck by 19 of 41 bullets fired by four white officers,
are meant to recall memorable moments of struggle in American
history _ from Henry David Thoreau's refusal to pay a poll tax to
the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s use of nonviolent
confrontation in the fight for civil rights.
</P>
<P>
   But they also reflect the cordial choreography of street theater
that has come to define many demonstrations, with protesters and
police officers acting more like co-stars than adversaries.
</P>
<P>
   The daily protests, the backdrop to the four officers'
indictment for murder last week, have certainly created stirring
images for the evening news and the morning newspapers that go
beyond the novelty of showing Susan Sarandon and Ossie Davis in
custody.
</P>
<P>
   Each day, in fact, has brought portraits of dignified
nonresistance: of Kweisi Mfume, the president of the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People, his mouth a thin
line of determination; of former Mayor David Dinkins, his eyes
reflecting sorrow and defiance. Their faces contrasted effectively
with the masks of indifference worn by the arresting officers.
</P>
<P>
   Not captured in those images, however, were the offstage huddles
between lawyers for the protesters and high-ranking police
officials, often to confirm ground rules established in earlier
negotiations. The police politely explained that to get arrested on
charges of disorderly conduct the demonstrators would have to block
both entrances to the building.
</P>
<P>
   In turn, the demonstrators promised not to resist arrest. At
times the organizers have even provided the police with the names
of those planning to be arrested _ a thoughtful act designed to
expedite warrant checks and, ultimately, the release of the
conscientious scofflaws.

   ``That's the entente that's been worked out with the police,''
said Ronald Kuby, a lawyer with two decades of experience in civil
protest who has negotiated with the police on the parameters of the
demonstrations. ``Both sides have actually developed a relationship
where they've learned to deal with each other in a candid way.''

<P>
   Civil disobedience in the United States has matured since the
days of Thoreau. First came the influence of Gandhi, who advocated
a more coercive, confrontational approach to nonviolence _ in
particular, the participation of large numbers of people _ to
effect change.
</P>
<P>
   Then King, among others, introduced a liberal, Christian
sensibility to protest, as well as the recognition of the power of
images. A single photograph _ of fire hoses turned on civil rights
demonstrators by Police Commissioner Eugene ``Bull'' Connor in
Birmingham, Ala. _ could immediately convey the injustice of
segregation to the nation.
</P>
<P>
   James Tracy, the author of ``Direct Action: Radical Pacifism
From the Union Eight to the Chicago Seven'' (University of Chicago
Press, 1996), said that both Gandhi and King believed in being
candid with the authorities about their plans. That commitment to
openness, he said, was so prevalent by the early 1960s that peace
campaigners intent on obstructing the progress of a nuclear
submarine plant in Connecticut even allowed agents from the FBI to
attend their meetings.
</P>
<P>
   The anti-war protests of the late 1960s brought a more
confrontational style of civil disobedience to the fore, Tracy
said, one in which surprise was essential and negotiations with the
police were rejected. Since then, he said, ``A great deal of
tension over these two methods _ openness and surprise _ has tended
to break some organizations apart.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no question that many movements continue to adhere to
the ``surprise'' approach to disobedience _ with good reason,
according to Mark Hannay, a spokesman in New York for Act Up, an
AIDS protest group. ``Once you begin the negotiations process, all
of a sudden the power dynamic shifts so that the police try to
control and almost define what your event is going to be,'' he
said. ``All of a sudden it becomes not your event.''
</P>
<P>
   Chief Allan Hoehl, a police commander for the southern half of
Manhattan, has experienced both types of protests, and he obviously
prefers cooperation. ``When we meet with demonstrators, we ask
whether there's going to be civil disobedience,'' he said. ``If we
know when and how it's going to happen, we can make sure that no
one else jumps in, that there's no interference. It can go much
more smoothly.''
</P>
<P>
   But even in cases of coordination between protesters and the
police, neither side ever drops its guard. And both take comfort in
knowing that if necessary they can make life difficult for
everybody.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Kuby and Michael Hardy, the two lawyers helping the
Rev. Al Sharpton to organize the recent police protests, have made
it clear that the acts of civil disobedience are being staged in
front of police headquarters for symbolic purposes. And if the
police try to stop them, they and their hundreds of followers will
gladly stroll a few hundred yards to block traffic on Broadway _
inconveniencing motorists and requiring the services of many more
police officers.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, they know that such an action will come at a
cost. ``So when the demonstrators are done saying, `We'll do
this,''' Kuby explained, ``the police will say, `And when you're
done, we'll do what we want to do.''' At the very least, that can
mean dragging those arrested through a booking process that can
take 24 hours or more.
</P>
<P>
   That is why negotiations beforehand have become de rigueur for
protesters and police, Tracy explained. The action that results is
respectful of the law but emphasizes the need for a higher moral
principle. It is also so much easier.
</P>
<P>
   ``The police step in and say, `Those of you with children and
strollers, step away,' '' he said. ``Then newspaper people come
around, take pictures, and it's over.''

CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE, NEGOTIATED

(Repeating for all needing.) (The Week in Review) 
(lb) 
 By DAN BARRY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For the last two weeks, Police Headquarters in New
York City has provided an austere backdrop for a recurring drama:
the daily noontime engagement between police officers in protective
gear and protesters decrying police misconduct and brutality. Each
session ends with the arrests of dozens of people for participating
in the time-honored act of civil disobedience.
</P>
<P>
   The protests, prompted by the death last month of an unarmed
black man struck by 19 of 41 bullets fired by four white officers,
are meant to recall memorable moments of struggle in American
history _ from Henry David Thoreau's refusal to pay a poll tax to
the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s use of nonviolent
confrontation in the fight for civil rights.
</P>
<P>
   But they also reflect the cordial choreography of street theater
that has come to define many demonstrations, with protesters and
police officers acting more like co-stars than adversaries.
</P>
<P>
   The daily protests, the backdrop to the four officers'
indictment for murder last week, have certainly created stirring
images for the evening news and the morning newspapers that go
beyond the novelty of showing Susan Sarandon and Ossie Davis in
custody.
</P>
<P>
   Each day, in fact, has brought portraits of dignified
nonresistance: of Kweisi Mfume, the president of the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People, his mouth a thin
line of determination; of former Mayor David Dinkins, his eyes
reflecting sorrow and defiance. Their faces contrasted effectively
with the masks of indifference worn by the arresting officers.
</P>
<P>
   Not captured in those images, however, were the offstage huddles
between lawyers for the protesters and high-ranking police
officials, often to confirm ground rules established in earlier
negotiations. The police politely explained that to get arrested on
charges of disorderly conduct the demonstrators would have to block
both entrances to the building.
</P>
<P>
   In turn, the demonstrators promised not to resist arrest. At
times the organizers have even provided the police with the names
of those planning to be arrested _ a thoughtful act designed to
expedite warrant checks and, ultimately, the release of the
conscientious scofflaws.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the entente that's been worked out with the police,''
said Ronald Kuby, a lawyer with two decades of experience in civil
protest who has negotiated with the police on the parameters of the
demonstrations. ``Both sides have actually developed a relationship
where they've learned to deal with each other in a candid way.''

<P>
   You know about the Tower of Babel, the ambitious architectural
project that the Lord foiled in Genesis by rendering its
overreaching builders unable to communicate with one another. Now
consider its modern heir: the babble about towers spouted by
architects.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen A. Kliment, former editor of Architectural Record, says
that much of the time even he can't figure out what the heck
today's architects and other high-concept designers are talking
about. In his book ``Writing for Design Professionals'' (W.W.
Norton, 1998), he pleads for clarity in proposals, letters,
brochures and professional articles.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, every profession has its useful private shorthand, he
says, and architecture is no exception. But when you start talking
about decontextualizing your intrinsic modularity _ designer-babble
terms that Kliment says he has encountered _ you know your
profession's in trouble linguistically.
</P>
<P>
   Below are some longer passages collected by Kliment for this
article.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS) From ``Culture, Merchandise, or Just Light
Entertainment? New Architecture at the Millennium'' by Bruce Thomas
of Lehigh University, in the May 1997 issue of the Journal of
Architectural Education:(END ITALICS)
</P>
<P>
   Now, as the ``simulacrum'' continues to gain currency in
architectural theory and as the map of culture is being recharted
into cyberspace, tinkering with the architectural design process is
more than merely a matter of exchanging juxtaposition for
synthesis. Humanism may, as Eisenman and others so glibly contend,
already be gone, but its replacement is at best a highly
speculative alternative. As the raw power of media plays an ever
larger role in shaping the intellectual basis for much of the
emerging millennium's culture, we run the risk of building a new
architecture not on substantial foundations, but according to a
debasement of humanist ideals, what might be described as ``tabloid
humanism.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS) Crystal clear enough for you? Then try ``Beyond
the Valley of Silicon Architecture'' in the current Harvard Design
Magazine, by Mitchell Schwarzer, professor of architectural history
at the California College of Arts and Crafts in San Francisco:(END
ITALICS)
</P>
<P>
   My aim here is to inquire into architecture's participation in
the construction of the information age in Silicon Valley. I intend
to situate the architecture of Santa Clara and San Mateo counties
within a theory of capitalist realism and analyses of the pragmatic
economics propelling development of the high technology office
campus. How does architecture operate free from history's burdens
and ideology's veils, yet beholden to utilitarian programs and
outrageous profit margins? What role does architecture have within
an information revolution where the notion of representation is
being radically redefined and dematerialized?
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS) The author's just warming up, continuing a few
paragraphs later:(END ITALICS)
</P>
<P>
   In other words, if experimental architecture is not possible on
high technology campuses for all the reasons discussed above,
couldn't architecture be split between calculated program and
incidental program, between functional, profitable office zones and
other enclosures, extensions, excavations, and escarpments that
respond to the landscape? Instead of architecture representing the
information age, or popular culture as Venturi would have it,
couldn't architecture be more of a flickering between utilitarian
practices and ludic transgression? This second architecture,
directed toward the resonances of landscape and not the symbolism
of a particular company, would appeal to most firms needing space
in the Valley, and might go a long way toward overcoming the
real-estate conundrum of exit strategies.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS) Asia too has its conundrums, real estate and
otherwise. And architecturally it's not having much fun either, as
Cherie Wendelken suggested last year in Thresholds 17, a journal
published by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's School of
Architecture:(END ITALICS)
</P>
<P>
   In recent years a new identity has emerged for Asia in
contemporary architectural discourse. In the writing of Rem
Koolhaas and others, Asia as an idea has become ephemerality,
megaform, placelessness, globalization. These notions displace _
even invert _ earlier European and American constructs of Asia as a
timeless or ancient non-modern realm against which to measure the
modern. Yet strangely, the new idea of Asia constructs an
embodiment of the postmodern _ a place of another extreme where
history is willfully abandoned, visual meaning is casually
discursive, and all built form is tentative. The city of Tokyo
becomes a discourse about ephemerality. The rebuilding of Singapore
becomes an emblem of cultural tabula rasa and bigness.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS) It's enough to make you fear for the future of
the profession. And maybe you should. In the November 1997 Journal
of Architectural Education, Kelly Carlson-Redding of the University
of North Carolina employs the architect lingo of today to write of
the challenges facing the architects of tomorrow:(END ITALICS)
</P>
<P>
   Architecture students today face a variety of complex and often
contradictory models of materiality in architecture. Ideas about
``honest'' materials and rational tectonics are still touted by
modernist and neo-modernist educators and practitioners, while many
urban and suburban environments are inundated with both
well-constructed and shamefully constructed postmodern buildings _
thin-skinned compositions in which pattern making overrides
materiality and extravagance is often substituted for interest. ...
Resurgent interests in expressive tectonics have led to fetishistic
fixations on exaggerated elements of structure, construction and
building systems. ...
</P>
<P>
   As educators we are fortunate to work with architecture students
in a time so rich in variety and possibility, but amid this wealth
of divergent propositions it is imperative that we help students
order their own theoretical and instrumental position with regard
to questions of materiality.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS) But perhaps the most telling observation about
architect blather is the one made by a juror recently at a design
competition:(END ITALICS)

   How can you possibly rank national crises? Who's to say, ``Yep,
that one's an eight, but this has got to be a 10''? Do you measure
headline size, count talk-show references, or just throw up your
hands and await history's ruling?
</P>
<P>
   None of the above, to hear Frank Meeks tell it. Just follow the
pizza.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever matters of state overwhelm, matters of the belly must
be dealt with in the quickest, most instantly gratifying way
possible. ``When Washington is in crisis, pizza sales soar,'' said
Meeks, owner of 59 Domino's Pizza stores in the Washington area.
</P>
<P>
   So what exactly, on the pizza-crisis meter, are the biggies (not
appetite-adjusted, of course)? Well, the Capitol set its record _
1,500 Domino's pies _ on Impeachment Saturday, Meeks said. And when
the Lewinsky scandal broke, he said, ``things were rocking'' at the
White House _ to the tune of an unrivaled 900 pizzas a day,
compared with 50 on a typical day.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the Pentagon set its record: more than 800 pies.
``Right as the bombs went off,'' Meeks said, orders flooded in from
the Pentagon and the White House.
</P>
<P>
   But can any trend be spotted in the toppings chosen? Pepperoni
for spicy sex scandals, perhaps, or veggie-only for a health-care
crisis? No, said Meeks, ``but when there's a crisis, they load up
on the toppings.''

be dealt with in the quickest, most instantly gratifying way
possible. ``When Washington is in crisis, pizza sales soar,'' said
Meeks, owner of 59 Domino's Pizza stores in the Washington area.
</P>
<P>
   So what exactly, on the pizza-crisis meter, are the biggies (not
appetite-adjusted, of course)? Well, the Capitol set its record _
1,500 Domino's pies _ on Impeachment Saturday, Meeks said. And when
the Lewinsky scandal broke, he said, ``things were rocking'' at the
White House _ to the tune of an unrivaled 900 pizzas a day,
compared with 50 on a typical day.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the Pentagon set its record: more than 800 pies.
``Right as the bombs went off,'' Meeks said, orders flooded in from
the Pentagon and the White House.
</P>
<P>
   But can any trend be spotted in the toppings chosen? Pepperoni
for spicy sex scandals, perhaps, or veggie-only for a health-care
crisis? No, said Meeks, ``but when there's a crisis, they load up
on the toppings.''

   Oscar's Hangover
</P>
<P>
   As a four-hour endurance contest, the 71st annual Academy Awards
seemed even longer than usual. By the time it was over, the
question of the night was, what were former Sen. John Glenn and
Gen. Colin Powell doing on stage? No one knew.
</P>
<P>
   The big upset was ``Shakespeare in Love,'' beating the
front-runner, ``Saving Private Ryan.'' Miramax, the
quasi-independent company owned by Disney, won 10 Oscars, including
three for Roberto Benigni's ``Life Is Beautiful.'' Gwyneth Paltrow
won best actress and Judi Dench best supporting actress for
``Shakespeare in Love,'' and James Coburn was voted best supporting
actor for ``Affliction.''
</P>
<P>
   The aftermath of the awards was more fun than the show itself.
Miramax and Dreamworks continued sniping at one another over how
much money the other spent on its campaign for ``Shakespeare in
Love'' and ``Saving Private Ryan.'' A photograph in the trade
papers showed the three owners of Dreamworks _ Steven Spielberg,
David Geffen and Jeffrey Katzenberg _ sitting together at a
post-Oscar party, looking somewhat unhappy.
</P>
<P>
   And Fernanda Montenegro, the Brazilian star who was nominated as
best actress for ``Central Station,'' had some blunt comments that
stung because many in Hollywood believed she was on target. She
told a Brazilian television interviewer that neither Ms. Paltrow
nor Benigni were especially worthy of the awards, and called Ms.
Paltrow ``this romantic figure, thin, pure, virginal.''

   For Detained Pinochet, A Partial Victory
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Augusto Pinochet's desire to end his house arrest in
England and return home to Chile got a boost when England's highest
court threw out the bulk of the charges that could be used in the
Spanish effort to extradite him to Madrid to stand trial for crimes
against humanity.
</P>
<P>
   The 83-year-old former Chilean dictator was arrested in October
and has been detained since then. His lawyers argued that the
lesser charges are not sufficient to hold him any longer.

   Jackson Says, `No Thanks'
</P>
<P>
   Campaign after campaign, supporters of the Rev. Jesse Jackson
greeted the civil rights leader with the rallying cry, ``Run Jesse
Run!''
</P>
<P>
   This time, he could not be enticed. Jackson, who has run twice
for president, announced he would sit out the 2000 contest, saying
he would rather concentrate on persuading corporations to invest in
minority businesses. ``The time spent running for president is time
that cannot be spent doing something else,'' he said. ``I've got so
many issues I want to raise. I've got so many battles left to
fight.''
</P>
<P>
   That leaves Vice President Al Gore with only one rival for the
Democratic nomination, former Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey.

   Dr. Bertrand Piccard and Brian Jones became the first
balloonists to circle the world nonstop. They were greeted in
Geneva by a thunderous cheer and a trumpeter playing the
``Triumphal March'' from ``Aida.''
</P>
<P>
   Piccard, 41, a Swiss psychiatrist, and his British co-pilot,
Jones, 52, completed a 19-day trip around the world in their
Breitling Orbiter 3 balloon when they flew over an invisible finish
line at 9 degrees 27 minutes west longitude in Mauritania, then
touched down in the soft sands of southern Egypt.

   More than a score of pilots had tried to go around the world in

   MIT Admits It's Tough on Women
</P>
<P>
   From Harvard to Stanford, top American universities are often
accused of discriminating against their female professors, and
usually respond with defensive denials. The Massachusetts Institute
of Technology took a different, more scientific approach: It
gathered the data, quantified the problem and verified its
existence.
</P>
<P>
   And now, the institute _ the most prestigious science and
technology school in the country _ has responded with an
extraordinary admission from its highest officials that, yes, women
on the faculty have been systematically, though unintentionally,
short-changed. It found pervasive evidence that women came up short
on everything from hiring and tenure to the allocation of critical
resources like research money and lab space.

   Cruise Line Takes a Plea
</P>
<P>
   Royal Caribbean Cruises pleaded guilty in federal court in Los
Angeles to three counts of making false statements to Coast Guard
inspectors in an attempt to conceal the illegal dumping of oily
waste water into the Pacific Ocean in 1994. Prosecutors believe the
unexpected admission reinforces United States jurisdiction over
foreign cruise ships. Royal Caribbean, the world's second-largest
cruise company, still faces potential dumping charges in New York
and Alaska. The industry is under congressional scrutiny on several
fronts, including whether to alter the tax-free status that saves
foreign ships plying U.S. waters billions of dollars a year.

   A Call for Changes in the 737

   The rudder system of the Boeing 737 should be changed, the
National Transportation Safety Board said, to meet one of the
simplest principles of aviation: that every crucial part have a
back-up. The recommendation for the world's most popular airliner
was based on investigations of two crashes and several smaller
mishaps, and could be among the most far-reaching the board has
ever made.
</P>
<P>
   The board blamed the crash of USAir flight 427, a 737 that went
down on approach to Pittsburgh in 1994, on the failure of a single
hydraulic valve that it said should be made ``reliably redundant.''

   Deficits have given way to surpluses, but budget politics in
Washington go on. Both the House and the Senate adopted Republican
tax-and-spending plans, putting Congress on a collision course with

   Republicans want to bolster Social Security and provide a big

tax cut. With the pie as big as it is, there is probably room for
compromise.

trade barriers and protection for state-owned industries.

   Now, the Chinese seem willing to play, and negotiations are
becoming furious in the run-up to Prime Minister Zhu Rongji's visit

cold feet. Amid charges of spying and human rights violations, some
wonder whether Congress will torpedo the whole deal.

UNCLE SAM IN TELEVISIONLAND: LESSONS NOT QUITE READY FOR PRIME
TIME 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.)  (The Week in Review)  
 (bl)  
 By JAMES STERNGOLD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ If some adults doubt how difficult it is to
deliver educational messages to children through television, they
should have attended a recent conference here on creating positive
programming. Some children, ages 11 to 14, were asked if they
watched Jerry Springer. They all said yes. Asked if the show was
staged, these young viewers, wise to the ways of manipulation, said
yes again, with several adding that the staging increased the
thrills.
</P>
<P>
   Children have never been more cynical about television, harder
to reach or as resistant to traditional programming than now, with
the proliferation of cable channels and the Internet. Yet this
comes at a time when the federal government has started an oddly
earnest experiment, a counterpoint to this age of deregulation,
requiring the networks to devote at least three hours a week to
educational programming. The rules specify the kinds of messages
that must be delivered and the age group at which they are aimed.
</P>
<P>
   The rules, passed by the Federal Communications Commission and
in effect for two seasons now, have created a quandary for network
executives, who are eager to comply but don't want to build, as one
executive said, a three-hour black hole in schedules that are
already being watched less and less by children whose taste for
irreverent humor, violence and other forms of entertainment has
made educational moralizing unappealing.
</P>
<P>
   The question is whether the cod-liver oil of educational
programming can compete with the french fries of pure
entertainment. Can Scholastic's ``The Magic School Bus'' on Fox
attract someone from Jerry Springer? So far, the answer seems to be
not yet.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of volume, the law has clearly met its goal. Federal
Communications Commission Chairman William Kennard, who
participated in the conference on positive programming held by the
the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences this month, said in an
interview that virtually all the stations in the country were in
compliance, some even offering four hours a week of educational
fare. The shows range from ``The Magic School Bus,'' an animated
program that teaches science to children 6 to 9 years old through
flights of fancy, to ``Hang Time,'' ``One World'' and ``Saved by
the Bell,'' dramas for teen-agers on NBC that frequently focus on
morals and relationships.
</P>
<P>
   But few children or teen-agers are actually tuning in, experts
say. According to Nielsen Media Research, the highest-rated
educational show, ``Hang Time,'' which airs at 10:30 Saturday
morning, is watched by only 2.8 percent of the households with
televisions this season. Popular cartoons and pure entertainment
shows frequently pull in almost twice that.
</P>
<P>
   Some argue that the shows' construction, which begins with the
curriculum and ends with the story, is antithetical to the creative
process. A compelling story, they say, should be paramount.
</P>
<P>
   This structural awkwardness was evident at an NBC seminar
recently held at a hotel here. Various experts taught writers of
the network's educational programs, which are aimed at teen-agers,
how to build in important lessons and still be creative.
</P>
<P>
   ``Keep thinking out of the box!'' exhorted Robin Schwartz, NBC's
executive in charge of the programs. Dr. Drew Pinsky, who offers
sexual advice on MTV's ``Loveline,'' added, ``To produce material
for teens, there cannot be a whiff of adult management of the
message. It has to be real.''
</P>
<P>
   But then Karen Hill-Scott, a child development expert and an
adult who manages the messages on every one of the NBC educational
programs, showed a series of pie charts on last season's shows with
precise statistics on their treatment of the ``socio-emotional
domain'' and ``the cognitive domain.'' In the future, she said, the
writers had to develop more programs around anti-drug and
anti-smoking messages, among other themes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've done everything but show the lungs of the kid who
smokes,'' said Peter Engel, the executive producer of the NBC
Saturday programs. ``It's very, very difficult to do these shows.
You've got to do them in informational and educational ways, but if
they're not entertaining, nothing happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Advocates of the programming say that, on the plus side, a new
market is emerging for material that enlightens. ``I do measure the
results of the law by the fact that there's a generation of
programming that wouldn't exist without it,'' said Jeff Chester,
executive director of the Center for Media Education, based in
Washington. ``At the very least, the programs are benign. They
aren't violent or exploitive.''
</P>
<P>
   Most experts agree it is impossible to measure whether the law's
real goal _ better educated children _ is being met, except in the
most general sense. ``This is like exercise,'' said Rep. Edward
Markey, D-Mass., one of the law's primary backers. ``We all know
you should exercise, and in the same way, kids should watch
educational television. I know it's not harmful, and I'm positive
it's helpful.''
</P>
<P>
   Many network executives say that if ``not harmful'' is the best
that can be expected, the money might be better spent elsewhere,
opening the television schedule to shows that more children might
actually view.
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly wouldn't be doing this much without the law,''
said CBS senior vice president Martin Franks. ``The rule has been a
wonderful success in terms of quantity.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``It's a little harder to judge whether it's been a
success in terms of quality. Because there's so much of this on the
air, the government has made it harder for a show to break through
the clutter. I'm not sure that's a great public policy outcome. You
might argue that we'd be better off funding scholarships with that
money.''
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the biggest criticism of the federal rules is the
claim that television is best suited to conveying lessons
informally rather than through pie charts or government mandates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't buy that the lessons have to be so formal,'' said
Meryl Marshall, chairman of the Academy of Television Arts and
Sciences and a speaker at the conference. ``What this seminar has
grown out of is a strong desire by the membership itself to be
conscious of what we want to convey. People's focus is not on
regulation, but it is on values.''

UNCLE SAM IN TELEVISIONLAND: LESSONS NOT QUITE READY FOR PRIME
TIME 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.)  (The Week in Review)  
 (bl)  
 By JAMES STERNGOLD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ If some adults doubt how difficult it is to
deliver educational messages to children through television, they
should have attended a recent conference here on creating positive
programming. Some children, ages 11 to 14, were asked if they
watched Jerry Springer. They all said yes. Asked if the show was
staged, these young viewers, wise to the ways of manipulation, said
yes again, with several adding that the staging increased the
thrills.
</P>
<P>
   Children have never been more cynical about television, harder
to reach or as resistant to traditional programming than now, with
the proliferation of cable channels and the Internet. Yet this
comes at a time when the federal government has started an oddly
earnest experiment, a counterpoint to this age of deregulation,
requiring the networks to devote at least three hours a week to
educational programming. The rules specify the kinds of messages
that must be delivered and the age group at which they are aimed.
</P>
<P>
   The rules, passed by the Federal Communications Commission and
in effect for two seasons now, have created a quandary for network
executives, who are eager to comply but don't want to build, as one
executive said, a three-hour black hole in schedules that are
already being watched less and less by children whose taste for
irreverent humor, violence and other forms of entertainment has
made educational moralizing unappealing.
</P>
<P>
   The question is whether the cod-liver oil of educational
programming can compete with the french fries of pure
entertainment. Can Scholastic's ``The Magic School Bus'' on Fox
attract someone from Jerry Springer? So far, the answer seems to be
not yet.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of volume, the law has clearly met its goal. Federal
Communications Commission Chairman William Kennard, who
participated in the conference on positive programming held by the
the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences this month, said in an
interview that virtually all the stations in the country were in
compliance, some even offering four hours a week of educational
fare. The shows range from ``The Magic School Bus,'' an animated
program that teaches science to children 6 to 9 years old through
flights of fancy, to ``Hang Time,'' ``One World'' and ``Saved by
the Bell,'' dramas for teen-agers on NBC that frequently focus on
morals and relationships.
</P>
<P>
   But few children or teen-agers are actually tuning in, experts
say. According to Nielsen Media Research, the highest-rated
educational show, ``Hang Time,'' which airs at 10:30 Saturday
morning, is watched by only 2.8 percent of the households with
televisions this season. Popular cartoons and pure entertainment
shows frequently pull in almost twice that.
</P>
<P>
   Some argue that the shows' construction, which begins with the
curriculum and ends with the story, is antithetical to the creative
process. A compelling story, they say, should be paramount.

SLAVERY'S TRUTHS (AND TALES) COME FLOCKING HOME

<P>
   Emancipation was declared in 1863, but it is in this last decade
of the 20th century that historians and writers are writing freely
about the brutality and violence of slavery _ taboo topics that
have silenced families, black and white, for centuries.
</P>
<P>
   A proliferating number of popular and scholarly books about
slavery are stripping away whatever is left of the velvety romance
of benign slaveholders presiding over docile slaves. And they are
emphasizing efforts of the enslaved to escape or rebel and the
punishments they faced that ranged from branding to amputation.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the bleaker information emerges from the faded pages of
court records and antebellum divorce petitions. But among the newly
published books are some milder views expressed in the memoirs of
planters' wives, old handwritten diaries and slave narratives.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some ways, the taboos have been lifted,'' said Lucinda
MacKethan, an English professor at North Carolina State University,
who helped arrange for the publication of ``Lyddy'' (University of
Georgia Press), an antebellum novel by a planter's wife, and
another wife's memoirs. ``For instance, talking about miscegenation
in families is no longer considered the horrible shaming thing that
it was.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a feeling, she added, ``that we don't know the full
story and we ought to go back and get it.''
</P>
<P>
   She added, ``We used to keep silent about it because there was a
social stigma attached to those things.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the burst in publishing about slavery has come in the
1990s, with 53 titles published last year and 16 published so far
this year, according to R.R. Bowker's Books in Print. In previous
decades, the yearly output of titles was less than 12 a year.
</P>
<P>
   But the current interest in slavery goes beyond that of
academics and historians. There are also amateur sleuths and
genealogists like Robert Newman, an Ohio civil rights lawyer who
discovered the handwritten memoir of John P. Parker, a former slave
and conductor on the Underground Railroad. Newman, who tracked the
autobiography to a university archive from a footnote in a doctoral
dissertation, used the $75,000 advance from publication of ``His
Promised Land'' (W.W. Norton &AMP; Co.) to purchase the Parker home in
Ripley, Ohio, for a museum.
</P>
<P>
   The National Underground Railroad Freedom Center is scheduled to
open in 2003 in Cincinnati. The $80 million building will include
interactive exhibits enabling visitors to experience what it was
like to be a slave.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you take a cover off of something that's been covered along
time, then you generate a lot of curiosity,'' said Ed Rigaud, the
president and chief executive of the Cincinnati center. ``We're
taking the cover off.''
</P>
<P>
   The literature on slavery has distinct periods beginning with
the political activism of abolitionists, who after the 1830s
published books describing the mistreatment of slaves. The
publications provoked slaveholders into publishing
counter-narratives that portrayed slaves as intelligent people who
loved being part of the plantation family.
</P>
<P>
   During the Great Depression, workers at the Works Progress
Administration collected the oral histories of aging former slaves,
but the results were bland because white interviewers conducting
the research avoided the painful questions of brutality, violence
and rape.
</P>
<P>
   Those topics were often forbidden for the descendants of slaves
and slaveowners themselves. ``It's a part of history that as a
black I wasn't familiar with myself,'' said Mary Young, an
associate professor of English and Black Studies at the College of
Wooster in Ohio, whose family just didn't talk about slavery. She
has edited two books of slave narratives published by Franklin
Watts, ``All My Trials,'' a collection of histories from women, and
``Testaments of Courage,'' a history of men.
</P>
<P>
   But there are curious gaps in these narratives, Professor Young
said. The women may have talked easily about ``sassing'' their
owners, but they declined to talk about sexual exploitation and
cruelty. She said she had to dig for stories about a slave whose
ear was nailed to a post or a runaway who was punished with the
amputation of a foot.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Runaway Slaves: Rebels on the Plantation'' (Oxford
University Press), historians John Hope Franklin and Loren
Schweninger examined the brutal side of slavery after years of
researching old civil court records, divorce petitions and
newspaper advertisements offering descriptions of runaway slaves.
</P>
<P>
   From the divorce records filed by plantation wives, a picture
emerged that it was ``widespread and not uncommon for slaveholders
to have interracial sex with slaves in their late teens and 20s,''
Schweninger said. The runaway notices often revealed vivid
descriptions of the missing slaves: scars, whip marks, cropped ears
or branding on the forehead or back.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the historians calculated that slaveowners had to
contend with frequent escapes; they estimated that each year more
than 50,000 of the 2 million adult slaves tried to run away either
to the North or deeper into the South to be reunited with relatives
sold to new owners. But few succeeded in their escape, perhaps less
than 5 percent, Schweninger said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a group of historians who believe that the vast
majority of slave owners were pious Christian men devoted to their
families,'' Schweninger said. ``I think people are going to take
umbrage at how we explore this, but we use evidence and the
evidence is overwhelming.''
</P>
<P>
   Edward Ball, whose book ``Slaves in the Family'' (Farrar, Straus
&AMP; Giroux) won the National Book Award for nonfiction last year,
knows firsthand how difficult it is to probe for information about
slavery. When he inquired into the history of his famous
slaveholding family, one cousin scolded him, saying, ``This will
court anger and it will divide people.'' When he interviewed
descendants of the Balls' slaves, one elderly woman explained the
logic for silence: ``The older parents come under such strain, with
slavery, until they didn't tell the children things they should
have told them.''
</P>
<P>
   Ball said his book lectures have turned into miniature town
meetings about race. ``The feeling I get is that people now welcome
the permission to talk about the hard stuff in my book,'' he said.
`` `Slaves in the Family' talks in thorough detail about the
purchase and sale of children, black and white sex, the slave
ships. It means that people want to find a way to talk about this
inheritance and the story I tell seems to help. There's too much
silence about it.''

   Editors: The following items from The N.Y. Times Week in Review
for Sunday, March 28, moved Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   _ On the dress page:
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-SERBS-REVIEW (Belgrade) _ Slobodan Milosevic rose to
power on the issue of the minority Serbs in Kosovo, the province
from which Serbs derive their defining myths of nationalism,
victimization and endurance. Kosovo is the Serbs' Jerusalem, the
holy touchstone and center of their existence as a nation despite
all the defeats and travails of history. It is so deeply ingrained
in Serbian mythology that the West seems to have miscalculated
Milosevic's ability to abandon the issue even if he wanted to. By
Steven Erlanger. (`i' category).
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-KLA-REVIEW (Undated) _ In trying to bring the Serbs to
heel, NATO has unwittingly married itself to the Kosovo Liberation
Army, which is widely seen as a terrorist group. Although the KLA's
atrocities are dwarfed by those of Serb leader Slobodan Milosevic,
the fact that it has emerged to speak for Kosovo's Albanians, and
the fact that NATO is bombing Serb targets in Kosovo, reveals a
great deal about the moral ambiguities facing outsiders who wade
into the Balkans. By Chris Hedges. (`i' category)
</P>
<P>
   NY-POLICE-PROTESTS-REVIEW (New York) _ The protests and arrests
at police headquarters have gotten much media coverage. Less
attention has been given to off-stage huddles between the
protesters' lawyers and police officials, often to discuss ground
rules. The police politely explained that to get arrested for
disorderly conduct, the demonstrators would have to block BOTH
entrances. In turn, the demonstrators promised not to resist
arrest. Organizers have even provided police with the names of
those planning to be arrested _ a thoughtful act designed to
expedite warrant checks and the release of the conscientious
scofflaws. By Dan Barry. (`a' category)
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moving in the `a' category
</P>
<P>
   CAMPAIGN-CONDUCT-REVIEW (Washington) _ If the candidates are to
be believed, the 2000 presidential campaign will be a high-toned,
polite affair. But while candidates sense that people are repulsed
by the vitriolic discourse in Washington _ and pollsters warn that
attacks can boomerang _ no one believes that the days of dirty,
dark politics are over. In this first post-impeachment campaign,
the trick will be to deploy attack strategies without seeming to do
so. By Richard L Berke.

   SLAVERY-BOOKS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Slavery ended in the 1860s, but
it is only the 1990s that historians and others are writing freely
about the brutality and violence of slavery _ taboo topics that
have silenced families, black and white, for centuries. A
proliferating number of popular and scholarly books about slavery
are stripping away what is left of the velvety romance of benign
slaveholders presiding over docile slaves. And they are emphasizing
the slaves' efforts to escape or rebel. By Doreen Carvajal.
</P>
<P>
   B52-REVIEW (Undated) _ The most remarkable aircraft taking part
in NATO's strikes at Serbia is also the oldest: the B-52.
Thirty-seven years after the last of them rolled off the production
line, the B-52 remains the workhorse of the Air Force, old and slow
but still able to deliver a terrific punch anywhere in the world.
And, incredibly, the last of the 76 B-52s still flying are not
expected to retire until 2044, when they will be 82 years old.
</P>
<P>
   CAR-THEFT-REVIEW (Detroit) _ The end of the Cold War has led to
an arms race between the people who make cars and the people who
steal them. It has changed the auto theft industry by opening up a
huge new market for stolen cars. Thieves supplying this business
have become more sophisticated; so have the counter-measures
designed by automakers to stop them. By Keith Bradsher.
</P>
<P>
   WOMEN'S-MAGS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Changes in Glamour, echoed in
other women's magazines, is part of a larger retreat _ not a
backlash of men against women but of women against feminism _ that
vexes feminist theorists and cheers conservatives. By virtue of the
articles they choose to publish, youthful women's magazines like
Cosmopolitan and Glamour seem to argue that their reader doesn't
want or need feminism; that she doesn't care much about Washington
or affirmative action, and that she isn't angry about being cheated
out of day care. By Alex Kuczynski.
</P>
<P>
   EDUC-TV-REVIEW (Los Angeles) _ The federal government has
started an oddly earnest experiment, a counterpoint to this age of
deregulation, requiring TV networks to devote at least three hours
a week to educational programming. The rules have created a
quandary for network executives, who want to comply but don't want
to build a three-hour black hole in schedules that are already
being watched less and less by children whose taste for irreverent
humor, violence and other forms of entertainment has made
educational moralizing unappealing. By James Sterngold.
</P>
<P>
   PIZZA-CRISIS-REVIEW (Undated) _ ``When Washington is in crisis,
pizza sales soar,'' says Frank Meeks, owner of 59 Domino's Pizza
stores in the D.C. area. When the Lewinsky scandal broke, the White
House was ordering an unrivaled 900 pizzas a day. The Capitol set
its record _ 1,500 pies _ on Impeachment Saturday. As the bombing
of Serbia began, the Pentagon set its record: over 800 pies. By
Hubert Herring.
</P>
<P>
   SHAKESPEARE-HEADLINES-TEXT-REVIEW (Undated) _ How have the media
been recycling the Bard-isms in the midst of Shakespeare's
pop-culture renaissance? Let us count the ways, with selected
newspaper headlines, starting with last week's Oscar awards, at
which `Shakespeare in Love' won Best Picture.
</P>
<P>
   ARCHITECT-TEXT-REVIEW (Undated) _ Stephen Kliment, former editor
of Architectural Record, says he often can't figure out what
today's architects and other high-concept designers are talking
about. In his book `Writing for Design Professionals,' he pleads
for clarity in proposals, letters, brochures and articles.

   THISWEEK-REVIEW (Undated) _ A look at the Oscars and some other
highlights of the week.

   OPEC-WHY-REVIEW (Vienna) _ OPEC and its oil embargoes had
considerable impact in the 1970s because a measure of anti-American
sentiment could be counted on. But in the '80s and '90s, divisions
among the Mideast oil producers (and alliances with the U.S. after
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait) became more important, even as new
non-OPEC oil production began in Alaska and the North Sea. Now a
new political factor has taken hold, uniting OPEC's members as
never before and overcoming much of their rivalries: the cost to
their countries of low oil prices. By Youssef Ibrahim.

   Editors: The following items from The N.Y. Times Week in Review
for Sunday, March 28, moved Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   _ On the dress page:
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-SERBS-REVIEW (Belgrade) _ Slobodan Milosevic rose to
power on the issue of the minority Serbs in Kosovo, the province
from which Serbs derive their defining myths of nationalism,
victimization and endurance. Kosovo is the Serbs' Jerusalem, the
holy touchstone and center of their existence as a nation despite
all the defeats and travails of history. It is so deeply ingrained
in Serbian mythology that the West seems to have miscalculated
Milosevic's ability to abandon the issue even if he wanted to. By
Steven Erlanger. (`i' category).
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-KLA-REVIEW (Undated) _ In trying to bring the Serbs to
heel, NATO has unwittingly married itself to the Kosovo Liberation
Army, which is widely seen as a terrorist group. Although the KLA's
atrocities are dwarfed by those of Serb leader Slobodan Milosevic,
the fact that it has emerged to speak for Kosovo's Albanians, and
the fact that NATO is bombing Serb targets in Kosovo, reveals a
great deal about the moral ambiguities facing outsiders who wade
into the Balkans. By Chris Hedges. (`i' category)
</P>
<P>
   NY-POLICE-PROTESTS-REVIEW (New York) _ The protests and arrests
at police headquarters have gotten much media coverage. Less
attention has been given to off-stage huddles between the
protesters' lawyers and police officials, often to discuss ground
rules. The police politely explained that to get arrested for
disorderly conduct, the demonstrators would have to block BOTH
entrances. In turn, the demonstrators promised not to resist
arrest. Organizers have even provided police with the names of
those planning to be arrested _ a thoughtful act designed to
expedite warrant checks and the release of the conscientious
scofflaws. By Dan Barry. (`a' category)

   _ Also moving in the `a' category
</P>
<P>
   CAMPAIGN-CONDUCT-REVIEW (Washington) _ If the candidates are to
be believed, the 2000 presidential campaign will be a high-toned,
polite affair. But while candidates sense that people are repulsed
by the vitriolic discourse in Washington _ and pollsters warn that
attacks can boomerang _ no one believes that the days of dirty,
dark politics are over. In this first post-impeachment campaign,
the trick will be to deploy attack strategies without seeming to do
so. By Richard L Berke.

   Antagonisms between Serbs and Albanians have marked Kosovo's
history since the disintegration of the Ottoman Empire. Christian
Serb forces seized the province in October 1912 during the first
Balkan War. Massive recriminations against local Muslim Albanians
followed, including the burning of villages and forced conversions,
which were described by reporters, including the Vienna
correspondent of the Ukrainian newspaper Kievskaia Mysl, Lev
Bronshtein, later known as Leon Trotsky.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Serbs made up about 25 percent of a population of
about 300,000; most of the rest were Muslims who identified
themselves as either Turks or Albanians. An estimated 20,000
Albanians were killed.
</P>
<P>
   Under Serb rule, periodic revolts by Albanian guerrillas known
as kacaks broke out. The government confiscated land for Serb
settlers, many of whom formed armed bands known as chetniks to
fight the kacaks. Perhaps 70,000 Serbs settled between the wars;
nearly 100,000 Albanians were driven out.
</P>
<P>
   When Italy and Germany occupied Kosovo in 1941, the Albanians,
armed by the fascists, forced out at least 40,000 Serbs and
Montenegrins.
</P>
<P>
   Then Tito's partisans took the province, after quelling a
rebellion that left as many as 10,000 Albanians dead. Tito largely
suppressed ethnic rivalries and in 1974 granted Kosovo autonomy;
harassment of Serbs increased and perhaps as many as 50,000 left.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, Slobodan Milosevic, then Serbia's president, revoked
Kosovo's autonomy. Some 200,000 Serbs were left _ 10 percent of the
population.

   ARLINGTON, Va. _ Seventeen years have passed since Karen
Jurgensen, the single mom of a 5-year-old daughter, drove a
thousand miles up I-95 to start a job on a newspaper that existed
only in the minds of a few journalistic visionaries.
</P>
<P>
   Separated from her husband, she had quit a secure editorial
position on the Miami News and sold her house to ``work for
something that might or might not exist in the future. It was a
leap of faith,'' she recalled. ``I thought then and still think
that USA Today is the most exciting thing going on in journalism in
the country, and I wanted to be a part of it.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not a bad move.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami News folded six years after she left. She remarried,
to a lawyer named Bill Leary who works for the U.S. Interior
Department. And on May 1, Karen Jurgensen will replace the retiring
David Mazzarella as editor of USA Today.
</P>
<P>
   At the age of 50, she will become the first female editor of the
country's largest general-interest newspaper, moving up from her
current post as editor of the editorial page.
</P>
<P>
   Will the 2.3 million readers of USA Today be able to tell that a
woman has taken charge?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' said the soft-spoken Jurgensen. ``I'm not out
to make this a woman's newspaper. I hope that everybody will pick
up the paper and think it's relevant to their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   As for shattering a glass ceiling for her gender, ``to me it's a
natural progression of what's happened to women in the workplace,''
she explained.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over my professional career, which started in the early '70s
women have sort of infiltrated _ if I can use that word _
newsrooms. And I think it's only natural that women are getting to
the position where they have higher-ranking jobs. We have earned
the right.''
</P>
<P>
   Jurgensen started as topics editor in the Life section of USA
Today, and has since advanced to special projects editor, editor in
charge of the Life section, cover stories editor, senior editor for
special projects including polling, and since 1991, editor of the
editorial page.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, of course, there were sacrifices.
</P>
<P>
   ``In very beginning I had my daughter in a day-care center that
closed at 6 o'clock and was, at minimum, a 45-minute drive away at
rush hour,'' she said. ``Well, it very soon became obvious that
there was no way this was going to be a workable plan, so I hired
someone to come and be at the house with my daughter.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the model that we followed all through her growing up
years. There was somebody at home to take care of her until I got
home. The upside of that is that she has always been proud of what
I do, so she has forgiven me that. We have had a lot of really good
times together. I believe in quality time.''
</P>
<P>
   Her daughter, Kirsten Thompson, is now a senior at Bryn Mawr
College in Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   As editorial page editor, she also sacrificed her privacy to
provide a personal perspective to a sensitive women's issue.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, when journalists were debating whether the media
perpetuates the stigma of rape by not naming victims of the violent
crime, Jurgensen wrote a chilling column describing how she had
been raped 15 years before in North Carolina after leaving work one
evening at the Charlotte News.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've helped to hide ourselves away _ and to hide the
prevalence and brutality of rape,'' she wrote. ``And I thought: If
we all spoke up, you would know victims all around you.''
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, she heard ``from a lot of other people who had been
raped. They want to have someone to talk to and to have a sense
that they are not alone,'' said Jurgensen. ``One woman called and
said she was raped before she was married and had never had the
courage to tell her husband.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody was so supportive. It was not like I had to carry
this around by myself any more. It was a wonderful, warm feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   _ _ _
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting her Danish roots, her first name is pronounced
``CAR-in.'' Growing up in Chapel Hill, N.C., she was called
``Kardi'' by her family because her younger brothers, Mike and
Kris, had trouble with the proper pronunciation. Her father, Kai
Jurgensen, now deceased, was a drama professor at the University of
North Carolina. Her mother, Peggy, died when Karen was in the ninth
grade.
</P>
<P>
   ``I met Kardi in 1962,'' recalled her 80-year-old stepmother,
Paquita Shafer.
</P>
<P>
   Shafer, recently divorced, had left a job at the Raleigh News
and Observer in order to return to her home town, where her family
could help care for her three small children.
</P>
<P>
   She had begun working as a reporter for the local newspaper and
was covering a dance at a teen center called the Catskeller. The
rock 'n' roll music was provided by a local band of high schoolers
led by James Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were all dancing the watusi. I thought they were all
crazy,'' she said. Spotting a temporarily motionless Jurgensen, ``I
thought she was the only one with any sense.''
</P>
<P>
   So she asked the sensible one to come to the paper the next day
to identify students in photographs of the dance. She found out
that Jurgensen was a reporter for the school newspaper and host of
a local radio program and the daughter of a popular professor who
spoke eight languages fluently.
</P>
<P>
   That professor would soon become Shafer's suitor.
</P>
<P>
   ``He left three dozen roses on my desk and a note that said
'Let's have lunch','' she said. ``I didn't have a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Her sensible stepdaughter would go on to major in English and
graduate with honors from UNC. They get together whenever Jurgensen
returns ``to the Southern part of heaven _ which is what we call
Chapel Hill,'' said Shafer.
</P>
<P>
   As chairperson of the board of visitors for the university's
School of Journalism and Mass Communications, Jurgensen returns at
least twice a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is nothing short of splendid,'' said Richard Cole, dean of
the journalism school. ``She is a most astute journalist. I've
known many over the years, and she is right up there with the
best.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a ``gutsy move'' for Jurgensen to go to USA Today, said
Paul Kaplan, who worked with her at the Miami News and is now
Sunday editor for the Atlanta Journal and Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan was metro editor at the News. Jurgensen was features
editor but became Kaplan's assistant _ technically a demotion _ to
gain ``hard news experience,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's very savvy, but in a quiet way. She's definitely not a
screamer,'' he said. ``She treats people well, and they respond to
her management style. She is very direct in her dealings with
people. Very professional.''
</P>
<P>
   Susan Weiss, the current USA Today managing editor for the Life
section, worked with Jurgensen in the ``early, very chaotic days''
of the section. ``She would draw people out, listen, then act,''
said Weiss. ``Her management style is a very collaborative one.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no pigeon-holing of her interests for the section,
Weiss said. ``She liked stories about ordinary people doing
formidable things, entertainment stories with real news, stories
that solve problems.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She is an intelligent, aware human being,'' Weiss said of her
boss-to-be.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   _ _ _
</P>
<P>
   USA Today has changed since it was dubbed McPaper.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the beginning it was very much a newspaper that existed in
the heads of a few people, and they had to convey that to the rest
of us. It was very much a vision of those early leaders. Al
Neuharth. John Curley. John Quinn,'' said Jurgensen.
</P>
<P>
   ``The notion of the paper has changed some. We tried in the
beginning to be very different. The assumption was that people had
already gotten the day's news by the time they got to us,'' she
said. ``We don't think that now. We consider that our readers are
news junkies. they have many sources of information. But we think
we have to provide a complete, thorough news report every day, with
our own kind of spark of creativity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want the newspaper to have a thorough view of what happened
in the past 24 hours and what will happen in the next 24 hours,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   As editorial page editor, she has pressed issues involving
women's rights, such as Title IX gender equity in college sports,
health care and air travel _ ``very important to our readers.''
</P>
<P>
   Will she bring a woman's perspective to the top post?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think to a degree,'' Jurgensen said. ``We have a whole mix
of people here who are male or female and minorities, and I hope we
all bring those points of view to the table when we think about
what to put in the newspaper.''
</P>
<P>
   Newspapers are already challenged in an era where information is
instantly available from the Internet, cable TV and portable
digital phones, and the competition will increase in the future,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Technological change ``is going to get much faster,'' said
Jurgensen. ``The alternatives to newspaper reading will explode.
The challenge is to create a newspaper that appeals to readers in
that environment, that serves them in that environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need to help people put into context all this
proliferation of information that is coming at them. There are
many, many voices out there. I hope part of our role will be to
help people sort through that, to know what is believable or not
believable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope part of my legacy will be helping discover what is the
journalism of the 21st century.''

TALES FROM THE CRYPT AND OTHER VEILED EAVES-DROPPING 
</HEADLINE>

 c. 1999 KANSAS CITY STAR 
<TEXT>
<P>
   VAIL, Colo. _ So my wife and I are walking down a busy street in
this semi-ritzy skiing village, thinking about whether I want a
ski-burger for lunch or a ski-taco, when this small knot of women
passes by us. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   They're well into the middle of some immensely engaging (to
them) conversation, which means that I was privileged to overhear
only a piece of it as they came within earshot and then drifted
away, their voices merging with the surrounding cloud of background
ski-ish noises. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here, however, is what I heard one of those women exclaim: ``But
I was supposed to be dead anyway, so I guess it was all right.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I wanted to spin around and follow them at a discreet distance
to find out how she was supposed to have died, how she avoided
buying the farm, what was all right about her supposed death and on
and on. But my wife, as well she should, frowns on me shadowing
small packs of women so I can eavesdrop. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Furtive doesn't become you,'' she says. At least she'll
realize she says that when she reads it here. (I don't have time to
check all these quotes.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But as I took in that ``supposed to be dead'' quote, it occurred
to me that I don't need to track people around for their full
stories. I'm guessing that those stories can't be much better than
ones I can make up about them with no more construction supplies
than a few lines of actual words spoken by a passer-by. (An aside:
Do you, too, sometimes put ``passer-by'' on your resume? Or is that
just me?) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In fact, I've come to understand that one way to give my mind a
vacation from the tedium of daily routines is to engage it in
altogether different and creative ways when _ as I'm doing here in
Colorado _ I take some time off. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So I've decided to spend part of today picking up snippets of
real passing conversation and filling in the story myself. As for
the supposed-to-be-dead woman, here is almost certainly the part
that preceded what I heard: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Diagnosed with a critical illness and given 12 days to live, she
proved her doctors wrong by surviving. Although still expecting her
own demise, she finally got a call from her physician, who said:
``The diagnosis was meant for another Elizabeth Lilliquith
Snagglepunk, not you.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   She rejoiced that night by drinking far too much demon rum and
awoke the next morning feeling as if the Army of Belize had spent
the night doing incompetent and highly irregular maneuvers on her
skull. ``But I was supposed to be dead anyway, so I guess it was
all right,'' she allowed of her morning-after condition, sounding,
frankly, a little unconvinced. The end. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Just a few minutes later, as I walked toward the Vail public
parking garage, two 30-ish men off to my side engaged in this
exchange: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``So, Bob, you remain single.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Yep.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``You ever been close to getting married?'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Yep.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And just that quickly they were out of hearing. So that forced
me to imagine where this conversation went after that: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you tell me about it, Bob?'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Yep.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, tell me about it.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Nope.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Never mind, Bob. I think I see the problem.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At that point I imagine Bob, a doctor, seeing a woman nearby and
greeting her: ``Elizabeth Lilliquith Snagglepunk! It's great to see
you're not dead.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>

 &HT;    Ever-ready economy floating on flexibility
 &HT;    By Marilyn Geewax
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Brazil is brimming with coffee beans, iron ore and
sugar. Russia is home to some of the world's most brilliant
scientists. Japan's work force is healthy, hard-working and
well-educated.
</P>
<P>
   But despite such advantages, these countries, like so many
others today, can't find their way out of a tangle of unemployment,
weak currencies and pessimism.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in the United States, the good times roll: Federal
deficits have dried up, stock prices are setting records, inflation
is tamed, and home sales are booming. Economists say Americans are
enjoying the best business environment in history.
</P>
<P>
   How can so much of the world be cowering under dark economic
clouds while the sun keeps shining so brightly on everything red,
white and blue? Last year, Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan
Greenspan famously warned that with much of the world mired in
economic misery, the United States could not remain ``an oasis of
prosperity.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet here we are, cool drink in hand, kicking back at the oasis
to soak up more fun. How do we do it?
</P>
<P>
   Economic historians have spent decades trying to pin down the
reasons for ``American exceptionalism,'' a phrase coined in the
1830s by Alexis de Tocqueville, a French social philosopher who
wrote about why this country seemed so different from Europe. The
topic still fascinates. At a global economic conference sponsored
by the Milken Institute _ a California think tank founded by
one-time junk-bond king Michael Milken _ four Nobel prize-winning
economists kicked around ideas about why America has grown so
exceptionally wealthy. And why it's getting even richer.
</P>
<P>
   In general, they agreed with the conventional wisdom that
contributing to our unmatched economic success are: our respect for
laws governing property, contracts and individual liberties; an
emphasis on learning and literacy; an abundance of natural
resources; our large geographical size; and the rapid growth of
population.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the most important factor, according to Nobel
laureate Gary Becker, an economist at the University of Chicago, is
that we have been encouraged to be, in the best sense, greedy.
</P>
<P>
   Advertisers, mall operators, car salesmen and others constantly
urge us to acquire more goods and services. Enough is never enough
in a popular culture where the Material Girl is a role model. The
promotion of avarice may seem shallow, but it has a positive
economic impact. To fulfill our many desires, we feel compelled to
work harder. That leads to new inventions and higher output, which
stimulate more buying, and on and on.
</P>
<P>
   In nations where the government has discouraged individuals from
accumulating personal wealth, the society has remained relatively
poor. That's true even in countries that promote advanced learning,
such as Russia, Cuba and China.
</P>
<P>
   Each of those countries ``invested an awful lot in education ...
and nevertheless had dismal economic development,'' economist
Becker said. Education, like natural resources, won't bring
financial success unless a country also fosters a ``delicate
interdependence'' between skills and greed. The United States has
flourished in the 20th century because ``we gave people the
incentive to use their human capital,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, though Becker's point about the benefits of allowing people
to satisfy their material appetites helps explain why Americans
succeeded up to the 1990s, it doesn't fully account for why we are
now becoming so much richer than even other capitalist countries,
such as Japan.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese seem to be like us in many ways. They have respect
for laws, a democratic government, a well-educated work force and a
culture that encourages young people to try to get rich. Yet our
economy is vastly outpacing theirs. Why?
</P>
<P>
   Douglass North, a Nobel laureate from Washington University in
St. Louis who also spoke at the Milken Institute conference, said
the difference can be summarized in a word: ``flexibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Japanese business leaders, Americans are quick to lay off
workers, close plants, change banking practices or do whatever else
is necessary to survive. North said our free-wheeling economy keeps
replacing products and practices that don't work well with whatever
will.
</P>
<P>
   And labor is nearly as flexible as capital in this country. A
worker who gets laid off in Connecticut will readily switch to a
job in Atlanta. Or Los Angeles. Or Seattle. Even though the
distances are enormous, it's all one country with excellent
transportation and communication links.
</P>
<P>
   Life couldn't be more different in Europe. For example, a
laid-off German autoworker would dread moving to Portugal where
unemployment is much lower, even though both Germany and Portugal
are members of the European Union. Language, patriotism and family
ties make Europeans extremely reluctant to hop from one location to
another.
</P>
<P>
   Of course in human terms, American flexibility has its downside.
A South Georgia farmer who is losing his land and moving to Atlanta
to start a landscaping business might be heartbroken about the
change. But ultimately, both he and the economy will be better off
when his labor gets shifted to where it is most needed.
</P>
<P>
   This flexibility also helps explain why in 1998 _ when the U.S.
unemployment rate averaged just 4.5 percent _ more than a million
Americans were laid off, according to the Labor Department. Even
though times were good, companies were furiously closing plants,
installing equipment to replace workers and pursuing mergers to cut
costs.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, our national character helps us through these
upheavals. As a nation of immigrants, we have a long tradition of
picking up and starting over. ``Go West, young man!'' has resonated
with Americans for generations; we're willing to keep looking for
that pot of gold.
</P>
<P>
   And that can-do spirit fuels our optimism. This month, KPMG, a
business consulting firm in New York, polled college students via
its Web site. Of the 281 students who responded to the question,
``Do you think you are going to be a millionaire in your
lifetime?'' more than three-quarters answered ``yes.''
</P>
<P>
   Will today's level of optimism and flexibility allow the United
States to remain the world's one true superpower forever? Economic
historians say we are entering the 21st century with a good head of
steam but note that no great power has dominated for eternity. The
once-mighty leaders of Egypt, Rome, China and Spain all faded
eventually. Perhaps by the end of the next century, China, with its
massive population and resources, will re-emerge as the most
powerful nation.
</P>
<P>
   But for now, our country is on top of the world. On New Year's
Eve 1999, there will be no better place to party at midnight than
at the oasis.
</P>

Marilyn Geewax on issues raised by the coming of 2000.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Ma and Pa go to town
 &HT;    By Vicki Marsh Kabat
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ When I was a child growing up on a farm in the
Midwest, our family went to town once a week. We all piled into the
car and drove the seven miles to stock up on supplies. It was the
highlight of our week.
</P>
<P>
   We went to the feed store first to get chick feed, brush killer,
salt blocks and the like. Then we'd go to the square, where our
stately courthouse was surrounded on all sides by store after
store. Mom would go into JC Penney's and buy a $3 cotton shirtdress
and get dad some new handerkerchiefs and socks.
</P>
<P>
   Then we'd go to the dime store, truly heaven on earth for kids.
We'd amble down the aisles marveling at the gadgets and goodies
laid out before us. We never bought much, but we could look. Mom
usually headed straight to the back of the store where the fabrics
were to get her sewing supplies. We lingered over the jacks and
rubber balls, Barbie clothes, colored pencils and pens, Nancy Drew
paperbacks and the cornucopia of candy.
</P>
<P>
   Then we'd go to the grocery store and fill up on the needs of
our family of five for a week. Of course, most of what we ate on
the farm we grew or raised ourselves. We were in town for the
staples: sugar, salt, flour, coffee, soap, detergent and such.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of our trip, if we had been really good, we might get
to go back up to the square to park and watch people go by. Any
wonder so many of us left for the city as soon as we could?
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, town squares have been replaced by superstores _
sprawling retail centers that offer everything from garden supplies
to golf balls, banking to beauty salons, pet food to Preparation H,
all under one endless roof.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent Saturday, my husband and I found ourselves in one
such superstore _ not a regular destination for a couple of
anti-shoppers like us. We needed just a couple of things and
thought we'd pop in to get them. You never just ``pop in'' to one
of these places. Finding a parking space and getting to the front
door can take a good 30 minutes. Once inside, something happens.
</P>
<P>
   You step through that door and look up to see _ everything. It's
the dime store of my youth ad infinitum. No matter how focused you
were before that automatic door opened, you are overwhelmed as soon
as it shushes to a close.
</P>
<P>
   Something insidious overtakes you. Suddenly you realize you need
some hand towels for the kitchen, and you might as well stock up on
tuna fish while you're here. Oh, and look, they've got socks on
sale, a package of 10 for $6.
</P>
<P>
   Pretty soon, you're pushing two cartloads to the checkout
counter and have nickeled and dimed yourself into the hundreds.
</P>
<P>
   It's ``Ma and Pa Kettle Go to Town.'' It's the Waltons stopping
by the general store to pick up the mail and being seduced by the
gumballs. I don't care where we live, it's the country folks being
sucked in by the lure of the big city and all its marvels. If it's
there, we must want it.
</P>
<P>
   My husband and I stumbled out of the store two hours later with
more bags than we could carry. We got home and found we'd bought
things we had no idea we needed _ and didn't.
</P>
<P>
   Slowly, the daze lifted. Like coming out of anesthesia, we
blinked several times, gulped and began making a return pile.
</P>
<P>
   The trauma of this experience has led me to a conclusion: We
need help. And so do others like us. We need to start a support
group.
</P>
<P>
   ``My name is Vicki, and I am a superstore addict.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, Vicki, we're with you!''
</P>
<P>
   We can meet weekly at the food court. Oh, and don't let me
forget to pick up some miniblinds and mayonnaise after the meeting.

 &HT;    Wedding plans prompt some soul-searching
 &HT;    Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ For over 40 years, I've been working on an
advanced degree in curmudgeonry. Although not a new field, it is
rather an obscure one, requiring far more scholarly dedication than
throw-away subjects like biophysics and brain surgery.
</P>
<P>
   And now, just as I was about to be ushered into the hallowed
halls of the truly cantankerous, the unthinkable happens. My son
Kristofor brings home his lovely Amy and tells me they're getting
married.
</P>
<P>
   My reaction is like that of any devoted mother. I hug Kristofor,
check Amy's teeth, and give the union my blessing. Then I ask when
they're going to elope. The children eye one another briefly as my
son breaks the news. Sorry, Mom, no elopement. We're planning a
garden wedding with guests, crying mothers, and a
</P>
<P>
   string quartet. The whole meatball.
</P>
<P>
   At that moment our history, Kristofor's and mine, flashes before
me like a drowning person. Specters of overflowing diaper pails,
emergency rooms, and spit-up carrots, loom larger than life. The
countless boo boos I had kissed, and two years of driving
kindergarten carpool with a gaggle of four- and five-year-olds
pouring Orange Crush in each other's hair, swims before my
</P>
<P>
   eyes.
</P>
<P>
   I even recall the time he invited me up to his treehouse to
discuss the meaning of life. My words were less than profound, but
adequate, I thought. ``You grow up, go to college, work at
something you love doing, meet the lady of your dreams, and
elope.''
</P>
<P>
   Blatant brainwashing, I admit, but it was for his own
</P>
<P>
   good _ and mine _ because for decades now, I have politely
refused invitations to weddings, christenings, graduations, bar
mitzvahs, circumcisions, and showers of all kinds (tedious
gatherings where a bunch of women get together to see how many
words they can make out of ``can opener'' before anybody's allowed
to order a drink). In time, true friends came to understand my odd
ways. ``Oh, that's just Elizabeth,'' I've heard them explain to the
uninitiated.
</P>
<P>
   So much for unrepentant churlishness. I'm going to have to get
over it, for the time being anyway, and behave myself. I have vowed
to brush up on small talk, practice agreeing with everything, and
to follow the advice of a couple of my friends who've already been
where I'm heading. ``Wear beige and smile _
</P>
<P>
   with your mouth CLOSED.''
</P>
<P>
   And buy a new dress.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to another problem. There are three things I
absolutely do NOT do. I do not wash cars, mow lawns, or shop. So
far, it's worked out to my satisfaction. I've jobbed out the car
washing and lawn mowing, and simply stayed out of stores. But now I
need a dress.
</P>
<P>
   I started thumbing through catalogues but soon realized that
while L.L.Bean is great, I can't wear a sleeping bag to a garden
wedding. Not even with kid gloves.
</P>
<P>
   As a last resort, I walked up to the drug store and picked up a
fashion magazine _ I didn't buy it, mind you, I just picked it up
and looked at it. Inside the cover is a two-page layout for a well
known peddler of the ultimate in chic. Unbelievable.
</P>
<P>
   The photo is of a young guy wearing a wet T-shirt with a
drooping pocket and a stretched-out neck. His shirttail half-hangs
out of a pair of oversize cargo pants (the ones with a pocket on
each leg big enough to garage a Moped), and he is pouting like
someone has just swiped his half-full bottle of muscatel. Over it
all, he wears a trench coat that even Columbo would have
</P>
<P>
   turned down. If I hadn't recognized the designer's name, I would
have sworn it was an ad warning derelicts to repent.
</P>
<P>
   Two pages back, a pre-pubescent waif wearing only what appears
to be a babushka with spaghetti straps stares at me over circles
under her eyes so dark they can mean only one thing _ she's either
just out of, or on her way into, rehab.
</P>
<P>
   I dropped the magazine back on the rack, went home and called my
high-school-and-forever friend, Jeanne. She's married off two sons,
gracefully, so if anybody can pull me through this, she can.
</P>
<P>
   We're going shopping.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Cheap_o wine signals new trouble spots
 &HT;    By MARK LANE
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ I was tipped off well ahead of time to the
crisis in the region formerly known as Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   No, I don't read State Department cables, Central European
newspapers, exotic Web sites or even watch CNN. I saw it at the
liquor store.
</P>
<P>
   My intelligence about the region comes from a source ignored by
the foreign_policy establishment, unnoted by pundits and unanalyzed
by analysts. Look for this indicator and you, too, can be a foreign
policy prognosticator. Here it is: impending political calamity
creates cheap wine.
</P>
<P>
   A few months ago, when Slovenian Sauvignon and something dark
and tongue_staining from Montenegro dropped below the benchmark
$3.00_a_bottle level, I started looking at cruise_missile futures.
</P>
<P>
   I discovered this pattern many years ago. Back when I first
realized that my sense of taste was too crude and uneducable to
merit spending much on wine. I would buy something cheap and exotic
from the back shelves of the store and three months later, the
place on the label would appear in 38_point type on newspaper
international pages. Once you see a country's name on a two_buck
bottle of wine, you can count on Christiane Amanpour being there
within six months.
</P>
<P>
   I fondly recall the last time I bought a 99_cent bottle of wine.
It came from Algeria at just about the time Col. Houari Boumedienne
had died and colonials and commies were divvying up the government.
The wine was _oh, how do the food writers say it? _ a robust
vintage, an earthy wine, a wine that speaks of fruit and tractor
parts, that slaps you on the back, belches and calls for another
round. Equally good as an aperitif or for tie-dying shirts. I loved
it.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, Algeria stabilized and the wine left the bargain rack. I
thought I'd never see it again. Then, in the early 1990s, it
reappeared in $1.99-a-bottle version. Sure enough, within months,
militant Islamic fundamentalists won parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
   The system works.
</P>
<P>
   Years before the global economy became a Sunday editorial
buzzword, the wine scavenger was well aware of how closely we are
all connected. How a few bad elections, an ethnic insurgency or a
sucker bet on industrial policy could take the proud, sun-ripened
product of a distant land and slap a ``$2.99'' sticker on it.
</P>
<P>
   The world of the wine cheapskate is one of international
intrigue, currency devaluations, fiscal crisis, armed insurrection,
religious strife and collapsing dictatorships in temperate
climates. We see the dark side of the world economy and drink it
in.
</P>
<P>
   But sometimes we strain it through a coffee filter first.
</P>
<P>
   It makes me read international stories a whole different way. I
note with pleasure the ascendance of right-wing kooks in French
elections. Smile at the slide of the Euro. Too late for this year's
Beaujolais Nouveau, but it has potential.
</P>
<P>
   The wine scavenger, however, is no pessimist. We know too well
that crises come and go.
</P>
<P>
   The march of democracy continually clears the bargain shelf and
we must find the next troubled region. A stable, democratically
elected government with a central bank that does not operate out of
a suitcase hikes the cost of a bottle by at least a dollar.
</P>
<P>
   Argentine hyperinflation brought us Cabernet Sauvignons more
intense than the same three bucks would buy you from mellow
California. But the transition to democracy and stabilization of
the peso moved the product to parts of the store I just see on the
way in.
</P>
<P>
   Portugal's move from military dictatorship to democracy to
full-blown part of Europe has made its jug wine less of a deal
every year. They even started filtering the chunky stuff out before
they bottle it. They're no fun anymore.
</P>
<P>
   So if our smart bombs are really smart, they will spare coastal
vineyards of Montenegro and the peacekeepers will step around the
fields in Macedonia. A three-buck red wine could be their first
timid step toward becoming a normal country.
</P>
<P>
   Don't accuse me of enjoying the world's misfortunes. I am
helping developing economies join the community of nations. That's
a lot to ask a browser in a liquor store, but with enough time on a
Friday night, I'm up to the task.

 &HT;    Popular iMac serves as bait for game developers
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The bait is an iridescent gumdrop of computer. The prey? Game
developers, many of whom stopped publishing for the Mac years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Apple Computer is hoping its popular new iMac computer will lure
developers back to the Mac platform.
</P>
<P>
   It's too early to tell whether developers are taking the bait,
but Apple Computer should get an A for effort. The company is
pulling out the stops to win over game developers, seeing them as
key to an effort to win a greater share of the home market.
</P>
<P>
   Some developers are expressing renewed interest in the Mac.
What's caught their fancy is twofold. The iMac has been a
commercial success, the best-selling single computer, and it was
designed for games.
</P>
<P>
   iMacs include technologies that developers like. For example,
there's a strong, if not state of the art, graphics accelerator.
This technology enables graphically detailed games to run faster.
</P>
<P>
   These computers also use a new standard for peripherals called
Universal Serial Bus, which is favored by many developers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's simple,'' Matthew Manuel, a senior Disney Interactive
programmer, recently told MacWeek magazine. ``The iMacs are sort of
like game consoles. They're much easier to optimize for games.''
</P>
<P>
   Apple Computer's campaign to win over game developers involves
more than just new technology. The company is going out of its way
to schmooze them.
</P>
<P>
   The company turned out in force at the recent Game Developers
Conference in San Jose, Calif. It had a large booth featuring iMacs
and its new blue-and-white iridescent G3 computers.
</P>
<P>
   Running on these computers were some of the top games, including
``Myst II'' and ``Quake II.'' It was an impressive display that
attracted a crowd of developers all day long.
</P>
<P>
   And, to sweeten the pot, Apple Computer gave every developer
attending the conference a free package of software development
tools for the Mac.
</P>
<P>
   The result of Apple Computer's effort is not overwhelming so
far, but it is beginning to win back some important developers that
were on the fence.
</P>
<P>
   Maxis, for example, was uncertain about whether it was going to
publish a Mac version of its latest version of ``SimCity'' a year
ago. Now, a Mac version has been announced.

 &HT;    Broadband is coming, and you might like it
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   This is broadband. This is the way.
</P>
<P>
   That's the slogan of MediaOne, the cable company recently
purchased by fellow cable operator Comcast for $55.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   In MediaOne locations, this phrase hasn't really caught on.
``Get the cable thing right first,'' frustrated subscribers have
been known to bark at MediaOne salespeople trying to sell them on
the broadband future.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it's unfair to single MediaOne out as the sole source
of cable consumer wrath. There are few American cable subscribers
who can't relate to tales of waiting for repairmen, hearing a
disembodied voice endlessly repeat the phrase, ``Please stay on the
line; your call is important to us,'' or muttering incredulously,
``They want how much for HBO?''
</P>
<P>
   But _ kidding aside _ broadband is coming, and it's going to
make your current dial-up Internet service as outdated as an old PC
left over from the '80s.
</P>
<P>
   But these same cable operators are also offering one of the
major on-ramps to the future of the Internet _ the high-speed world
of cable modems. For about $49 per month plus installation, most
cable operators are ready to bring the world of high-speed Web
access into your home, not in 2004 as the analysts were predicting,
but right now, today, this very minute.
</P>
<P>
   My personal instinct is to be leery of anybody who wants to come
in and fiddle with my home computer _ especially cable companies
that usually have to drop by three or four times to figure out why
the cable works in the living room but not in the den.
</P>
<P>
   My professional instinct has been to say a polite ``no thanks''
to the cable modem and high-speed telephone access. Speed for its
own sake means nothing. High-speed access will let me download the
new Internet Explorer browser in a matter of minutes instead of the
countless hours it would take with my teensy telephone connection.
But the question remains: What else can you get with all this speed
that you can't get with traditional dial-up access?
</P>
<P>
   There are a few companies beginning to develop Web sites for the
high-speed world. This week, Web portal Snap (www.snap.com)
introduced a high-speed version of its service, temporarily dubbed
``Snap.com for Higher Speed Users.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It really does define a different experience for high-speed
users,'' says Snap Chief Operating Officer Edmond Sanctis. Snap has
already made deals to offer the customized versions of high-speed
Snap with several cable and phone companies including Cable and
Wireless USA, Bell Atlantic and SBC. However, the faster portal
service is also available to users with T1 lines, which would
include almost anybody who logs on to the Web from work. Having
this rich media content at the office really does whet the appetite
for installing the same kind of service at home.
</P>
<P>
   Looking at Snap's high-speed service via a T1 connection is a
different Internet experience. Users can surf the site the way they
always have to hunt for information, check stock prices and read
news headlines, or they can watch live news reports from Bloomberg
TV, catch movie star interviews from E! online or check out an
infinite number of ``South Park'' videos.
</P>
<P>
   The high-speed Snap is a multimedia version of dial-up Snap,
with more audio video and music links. ``The thing I didn't want to
do was gratuitous video,'' Sanctis says. ``It truly does bring the
best of what works on a portal with a richer, more television-like
experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there is BellSouth.net's new Web portal service, available
in each of the markets in its nine-state service area. While
portals may seem like an old-fashioned narrowband idea, the
BellSouth.net portal offers a link to its Yellow Pages service,
which Vice President Donna LaChance says is the most updated
version of the BellSouth Yellow Pages there is.
</P>
<P>
   While directory assistance operators are often unable to help
you if you only know half a company's name or aren't really sure if
the business is in the city or the suburbs, the BellSouth online
Yellow Pages is able work with any kind of mangled information you
throw at it and return the exact business you're looking for.
</P>
<P>
   For today's dial-up Internet customers, logging onto the
Internet to find the phone number of the local pizza joint might be
more bother than it's worth. But over the next few years, when
MediaOne/Comcast, BellSouth and others offer ``always on''
high-speed phone and cable modem access puts the Internet at more
and more fingertips, multimedia portals and online Yellow Pages
might become broadband's killer applications. And it might be
enough for skeptics to seriously consider letting the cable or
phone company come over and wire them for speed.

 &HT;    Don't hold the phone: Headset phones growing popular at home
 &HT;    WITH PHOTO
 &HT;    By James Cummings
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Homemaker Lori Mackintosh doesn't have five or 10
minutes to spend standing around with a phone pressed to her ear
listening to elevator music while waiting to be taken off hold.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have kids at home, you need your hands free, and you
need to be able to move around,'' said Mackintosh, who lives in
Washington Twp., Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   The solution for Mackintosh and for a growing number of
telephone users has been to buy a headset for her home telephone.
</P>
<P>
   Headsets traditionally have been associated with switchboard
operators, workers who spend their entire days making phone
connections. More recently, headset use has spread to other office
workers who need to type, take notes or shuffle papers while
talking on the phone.
</P>
<P>
   Now the big push is toward headsets at home.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Small, director of residential phone marketing for
Ameritech Corp., said the growth of headset phones at home is
connected to consumer demands for mobility. He said cordless phones
went from virtually nonexistent to being in 70 percent of all homes
within the past few years.
</P>
<P>
   Cordless phones have freed people from the need to be close to
the place where the phone is plugged in. Headsets connected to
cordless phones let the user keep working around the house or home
office while talking on the phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's definitely where we're going,'' Small said. ``We expect
phones with headsets to represent about 30 to 40 percent of the new
phone market.''
</P>
<P>
   About 25 readers contacted the Dayton Daily News after the paper
ran a short item asking for comments from people who use headsets
at home.
</P>
<P>
   Most of those who called or e-mailed were women who found
headsets more comfortable and convenient to use at home than the
traditional handset.
</P>
<P>
   Most people at one time or another have pinned telephone
handsets between their ears and shoulders by crooking their necks
so they could use both hands while talking on the phone. But
holding that position on a regular basis can be extremely
uncomfortable.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I don't use a headset it hurts my back too much,'' said
Patty Boeckman of Englewood, Ohio. ``If I try to hold a handset
phone on my shoulder it runs pains through the right side of my
neck.''
</P>
<P>
   Boeckman started using a headset while working full time as a
travel agent. She still works as a travel agent, but since July has
split her time between working in an office and working from her
home.
</P>
<P>
   She bought a Radio Shack system that has a headset attached to a
dial pad. The phone doesn't have a handset.
</P>
<P>
   A Miami University ergonomist said Boeckman's complaints are not
unusual. Marvin Dainoff is a professor of psychology and director
of Miami's Center for Ergonomic Research. He has written or
co-written several books and advocates ``guerrilla ergonomics'':
achieving fit and comfort with inexpensive, easy-to-find solutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cradling a phone on your shoulder has a high likelihood of
causing problems,'' Dainoff said. ``Especially if you're working at
a desk, a headset makes a lot of sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Dainoff and Small both said the key to choosing a headset is to
try it on in the store before making a purchase. Headsets are more
delicate than handsets and tend to be in use longer, so durability
is a major consideration.
</P>
<P>
   Check out the headband first. It must be rugged and should be
adjustable to give a firm but not tight fit. The microphone should
be held comfortably in front of your mouth when in the active
position.
</P>
<P>
   If you prefer an earpiece clip instead of a headband, be sure
the earpiece holds the phone comfortably and securely even when you
pivot your head rapidly from side to side.
</P>
<P>
   Look on the package for assurances that the phone cord is
shielded. Unshielded telephone cords can pick up radio signals that
interfere with reception.
</P>
<P>
   The highest quality headset phones have noise cancellation
features. These are electronic components that reduce the amount of
background noise the headset microphone picks up.
</P>
<P>
   Several companies, led by Radio Shack and Plantronic, make
stand-alone headset phones _ that is, phones that have no handsets.
</P>
<P>
   But more common are headsets designed to use with cordless or
cellular phones. Small said almost all cordless phones currently
being made have 2.5 millimeter jacks built in that are designed to
accept headsets.
</P>
<P>
   People using them usually carry the cordless or cellular phone
unit in a pocket or clipped to a belt with the headset in place on
their heads.
</P>
<P>
   Small said Ameritech plans to introduce a headset phone that
doesn't need a cord to connect it to the body of a cordless phone.
</P>
<P>
   The phone, now in the prototype stage, has a dial pad on a unit
about the size of a credit card that can be slipped into a shirt
pocket. Signals pass between the dial pad and headset using
infrared light.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, not everyone is enamored with the idea of headsets.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Perenic, an engineer who works as a support contractor to
the Aeronautical Systems Center at Wright Patterson Air Force Base,
complains that phone engineering may have gone too far.
</P>
<P>
   He said phones, particularly cellular phones, have been
miniaturized to the point that they're too small to hold.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no doubt that given enough time we could probably make
telephones the size of a sugar cube. But why would you want to,
other than to prove that you could?'' Perenic asked. ``Now most
people would probably say, `Oh, don't be silly, they'd never make
it that small!' Well, maybe, but I never thought they'd make most
phones the size of a pickle either and then make me wear Spaceman
Spiff headphones to use it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A headset solves a lot of problems, but there's an axiom that
every ergonomic solution creates a few new problems,'' Dainoff
said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, when you wear a headset, people around you are
never sure whether you're on the phone or not. ``Holding a handset
to your ear is a clear visible signal that you're talking; wearing
a headset is not,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dainoff said he owned a headset a few years ago but got rid of
it because people he talked to complained that they couldn't hear
him as well as they did when he used a headset.
</P>
<P>
   Phone equipment has improved rapidly and sound quality problems
are less prevalent than they once were.
</P>
<P>
   But Dainoff said men in particular still are resistant to the
headset idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue of image is not trivial,'' he said. ``The people we
traditionally associate with headphones are telephone operators,
and they were almost all women.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter how practical headsets are, they have to overcome
that image before most men will wear them.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   The Internet is becoming an increasingly big part in both the
marketing and distribution of music. Read what rocker David Bowie
has to say about music and the Internet in the April issue of
Yahoo! Internet Life. Says Bowie of the Net, ``This is for real. It
will change everything that we know _ absolutely everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowie is just one element in Yahoo!'s April issue, which is
devoted to music and the Internet. Other articles include a look at
the war between the music industry and a group of upstarts trying
to set the standard for how music is distributed through the Net.
Many music publishers and distributors think the Net will forever
change the way you buy recordings, because it is fast and it also
does something marketers like _ encourages impulse buying.

 &HT;    Remote eliminates confusing forest of buttons
 &HT;    By James Cummings
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ If you're like most people, your home
entertainment equipment includes remote controls. But you don't
necessarily know where the remote controls are, and the ones you
can put your hands on may not work the way you'd like them to.
</P>
<P>
   I have eight home entertainment devices that were sold with
remote control units. Only two original remote controls are in
active use.
</P>
<P>
   I use two replacement remotes that are supposed to combine the
functions of several remotes but really don't. They don't have slow
motion, or frame-by-frame buttons for the VCRs, for example.
</P>
<P>
   One device, a compact stereo, sits close enough to the side of
the bed that it's easier to push the buttons than to use the
remote.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it would be nice to have a single remote control that
handles all the functions of the remotes that came with the
devices. It would be even nicer if the remote control was easy to
use and didn't cost as much as the equipment it operates.
</P>
<P>
   Several omnibus remote controls are on the market, and it's up
to you to decide if they meet your criteria for a good buy.
</P>
<P>
   One of the more sophisticated units is the Take Control system
from audiovisual manufacturer Harman/Kardon. Harman/Kardon claims
Take Control is so simple to use it's actually fun to operate, and
they say it's the most versatile remote control ever made.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of a series of buttons as found on most remote controls,
Take Control has a few buttons and a touch-sensitive screen.
</P>
<P>
   The user programs the device to create various ``activity
screen'' displays that can be called up to handle particular
functions. The ``watch TV'' activity screen, for instance, combines
controls for an audiovisual receiver, video controls for the
television, channel selection from a cable box and controls for a
VCR or DVD player.
</P>
<P>
   Take Control comes with CD-ROM software that allows users to
customize the remote control with their personal computers. This
feature lets users create macro commands that trigger functions of
several components with the touch of one button.
</P>
<P>
   Take Control carries a manufacturer's retail price of $349.
</P>
<P>
   It is available where Harman/Kardon components are sold.

 &HT;    PC Camera refuses to take a trip on Serial Bus
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   This is an account of a well-meaning attempt to review a $100
computer gadget. It turned into a saga we'll call ``Oklahoma Warner
and the Bus of Doom.''
</P>
<P>
   The Philips USB PC Camera is one of those little egg-shaped
devices that sits on the desktop and transmits moving pictures to
your computer. The interesting thing is it uses the Universal
Serial Bus, or USB, connection, an appendage with which all
up-to-date computers are equipped. Having never used my USB, it
seemed a good thing on which to report.
</P>
<P>
   That, of course, was the first mistake. First times never work
for me.
</P>
<P>
   The documentation, actually, provided a fair omen. It consists
of a printed manual with setup instructions in six languages and a
separate yellow card with a big red STOP sign that says to ignore
the manual and do it this way instead.
</P>
<P>
   It took both sides of this 4x8-inch card to go through the 31
steps for installing the camera and its software. It is very hard
to do 31 consecutive things right. I found the best procedure was
to accomplish the first 15, then take a nice long nap before
assaying the final 16.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, all the little devices showed up in the right places in
the Device Manager, and it came time to set up the software for the
camera. The software, of course, said the camera wasn't correctly
attached and wasn't responding.
</P>
<P>
   Rebooting seemed like a wise thing to do, but it wasn't. The
computer wouldn't reboot. It would get a little way along the route
to daylight and then quit. Worst of all, when it reached that
point, it would not allow itself to be turned off. Pushing the
on-off button had no effect at all; it had to be unplugged. Upon
detaching the camera, the problem went away.
</P>
<P>
   Down at the bottom of the yellow card, below the 31st step, it
says if the computer won't start when the camera is connected, ``It
is very likely that your BIOS is not compatible with the USB
standard.'' Why my BIOS would have a USB and not be compatible with
its standard is one of those imponderables like the meaning of life
or income tax codes.
</P>
<P>
   So I called tech support at Gateway. This is an operation in
constant flux; it never works the same way for more than a month at
a time. After pressing numerous buttons, a recording basically told
me everyone was busy and I should go away and quit bothering them.
It shunted me into something called Automated Tech Support, where a
recorded voice said:
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are running Windows 95 on your desktop computer, press
1. If you are running a laptop computer, press 2. If you are
running a Destination computer, press 3.'' I'm doing none of the
above. I'm running Windows 98. A patient man would no doubt have
tried No. 1, but I decided to take another nap.
</P>
<P>
   Upon arising, I went to Gateway's site on the Web and found the
BIOS updates which are, allegedly, the right ones for my computer.
There are two of them. Why two? I only need one. Which one? Ah,
wouldn't life be dull without these little mysteries? I downloaded
both, and opened up one of them.
</P>
<P>
   The instructions for upgrading the BIOS don't run to 31 steps,
but they involve changing jumpers back and forth on the motherboard
and warn you if you do this wrong, you will have performed a
frontal lobotomy on your computer.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, standing here in the cave, I have to grab the
idol off the pedestal and replace it with another so swiftly that
the secret mechanism won't drop the ceiling on me. The howls of
outraged natives echo from the mouth of the cave.
</P>
<P>
   I'd better have another nap.

 &HT;    Putting online buying to the test
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The folks at Yahoo! Internet Life have a standing feature that
takes a look at whether electronic commerce (which is just a nice
way of saying ``buying things on the Web'') is really the wave of
the future.
</P>
<P>
   The piece in the April issue discusses the question of whether
it is easier to buy something on the Internet or the old-fashioned
way.
</P>
<P>
   The first comparison looks at bagel buying. The old way, in this
case, is heading to the neighborhood bagel store. Total time and
cost for 24 bagels and cream cheese: 24 minutes, $26.50.
</P>
<P>
   The new way involved searching for a bagel store online. A site
called bageloasis.com delivered overnight: cost $59, plus delivery.
Time: Eleven minutes to find a site and order, one day to deliver.
</P>
<P>
   Conclusion: The old way is better (assuming you live near a
bagel store).
</P>
<P>
   A more apt comparison looks at book buying. Amazon.com and
Barnes and Noble have received a lot of attention for the prices at
their retail book sites, but lesser-known sites such as
www.buybooks.com and www.spree.com have even cheaper prices. Tom
Wolfe's ``A Man in Full,'' the book used in the comparison, sold
for $14.48 at BuyBooks. Traditional retailers, such as Crown Books,
offered the same book at $17.37.
</P>
<P>
   The piece concluded by saying that online sites, once you add
shipping costs, are more expensive than Crown's prices, but
shopping for books online takes very little time and no gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   The April issue also gives fanatics a chance to locate the grave
sites of the rich, famous or interesting. The site,
www.findagrave.com, lets you search by location, name or claim to
fame.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the listings include directions to the cemetery. For
some, including Duane Allman's, pictures of the grave site are
included.
</P>
<P>
   Site helps connect your business with money
</P>
<P>
   An online site for venture capital could become a one-stop
shopping site for companies looking for growth tips and growth
capital.
</P>
<P>
   Venture Capital Online, www
</P>
<P>
   .vcapital.com, is a Chicago- and San Francisco-based company
with a Web site that connects growing companies with money. Venture
capital is money invested in young companies. Investors in
early-stage companies get a larger stake. The companies, in turn,
get money that lets them develop product and hire employees. In
return for their money, early investors often take an active role
in the day-to-day running of the companies.
</P>
<P>
   The site was launched in January by Len Batterson, a Chicago
venture capitalist and an original investor in America Online.
Batterson created the site to speed up the early stages of picking
and choosing. The site claims it can cut the early
information-gathering stages from an average of 20 weeks to four.
</P>
<P>
   The funds, while open to all companies, will focus on the
Southeast, Midwest, Southwest and Southern California. Venture
Capital Online said those areas have the potential to blossom into
another Silicon Valley or Route 128 near Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Venture Capital Online is a network of 26 venture capital firms
that manage more than $3 billion in assets, including Hambrecht &AMP;
Quist, Apex Investment Partners, Tribune Ventures, Kline Hawkes and
Technology Funding.
</P>
<P>
   A feature called ``Venture Capital Clearinghouse'' screens the
entrepreneur's request for money, matching it with venture
capitalists based on their likes and dislikes, and provides a
summary of your business plan.
</P>
<P>
   The long-term plan is to turn the site into a kind of online
community of people running start-up companies and the people that
help fund them, including market research, educational information,
multimedia features and live chats.
</P>
<P>
   Until March 31, the site charges a $99 fee to refer a business
plan to venture a capitalist.

 &HT;    Don't hold the phone: Headset phones growing popular at home
 &HT;    WITH PHOTO
 &HT;    By James Cummings
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Homemaker Lori Mackintosh doesn't have five or 10
minutes to spend standing around with a phone pressed to her ear
listening to elevator music while waiting to be taken off hold.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have kids at home, you need your hands free, and you
need to be able to move around,'' said Mackintosh, who lives in
Washington Twp., Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   The solution for Mackintosh and for a growing number of
telephone users has been to buy a headset for her home telephone.
</P>
<P>
   Headsets traditionally have been associated with switchboard
operators, workers who spend their entire days making phone
connections. More recently, headset use has spread to other office
workers who need to type, take notes or shuffle papers while
talking on the phone.
</P>
<P>
   Now the big push is toward headsets at home.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Small, director of residential phone marketing for
Ameritech Corp., said the growth of headset phones at home is
connected to consumer demands for mobility. He said cordless phones
went from virtually nonexistent to being in 70 percent of all homes
within the past few years.
</P>
<P>
   Cordless phones have freed people from the need to be close to
the place where the phone is plugged in. Headsets connected to
cordless phones let the user keep working around the house or home
office while talking on the phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's definitely where we're going,'' Small said. ``We expect
phones with headsets to represent about 30 to 40 percent of the new
phone market.''
</P>
<P>
   About 25 readers contacted the Dayton Daily News after the paper
ran a short item asking for comments from people who use headsets
at home.
</P>
<P>
   Most of those who called or e-mailed were women who found
headsets more comfortable and convenient to use at home than the
traditional handset.
</P>
<P>
   Most people at one time or another have pinned telephone
handsets between their ears and shoulders by crooking their necks
so they could use both hands while talking on the phone. But
holding that position on a regular basis can be extremely
uncomfortable.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I don't use a headset it hurts my back too much,'' said
Patty Boeckman of Englewood, Ohio. ``If I try to hold a handset
phone on my shoulder it runs pains through the right side of my
neck.''
</P>
<P>
   Boeckman started using a headset while working full time as a
travel agent. She still works as a travel agent, but since July has
split her time between working in an office and working from her
home.
</P>
<P>
   She bought a Radio Shack system that has a headset attached to a
dial pad. The phone doesn't have a handset.
</P>
<P>
   A Miami University ergonomist said Boeckman's complaints are not
unusual. Marvin Dainoff is a professor of psychology and director
of Miami's Center for Ergonomic Research. He has written or
co-written several books and advocates ``guerrilla ergonomics'':
achieving fit and comfort with inexpensive, easy-to-find solutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cradling a phone on your shoulder has a high likelihood of
causing problems,'' Dainoff said. ``Especially if you're working at
a desk, a headset makes a lot of sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Dainoff and Small both said the key to choosing a headset is to
try it on in the store before making a purchase. Headsets are more
delicate than handsets and tend to be in use longer, so durability
is a major consideration.
</P>
<P>
   Check out the headband first. It must be rugged and should be
adjustable to give a firm but not tight fit. The microphone should
be held comfortably in front of your mouth when in the active
position.
</P>
<P>
   If you prefer an earpiece clip instead of a headband, be sure
the earpiece holds the phone comfortably and securely even when you
pivot your head rapidly from side to side.
</P>
<P>
   Look on the package for assurances that the phone cord is
shielded. Unshielded telephone cords can pick up radio signals that
interfere with reception.
</P>
<P>
   The highest quality headset phones have noise cancellation
features. These are electronic components that reduce the amount of
background noise the headset microphone picks up.
</P>
<P>
   Several companies, led by Radio Shack and Plantronic, make
stand-alone headset phones _ that is, phones that have no handsets.
</P>
<P>
   But more common are headsets designed to use with cordless or
cellular phones. Small said almost all cordless phones currently
being made have 2.5 millimeter jacks built in that are designed to
accept headsets.
</P>
<P>
   People using them usually carry the cordless or cellular phone
unit in a pocket or clipped to a belt with the headset in place on
their heads.
</P>
<P>
   Small said Ameritech plans to introduce a headset phone that
doesn't need a cord to connect it to the body of a cordless phone.
</P>
<P>
   The phone, now in the prototype stage, has a dial pad on a unit
about the size of a credit card that can be slipped into a shirt
pocket. Signals pass between the dial pad and headset using
infrared light.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, not everyone is enamored with the idea of headsets.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Perenic, an engineer who works as a support contractor to
the Aeronautical Systems Center at Wright Patterson Air Force Base,
complains that phone engineering may have gone too far.
</P>
<P>
   He said phones, particularly cellular phones, have been
miniaturized to the point that they're too small to hold.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no doubt that given enough time we could probably make
telephones the size of a sugar cube. But why would you want to,
other than to prove that you could?'' Perenic asked. ``Now most
people would probably say, `Oh, don't be silly, they'd never make
it that small!' Well, maybe, but I never thought they'd make most
phones the size of a pickle either and then make me wear Spaceman
Spiff headphones to use it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A headset solves a lot of problems, but there's an axiom that
every ergonomic solution creates a few new problems,'' Dainoff
said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, when you wear a headset, people around you are
never sure whether you're on the phone or not. ``Holding a handset
to your ear is a clear visible signal that you're talking; wearing
a headset is not,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dainoff said he owned a headset a few years ago but got rid of
it because people he talked to complained that they couldn't hear
him as well as they did when he used a headset.
</P>
<P>
   Phone equipment has improved rapidly and sound quality problems
are less prevalent than they once were.
</P>
<P>
   But Dainoff said men in particular still are resistant to the
headset idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue of image is not trivial,'' he said. ``The people we
traditionally associate with headphones are telephone operators,
and they were almost all women.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter how practical headsets are, they have to overcome
that image before most men will wear them.''

seemed a good thing on which to report.
</P>
<P>
   That, of course, was the first mistake. First times never work
for me.
</P>
<P>
   The documentation, actually, provided a fair omen. It consists
of a printed manual with setup instructions in six languages and a
separate yellow card with a big red STOP sign that says to ignore
the manual and do it this way instead.
</P>
<P>
   It took both sides of this 4x8-inch card to go through the 31
steps for installing the camera and its software. It is very hard
to do 31 consecutive things right. I found the best procedure was
to accomplish the first 15, then take a nice long nap before
assaying the final 16.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, all the little devices showed up in the right places in
the Device Manager, and it came time to set up the software for the
camera. The software, of course, said the camera wasn't correctly
attached and wasn't responding.
</P>
<P>
   Rebooting seemed like a wise thing to do, but it wasn't. The
computer wouldn't reboot. It would get a little way along the route
to daylight and then quit. Worst of all, when it reached that
point, it would not allow itself to be turned off. Pushing the
on-off button had no effect at all; it had to be unplugged. Upon
detaching the camera, the problem went away.
</P>
<P>
   Down at the bottom of the yellow card, below the 31st step, it
says if the computer won't start when the camera is connected, ``It
is very likely that your BIOS is not compatible with the USB
standard.'' Why my BIOS would have a USB and not be compatible with
its standard is one of those imponderables like the meaning of life
or income tax codes.
</P>
<P>
   So I called tech support at Gateway. This is an operation in
constant flux; it never works the same way for more than a month at
a time. After pressing numerous buttons, a recording basically told
me everyone was busy and I should go away and quit bothering them.
It shunted me into something called Automated Tech Support, where a
recorded voice said:
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are running Windows 95 on your desktop computer, press
1. If you are running a laptop computer, press 2. If you are
running a Destination computer, press 3.'' I'm doing none of the
above. I'm running Windows 98. A patient man would no doubt have
tried No. 1, but I decided to take another nap.
</P>
<P>
   Upon arising, I went to Gateway's site on the Web and found the
BIOS updates which are, allegedly, the right ones for my computer.
There are two of them. Why two? I only need one. Which one? Ah,
wouldn't life be dull without these little mysteries? I downloaded
both, and opened up one of them.
</P>
<P>
   The instructions for upgrading the BIOS don't run to 31 steps,
but they involve changing jumpers back and forth on the motherboard
and warn you if you do this wrong, you will have performed a
frontal lobotomy on your computer.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, standing here in the cave, I have to grab the
idol off the pedestal and replace it with another so swiftly that
the secret mechanism won't drop the ceiling on me. The howls of
outraged natives echo from the mouth of the cave.
</P>
<P>
   I'd better have another nap.

 &HT;    Web twinkles with astrologers' readings
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Everyone knows the best use of the Web isn't research, nor is it
finding out if it's going to rain tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   The most important use of the Web is getting your horoscope.
Otherwise, why would there be so many different horoscope sites on
the Web? The good thing about that sort of astrological richness is
you are almost sure to find just what you want to hear from one
site or another.
</P>
<P>
   Let's start our journey through the stars with a site for the
astrologer Sidney Omarr.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, you'll find sites for Omarr scattered across the Web,
but one of the best places to find him is on The Washington Post
site at www.washingtonpost
</P>
<P>
   .com/wp-srv/style/columns
</P>
<P>
   /horoscope.htm. This is a very straightforward site. No added
features, no fancy stuff like compatibility matching or horoscopes
for the entire year. Just the identical predictions you'll find in
the morning newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   If it's fancy and elaborate you want, then check out Jonathan
Cainer's site at www.bubble
</P>
<P>
   .com/WEBSTARS/. Cainer is a British astrologer, and his
predictions appear in the United Kingdom's Daily Mail.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's just his European nature, but Cainer seems more
entertaining and bolder in his predictions than most astrologers.
And his site does offer _ besides the standard daily horoscope _
extras such as year-ahead forecasts, weekly forecasts and a way to
check your horoscope for the day before.
</P>
<P>
   Astrology Net at serv2
</P>
<P>
   .astrology.net/ is more elaborate. There are special romance and
compatibility forecasts, general information about astrology, live
chats, a gift store (there are plenty of commercial offers on this
site), lists of famous people who share your sign, monthly
forecasts and the standard daily forecasts (you can even specify
whether you'd like the short version or a longer one). The
astrologer in residence here is Kelli Fox, well known in astrology
circles.
</P>
<P>
   If you're really into astrology, the sites mentioned might not
suit you. After all, you probably want something more precise.
While there are sites on the Web that offer that service, many of
them charge, so you may want to compute your own horoscope using
your place of birth and the time of day you were born.
</P>
<P>
   The next site called Astrodienst at www.astro.ch/homepage
</P>
<P>
   /indexe.ht is primarily a pay site, but it does have a nifty
feature. You'll be able to find the latitude and longitude (along
with time zone information) for almost any city you can name.
</P>
<P>
   Truth is, even if you think flipping a coin is about as accurate
as astrology and a lot less weird, you still may want to bookmark
this site.
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of school assignments and other grown-up chores require
time zone or geographical information.

 &HT;    AlphaSmart's a `cool,' lightweight word processor
 &HT;    By Jennifer Hill
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Anyone who has ever carried around a laptop computer knows even
the lightest machine becomes a heavyweight over time.
</P>
<P>
   So it was with some concern that I began searching for portable
options for my son to use for writing at home and school.
</P>
<P>
   Although he seems comfortable carrying most of his current
valuable earthly possessions and a revolving library of six to
seven books in a load that probably weighs a little less than a
baby hippo, I was reluctant to add to his daily backpack load.
</P>
<P>
   While cruising Web sites about technology and learning, I kept
coming across references to the AlphaSmart keyboard. So I surfed on
over to the company's site at www.alphasmart
</P>
<P>
   .com/, where I discovered you can obtain a loaner keyboard for
two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The loaner came about four days after filling out the forms,
just in time for a trial run working with the initial outline of my
son's science fair project. And, for good measure, there also was a
poetry assignment.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is it? How does it work?'' greeted its emergence from the
box. Both boys, who were immediately intrigued, deftly and easily
handled the footlong keyboard. It really is amazingly light.
</P>
<P>
   Its trim size is due to the fact it is a word processor, not a
laptop computer. But what it does, it does well.
</P>
<P>
   The AlphaSmart has eight files. File 1, which automatically
opens when the unit is turned on, will hold 16 pages of
single-spaced text. (The screen is four lines long.) Files 2-5 are
eight pages long, 6 and 7 are six pages, and 8 is four pages. The
total storage capacity is 64 pages of single-spaced copy, or
128,000 characters.
</P>
<P>
   With this arrangement, more than one family member can use the
AlphaSmart by working in different files, or one person can work on
several entries, or organize one long one.
</P>
<P>
   The shape and size of the keyboard make it easy to type on, but
I do wish it had a handle. I had visions of it flying out of the
crook of my son's sweatshirt-covered arm when bumped in the normal
jostling of life at school.
</P>
<P>
   And while a company spokesman assured me it could survive knocks
to the floor from a table or desk, she did draw the line for times
when the AlphaSmart meets concrete. And I wonder what effect the
ubiquitous woodchip dust at my children's school might have. (I
know for a fact this dust has the ability to creep inside tied
shoes, rendering once-white socks a permanent shade of greige.)
</P>
<P>
   Transferring a file from the AlphaSmart to your Mac or PC (it's
compatible with both) is simple. My 12-year-old was able to do it
unassisted the third time he used the machine.
</P>
<P>
   To transfer a file, you start your word processing software on
your desktop and open up a new file. Then you unplug the keyboard
cable from the keyboard and plug it in to the AlphaSmart. Press
``send'' on the AlphaSmart keyboard, and the file begins to
transfer.
</P>
<P>
   Watching the words appear on the screen of old Mac is what the
magic of technology is all about. As his Japanese-style poem about
Clyde, his frog, flowed onto the screen, my son uttered a soft but
sincere ``Cool.''
</P>
<P>
   That softly uttered exclamation also signaled to my mom antenna
that if he had one, he would likely use it, even at school, because
it was, after all, cool.
</P>
<P>
   Three AAA batteries provide about 120 hours of use.
</P>
<P>
   But the best thing about the AlphaSmart may be its price. At
$229-$249, it makes portability affordable for many would-be users.

 &HT;    Yahoo! devotes issue to music, Net
 &HT;    By Charles Hadaad
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Internet is becoming an increasingly big part in both the
marketing and distribution of music. Read what rocker David Bowie
has to say about music and the Internet in the April issue of
Yahoo! Internet Life. Says Bowie of the Net, ``This is for real. It
will change everything that we know _ absolutely everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowie is just one element in Yahoo!'s April issue, which is
devoted to music and the Internet. Other articles include a look at
the war between the music industry and a group of upstarts trying
to set the standard for how music is distributed through the Net.
Many music publishers and distributors think the Net will forever
change the way you buy recordings, because it is fast and it also
does something marketers like _ encourages impulse buying.
</P>
<P>
   On CD-ROM
</P>
<P>
   Tonka cars, the favorite of many a kid, have gone digital. The
company now offers a computer CD version of its cars. In ``Tonka
Garage,'' kids can build their own cars and crash them. You can
also convert images of cars to trading cards, decals and other
things that can be printed out.
</P>
<P>
   A companion game, ``Tonka Raceway,'' lets you create racetracks
and then race the cars you've created. Or you can pick cars and
trucks to race from a list of 30 already created for the game.
Published by Hasbro Interactive, these games are available only for
PCs running Windows 95 or a higher version of the operating system.

 &HT;    Remote eliminates confusing forest of buttons
 &HT;    By James Cummings
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ If you're like most people, your home
entertainment equipment includes remote controls. But you don't
necessarily know where the remote controls are, and the ones you
can put your hands on may not work the way you'd like them to.
</P>
<P>
   I have eight home entertainment devices that were sold with
remote control units. Only two original remote controls are in
active use.
</P>
<P>
   I use two replacement remotes that are supposed to combine the
functions of several remotes but really don't. They don't have slow
motion, or frame-by-frame buttons for the VCRs, for example.
</P>
<P>
   One device, a compact stereo, sits close enough to the side of
the bed that it's easier to push the buttons than to use the
remote.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it would be nice to have a single remote control that
handles all the functions of the remotes that came with the
devices. It would be even nicer if the remote control was easy to
use and didn't cost as much as the equipment it operates.
</P>
<P>
   Several omnibus remote controls are on the market, and it's up
to you to decide if they meet your criteria for a good buy.
</P>
<P>
   One of the more sophisticated units is the Take Control system
from audiovisual manufacturer Harman/Kardon. Harman/Kardon claims
Take Control is so simple to use it's actually fun to operate, and
they say it's the most versatile remote control ever made.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of a series of buttons as found on most remote controls,
Take Control has a few buttons and a touch-sensitive screen.
</P>
<P>
   The user programs the device to create various ``activity
screen'' displays that can be called up to handle particular
functions. The ``watch TV'' activity screen, for instance, combines
controls for an audiovisual receiver, video controls for the
television, channel selection from a cable box and controls for a
VCR or DVD player.
</P>
<P>
   Take Control comes with CD-ROM software that allows users to
customize the remote control with their personal computers. This
feature lets users create macro commands that trigger functions of
several components with the touch of one button.
</P>
<P>
   Take Control carries a manufacturer's retail price of $349.
</P>
<P>
   It is available where Harman/Kardon components are sold.

 &HT;    Get your mouse and er, mop, it's time for spring- cleaning
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   I have no business writing a column about spring cleaning.
</P>
<P>
   If you had to pass a test to use a mop or a broom, they wouldn't
give me a license. I have Evelyn to thank for my generally clean
house. She shows up with mysterious cleaning apparatuses and keeps
things halfway decent.
</P>
<P>
   There is one kind of spring cleaning that I understand. Your
computer is just as likely to accumulate dirt and grime as your
house. But the gunk in your computer can do more than embarrass you
in front of friends. It can actually ruin that expensive box of
chips.
</P>
<P>
   So today, in honor of spring, we'll do some cleaning that could
save you money and will surely make your computer last longer.
</P>
<P>
   Let's start with your mouse. It's easy to clean, and that may
give you the confidence to tackle some of the other chores. We'll
start our mouse surgery by turning the patient upside down. You'll
see a retaining ring of plastic around what looks like a rubber
ball. Remove the ring by following the instructions printed on the
plastic (usually that means turning the ring to the left, but it
varies from mouse to mouse). Now remove the small ball and wash it
with a mild soap solution, rinse it and dry it. Then look inside
the mouse. You'll see that the ball rests on small rollers _
usually three of them. Take a cotton swab, moisten it with rubbing
alcohol and clean the rollers. Let everything dry and reassemble
the mouse. If it is more than a few months old, you'll notice it
works much better now.
</P>
<P>
   Now that you are filled with confidence, let's do something some
of you have never tried before: Open the case to your computer.
It's really not all that bad. Since the way you open up the case
varies from computer to computer, you'll need the manual. Truth is,
even without the manual, you can probably figure out how to open it
just by looking. Make sure you unplug that sucker before you do
anything else.
</P>
<P>
   Once you have the case off, look at the exhaust vent for the
small fan. Dust can clog the screen that protects the fan. If that
happens and air flow is restricted, the inside of your computer can
get as hot as an oven. The chips can easily fail if you leave them
half-baked. So cleaning the exhaust grille can save you money and
frustration.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the top is open, also take a look at the circuit board
itself. Is it covered with dust? If so, then you may have a short
circuit just waiting to happen.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the deal. The circuit board has tiny connections (called
traces) that run along the surface. The distance between these
traces is so small that even a particle of dust can bridge them.
</P>
<P>
   So what? Here's what. Some dust particles are actually pretty
good conductors of electricity. So the dust can bridge two traces
and cause a short circuit. Your computer will let you know about
that with an impressive smoke signal, and that kind of smoking is
definitely bad for its health.
</P>
<P>
   The best way to clean a dirty circuit board is to use a small
vacuum that's held well above any components so you don't bump into
them and ruin them. Another way _ not nearly as good _ is to use
one of those cans of compressed air that are sold in computer and
camera stores to blow the dust away. Evelyn could tell you why
that's not the best way _ you are just moving the dust from one
area to another.
</P>
<P>
   One last thing. I know some of you won't feel comfortable
opening up the case to your computer. That's fine. I don't feel
comfortable with a mop, so I hired an expert. You can do the same
thing and take your computer in to have the innards cleaned by an
expert.
</P>
<P>
   But, honest, this is easy. It ain't brain surgery. At worst,
it's mouse surgery.

 &HT;    Putting online buying to the test
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The folks at Yahoo! Internet Life have a standing feature that
takes a look at whether electronic commerce (which is just a nice
way of saying ``buying things on the Web'') is really the wave of
the future.
</P>
<P>
   The piece in the April issue discusses the question of whether
it is easier to buy something on the Internet or the old-fashioned
way.
</P>
<P>
   The first comparison looks at bagel buying. The old way, in this
case, is heading to the neighborhood bagel store. Total time and
cost for 24 bagels and cream cheese: 24 minutes, $26.50.
</P>
<P>
   The new way involved searching for a bagel store online. A site
called bageloasis.com delivered overnight: cost $59, plus delivery.
Time: Eleven minutes to find a site and order, one day to deliver.
</P>
<P>
   Conclusion: The old way is better (assuming you live near a
bagel store).
</P>
<P>
   A more apt comparison looks at book buying. Amazon.com and
Barnes and Noble have received a lot of attention for the prices at
their retail book sites, but lesser-known sites such as
www.buybooks.com and www.spree.com have even cheaper prices. Tom
Wolfe's ``A Man in Full,'' the book used in the comparison, sold
for $14.48 at BuyBooks. Traditional retailers, such as Crown Books,
offered the same book at $17.37.
</P>
<P>
   The piece concluded by saying that online sites, once you add
shipping costs, are more expensive than Crown's prices, but
shopping for books online takes very little time and no gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   The April issue also gives fanatics a chance to locate the grave
sites of the rich, famous or interesting. The site,
www.findagrave.com, lets you search by location, name or claim to
fame.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the listings include directions to the cemetery. For
some, including Duane Allman's, pictures of the grave site are
included.
</P>
<P>
   Site helps connect your business with money
</P>
<P>
   An online site for venture capital could become a one-stop
shopping site for companies looking for growth tips and growth
capital.
</P>
<P>
   Venture Capital Online, www
</P>
<P>
   .vcapital.com, is a Chicago- and San Francisco-based company
with a Web site that connects growing companies with money. Venture
capital is money invested in young companies. Investors in
early-stage companies get a larger stake. The companies, in turn,
get money that lets them develop product and hire employees. In
return for their money, early investors often take an active role
in the day-to-day running of the companies.
</P>
<P>
   The site was launched in January by Len Batterson, a Chicago
venture capitalist and an original investor in America Online.
Batterson created the site to speed up the early stages of picking
and choosing. The site claims it can cut the early
information-gathering stages from an average of 20 weeks to four.

 &HT;    Handle perfumes appropriately to make them last longer
 &HT;    By Jane Greig
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: How long do perfumes last? Do they go bad after awhile? Can
anything be done to make them last longer?
</P>
<P>
   _Stephanie Coates
</P>
<P>
   A: Perfume longevity depends on storage. Once a bottle is
opened, it is meant to be used, say the scent gurus at the
Fragrance Foundation. Exposure to sunlight or extremes of
temperature change a perfume's scent and quality.
</P>
<P>
   Colognes and toilet water can be kept in the refrigerator to
invigorate the scent. Perfume should be stored in its box in a
cool, dry place away from sunlight.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Someone left a Bible where I work and no one has claimed it.
Any idea what to do with it?
</P>
<P>
   _Jake Guzman
</P>
<P>
   A. Is it in fairly good shape? Donate the Bible to a nearby
church.
</P>
<P>
   If the Bible is no longer usable (binding coming apart, pages
soiled), that is another matter. According to Helen Osmanat the
Catholic Diocese of Austin,a blessed or consecrated Bible is sacred
(these volumes are often inscribed) and should be buried or burned.
If the Bible has not been blessed, disposition is up to your
discretion.Q: You enlightened us with the origin of ``stat.'' How
about the origin of ``stet,'' the editor's mark meaning ``ignore my
other marks and leave as is''? Being a newspaper columnist, I'm
sure you have some experience with this.
</P>
<P>
   A: Break out the Latin dictionary _ this is the third person
singular, present subjunctive of ``stare'' meaning ``to
stand.''Looks like Latin is more than a source for answers in The
New York Times crossword puzzle. My old Latin teacher, Sister
Cecilia, would be proud.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My wife flies to Korea in April and will return in May. Can
you give us the preparations used to minimize jet lag on both
trips?
</P>
<P>
   _R.D.B.
</P>
<P>
   A: Even jet-setting has a down side.
</P>
<P>
   Body time and local time at war? Sandy McDonough of Austin
Diagnostic Center's Travel Clinicsays a little common sense goes a
long way: Get adequate rest before traveling, reduce smoking and
avoid alcohol and caffeine, carry healthy snacks and avoid heavy
meals, increase fluid intake (eight ounces per hour during flight),
exercise (in-seat flexes, walking around), sleep as much as
possible on the plane (request pillow and blankets and bring ear
plugs and eye cover, shower or wash hands and face at stops.
</P>
<P>
   So skip the free champagne, grab some shut-eye and drink water
like a fish. McDonough adds sleeping pills are not recommended, as
they interrupt normal sleep patterns. Upon arrival, do not
immediately sleep. Get some sunshine if possible.
</P>
<P>
   Q:What is the deal with the new quarters? Is there something
behind them or is the government just issuing new quarters?
</P>
<P>
   _J. Wilson
</P>
<P>
   A:Beginning this year, the U.S. Mint is starting a ten-year
celebration of the 50 states. Each year five new quarters will be
issued, celebrating each state in turn _ according to the date it
was admitted to the union. The first five quarters (check your
pockets) honor Delaware, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Georgia or
Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   This is the first change to the quarter since the bicentennial
quarter was issued in 1975-76. The familiar George Washington
silhouette replaced Lady Liberty on the obverse of the quarter in
1932. Contact Jane Greig, author of ``Thanks for Asking,'' at P.O.
Box 670, Austin 78767; (512) 445-3697; e-mail

 &HT;    Web twinkles with astrologers' readings
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Everyone knows the best use of the Web isn't research, nor is it
finding out if it's going to rain tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   The most important use of the Web is getting your horoscope.
Otherwise, why would there be so many different horoscope sites on
the Web? The good thing about that sort of astrological richness is
you are almost sure to find just what you want to hear from one
site or another.
</P>
<P>
   Let's start our journey through the stars with a site for the
astrologer Sidney Omarr.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, you'll find sites for Omarr scattered across the Web,
but one of the best places to find him is on The Washington Post
site at www.washingtonpost
</P>
<P>
   .com/wp-srv/style/columns
</P>
<P>
   /horoscope.htm. This is a very straightforward site. No added
features, no fancy stuff like compatibility matching or horoscopes
for the entire year. Just the identical predictions you'll find in
the morning newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   If it's fancy and elaborate you want, then check out Jonathan
Cainer's site at www.bubble
</P>
<P>
   .com/WEBSTARS/. Cainer is a British astrologer, and his
predictions appear in the United Kingdom's Daily Mail.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's just his European nature, but Cainer seems more
entertaining and bolder in his predictions than most astrologers.
And his site does offer _ besides the standard daily horoscope _
extras such as year-ahead forecasts, weekly forecasts and a way to
check your horoscope for the day before.
</P>
<P>
   Astrology Net at serv2
</P>
<P>
   .astrology.net/ is more elaborate. There are special romance and
compatibility forecasts, general information about astrology, live
chats, a gift store (there are plenty of commercial offers on this
site), lists of famous people who share your sign, monthly
forecasts and the standard daily forecasts (you can even specify
whether you'd like the short version or a longer one). The
astrologer in residence here is Kelli Fox, well known in astrology
circles.
</P>
<P>
   If you're really into astrology, the sites mentioned might not
suit you. After all, you probably want something more precise.
While there are sites on the Web that offer that service, many of
them charge, so you may want to compute your own horoscope using
your place of birth and the time of day you were born.
</P>
<P>
   The next site called Astrodienst at www.astro.ch/homepage
</P>
<P>
   /indexe.ht is primarily a pay site, but it does have a nifty
feature. You'll be able to find the latitude and longitude (along
with time zone information) for almost any city you can name.
</P>
<P>
   Truth is, even if you think flipping a coin is about as accurate
as astrology and a lot less weird, you still may want to bookmark
this site.
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of school assignments and other grown-up chores require
time zone or geographical information.

 &HT;    AlphaSmart's a `cool,' lightweight word processor
 &HT;    By Jennifer Hill
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Anyone who has ever carried around a laptop computer knows even
the lightest machine becomes a heavyweight over time.
</P>
<P>
   So it was with some concern that I began searching for portable
options for my son to use for writing at home and school.
</P>
<P>
   Although he seems comfortable carrying most of his current
valuable earthly possessions and a revolving library of six to
seven books in a load that probably weighs a little less than a
baby hippo, I was reluctant to add to his daily backpack load.
</P>
<P>
   While cruising Web sites about technology and learning, I kept
coming across references to the AlphaSmart keyboard. So I surfed on
over to the company's site at www.alphasmart
</P>
<P>
   .com/, where I discovered you can obtain a loaner keyboard for
two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The loaner came about four days after filling out the forms,
just in time for a trial run working with the initial outline of my
son's science fair project. And, for good measure, there also was a
poetry assignment.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is it? How does it work?'' greeted its emergence from the
box. Both boys, who were immediately intrigued, deftly and easily
handled the footlong keyboard. It really is amazingly light.
</P>
<P>
   Its trim size is due to the fact it is a word processor, not a
laptop computer. But what it does, it does well.
</P>
<P>
   The AlphaSmart has eight files. File 1, which automatically
opens when the unit is turned on, will hold 16 pages of
single-spaced text. (The screen is four lines long.) Files 2-5 are
eight pages long, 6 and 7 are six pages, and 8 is four pages. The
total storage capacity is 64 pages of single-spaced copy, or
128,000 characters.
</P>
<P>
   With this arrangement, more than one family member can use the
AlphaSmart by working in different files, or one person can work on
several entries, or organize one long one.
</P>
<P>
   The shape and size of the keyboard make it easy to type on, but
I do wish it had a handle. I had visions of it flying out of the
crook of my son's sweatshirt-covered arm when bumped in the normal
jostling of life at school.
</P>
<P>
   And while a company spokesman assured me it could survive knocks
to the floor from a table or desk, she did draw the line for times
when the AlphaSmart meets concrete. And I wonder what effect the
ubiquitous woodchip dust at my children's school might have. (I
know for a fact this dust has the ability to creep inside tied
shoes, rendering once-white socks a permanent shade of greige.)
</P>
<P>
   Transferring a file from the AlphaSmart to your Mac or PC (it's
compatible with both) is simple. My 12-year-old was able to do it
unassisted the third time he used the machine.
</P>
<P>
   To transfer a file, you start your word processing software on
your desktop and open up a new file. Then you unplug the keyboard
cable from the keyboard and plug it in to the AlphaSmart. Press
``send'' on the AlphaSmart keyboard, and the file begins to
transfer.
</P>
<P>
   Watching the words appear on the screen of old Mac is what the
magic of technology is all about. As his Japanese-style poem about
Clyde, his frog, flowed onto the screen, my son uttered a soft but
sincere ``Cool.''
</P>
<P>
   That softly uttered exclamation also signaled to my mom antenna
that if he had one, he would likely use it, even at school, because
it was, after all, cool.
</P>
<P>
   Three AAA batteries provide about 120 hours of use.
</P>
<P>
   But the best thing about the AlphaSmart may be its price. At
$229-$249, it makes portability affordable for many would-be users.

 &HT;    NEWS FOR KIDS: Christian, Jews prepare to celebrate
 &HT;    By Judith Green
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Your family may celebrate one of two religious holidays this
week. If you're Jewish, you'll probably begin the eight-day
celebration of Passover on Wednesday evening. And if you're
Christian, you're likely to celebrate Easter this Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Though these two holidays remember different events for these
religions, they have some links.
</P>
<P>
   Passover celebrates the escape of the Jews from slavery in Egypt
nearly 3,500 years ago. The story of the escape and their 40-year
journey to the land that is now Israel, is told in Exodus. Exodus
is the second book of the Old Testament in the Bible.
</P>
<P>
   Christians believe Jesus, who was Jewish, is the son of God,
whose resurrection from the dead is celebrated on Easter. The story
of Jesus' life, death and resurrection is written in the Gospels of
the New Testament in the Bible.
</P>
<P>
   The Seder and the Last Supper
</P>
<P>
   The Gospels say the Last Supper eaten by Jesus and his 12
followers before his death was a Seder. The Seder is a symbolic
meal served on the first night of Passover. This year, Passover
falls between Palm Sunday and Easter, just as it did 2,000 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   When Jesus broke the bread and told his disciples to eat it in
his memory, he was holding a piece of matzo, an unrisen bread. The
wine he blessed and offered to them was the wine in the Seder cup.
</P>
<P>
   The bread and wine were adopted by the Christian religion as
part of its own rituals. A round wafer of flat bread or a piece of
real bread is eaten and a chalice of red wine drunk at Holy
Communion. Communion is central to Christian worship.
</P>
<P>
   The story of Passover
</P>
<P>
   Hebrews, who became known as Jews, settled in Egypt around 1500
B.C. but later were enslaved.
</P>
<P>
   In the 13th century B.C., a Jewish leader named Moses encouraged
his people to seek freedom. (The story of his youth is told in the
movie ``The Prince of Egypt.'') According to the Bible, the pharaoh
Ramses II refused to release them, and God punished the Egyptians.
God sent 10 plagues, including livestock disease, hail and swarms
of locusts. After each disaster, the pharaoh agreed to release the
Jews, then went back on his word.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Moses called for the 10th and most terrible plague: the
death of firstborn children of Egyptian families. On the night
Moses had predicted, the Bible says, God sent the Angel of Death to
kill the oldest child of each Egyptian household.
</P>
<P>
   The Jews were told to slaughter a lamb and mark their doors with
its blood so the angel would know to pass over their houses. That
is how the holiday got its name.
</P>
<P>
   Getting out of town
</P>
<P>
   After he called down the last plague, Moses told his people to
be ready to leave at any time. That night was the one before
families did their weekly baking, so the women did not set out the
bread dough for its overnight rising. They mixed the dough without
yeast (so it would keep on the journey) and packed it. When they
stopped to rest, they laid out flat pieces of dough on the hot
desert rocks to bake in the sun. The baked dough was called matzo _
unrisen bread. Made of flour and water, it looks and tastes like a
cracker.
</P>
<P>
   The Seder
</P>
<P>
   Today, the Passover meal begins with the ritual of the Seder, a
word that means ``order.'' During the Seder, the Exodus story is
retold and foods that symbolize the Passover events are eaten.
</P>
<P>
   The book of prayers, stories and procedures for Passover is the
Haggadah. The foods on the Passover plate are:
</P>
<P>
   Maror (MA-ror): bitter herbs (horseradish) for the bitterness of
slavery.
</P>
<P>
   Karpas (KAR-pas): a green vegetable (parsley, lettuce,
watercress) symbolic of spring. It is dipped in salt water to
recall the tears shed in slavery.
</P>
<P>
   Charoseth (ha-RO-seth): a mixture of chopped apples, spice, nuts
and wine, for the mortar that bound the stones of the Pyramids.
</P>
<P>
   Zeroa (ze-RO-ah): a roasted leg bone, for the lamb whose blood
ensured freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Beitzah (bay-TZAH): an egg, hard-boiled and then oven-roasted,
for the Egyptian children who died so near the start of their
lives.
</P>
<P>
   Chazeret (ha-ZER-et): an optional bitter vegetable such as a
parsnip.

 &HT;    NEWS FOR KIDS: U.S. attacks Yugoslavia
 &HT;    By Theresa Walsh Giarrusso
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The United States and its allies began bombing Yugoslavia last
week, trying to bring peace to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo is a province that wants independence from Yugoslavia.
Yugoslavia's Serbian leaders don't want to let it break away, and
Serbian military forces have killed or driven away many Kosovo
residents.
</P>
<P>
   North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) warplanes and missiles
blasted targets, trying to weaken the Serbian military and its
defense systems.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials insist the bombing won't stop until Serb leaders
agree to a peace deal.

<P>
   historic baseball game
</P>
<P>
   One hundred American students traveled to Cuba to watch the
Baltimore Orioles take on the Cuban National team over the weekend.
The students also got to play their own game against Cuban kids.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids here play a more exciting kind of baseball,'' said
Jimmy Petrila, a 12-year-old from Washington. ``In the United
States, people swing for the fences. Here there are a lot of bunts
and stealing. It is a more strategic kind of playing.''
</P>
<P>
   The students, all from the Baltimore-Washington area, were among
a small group of foreigners who got to watch the exhibition match
in person.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time in 40 years that a major-league team
played in Cuba. Big leaguers used to travel to the island nation
before the 1959 revolution that brought Communist Fidel Castro to
power.

   Poacher busted by DNA
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, Florida wildlife officials used a deer's DNA
to prove the animal was killed illegally. DNA is a substance found
in all living creatures.
</P>
<P>
   The hunter in the case said he had killed a buck, or male deer.
But when the deer meat was analyzed by researchers at the
University of Florida, they proved it was from two does _ female
deer. It is illegal to kill does in certain areas.
</P>
<P>
   The hunter was fined $1,661, and his hunting license was
suspended for three years.

 &HT;    NEWS FOR KIDS: Wrestling goes Hollywood
 &HT;    By Jeffry Scott
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hollywood is seeking new action heroes to star in its movies,
and guess where it's looking?
</P>
<P>
   Producers and directors are glued to wrestling shows, like TNT's
``WCW Monday Nitro'' and the USA Network's ``Raw Is War'' to find
their new stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hollywood Hogan'' has led the way from the ring to the silver
screen, acting in more than 13 films, including ``No Holds
Barred,'' ``Mr. Nanny,'' and ``Rocky III.''
</P>
<P>
   Now other famous guys in shorts _ Stone Cold Steve Austin, Bill
Goldberg and Kevin Nash _ hope to be box office smashes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Producers are looking for new action stars now that Sylvester
Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger are getting older,'' says
Hollywood agent Barry Bloom, who works for WCW star Goldberg.
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg stars as a bad guy named Romeo in a new action movie,
``Universal Soldier, The Sequel,'' which will be in movie theaters
this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm always reading new movie scripts,'' says the 6-foot,
4-inch-tall, 291-pound Goldberg, who has become one of the hottest
wrestlers around.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what I really want to do, be in the movies,'' Goldberg
says.
</P>
<P>
   The rivalry between the wrestlers even extends outside the ring.
The WCW's Goldberg _ who has challenged WWF's big star, Stone Cold
Steve Austin to a $100,000 grudge match _ beat out Austin for the
role in ``Universal Soldier.''
</P>
<P>
   Austin has appeared in a recent episode of the TV show, ``Nash
Bridges,'' playing a cop, and the producers say they want him in
another.
</P>
<P>
   The WCW's Kevin Nash (``Big Sexy'') appeared on an episode of
``The Love Boat'' with Goldberg last September.
</P>
<P>
   In that show, Nash played Goldberg's wrestling partner who
wouldn't leave Goldberg alone, even though Goldberg was on his
honeymoon.
</P>
<P>
   That's kind of funny since Nash was suddenly Goldberg's worst
enemy in December. He beat him to become WCW world heavyweight
champion.
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg vows: ``I'll be back!''
</P>
<P>
   That is, if he's not too busy making a movie!

READ ME: SOME EASY ANSWERS ON KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>
  By MICHAEL KINSLEY 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is often said that there are no easy answers, but in fact
there are. In a former life I used to interrogate politicians on
television, and in six years there was never a subject on which
they were unable to come up with an easy answer. Not necessarily a
correct answer--or honest or heartfelt or logically coherent--but
easy.
</P>
<P>
   The current issue of American military involvement in Kosovo,
for example, seems to be a yes-or-no question to which either
conventional answer--call them ``yes'' and ``no''--is decidedly
uneasy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes'' means risking American lives in a faraway land that has
no apparent connection to the only thing that really matters, which
is the Dow Jones industrial average.
</P>
<P>
   ``No'' means doing nothing, as the world's only superpower,
while a thug government commits daily televised atrocities against
white people in Europe (not just some unmediated Africans). Unless
you're extraordinarily lucky, the outcome of making either choice
will leave you morally implicated in some dead bodies (with larger
raw numbers making up for lack of American citizenship in the case
of a ``no'').
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, even for Kosovo there are answers available besides
yes and no. They will be familiar from intervention disputes dating
back at least to Vietnam, but they are especially useful for the
summer-squall-style military actions of today, in which we all
agree to be frenzied about the occupation of Kuwait or a
drug-smuggling dictator in Panama or warlords in Somalia or
genocide in Bosnia on the strict understanding that we will be
allowed to forget all about these matters and places in six months,
max.
</P>
<P>
   Here are a few consumer-tested easy answers on issues like
Kosovo:
</P>
<P>
   1. ``Well, Cokie, my concern is that if we go into (INSERT
LOCATION), we should do so with the resources necessary to get the
job done. Airstrikes alone (or 'only 200,000 troops' or 'a mere
half a dozen hydrogen bombs' or whatever is on the menu) just
aren't enough. It is immoral to put American soldiers at risk
without a guarantee of overwhelming superiority for a certain and
speedy victory.''
</P>
<P>
   This is perhaps the most prestigious dodge: the Powell Doctrine,
named for Gen. Colin Powell (who is responsible for the doctrine
but not its use as a dodge). The Powell Doctrine holds that the
lesson of Vietnam is do it right or not at all. Go in full force
from the beginning rather than escalate yourself into a quagmire.
Or don't go in at all. Finish quickly before the public loses
patience (or ideally, as in the case of Grenada, before the public
has even heard of the place).
</P>
<P>
   Or, of course, don't start at all. As to which of these
alternatives--all or nothing at all--is the right one in any
situation, the Powell Doctrine does not say. So this is a great way
to sound tough and sophisticated without actually committing
yourself. Since any actual military engagement is not going to
involve every last wing nut in the Pentagon's ``miscellaneous
screws'' jar, you are well positioned to say ``I told you so'' if
things go badly. Yet you never actually opposed the action, so
you're OK if things go well. And no one can accuse you of wimping
out if the military action doesn't take place: Hey, you
</P>
<P>
   wanted to go in with more force!
</P>
<P>
   2. ``I don't think we should begin bombing unless and until the
Serbs really begin a very significant massacre against the people
in Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   That is Don Nickles of Oklahoma in Tuesday's Wall Street Journal
(where most of these quotes come from). In a way, this is not a
dodge. It is a sort of madcap Solomonic approach. Nickles is
saying: ``Why must we guess whether Milosevic is going to kill a
lot more people? Let's wait and see if he does it! And why must we
choose between saving a lot of Kosovars and saving none? Let's
split the difference and save half of them.'' As a bonus, Nickles
retains a valuable fudge factor in the question of what qualifies
as ``a very significant massacre.'' Depending on what happens,
Nickles is in a position to accuse the president of failing to
defend American interests and values, or of recklessly endangering
American lives on the basis of a massacre that was merely
``significant'' but not ``very significant.''
</P>
<P>
   3. ``What's happening in (WHEREVER) is a tragedy and an outrage,
Wolf. Intervention to stop the bloodshed is absolutely essential.
But it's a job for (INSERT NAME OF CLOSER COUNTRY AND/OR REGIONAL
GROUP), not for the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   This final dodge is slightly different. You're claiming credit
for sharing whatever humanitarian or geostrategic concern dictates
military action, while opposing the use of the only military power
you yourself bear responsibility for.
</P>
<P>
   I once interviewed an especially moronic senator, since
defeated, who declared that some worthy military action was ``a job
for the United Nations.'' I asked him why other countries should
risk their soldiers' lives if the United States wouldn't, and he
replied, ``I didn't say 'other nations,' I said the United
Nations.'' When it was pointed out to him that U.N. troops don't
come from Mars, he was stymied. That point had never occurred to
him.
</P>
<P>
   But exposing the logical flaw here does not depend on any
huffing and puffing about America's leadership role. An American
pol going on American television to say that the Europeans should
tidy up the former Yugoslavia without our help is like the
Economist running (as has been known to happen) a stuffy editorial
saying that a corrupt dictator in some Third World country should
resign.
</P>
<P>
   Of course he should. And the sun should shine in London every
day. But even the Economist's opinion cannot affect these matters.
When an answer moves beyond difficult to completely impossible, it
becomes easy once again.
</P>
<P>
   Watch for these easy answers on the TV talk shows and in the
newspaper. Practice on your own. Soon you too can be ducking
responsibility like a real-life member of Congress.

 Includes a color slide of Dermot Mulroney with Patricia Arquette in
a scene from ``Goodbye Lover.'' 
 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Dermot Mulroney is not a lawyer. And he doesn't play one on
television, either.
 &HT;    Just the other day a female fan told Mulroney, ``I love you in
that TV show, `The Practice.'''
 &HT;    Another fan once told him, ```In the Line of Fire' was such a
cool movie. You had great chemistry with Clint Eastwood.'''
 &HT;    Mulroney just nodded and smiled. Explaining takes too much
trouble.
 &HT;    He doesn't have a television series. He didn't star in that 1993
Eastwood hit. That was Dylan McDermott.
 &HT;    For years, the industry and fans have mixed up the two actors,
and things are only getting worse. The 34-year-old Mulroney's
biggest hit was ``My Best Friend's Wedding'' (1997), which
co-starred Julia Roberts _ who in real life was once engaged to ...
Dylan McDermott.
 &HT;    ``It boggles the mind,'' the good-natured Mulroney says over
breakfast at the Four Seasons Hotel in Los Angeles, reed-slim and
relaxed in blue jeans and a black sweater. ``Hey, between us, we
have an incredible resume.''
 &HT;    There is one sure way to tell the actors apart, he adds.
 &HT;    ``I have a scar on my face from when I was a kid and fell on a
broken dish while trying to feed some rabbits,'' he says. ``Now I'm
glad I have the scar _ it sets me apart.''
 &HT;    Another way: Mulroney is the one starring in ``Goodbye, Lover,''
the noirish thriller/comedy opening nationwide on April 16 and
co-starring Patricia Arquette and Don Johnson.
 &HT;    ``It's a significantly different comedy,'' Mulroney says.
``Basically, Patricia and I are plotting to murder my brother,
played by Don. This is a very serious dark comedy that reveals
itself slowly.
 &HT;    ``So few movies allow the audience a chance to figure it out for
themselves,'' he adds. ``Frankly, I'm sick of movies that don't
have a script, but they're wrapped up in this attitude. Most movies
today are just palatable _ they don't excite the mind.''
 &HT;    ``My Best Friend's Wedding'' excited minds to the tune of more
than $100 million at the box office, but Mulroney is under no
illusion that he was its drawing card.
 &HT;    ``I think that movie is the ultimate comedy,'' he says,
``because here you had characters played by Julia Roberts and
Cameron Diaz fighting over me. I swear when I got the part, I told
my wife, `I've got to lie down, honey. Send me a damp towel. This
is really too much.'
 &HT;    ``She said, `Yes, dear. The film is clearly a fantasy.'''
 &HT;    The film's success led to some new opportunities for Mulroney,
but the actor _ who has been on and off the hot list for a decade _
wasn't impressed.
 &HT;    ``Oh, I've certainly heard it all before,'' he says. ``I've
heard, `You're going to be the hottest thing alive,' and then it
doesn't happen. Then you're chilly cold and have to wait for a
thaw. So those little tags don't carry much weight with me anymore.
I don't put any stock in one film _ I have a wait-and-see attitude,
because I've been disappointed a few times.
 &HT;    ``In fact,'' he adds, ``the only difference I noticed with `My
Best Friend's Wedding' is that the film had a lot of promotion.
It's sad, but Hollywood now is really about how much they spend on
your movie after you make it.''
 &HT;    Mulroney's resume reflects quality films that haven't made much
money, including ``Kansas City'' (1996), ``The Trigger Effect''
(1997) and ``How to Make an American Quilt'' (1997). His more
commercial efforts, such as ``Point of No Return'' (1993) and the
western ``Bad Girls'' (1994), didn't pan out, and before ``My Best
Friend's Wedding'' his last real hit had been ``Young Guns''
(1988).
 &HT;    Nevertheless, he's been working steadily for 13 years, which he
says is enough.
 &HT;    ``For me, the fame doesn't matter,'' he says. ``I don't care if
my name is above the title.''
 &HT;    Even if he could, Mulroney says, he wouldn't want to achieve Tom
Cruise's level of stardom.
 &HT;    ``I don't think the big stars have a lot of control over their
lives,'' he says. ``It's not my style to splash around the cover of
magazines.
 &HT;    ``Of course, the one good thing about being Tom Cruise is that
people do go to see all of your movies. So it's a real Catch-22.''
 &HT;    Mulroney grew up far from the Hollywood glitter, as the middle
child in a family of five in suburban Alexandria, Va. It was his
mother Ellen, a former actress, who first suggested that he try
acting.
 &HT;    He did, and liked it. Various community-theater efforts led him
to Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill., where he majored in
film.
 &HT;    ``I thought I'd get a job on a movie set pulling cable,'' he
says. ``I didn't have lofty plans.''
 &HT;    Nonetheless, he took a chance when a William Morris agent
visited the campus during Mulroney's senior year.
 &HT;    ``He put a sign-up sheet on the wall and said, `Anybody
graduating is welcome to audition for an agent,''' Mulroney
recalls. ``I signed up. It was unexpectedly easy to get going in
this business.''
 &HT;    His first role was as Bill Bixby's son in the television movie
``Sin of Innocence'' (1986), a family divorce drama he calls ```The
Brady Bunch' with sex.'''
 &HT;    That led to a series of television movies and low-budget
features. It was while making one of the latter in 1988 that he met
his wife of eight years, actress Catherine Keener. According to
her, he made a good first impression by saving her life.
 &HT;    ``The movie `Survival Quest' was about this Outward Bound
group,'' she says in a separate interview. ``The tag line was, `In
the wilderness, you can't call 911.'''
 &HT;    As it turns out, the tag line had a point.
 &HT;    ``One day while shooting in a national park, I began to drown,''
she recalls. ``I'm getting carried down a river, and Dermot was the
only man who would jump in to save me. I swear, there were a
hundred crew guys who couldn't inconvenience themselves.
 &HT;    ``Dermot jumps in this raging river, and we're carried two miles
down by this horrible current,'' she says. ``At that moment I fell
in love with him, although we were both with other people at the
time.''
 &HT;    One thing led to another, however, and in 1991 they married.
 &HT;    ``We were best friends before we got married,'' Mulroney adds,
``which is the perfect place to start.''
 &HT;    Mulroney and his brother Shaun are also entrepreneurs, owning
the Double Door, a Chicago bar which showcases rock bands. Big-name
bands such as Smashing Pumpkins, Oasis and Bush have jammed there,
as has the actor's own band, The Low and Sweet Orchestra, which
released its first album, ``Goodbye to All That,'' two years ago.
 &HT;    ``I play cello and mandolin in a rock band,'' he says, shaking
his head. ``You figure it out.''
 &HT;    His fame probably gives the band some extra pull, but even that
has its complications. Shaun Mulroney has told his brother that
people wonder when ``that guy from `The Practice' will be
playing.'''
 &HT;    Mulroney sighs.
 &HT;    ``You know, one day I'll have to star in a movie with Dylan
McDermott,'' he says. ``It would be the ultimate way to confuse
America.''

GWEN VERDON STILL HEARS THE MUSIC

entertainment package.) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not

 Includes a color slide of Gwen Verdon with Ann Reinking during
rehearsals for ``Fosse.'' 
 By MICHAEL J. BANDLER  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    ``I just back up into everything,'' Gwen Verdon says.
 &HT;    That's the secret behind her more than a half-century as an
entertainer, she says. It accounts for success on stage, in films
and on television, not to mention an armful of Tony Awards and,
most recently, the National Medal of the Arts.
 &HT;    Along the way, she's taught Marilyn Monroe how to walk, served
as muse to arguably the century's greatest choreographer and, most
notably, sang and danced up a storm in such Broadway hits as ``Damn
Yankees'' (1955), ``New Girl in Town'' (1957), ``Sweet Charity''
(1966) and ``Chicago'' (1975).
 &HT;    And she isn't through yet. The hit new revue ``Fosse'' _
celebrating her late husband, director/choreographer Bob Fosse _
brought her back to Broadway as its artistic adviser. She has two
movies in the can. And her daughter, Nicole Fosse, recently gave
birth to Verdon's fifth grandchild _ perhaps the best treat of all
for the 74-year-old, who is already a great-grandmother as well.
 &HT;    But don't count on Verdon doing much babysitting. She recently
taped an episode of ``Walker, Texas Ranger,'' with more film and
television work to come.
 &HT;    It's rare for musical performers to find work after they pass
song-and-dance age, but when Verdon hung up her dancing shoes she
quickly found work with such prestigious directors as Francis Ford
Coppola (1984's ``The Cotton Club'') and Ron Howard (1985's
``Cocoon''). By the time she finished working with them, her new
career was well underway.
 &HT;    Verdon knew something about brilliant directors through her
years with Fosse. The mercurial dance innovator was her
professional partner from 1955 until his death in 1987, and the two
married in 1960. They separated in the early 1970s but never
divorced, even as he moved on to other women _ including Ann
Reinking, who later became a close friend of Verdon and co-directed
``Fosse.''
 &HT;    Even when she wasn't in a Fosse production, Verdon says, she was
always around, working with dancers, offering the director an
objective eye and even tracking down a gorilla suit for the 1972
movie version of ``Cabaret.''
 &HT;    ``We were always together,'' Verdon says during a conversation
at Sardi's, the legendary Manhattan theater-themed restaurant where
her caricature has hung prominently for decades. ``I just accept it
_ that was my life. I can't imagine not belonging to him.
 &HT;    ``We were great if we didn't have to live together and deal with
mundane things,'' she adds. ``It was mundane things that drove us
nuts. I never wished him, and he never wished me, an unhappy life.
If you really examine a person and admire him, that feeling doesn't
go away.''
 &HT;    Since Fosse's death Verdon has seen herself as a keeper of the
flame, helping to create a Fosse archive at the Library of
Congress, establishing a scholarship to train dancers in the Fosse
style and, of course, working with Reinking and others to create
``Fosse.''
 &HT;    ``I was determined that Bob's work somehow would be seen
again,'' she says. ``It deserved it. And audiences deserved to see
not just those dance numbers, but his point of view about theater _
his use of the stage and the levels of the stage. No one else has
approached theater and dance the way Bob did.
 &HT;    ``He could not be categorized, either in his work or in his
character,'' she says. ``He truly was very interesting, very unique
_ and always a surprise.''
 &HT;    The daughter of an MGM gaffer who worked on Greta Garbo movies
and the ``Tarzan'' series _ ``Johnny Weismuller taught me the
backstroke, his specialty,'' she recalls _ Gwyneth Verdon was born
with rickets, which was then usually treated by breaking the legs
and letting the bones realign.
 &HT;    But her mother, a dancer, chose her own method _ corrective
shoes and dance exercises.
 &HT;    ``I did them completely wrong, with my feet turned in,
pigeon-toed and knock-kneed,'' she says, laughing. ``I think that's
why it was so easy to dance for Bob Fosse.''
 &HT;    Verdon was a trouper from the outset. As a teen she danced with
several professional companies and modeled bathing suits. At 17 she
married Jim Henaghan, a columnist for The Hollywood Reporter, and
nine months later gave birth to her first child, James. The
marriage, troubled by Henaghan's alcoholism, lasted only five
years.
 &HT;    One night when her husband was ``on one of his big drunks,''
Verdon took over his assignment to cover a nightclub show. There
she encountered the Afro-Cuban jazz style of Jack Cole, and was
mesmerized. Going backstage, she asked to work with him, and for
the next couple of years assisted Cole on Broadway projects and
then in Hollywood. She performed as a ``specialty dancer'' in
movies such as ``David and Bathsheba'' (1952) and ``The Merry
Widow'' (1952), and worked behind the scenes teaching actresses
such as Marilyn Monroe and Jane Russell how to move.
 &HT;    ``Marilyn would wiggle so much she could never get someplace,''
Verdon recalls, ``so I would have to calm her down. And I had to
teach Jane not to act so tough. She was sort of clod-walking. I got
her to believe she was only 5-feet-4, instead of 6 feet tall.''
 &HT;    One day choreographer Michael Kidd saw Verdon perform, which led
to her Broadway debut in a small role in Kidd's ``Can-Can'' (1953)
_ and with it a name change so she'd fit on a marquee.
 &HT;    The opening night was the stuff of Broadway legend. Though she
wasn't the star, the audience rose and summoned Verdon for a
curtain call. Kidd had to all but drag her onstage from her
dressing room.
 &HT;    ``They wouldn't stop applauding,'' she recalls dreamily.
 &HT;    That role won her first Tony award. Two years later, in Fosse's
``Damn Yankees,'' she won a second Tony and etched herself
indelibly in Broadway history with her playfully sultry ``Whatever
Lola Wants, Lola Gets,'' recreating the role for the 1958 film.
 &HT;    ``New Girl in Town'' and ``Redhead'' (1959) followed, each
winning another Tony.
 &HT;    Even Nicole's birth didn't slow her down much _ she was back on
Broadway three years later in ``Sweet Charity,'' and then again in
1975 for ``Chicago.''
 &HT;    Verdon's shift to nonmusical acting wasn't a shock _ even during
the peak of her musical stardom she'd been studying with acting
guru Sanford Meisner _ but she admits that it was a difficult
transition, Tony Awards notwithstanding.
 &HT;    ``People don't think of you as an actor,'' she says with a
shrug.
 &HT;    By now, however, people do. Specializing in
eccentric-but-vigorous oldsters, she'll be seen as Ellen Burstyn's
nosy next-door neighbor in the upcoming ``Walking Across Egypt''
and as an agoraphobic woman who shares her house with a Great Dane
in ``Bruno.'' The latter film is being directed by Shirley
MacLaine, another Fosse veteran _ she won Verdon's part for the
1969 film version of ``Sweet Charity,'' but Verdon didn't hold a
grudge and even helped her learn the dances.
 &HT;    One day last fall, out of the blue, the actress got a call
informing her that she had been selected to receive the National
Medal of the Arts. On a bright November morning, under a glistening
white tent on the south lawn of the White House, Verdon received
her award from President Clinton, in the company of such fellow
honorees as film star Gregory Peck and opera singer Roberta Peters.
 &HT;    Saluting her, the president observed that ``this famous redhead
is showing us all that she is still alive and kicking.''
 &HT;    Indeed she is. At an age when many people have long since
retired, Verdon volunteers that she'd love the chance to appear in
a costume drama like ``Elizabeth'' or ``Shakespeare in Love.''
 &HT;    Or even a western, she adds.
 &HT;    ``I could always be the lady who runs the whorehouse!''

MELINA KANAKAREDES: DIVINE `PROVIDENCE'

 Includes a color slide of Melina Kanakaredes in a scene from
``Providence.'' 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    It isn't hard to tell when you're suddenly famous.
 &HT;    ``I was in New York City for the premiere of `Providence,'''
says Melina Kanakaredes, the ebullient star of NBC's surprise
midseason hit. ``We were going down Broadway, and there was my
face, on a billboard!
 &HT;    ``I'd never seen my face that big before,'' she says, still
amazed. ``My mother nearly stopped everybody on the street to say,
`That's my baby!' It was so bizarre to see her all excited.
 &HT;    ``I was like, `Oh my God, this is very strange,''' the actress
recalls. ``I remembered back to when I graduated from college and
moved to New York. I barely made 200 bucks a month doing
off-off-off Broadway.
 &HT;    ``And now there was my head on this wall.''
 &HT;    The excitement was just beginning. That evening ``Providence's''
debut episode captured the attention of nearly 20 million viewers.
 &HT;    Kanakaredes, a Greek-American beauty who's all slate-gray eyes
and cascading curls, awoke the next morning as Hollywood's latest
overnight success.
 &HT;    ``Every teacher in every school, during roll call on that first
day, would say `Melina Ka ... Kana ... ,''' she says with a laugh
during a telephone call from her rented home in Los Angeles. ``Now,
to have Jay Leno say, `And next, Melina Kanakaredes,' is
incredible.''
 &HT;    Kanakaredes is actually far from an overnight success. She's 31
and has been kicking around stage, television and movie circles for
years. Her credits include a four-year stint on the soap opera
``Guiding Light,'' the television series ``NYPD Blue'' (as Jimmy
Smits' girlfriend), ``New York News'' and ``Leaving L.A,'' plus
such films as ``The Long Kiss Goodbye'' (1996) and ``Rounders''
(1998).
 &HT;    NBC recognized her talent _ she projects genuine earthiness _
and inked her to a production deal. Kanakaredes passed on several
proposed projects, including a new cop drama and a role on ``Law
and Order,'' until the ``Providence'' script arrived for her
consideration.
 &HT;    The show would follow the joys and sorrows of the Hansen family
of Providence, R.I., with Kanakaredes in the pivotal role of
Sydney, the oldest and most sensible Hansen sibling. In the pilot,
Mom Hansen (Concetta Tomei) dies in the middle of a wedding,
prompting disenchanted plastic surgeon Sydney to remain in
Providence with her veterinarian father (Mike Farrell), troublesome
brother (Seth Peterson) and pregnant sister (Paula Cale).
 &HT;    ``I honestly thought `Providence' might catch on,'' Kanakaredes
says. ``As usual, I had to judge an entire series on one pilot
script. I had no idea what would happen after the pilot, but I was
so taken with the characters and the way it was written, with all
those bizarre twists and turns.
 &HT;    ``I really liked Sydney, and I attached myself to her,'' the
actress says. ``I decided to do it, thinking, `Whatever happens,
it'll be something I really enjoy doing. If it doesn't go to
series, I'll have an hour of material to put on my clip reel.'
 &HT;    ``The other scripts I read reminded me of other shows on
television,'' she adds. ```Providence' struck me as something new
and different. Family drama is not new, but it hasn't been done in
this way, in this venue, with our quirkiness.
 &HT;    ``So far I haven't been proved wrong.''
 &HT;    Critics tore into ``Providence'' with a vengeance. Some declared
the show cloying or syrupy, others deemed it contrived or downright
silly.
 &HT;    Almost every reviewer detested the show's trademark device:
Sydney's dead mom comes to her in dreams, bitching about life and
death, complaining about Sydney's choice in men and chain-smoking
like Denis Leary in drag.
 &HT;    Kanakaredes took it all in stride.
 &HT;    ``I always say I love constructive criticism, and that's because
a television show can take it to heart, adjust certain elements and
make it better,'' the actress says. ``In many cases, the criticism
of `Providence' was not constructive.
 &HT;    ``In those instances I went, `Apple pie, cherry pie.' Some
people love `Providence' and some don't. That's fine,'' she says.
``The validation is that the audience really loves it. Also, the
critics tooled on the show, but they weren't so bad to me.''
 &HT;    Kanakaredes laughs.
 &HT;    ``I'm thankful,'' she says, ``for the little miracles.''
 &HT;    Right now, with its audience growing, ``Providence'' seems
primed for a lengthy run. Such a prospect hardly daunts
Kanakaredes, who calls Brooklyn, N.Y., her home and only rents her
place in Los Angeles.
 &HT;    ``It's always a roller-coaster ride, and you never know what's
going to happen tomorrow,'' she says. ``We all just want to
continue to raise the bar on the material, make the best show we
can and enjoy ourselves in the process.
 &HT;    ``If it goes five or six years, I guess I'm ready for that,''
Kanakaredes says. ``You sign on for that _ I've got a five-year
contract.
 &HT;    ``This year just flew by, and I hope it will continue like
that,'' she says. ``We have a great group of people, cast and crew.
I'm sure actors say that all the time, but we do, and I couldn't
ask for the experience to be any better.''
 &HT;    A native of Akron, Ohio, Kanakaredes knew early on that acting
was her destiny. She jokes that she's been performing for ages _
albeit for much of that time without pay.
 &HT;    ``I'm the youngest of three girls,'' she says. ``My sisters did
a lot of musical theater growing up, so I started singing and
dancing.
 &HT;    ``I said to my parents, `I want to be an actress,' and they
said, `Well, OK, just make sure your grades are good and that you
have something to fall back on.'
 &HT;    ``Right into college I just kept on acting,'' Kanakaredes says.
``I never worried about making a living from it, because the
worst-case scenario was to go home and work in my family's candy
business.
 &HT;    ``I continue to love what I do,'' the actress says cheerfully.
``It's fun to leave yourself and jump into somebody else's skin for
a while. To do that you have to collaborate so much with other
people, all of whom bring their own talent to the show or movie.
 &HT;    ``When it all comes together, it can be magical.''
 &HT;    Magical and life-altering. Not only can Jay Leno now pronounce
her name, but fans recognize Kanakaredes in the streets and
producers are calling with movie offers.
 &HT;    It's a decidedly heady time, but the actress has her family _
most notably her sisters and her husband of six years, New York
chef Peter Constantinides _ to help keep her feet on the ground and
her ego in check.
 &HT;    ``My sanity is my family,'' she says. ``Actually, my sanity and
my insanity is my family. We see each other as much as we can, even
though we're often on different coasts.
 &HT;    ``I'm Greek, and togetherness is a big part of our culture,''
she adds. ``My husband is of the same background.
 &HT;    ``My attitude is I love what I do, but it's not 100 percent of
who I am,'' Kanakaredes says. ``Being with my family puts
everything in perspective, and I don't care as much about the crazy
stuff _ the publicity and the recognition _ that's going on.''

 Includes a color slide of Kelsey Grammer in a scene from
``Frasier.'' 
 By ANDREW RYAN  
 c.1999 TV Guide Canada  
 World rights except Chicago 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   These are the very best of times for ``Frasier.''
</P>
<P>
   Since moving to Thursday nights in September 1998, the show has
thrived. Most weeks it notches even higher ratings than its
timeslot predecessor, ``Seinfeld.'' After five years of slugging it
out on Tuesdays, ``Frasier'' has settled into NBC's Thursday-night
lineup for what would appear to be an extended run _ and few people
are more surprised than Kelsey Grammer, Frasier Crane himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Believe me, it sounds extremely odd for me to say out loud
that I've been playing Frasier for 16 years now,'' says the genial
Grammer, who first played the pompous shrink on ``Cheers'' way back
in 1983. ``But this has been an extremely gratifying year for us,
for all of us. It's a message to us that all our hard work is
paying off. These are the best of times.''
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Grammer's onscreen compatriot David Hyde Pierce, who
plays Frasier's stuffy brother Niles, feels fully vindicated by the
show's resurgence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were _ and are _ a really good show,'' Pierce says. ``This
has been an amazing season for us _ we've had some of our very best
episodes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the fact we're in syndication, too, has helped our
ratings,'' he adds. ``Instead of just people who know about the
show sitting down to watch once a week, suddenly people come home
from work, flick on the TV and realize, `That's ``Frasier?'' Hey,
it's a pretty funny show.'''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the credit for ``Frasier's'' most successful season ever
has to go to Grammer, Pierce and their collective onscreen
chemistry. There's also a lot to be said for co-stars Jane Leeves,
John Mahoney and Peri Gilpin. But there are other factors, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the compliments our show always gets, which I hate, is
that we're so intelligent, so highbrow,'' Pierce says. ``That's so
unfair. We have the broadest physical comedy _ we do everything on
this show. There happen to be two very intellectual characters in
it, but the things they go through are the same things we all go
through _ wanting to be liked, wanting to find love and all that
other stuff. Our writers know how to make these two snobby guys
very human.''
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, the writers on ``Frasier,'' who have collected
three Emmys to date, are fearless. It took nerve, for example, to
lead off this season with a story line that saw Frasier ousted from
his radio career and sunk in general depression.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got nine shows out of it,'' Grammer says with a shrug. ``It
was an interesting journey for Frasier, but we always knew he'd go
back to the station.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it made the audience uncomfortable, because Frasier's
confidence was completely shot,'' he says. ``It's interesting,
because he's often lacking in confidence. But if Frasier is in real
despair, it makes the comedy a little harder. I mean, a guy who's
pompous and out of work is a little hard to watch.''
</P>
<P>
   At this stage of the game, Grammer says, he and the writers are
hesitant to drop another full-time cast member into the mix.
There's still room for the occasional recurring character, such as
Canadian actor Saul Rubinek as Donny, Niles's sleazy lawyer who
also has designs on Daphne.
</P>
<P>
   But don't expect any new additions to the regular cast.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried that,'' Grammer says, wincing. ``A few years ago, we
added Mercedes Ruehl as the station manager, and we thought about
making her full-time. We got, like, five shows out of it, and that
seemed sufficient _ that seemed like the limit to what we had
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Which would seem to rule out a regular girlfriend for Frasier,
though the possibility is always there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly hope so,'' Pierce says jokingly. ``Don't you think
he's suffered enough?''
</P>
<P>
   Frasier's previous pairings _ with women played by JoBeth
Williams, Virginia Madsen, Linda Hamilton and other comely
actresses _ have all ended badly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly Frasier is still looking for love,'' Grammer says
with a sigh. ``We may yet find a comfortable relationship for him.
If it was filled with humor and autonomy and parity and real love,
I think it would be a wonderful thing to have.''
</P>
<P>
   On a more personal level, Grammer says that he's finally come to
terms with his own success. After a miserable and violent childhood
_ both his father and his sister were murdered _ the actor's early
years in Hollywood were marred by drunken-driving incidents and
self-admitted problems with alcohol, as well as two failed
marriages.
</P>
<P>
   All that is in the past, he says now. He's off the bottle, and
with his wife Camille _ the two married last year _ he says he's
finally able to accept his own happiness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did an interview with Details magazine where they asked me
what was my most `mondo' year,'' he says. ``And this year has been
the best year of my life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, the past two or three years have been
extraordinary,'' he says thoughtfully. ``It's sometimes hard for me
to believe that I can be functionally this happy all the time _ and
still be miserable when I need to be. There's this factor in me
that needs something to be wrong, or I just don't feel that I'm
alive. But things are very good.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides his continuing commitment to ``Frasier,'' Grammer would
like to make another ``appearance'' on ``The Simpsons,'' where he
has voiced the malevolent Sideshow Bob in several episodes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gosh, I'd love to do another one,'' he says enthusiastically.
``The last time Bob was a good guy, but he was wrongly sent back to
jail, which is really going to piss him off. I suspect when `The
Simpsons' plan their final episode, they'll have Sideshow Bob
return and finally destroy that wretched little town.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, however, ``Frasier'' should keep Grammer busy.
He's signed for three more years after this season, which would
make almost two decades of playing the same character.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will it bother me having played the exact same person for 19
years? Not at all,'' he says, smiling broadly. ``I think Frasier's
a pretty grand guy. Don't you?''

 Includes a color slide of Dermot Mulroney with Patricia Arquette in
a scene from ``Goodbye Lover.'' 
 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Dermot Mulroney is not a lawyer. And he doesn't play one on
television, either.
 &HT;    Just the other day a female fan told Mulroney, ``I love you in
that TV show, `The Practice.'''
 &HT;    Another fan once told him, ```In the Line of Fire' was such a
cool movie. You had great chemistry with Clint Eastwood.'''
 &HT;    Mulroney just nodded and smiled. Explaining takes too much
trouble.
 &HT;    He doesn't have a television series. He didn't star in that 1993
Eastwood hit. That was Dylan McDermott.
 &HT;    For years, the industry and fans have mixed up the two actors,
and things are only getting worse. The 34-year-old Mulroney's
biggest hit was ``My Best Friend's Wedding'' (1997), which
co-starred Julia Roberts _ who in real life was once engaged to ...
Dylan McDermott.
 &HT;    ``It boggles the mind,'' the good-natured Mulroney says over
breakfast at the Four Seasons Hotel in Los Angeles, reed-slim and
relaxed in blue jeans and a black sweater. ``Hey, between us, we
have an incredible resume.''
 &HT;    There is one sure way to tell the actors apart, he adds.
 &HT;    ``I have a scar on my face from when I was a kid and fell on a
broken dish while trying to feed some rabbits,'' he says. ``Now I'm
glad I have the scar _ it sets me apart.''
 &HT;    Another way: Mulroney is the one starring in ``Goodbye, Lover,''
the noirish thriller/comedy opening nationwide on April 16 and
co-starring Patricia Arquette and Don Johnson.
 &HT;    ``It's a significantly different comedy,'' Mulroney says.
``Basically, Patricia and I are plotting to murder my brother,
played by Don. This is a very serious dark comedy that reveals
itself slowly.
 &HT;    ``So few movies allow the audience a chance to figure it out for
themselves,'' he adds. ``Frankly, I'm sick of movies that don't
have a script, but they're wrapped up in this attitude. Most movies
today are just palatable _ they don't excite the mind.''
 &HT;    ``My Best Friend's Wedding'' excited minds to the tune of more
than $100 million at the box office, but Mulroney is under no
illusion that he was its drawing card.
 &HT;    ``I think that movie is the ultimate comedy,'' he says,
``because here you had characters played by Julia Roberts and
Cameron Diaz fighting over me. I swear when I got the part, I told
my wife, `I've got to lie down, honey. Send me a damp towel. This
is really too much.'
 &HT;    ``She said, `Yes, dear. The film is clearly a fantasy.'''
 &HT;    The film's success led to some new opportunities for Mulroney,
but the actor _ who has been on and off the hot list for a decade _
wasn't impressed.
 &HT;    ``Oh, I've certainly heard it all before,'' he says. ``I've
heard, `You're going to be the hottest thing alive,' and then it
doesn't happen. Then you're chilly cold and have to wait for a
thaw. So those little tags don't carry much weight with me anymore.
I don't put any stock in one film _ I have a wait-and-see attitude,
because I've been disappointed a few times.
 &HT;    ``In fact,'' he adds, ``the only difference I noticed with `My
Best Friend's Wedding' is that the film had a lot of promotion.
It's sad, but Hollywood now is really about how much they spend on
your movie after you make it.''
 &HT;    Mulroney's resume reflects quality films that haven't made much
money, including ``Kansas City'' (1996), ``The Trigger Effect''
(1997) and ``How to Make an American Quilt'' (1997). His more
commercial efforts, such as ``Point of No Return'' (1993) and the
western ``Bad Girls'' (1994), didn't pan out, and before ``My Best
Friend's Wedding'' his last real hit had been ``Young Guns''
(1988).
 &HT;    Nevertheless, he's been working steadily for 13 years, which he
says is enough.
 &HT;    ``For me, the fame doesn't matter,'' he says. ``I don't care if
my name is above the title.''
 &HT;    Even if he could, Mulroney says, he wouldn't want to achieve Tom
Cruise's level of stardom.
 &HT;    ``I don't think the big stars have a lot of control over their
lives,'' he says. ``It's not my style to splash around the cover of
magazines.
 &HT;    ``Of course, the one good thing about being Tom Cruise is that
people do go to see all of your movies. So it's a real Catch-22.''
 &HT;    Mulroney grew up far from the Hollywood glitter, as the middle
child in a family of five in suburban Alexandria, Va. It was his
mother Ellen, a former actress, who first suggested that he try
acting.
 &HT;    He did, and liked it. Various community-theater efforts led him
to Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill., where he majored in
film.
 &HT;    ``I thought I'd get a job on a movie set pulling cable,'' he
says. ``I didn't have lofty plans.''
 &HT;    Nonetheless, he took a chance when a William Morris agent
visited the campus during Mulroney's senior year.
 &HT;    ``He put a sign-up sheet on the wall and said, `Anybody
graduating is welcome to audition for an agent,''' Mulroney
recalls. ``I signed up. It was unexpectedly easy to get going in
this business.''
 &HT;    His first role was as Bill Bixby's son in the television movie
``Sin of Innocence'' (1986), a family divorce drama he calls ```The
Brady Bunch' with sex.'''
 &HT;    That led to a series of television movies and low-budget
features. It was while making one of the latter in 1988 that he met
his wife of eight years, actress Catherine Keener. According to
her, he made a good first impression by saving her life.
 &HT;    ``The movie `Survival Quest' was about this Outward Bound
group,'' she says in a separate interview. ``The tag line was, `In
the wilderness, you can't call 911.'''
 &HT;    As it turns out, the tag line had a point.
 &HT;    ``One day while shooting in a national park, I began to drown,''
she recalls. ``I'm getting carried down a river, and Dermot was the
only man who would jump in to save me. I swear, there were a
hundred crew guys who couldn't inconvenience themselves.
 &HT;    ``Dermot jumps in this raging river, and we're carried two miles
down by this horrible current,'' she says. ``At that moment I fell
in love with him, although we were both with other people at the
time.''
 &HT;    One thing led to another, however, and in 1991 they married.
 &HT;    ``We were best friends before we got married,'' Mulroney adds,
``which is the perfect place to start.''
 &HT;    Mulroney and his brother Shaun are also entrepreneurs, owning
the Double Door, a Chicago bar which showcases rock bands. Big-name
bands such as Smashing Pumpkins, Oasis and Bush have jammed there,
as has the actor's own band, The Low and Sweet Orchestra, which
released its first album, ``Goodbye to All That,'' two years ago.
 &HT;    ``I play cello and mandolin in a rock band,'' he says, shaking
his head. ``You figure it out.''
 &HT;    His fame probably gives the band some extra pull, but even that
has its complications. Shaun Mulroney has told his brother that
people wonder when ``that guy from `The Practice' will be
playing.'''
 &HT;    Mulroney sighs.
 &HT;    ``You know, one day I'll have to star in a movie with Dylan
McDermott,'' he says. ``It would be the ultimate way to confuse
America.''

GWEN VERDON STILL HEARS THE MUSIC

 Includes a color slide of Gwen Verdon with Ann Reinking during
rehearsals for ``Fosse.'' 
 By MICHAEL J. BANDLER  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    ``I just back up into everything,'' Gwen Verdon says.
 &HT;    That's the secret behind her more than a half-century as an
entertainer, she says. It accounts for success on stage, in films
and on television, not to mention an armful of Tony Awards and,
most recently, the National Medal of the Arts.
 &HT;    Along the way, she's taught Marilyn Monroe how to walk, served
as muse to arguably the century's greatest choreographer and, most
notably, sang and danced up a storm in such Broadway hits as ``Damn
Yankees'' (1955), ``New Girl in Town'' (1957), ``Sweet Charity''
(1966) and ``Chicago'' (1975).
 &HT;    And she isn't through yet. The hit new revue ``Fosse'' _
celebrating her late husband, director/choreographer Bob Fosse _
brought her back to Broadway as its artistic adviser. She has two
movies in the can. And her daughter, Nicole Fosse, recently gave
birth to Verdon's fifth grandchild _ perhaps the best treat of all
for the 74-year-old, who is already a great-grandmother as well.
 &HT;    But don't count on Verdon doing much babysitting. She recently
taped an episode of ``Walker, Texas Ranger,'' with more film and
television work to come.
 &HT;    It's rare for musical performers to find work after they pass
song-and-dance age, but when Verdon hung up her dancing shoes she
quickly found work with such prestigious directors as Francis Ford
Coppola (1984's ``The Cotton Club'') and Ron Howard (1985's
``Cocoon''). By the time she finished working with them, her new
career was well underway.
 &HT;    Verdon knew something about brilliant directors through her
years with Fosse. The mercurial dance innovator was her
professional partner from 1955 until his death in 1987, and the two
married in 1960. They separated in the early 1970s but never
divorced, even as he moved on to other women _ including Ann
Reinking, who later became a close friend of Verdon and co-directed
``Fosse.''
 &HT;    Even when she wasn't in a Fosse production, Verdon says, she was
always around, working with dancers, offering the director an
objective eye and even tracking down a gorilla suit for the 1972
movie version of ``Cabaret.''
 &HT;    ``We were always together,'' Verdon says during a conversation
at Sardi's, the legendary Manhattan theater-themed restaurant where
her caricature has hung prominently for decades. ``I just accept it
_ that was my life. I can't imagine not belonging to him.
 &HT;    ``We were great if we didn't have to live together and deal with
mundane things,'' she adds. ``It was mundane things that drove us
nuts. I never wished him, and he never wished me, an unhappy life.
If you really examine a person and admire him, that feeling doesn't
go away.''
 &HT;    Since Fosse's death Verdon has seen herself as a keeper of the
flame, helping to create a Fosse archive at the Library of
Congress, establishing a scholarship to train dancers in the Fosse
style and, of course, working with Reinking and others to create
``Fosse.''
 &HT;    ``I was determined that Bob's work somehow would be seen
again,'' she says. ``It deserved it. And audiences deserved to see
not just those dance numbers, but his point of view about theater _
his use of the stage and the levels of the stage. No one else has
approached theater and dance the way Bob did.
 &HT;    ``He could not be categorized, either in his work or in his
character,'' she says. ``He truly was very interesting, very unique
_ and always a surprise.''
 &HT;    The daughter of an MGM gaffer who worked on Greta Garbo movies
and the ``Tarzan'' series _ ``Johnny Weismuller taught me the
backstroke, his specialty,'' she recalls _ Gwyneth Verdon was born
with rickets, which was then usually treated by breaking the legs
and letting the bones realign.
 &HT;    But her mother, a dancer, chose her own method _ corrective
shoes and dance exercises.
 &HT;    ``I did them completely wrong, with my feet turned in,
pigeon-toed and knock-kneed,'' she says, laughing. ``I think that's
why it was so easy to dance for Bob Fosse.''
 &HT;    Verdon was a trouper from the outset. As a teen she danced with
several professional companies and modeled bathing suits. At 17 she
married Jim Henaghan, a columnist for The Hollywood Reporter, and
nine months later gave birth to her first child, James. The
marriage, troubled by Henaghan's alcoholism, lasted only five
years.
 &HT;    One night when her husband was ``on one of his big drunks,''
Verdon took over his assignment to cover a nightclub show. There
she encountered the Afro-Cuban jazz style of Jack Cole, and was
mesmerized. Going backstage, she asked to work with him, and for
the next couple of years assisted Cole on Broadway projects and
then in Hollywood. She performed as a ``specialty dancer'' in
movies such as ``David and Bathsheba'' (1952) and ``The Merry
Widow'' (1952), and worked behind the scenes teaching actresses
such as Marilyn Monroe and Jane Russell how to move.
 &HT;    ``Marilyn would wiggle so much she could never get someplace,''
Verdon recalls, ``so I would have to calm her down. And I had to
teach Jane not to act so tough. She was sort of clod-walking. I got
her to believe she was only 5-feet-4, instead of 6 feet tall.''
 &HT;    One day choreographer Michael Kidd saw Verdon perform, which led
to her Broadway debut in a small role in Kidd's ``Can-Can'' (1953)
_ and with it a name change so she'd fit on a marquee.
 &HT;    The opening night was the stuff of Broadway legend. Though she
wasn't the star, the audience rose and summoned Verdon for a
curtain call. Kidd had to all but drag her onstage from her
dressing room.
 &HT;    ``They wouldn't stop applauding,'' she recalls dreamily.
 &HT;    That role won her first Tony award. Two years later, in Fosse's
``Damn Yankees,'' she won a second Tony and etched herself
indelibly in Broadway history with her playfully sultry ``Whatever
Lola Wants, Lola Gets,'' recreating the role for the 1958 film.
 &HT;    ``New Girl in Town'' and ``Redhead'' (1959) followed, each
winning another Tony.
 &HT;    Even Nicole's birth didn't slow her down much _ she was back on
Broadway three years later in ``Sweet Charity,'' and then again in
1975 for ``Chicago.''
 &HT;    Verdon's shift to nonmusical acting wasn't a shock _ even during
the peak of her musical stardom she'd been studying with acting
guru Sanford Meisner _ but she admits that it was a difficult
transition, Tony Awards notwithstanding.
 &HT;    ``People don't think of you as an actor,'' she says with a
shrug.
 &HT;   By now, however, people do. Specializing in
eccentric-but-vigorous oldsters, she'll be seen as Ellen Burstyn's
nosy next-door neighbor in the upcoming ``Walking Across Egypt''
and as an agoraphobic woman who shares her house with a Great Dane
in ``Bruno.'' The latter film is being directed by Shirley
MacLaine, another Fosse veteran _ she won Verdon's part for the
1969 film version of ``Sweet Charity,'' but Verdon didn't hold a
grudge and even helped her learn the dances.
 &HT;    One day last fall, out of the blue, the actress got a call
informing her that she had been selected to receive the National
Medal of the Arts. On a bright November morning, under a glistening
white tent on the south lawn of the White House, Verdon received
her award from President Clinton, in the company of such fellow
honorees as film star Gregory Peck and opera singer Roberta Peters.
 &HT;    Saluting her, the president observed that ``this famous redhead
is showing us all that she is still alive and kicking.''
 &HT;    Indeed she is. At an age when many people have long since
retired, Verdon volunteers that she'd love the chance to appear in
a costume drama like ``Elizabeth'' or ``Shakespeare in Love.''
 &HT;    Or even a western, she adds.
 &HT;    ``I could always be the lady who runs the whorehouse!''

MELINA KANAKAREDES: DIVINE `PROVIDENCE' 
</HEADLINE>

entertainment package.)

 Includes a color slide of Melina Kanakaredes in a scene from
``Providence.'' 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    It isn't hard to tell when you're suddenly famous.
 &HT;    ``I was in New York City for the premiere of `Providence,'''
says Melina Kanakaredes, the ebullient star of NBC's surprise
midseason hit. ``We were going down Broadway, and there was my
face, on a billboard!
 &HT;    ``I'd never seen my face that big before,'' she says, still
amazed. ``My mother nearly stopped everybody on the street to say,
`That's my baby!' It was so bizarre to see her all excited.
 &HT;    ``I was like, `Oh my God, this is very strange,''' the actress
recalls. ``I remembered back to when I graduated from college and
moved to New York. I barely made 200 bucks a month doing
off-off-off Broadway.
 &HT;    ``And now there was my head on this wall.''
 &HT;    The excitement was just beginning. That evening ``Providence's''
debut episode captured the attention of nearly 20 million viewers.
 &HT;    Kanakaredes, a Greek-American beauty who's all slate-gray eyes
and cascading curls, awoke the next morning as Hollywood's latest
overnight success.
 &HT;    ``Every teacher in every school, during roll call on that first
day, would say `Melina Ka ... Kana ... ,''' she says with a laugh
during a telephone call from her rented home in Los Angeles. ``Now,
to have Jay Leno say, `And next, Melina Kanakaredes,' is
incredible.''
 &HT;    Kanakaredes is actually far from an overnight success. She's 31
and has been kicking around stage, television and movie circles for
years. Her credits include a four-year stint on the soap opera
``Guiding Light,'' the television series ``NYPD Blue'' (as Jimmy
Smits' girlfriend), ``New York News'' and ``Leaving L.A,'' plus
such films as ``The Long Kiss Goodbye'' (1996) and ``Rounders''
(1998).
 &HT;    NBC recognized her talent _ she projects genuine earthiness _
and inked her to a production deal. Kanakaredes passed on several
proposed projects, including a new cop drama and a role on ``Law
and Order,'' until the ``Providence'' script arrived for her
consideration.
 &HT;    The show would follow the joys and sorrows of the Hansen family
of Providence, R.I., with Kanakaredes in the pivotal role of
Sydney, the oldest and most sensible Hansen sibling. In the pilot,
Mom Hansen (Concetta Tomei) dies in the middle of a wedding,
prompting disenchanted plastic surgeon Sydney to remain in
Providence with her veterinarian father (Mike Farrell), troublesome
brother (Seth Peterson) and pregnant sister (Paula Cale).
 &HT;    ``I honestly thought `Providence' might catch on,'' Kanakaredes
says. ``As usual, I had to judge an entire series on one pilot
script. I had no idea what would happen after the pilot, but I was
so taken with the characters and the way it was written, with all
those bizarre twists and turns.
 &HT;    ``I really liked Sydney, and I attached myself to her,'' the
actress says. ``I decided to do it, thinking, `Whatever happens,
it'll be something I really enjoy doing. If it doesn't go to
series, I'll have an hour of material to put on my clip reel.'
 &HT;    ``The other scripts I read reminded me of other shows on
television,'' she adds. ```Providence' struck me as something new
and different. Family drama is not new, but it hasn't been done in
this way, in this venue, with our quirkiness.
 &HT;    ``So far I haven't been proved wrong.''
 &HT;    Critics tore into ``Providence'' with a vengeance. Some declared
the show cloying or syrupy, others deemed it contrived or downright
silly.
 &HT;    Almost every reviewer detested the show's trademark device:
Sydney's dead mom comes to her in dreams, bitching about life and
death, complaining about Sydney's choice in men and chain-smoking
like Denis Leary in drag.
 &HT;    Kanakaredes took it all in stride.
 &HT;    ``I always say I love constructive criticism, and that's because
a television show can take it to heart, adjust certain elements and
make it better,'' the actress says. ``In many cases, the criticism
of `Providence' was not constructive.
 &HT;    ``In those instances I went, `Apple pie, cherry pie.' Some
people love `Providence' and some don't. That's fine,'' she says.
``The validation is that the audience really loves it. Also, the
critics tooled on the show, but they weren't so bad to me.''
 &HT;    Kanakaredes laughs.
 &HT;    ``I'm thankful,'' she says, ``for the little miracles.''
 &HT;    Right now, with its audience growing, ``Providence'' seems
primed for a lengthy run. Such a prospect hardly daunts
Kanakaredes, who calls Brooklyn, N.Y., her home and only rents her
place in Los Angeles.
 &HT;    ``It's always a roller-coaster ride, and you never know what's
going to happen tomorrow,'' she says. ``We all just want to
continue to raise the bar on the material, make the best show we
can and enjoy ourselves in the process.
 &HT;    ``If it goes five or six years, I guess I'm ready for that,''
Kanakaredes says. ``You sign on for that _ I've got a five-year
contract.
 &HT;    ``This year just flew by, and I hope it will continue like
that,'' she says. ``We have a great group of people, cast and crew.
I'm sure actors say that all the time, but we do, and I couldn't
ask for the experience to be any better.''
 &HT;    A native of Akron, Ohio, Kanakaredes knew early on that acting
was her destiny. She jokes that she's been performing for ages _
albeit for much of that time without pay.
 &HT;    ``I'm the youngest of three girls,'' she says. ``My sisters did
a lot of musical theater growing up, so I started singing and
dancing.
 &HT;    ``I said to my parents, `I want to be an actress,' and they
said, `Well, OK, just make sure your grades are good and that you
have something to fall back on.'
 &HT;    ``Right into college I just kept on acting,'' Kanakaredes says.
``I never worried about making a living from it, because the
worst-case scenario was to go home and work in my family's candy
business.
 &HT;    ``I continue to love what I do,'' the actress says cheerfully.
``It's fun to leave yourself and jump into somebody else's skin for
a while. To do that you have to collaborate so much with other
people, all of whom bring their own talent to the show or movie.
 &HT;    ``When it all comes together, it can be magical.''
 &HT;    Magical and life-altering. Not only can Jay Leno now pronounce
her name, but fans recognize Kanakaredes in the streets and
producers are calling with movie offers.
 &HT;    It's a decidedly heady time, but the actress has her family _
most notably her sisters and her husband of six years, New York
chef Peter Constantinides _ to help keep her feet on the ground and
her ego in check.
 &HT;    ``My sanity is my family,'' she says. ``Actually, my sanity and
my insanity is my family. We see each other as much as we can, even
though we're often on different coasts.
 &HT;    ``I'm Greek, and togetherness is a big part of our culture,''
she adds. ``My husband is of the same background.
 &HT;    ``My attitude is I love what I do, but it's not 100 percent of
who I am,'' Kanakaredes says. ``Being with my family puts
everything in perspective, and I don't care as much about the crazy
stuff _ the publicity and the recognition _ that's going on.''

 Includes a color slide of Kelsey Grammer in a scene from
``Frasier.'' 
 By ANDREW RYAN  
 c.1999 TV Guide Canada  
 World rights except Chicago 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   These are the very best of times for ``Frasier.''
</P>
<P>
   Since moving to Thursday nights in September 1998, the show has
thrived. Most weeks it notches even higher ratings than its
timeslot predecessor, ``Seinfeld.'' After five years of slugging it
out on Tuesdays, ``Frasier'' has settled into NBC's Thursday-night
lineup for what would appear to be an extended run _ and few people
are more surprised than Kelsey Grammer, Frasier Crane himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Believe me, it sounds extremely odd for me to say out loud
that I've been playing Frasier for 16 years now,'' says the genial
Grammer, who first played the pompous shrink on ``Cheers'' way back
in 1983. ``But this has been an extremely gratifying year for us,
for all of us. It's a message to us that all our hard work is
paying off. These are the best of times.''
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Grammer's onscreen compatriot David Hyde Pierce, who
plays Frasier's stuffy brother Niles, feels fully vindicated by the
show's resurgence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were _ and are _ a really good show,'' Pierce says. ``This
has been an amazing season for us _ we've had some of our very best
episodes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the fact we're in syndication, too, has helped our
ratings,'' he adds. ``Instead of just people who know about the
show sitting down to watch once a week, suddenly people come home
from work, flick on the TV and realize, `That's ``Frasier?'' Hey,
it's a pretty funny show.'''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the credit for ``Frasier's'' most successful season ever
has to go to Grammer, Pierce and their collective onscreen
chemistry. There's also a lot to be said for co-stars Jane Leeves,
John Mahoney and Peri Gilpin. But there are other factors, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the compliments our show always gets, which I hate, is
that we're so intelligent, so highbrow,'' Pierce says. ``That's so
unfair. We have the broadest physical comedy _ we do everything on
this show. There happen to be two very intellectual characters in
it, but the things they go through are the same things we all go
through _ wanting to be liked, wanting to find love and all that
other stuff. Our writers know how to make these two snobby guys
very human.''
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, the writers on ``Frasier,'' who have collected
three Emmys to date, are fearless. It took nerve, for example, to
lead off this season with a story line that saw Frasier ousted from
his radio career and sunk in general depression.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got nine shows out of it,'' Grammer says with a shrug. ``It
was an interesting journey for Frasier, but we always knew he'd go
back to the station.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it made the audience uncomfortable, because Frasier's
confidence was completely shot,'' he says. ``It's interesting,
because he's often lacking in confidence. But if Frasier is in real
despair, it makes the comedy a little harder. I mean, a guy who's
pompous and out of work is a little hard to watch.''
</P>
<P>
   At this stage of the game, Grammer says, he and the writers are
hesitant to drop another full-time cast member into the mix.
There's still room for the occasional recurring character, such as
Canadian actor Saul Rubinek as Donny, Niles's sleazy lawyer who
also has designs on Daphne.
</P>
<P>
   But don't expect any new additions to the regular cast.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried that,'' Grammer says, wincing. ``A few years ago, we
added Mercedes Ruehl as the station manager, and we thought about
making her full-time. We got, like, five shows out of it, and that
seemed sufficient _ that seemed like the limit to what we had
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Which would seem to rule out a regular girlfriend for Frasier,
though the possibility is always there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly hope so,'' Pierce says jokingly. ``Don't you think
he's suffered enough?''
</P>
<P>
   Frasier's previous pairings _ with women played by JoBeth
Williams, Virginia Madsen, Linda Hamilton and other comely
actresses _ have all ended badly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly Frasier is still looking for love,'' Grammer says
with a sigh. ``We may yet find a comfortable relationship for him.
If it was filled with humor and autonomy and parity and real love,
I think it would be a wonderful thing to have.''
</P>
<P>
   On a more personal level, Grammer says that he's finally come to
terms with his own success. After a miserable and violent childhood
_ both his father and his sister were murdered _ the actor's early
years in Hollywood were marred by drunken-driving incidents and
self-admitted problems with alcohol, as well as two failed
marriages.
</P>
<P>
   All that is in the past, he says now. He's off the bottle, and
with his wife Camille _ the two married last year _ he says he's
finally able to accept his own happiness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did an interview with Details magazine where they asked me
what was my most `mondo' year,'' he says. ``And this year has been
the best year of my life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, the past two or three years have been
extraordinary,'' he says thoughtfully. ``It's sometimes hard for me
to believe that I can be functionally this happy all the time _ and
still be miserable when I need to be. There's this factor in me
that needs something to be wrong, or I just don't feel that I'm
alive. But things are very good.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides his continuing commitment to ``Frasier,'' Grammer would
like to make another ``appearance'' on ``The Simpsons,'' where he
has voiced the malevolent Sideshow Bob in several episodes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gosh, I'd love to do another one,'' he says enthusiastically.
``The last time Bob was a good guy, but he was wrongly sent back to
jail, which is really going to piss him off. I suspect when `The
Simpsons' plan their final episode, they'll have Sideshow Bob
return and finally destroy that wretched little town.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, however, ``Frasier'' should keep Grammer busy.
He's signed for three more years after this season, which would
make almost two decades of playing the same character.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will it bother me having played the exact same person for 19
years? Not at all,'' he says, smiling broadly. ``I think Frasier's
a pretty grand guy. Don't you?''

</P>
<P>
   VIAGRA (Albany, N.Y.) _ When Viagra hit the pharmacy shelves one
year ago, it was love at first sight. The excitement has calmed
somewhat, although not on Wall Street. We assess the drug after its
first year of use. By SYLVIA WOOD.
</P>
<P>
   CHEATING-INTERNET (Albany, N.Y.) _ The good news about higher
education is that the classics are still being taught in
universities throughout the nation. The bad news is that a lot of
students aren't reading them. But with as many as 70 Web sites
offering term papers for as much as $200 each, the procrastinators
are now finding that on-line cheating is easy. By ANDREW
BROWNSTEIN.
</P>
<P>
   YOSEMITE-KILLINGS (Sonora, Calif.) _ While the FBI has imported
a team of professional profilers to narrow its search for the
killers of three tourists, there are plenty of amateur profilers in
the Sierra Nevada foothills here, where the bodies of the women
were found. By JIM HERRON ZAMORA.
</P>
<P>
   LIFESTYLE/FEATURES (``l'' category)
</P>
<P>
   SUMMER-KITCHENS (Albany, N.Y.) _ The sturdy, reliable stoves of
yesteryear are back in style. And at least two companies, one in
Massachusetts and one in Canada, offer reproductions or restored
old stoves that are updated for today's modern kitchen. By FRANCES
INGRAHAM.
</P>
<P>
   GADGETS (Undated) _ A company called EASE Simulation
manufactures a product called AutoWatch, which is essentially a way
to spy on how your teen-agers (or your employees) drive. It's the
car equivalent of the ``black box'' flight recorder on airplanes.
By STEVE BARNES.
</P>
<P>
   BUSINESS/FINANCIAL NEWS (``f'' category)
</P>
<P>
   Y2K-EXPERT (Albany, N.Y.) _ Victor Porlier, a local resident,
recently published a book called ``Y2K: An Action Plan for Jan. 1,
2000,'' a user-friendly manual for preparing for computerdom's
worst-case scenarios. Now he's become a Y2K spokesman in demand
across the country. By ALAN WECHSLER.
</P>
<P>
   ETRADE-LAWSUITS (San Francisco) _ Thousands of consumers have
been hurt by recent system crashes and delays that are plaguing
on-line brokerages. Two class-action lawsuits filed against ETrade
Group Inc. highlight the growing pains of the young Internet
brokerage industry,. By EDWARD IWATA.
</P>
<P>
   WORKING-COLUMN (Houston) _ More and more baby boomers in their
early to mid-50s are opting to leave their steady jobs and move on
to new ventures _ whether that means volunteering full time or
launching their own business. By L.M. SIXEL.
</P>
<P>
   COMPUTER-COLUMN (Undated) _ A few months ago, I went gaga over
Netscape Communications' latest Web-surfing software, Communicator
4.5. While it was an incremental upgrade, it was enough of a leap
to push it past Internet Explorer 4.0. But now I've found a new
love: the Windows 98 version of Internet Explorer 5.0. By DWIGHT
SILVERMAN.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   ENTERTAINMENT (``e'' category)
</P>
<P>
   BOOK-REVIEW-Y2K (Undated) _ For many of us, the year 2000
computer problem is a scary notion looming on the horizon; but for
the nerds and technogeeks who understand the ramifications of
what's going to happen, it's the ultimate hack. One can only hope
that some of these nerds have a benevolent streak of those in the
gang that Mark Joseph describes in his novel, ``Deadline Y2K'' (St.
Martin's Press, $24.95). By HARRY THOMAS.
</P>
<P>
   TV-KILBORN (San Francisco) _ When Craig Kilborn walks onstage
Tuesday night as the host of ``The Late, Late Show,'' it's not just
going to be a ceremonial passing of the baton from Tom Snyder to
the new kid on the block. It's going to be a historic exchange _
the hip, wired age breaking away from the industrial era as the
millennium approaches. By TIM GOODMAN.
</P>
<P>
   COMMENTARY (``k'' category)
</P>
<P>
   ROSENFELD-COLUMN (Albany, N.Y.) _ It is striking how much debate
followed the NATO aerial assault on Yugoslavia compared with how
little preceded the fateful decision. By HARRY ROSENFELD.
</P>
<P>
   MORSE-COLUMN (San Francisco) _ It was a perfect afternoon and I
tried to find someone who cared about the war against Serbia. No
luck in my household. ``It's another Clinton thing,'' said my wife,
who is as cynical and isolationist as any American. ``I won't care
until the bombs start falling in my back yard.'' By ROB MORSE.
</P>
<P>
   SALTER-COLUMN (San Francisco) _ To say that I have mixed
feelings about the nasty fight between the Catholic Archdiocese and
the nuns-in-drag charity troupe, the Sisters of Perpetual
Indulgence, is like saying that it isn't always easy to be a
Christian. Some of my very best friends are gay and some are nuns
and priests. By STEPHANIE SALTER.

   For the Aztecs, human sacrifices were ironically the stuff of
life. Only human blood, they told Spanish priests, could give the
sun strength for its daily climb from the underworld. Yet for all
the grisly accounts of the early Spanish chroniclers,
archaeologists have exhumed surprisingly little evidence of these
rituals. That is until archaeologist Steve Bourget began digging at
the Pyramid of the Moon in Peru, where he unearthed a real
sacrificial site belonging to a lesser-known Andean people, the
Moche. Heather Pringle is the author of ``In Search of Ancient

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   For the Aztecs, human sacrifices were ironically the stuff of
life. Only human blood, they told Spanish priests, could give the
sun strength for its daily climb from the underworld.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for all the grisly accounts of the early Spanish
chroniclers, archeologists have exhumed surprisingly little
evidence of these rituals. But thanks to a series of stunning
archeological discoveries, researchers are now gaining a clearer
glimpse of these ancient rituals.
</P>
<P>
   The picture emerges not from the most famous civilizations, but
from a much earlier and lesser known Andean people _ the Moche of
Peru's northern coastal desert. They flourished from A.D. 100 to
800 in the river valleys from the Andes to the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, archeologists puzzled over the paintings on Moche
pots. Many portrayed knife-wielding gods holding human heads and
owl-headed priests presiding over human sacrifices, but few
researchers believed they reflected actual practices. But
researchers are uncovering startling forensic evidence of human
sacrifice _ from mass graves to giant wall murals incorporating
butchered human bones.
</P>
<P>
   These new discoveries raise a host of questions, not the least
of which is why the Moche performed human sacrifices.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, Canadian archeologist Steve Bourget began
searching for sites where the Moche performed their slaughter.
Bourget, who had just finished his Ph.D. dissertation on Moche art
and sacred geography, found depictions of mountaintop rituals in
which priests seemed to fling humans to their death down steep
slopes. If the Moche pots showed real events, reasoned Bourget,
then the sacrifices could have taken place near Moche temples
situated at the feet of small mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Bourget began poring over Moche depictions of a different
sacrifice ritual, one that had been studied by Christopher Donnan,
an archeologist at UCLA. The gruesome ritual, which Donnan called
the warrior narrative, was a favorite theme of Moche artists,
appearing on ancient pots and wall murals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It starts with Moche warriors going off to combat,'' Donnan
explains. ``Then some of the warriors are captured. All their
weapons, ornaments and clothing are taken from them. What follows
is a stage where the captors ... slap their faces and tear the
warriors' nose ornaments out. They put ropes around their necks and
parade them. The sacrifice follows.''
</P>
<P>
   Donnan, like other Moche experts, assumed that the warrior
narrative owed more to fiction than fact. But in 1987, Peruvian
archeologist Walter Alva exhumed the body of a great Moche lord,
dating to approximately A.D. 300. The man wore large circular
earspools and an immense gold headdress, a nose ornament and a back
flap, all crescent-shaped like the blade of a sacrificial knife. By
his side lay a scepter with a bladelike handle. These were the
insignia of the warrior priest.
</P>
<P>
   But if the sacrifices were actual events, where were all the
victims? Bourget studied depictions of the warrior narrative for
clues. And in 1995, he assembled a research team to excavate the
plaza at the Pyramid of the Moon.
</P>
<P>
   Peeling back layers of sediment, he was soon surrounded by
whitened human skeletons. Bourget was jubilant. ``For the first
time, we could really see how the Moche performed human
sacrifice,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Such a rare and complex burial site called for a specialist.
John Verano, a physical anthropologist and osteologist who had
worked with archeological teams on Peru's north coast, was
summoned. He set up an impromptu morgue in the Archeology Museum at
the University of Trujillo where he examined the collection of
human remains.
</P>
<P>
   Verano found that all the corpses who could be identified
belonged to a select demographic group: young, healthy, physically
active males. Indeed, the mean age at death was just 23. Many, it
turned out, were old hands at combat. One in every four bore healed
rib, arm, leg and skull fractures.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, many of the men had fractures just beginning to
knit at the time of death. These confirmed the story, corresponding
eerily to scenes from the warrior narrative.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Moche art,'' Verano says, ``the artists often show
prisoners being smacked on the nose so their noses will bleed, and
that's often done at the time of capture.''
</P>
<P>
   Judging from the healing of wounds, the battered men survived
for nearly two weeks after their capture, their last weeks mired in
misery. Death, when it finally arrived, came swiftly.
</P>
<P>
   Verano's data suggests that the bodies at the Pyramid of the
Moon belonged to Moche warriors wounded and captured on the field
of battle. It is entirely possible, he says, that the ancient
desert dwellers, like the Aztecs, fought at least some battles
specifically to capture young males for sacrifice. Just how often
the Moche conducted sacrifices and how many lives they took has yet
to be determined.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, Verano discovered something strange about an
enormous mural on the site. The pre-Columbian mural, painted in
crimson and electric yellow, shows a row of Moche nobles dancing
above the heads of war captives. While studying the mural,
researchers found a fallen chunk of mud plaster from one of the
dancer's feet. A piece of bone protruded from one end. Verano could
see that it was the rounded end of a human femur. It had been
chopped from a cadaver, stripped of flesh, and incorporated into
the giant mural.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dancers are stepping on the bones of their enemies,'' he
says, ``or their victims.''
</P>
<P>
   While new evidence explains much about how sacrifices were
performed, it falls far short of answering why. Researchers such as
Elizabeth Benson have traced an intimate link between the offering
of human lives and agricultural fertility.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, people thought they could change the world by
ritual,'' Benson says. ``This was how you controlled the world, how
you had enough food for your people. And a human being was the most
important offering you could make.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SIDEBAR: WHY DID THE GODS DEMAND BLOOD? &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``To the people who say the Moche or the Aztecs did sacrifices
because their gods demanded it, I would say, Why did their gods
demand it and other peoples' gods did not?'' observes Michael
Winkelman, an anthropologist at Arizona State University in Tempe.
</P>
<P>
   Winkelman studied scientific accounts of 45 societies worldwide
and came up with seven sacrifice performing societies, from the
Marquesans of the South Pacific to the Romans. He detected several
common, distinguishing traits: nearly all suffered from high
population densities and fought wars over land and scarce
resources.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, all the sacrificing societies were ruled locally by a
leader from a powerful family; in such a system, treachery and
betrayal were constant threats. To intimidate those contemplating
betrayal, Winkelman says, leaders naturally gravitated toward human
sacrifice.
</P>
<P>
   Moche experts call Winkelman's work thought-provoking, but few
are ready to accept that his analyses apply to the Moche, because
not enough is known about their population density or political
organization.

   For the Aztecs, human sacrifices were ironically the stuff of
life. Only human blood, they told Spanish priests, could give the
sun strength for its daily climb from the underworld.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for all the grisly accounts of the early Spanish
chroniclers, archeologists have exhumed surprisingly little
evidence of these rituals. But thanks to a series of stunning
archeological discoveries, researchers are now gaining a clearer
glimpse of these ancient rituals.
</P>
<P>
   The picture emerges not from the most famous civilizations, but
from a much earlier and lesser known Andean people _ the Moche of
Peru's northern coastal desert. They flourished from A.D. 100 to
800 in the river valleys from the Andes to the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, archeologists puzzled over the paintings on Moche
pots. Many portrayed knife-wielding gods holding human heads and
owl-headed priests presiding over human sacrifices, but few
researchers believed they reflected actual practices. But
researchers are uncovering startling forensic evidence of human
sacrifice _ from mass graves to giant wall murals incorporating
butchered human bones.
</P>
<P>
   These new discoveries raise a host of questions, not the least
of which is why the Moche performed human sacrifices.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, Canadian archeologist Steve Bourget began
searching for sites where the Moche performed their slaughter.
Bourget, who had just finished his Ph.D. dissertation on Moche art
and sacred geography, found depictions of mountaintop rituals in
which priests seemed to fling humans to their death down steep
slopes. If the Moche pots showed real events, reasoned Bourget,
then the sacrifices could have taken place near Moche temples
situated at the feet of small mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Bourget began poring over Moche depictions of a different
sacrifice ritual, one that had been studied by Christopher Donnan,
an archeologist at UCLA. The gruesome ritual, which Donnan called
the warrior narrative, was a favorite theme of Moche artists,
appearing on ancient pots and wall murals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It starts with Moche warriors going off to combat,'' Donnan
explains. ``Then some of the warriors are captured. All their
weapons, ornaments and clothing are taken from them. What follows
is a stage where the captors ... slap their faces and tear the
warriors' nose ornaments out. They put ropes around their necks and
parade them. The sacrifice follows.''
</P>
<P>
   Donnan, like other Moche experts, assumed that the warrior
narrative owed more to fiction than fact. But in 1987, Peruvian
archeologist Walter Alva exhumed the body of a great Moche lord,
dating to approximately A.D. 300. The man wore large circular
earspools and an immense gold headdress, a nose ornament and a back
flap, all crescent-shaped like the blade of a sacrificial knife. By
his side lay a scepter with a bladelike handle. These were the
insignia of the warrior priest.
</P>
<P>
   But if the sacrifices were actual events, where were all the
victims? Bourget studied depictions of the warrior narrative for
clues. And in 1995, he assembled a research team to excavate the
plaza at the Pyramid of the Moon.
</P>
<P>
   Peeling back layers of sediment, he was soon surrounded by
whitened human skeletons. Bourget was jubilant. ``For the first
time, we could really see how the Moche performed human
sacrifice,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Such a rare and complex burial site called for a specialist.
John Verano, a physical anthropologist and osteologist who had
worked with archeological teams on Peru's north coast, was
summoned. He set up an impromptu morgue in the Archeology Museum at
the University of Trujillo where he examined the collection of
human remains.
</P>
<P>
   Verano found that all the corpses who could be identified
belonged to a select demographic group: young, healthy, physically
active males. Indeed, the mean age at death was just 23. Many, it
turned out, were old hands at combat. One in every four bore healed
rib, arm, leg and skull fractures.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, many of the men had fractures just beginning to
knit at the time of death. These confirmed the story, corresponding
eerily to scenes from the warrior narrative.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Moche art,'' Verano says, ``the artists often show
prisoners being smacked on the nose so their noses will bleed, and
that's often done at the time of capture.''
</P>
<P>
   Judging from the healing of wounds, the battered men survived
for nearly two weeks after their capture, their last weeks mired in
misery. Death, when it finally arrived, came swiftly.
</P>
<P>
   Verano's data suggests that the bodies at the Pyramid of the
Moon belonged to Moche warriors wounded and captured on the field
of battle. It is entirely possible, he says, that the ancient
desert dwellers, like the Aztecs, fought at least some battles
specifically to capture young males for sacrifice. Just how often
the Moche conducted sacrifices and how many lives they took has yet
to be determined.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, Verano discovered something strange about an
enormous mural on the site. The pre-Columbian mural, painted in
crimson and electric yellow, shows a row of Moche nobles dancing
above the heads of war captives. While studying the mural,
researchers found a fallen chunk of mud plaster from one of the
dancer's feet. A piece of bone protruded from one end. Verano could
see that it was the rounded end of a human femur. It had been
chopped from a cadaver, stripped of flesh, and incorporated into
the giant mural.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dancers are stepping on the bones of their enemies,'' he
says, ``or their victims.''
</P>
<P>
   While new evidence explains much about how sacrifices were
performed, it falls far short of answering why. Researchers such as
Elizabeth Benson have traced an intimate link between the offering
of human lives and agricultural fertility.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, people thought they could change the world by
ritual,'' Benson says. ``This was how you controlled the world, how
you had enough food for your people. And a human being was the most
important offering you could make.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SIDEBAR: WHY DID THE GODS DEMAND BLOOD? &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``To the people who say the Moche or the Aztecs did sacrifices
because their gods demanded it, I would say, Why did their gods
demand it and other peoples' gods did not?'' observes Michael
Winkelman, an anthropologist at Arizona State University in Tempe.
</P>
<P>
   Winkelman studied scientific accounts of 45 societies worldwide
and came up with seven sacrifice performing societies, from the
Marquesans of the South Pacific to the Romans. He detected several
common, distinguishing traits: nearly all suffered from high
population densities and fought wars over land and scarce
resources.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, all the sacrificing societies were ruled locally by a
leader from a powerful family; in such a system, treachery and
betrayal were constant threats. To intimidate those contemplating
betrayal, Winkelman says, leaders naturally gravitated toward human
sacrifice.
</P>
<P>
   Moche experts call Winkelman's work thought-provoking, but few
are ready to accept that his analyses apply to the Moche, because
not enough is known about their population density or political
organization.

   For at least the next five years, NASA's Cassini spacecraft, six
tons of brute technology laboriously wending its way to Saturn and
its giant moon Titan, will serve nicely as a bloated billboard with
this message: The era of big, unmanned space missions is over. Not
only did the craft's considerable heft force an impressively
circuitous route that depends on the gravitational pull of three
heavenly bodies, but its $2 billion cost clashed ominously with the
U.S. space agency's shrinking budget.
</P>
<P>
   Just as the extinction of the dinosaurs cleared a place for
little, lithe mammals, so the termination of huge missions like
Cassini will create opportunities for petite but powerful
explorers. Under strict orders from NASA administrator Daniel
Goldin, whose mantra is ``better, faster, cheaper,'' the agency is
moving toward ideas reminiscent of science-fiction novels _ robots
that could fit on a spoon, solar sails and rockets no larger than a
computer chip. The technologies will be seen in the real world
surprisingly soon.
</P>
<P>
   At the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., ground
zero for NASA's tightened focus, a tiny rover called MUSES-CN
symbolizes the merits of miniaturization. MUSES resembles a
drastically downsized version of Sojourner, the remote-control
chariot that enchanted the public two summers ago as it rolled
across Mars. The reduced rover measures just six inches long and
weighs 42 ounces. Its size will allow it to ride piggyback on the
already-planned Japanese MUSES-C probe, to be launched at the
asteroid Nereus in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   MUSES is only a beginning. Rover mastermind Brian Wilcox is
developing tiny rovers that weigh no more than a few ounces.
Another little buggy may ride aboard the Near-Earth Asteroid
Prospector _ history's first privately funded deep-space probe. The
European Space Agency is working on ROSA, a six-wheeled robot
designed to tackle the worst terrain Mars has to offer. Other
exotic vehicles are in the works at JPL as well, such as a
``subsurface explorer'' _ a 2-inch-wide rod with a pressurized
gas-driven hammer that burrows eagerly underground.
</P>
<P>
   The spacecraft that fly the rovers are likewise dieting. Barry
Hebert's micro-spacecraft group at JPL is building radically
downsized vehicles, weighing as little as two pounds. Several could
fly into space on top of a single inexpensive Pegasus missile.
</P>
<P>
   They could then ``set up a virtual network _ a kind of Internet
in space,'' Hebert says. Networking would allow coordinated
activities such as observing an asteroid from all sides at once or
building a complex telescope that could reveal details far too fine
_ even for the Hubble Space Telescope. Hebert promises test flights
of his miniature spacecraft within the next couple of years.
</P>
<P>
   Featherweight spacecraft are a perfect fit with solar-sail
propulsion. Radiation from the sun could accelerate a huge but very
thin light collector to extremely high speeds. Later this year, the
space shuttle may carry a solar sail into Earth orbit to prove the
concept works.
</P>
<P>
   A few technological visionaries, such as inventor Forrest Bishop
of the Institute of Atomic-Scale Engineering, are planning machines
that can travel to other star systems and reconfigure themselves
molecule by molecule. Once they reach their target, they will seek
out raw materials, build sensors and an antenna, then relay images
back home.
</P>
<P>
   NASA scientists, staring at tight funding restrictions, dare not
embrace such dreaming. But that doesn't bother Bishop. ``In the
long term,'' he says, ``space will become a private venture.
Bureaucrats are not going to colonize the solar system.''

<P>
   For the Aztecs, human sacrifices were ironically the stuff of
life. Only human blood, they told Spanish priests, could give the
sun strength for its daily climb from the underworld.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for all the grisly accounts of the early Spanish
chroniclers, archeologists have exhumed surprisingly little
evidence of these rituals. But thanks to a series of stunning
archeological discoveries, researchers are now gaining a clearer
glimpse of these ancient rituals.
</P>
<P>
   The picture emerges not from the most famous civilizations, but
from a much earlier and lesser known Andean people _ the Moche of
Peru's northern coastal desert. They flourished from A.D. 100 to
800 in the river valleys from the Andes to the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, archeologists puzzled over the paintings on Moche
pots. Many portrayed knife-wielding gods holding human heads and
owl-headed priests presiding over human sacrifices, but few
researchers believed they reflected actual practices. But
researchers are uncovering startling forensic evidence of human
sacrifice _ from mass graves to giant wall murals incorporating
butchered human bones.
</P>
<P>
   These new discoveries raise a host of questions, not the least
of which is why the Moche performed human sacrifices.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, Canadian archeologist Steve Bourget began
searching for sites where the Moche performed their slaughter.
Bourget, who had just finished his Ph.D. dissertation on Moche art
and sacred geography, found depictions of mountaintop rituals in
which priests seemed to fling humans to their death down steep
slopes. If the Moche pots showed real events, reasoned Bourget,
then the sacrifices could have taken place near Moche temples
situated at the feet of small mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Bourget began poring over Moche depictions of a different
sacrifice ritual, one that had been studied by Christopher Donnan,
an archeologist at UCLA. The gruesome ritual, which Donnan called
the warrior narrative, was a favorite theme of Moche artists,
appearing on ancient pots and wall murals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It starts with Moche warriors going off to combat,'' Donnan
explains. ``Then some of the warriors are captured. All their
weapons, ornaments and clothing are taken from them. What follows
is a stage where the captors ... slap their faces and tear the
warriors' nose ornaments out. They put ropes around their necks and
parade them. The sacrifice follows.''
</P>
<P>
   Donnan, like other Moche experts, assumed that the warrior
narrative owed more to fiction than fact. But in 1987, Peruvian
archeologist Walter Alva exhumed the body of a great Moche lord,
dating to approximately A.D. 300. The man wore large circular
earspools and an immense gold headdress, a nose ornament and a back
flap, all crescent-shaped like the blade of a sacrificial knife. By
his side lay a scepter with a bladelike handle. These were the
insignia of the warrior priest.
</P>
<P>
   But if the sacrifices were actual events, where were all the
victims? Bourget studied depictions of the warrior narrative for
clues. And in 1995, he assembled a research team to excavate the
plaza at the Pyramid of the Moon.
</P>
<P>
   Peeling back layers of sediment, he was soon surrounded by
whitened human skeletons. Bourget was jubilant. ``For the first
time, we could really see how the Moche performed human
sacrifice,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Such a rare and complex burial site called for a specialist.
John Verano, a physical anthropologist and osteologist who had
worked with archeological teams on Peru's north coast, was
summoned. He set up an impromptu morgue in the Archeology Museum at
the University of Trujillo where he examined the collection of
human remains.
</P>
<P>
   Verano found that all the corpses who could be identified
belonged to a select demographic group: young, healthy, physically
active males. Indeed, the mean age at death was just 23. Many, it
turned out, were old hands at combat. One in every four bore healed
rib, arm, leg and skull fractures.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, many of the men had fractures just beginning to
knit at the time of death. These confirmed the story, corresponding
eerily to scenes from the warrior narrative.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Moche art,'' Verano says, ``the artists often show
prisoners being smacked on the nose so their noses will bleed, and
that's often done at the time of capture.''
</P>
<P>
   Judging from the healing of wounds, the battered men survived
for nearly two weeks after their capture, their last weeks mired in
misery. Death, when it finally arrived, came swiftly.
</P>
<P>
   Verano's data suggests that the bodies at the Pyramid of the
Moon belonged to Moche warriors wounded and captured on the field
of battle. It is entirely possible, he says, that the ancient
desert dwellers, like the Aztecs, fought at least some battles
specifically to capture young males for sacrifice. Just how often
the Moche conducted sacrifices and how many lives they took has yet
to be determined.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, Verano discovered something strange about an
enormous mural on the site. The pre-Columbian mural, painted in
crimson and electric yellow, shows a row of Moche nobles dancing
above the heads of war captives. While studying the mural,
researchers found a fallen chunk of mud plaster from one of the
dancer's feet. A piece of bone protruded from one end. Verano could
see that it was the rounded end of a human femur. It had been
chopped from a cadaver, stripped of flesh, and incorporated into
the giant mural.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dancers are stepping on the bones of their enemies,'' he
says, ``or their victims.''
</P>
<P>
   While new evidence explains much about how sacrifices were
performed, it falls far short of answering why. Researchers such as
Elizabeth Benson have traced an intimate link between the offering
of human lives and agricultural fertility.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, people thought they could change the world by
ritual,'' Benson says. ``This was how you controlled the world, how
you had enough food for your people. And a human being was the most
important offering you could make.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SIDEBAR: WHY DID THE GODS DEMAND BLOOD? &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``To the people who say the Moche or the Aztecs did sacrifices
because their gods demanded it, I would say, Why did their gods
demand it and other peoples' gods did not?'' observes Michael
Winkelman, an anthropologist at Arizona State University in Tempe.
</P>
<P>
   Winkelman studied scientific accounts of 45 societies worldwide
and came up with seven sacrifice performing societies, from the
Marquesans of the South Pacific to the Romans. He detected several
common, distinguishing traits: nearly all suffered from high
population densities and fought wars over land and scarce
resources.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, all the sacrificing societies were ruled locally by a
leader from a powerful family; in such a system, treachery and
betrayal were constant threats. To intimidate those contemplating
betrayal, Winkelman says, leaders naturally gravitated toward human
sacrifice.
</P>
<P>
   Moche experts call Winkelman's work thought-provoking, but few
are ready to accept that his analyses apply to the Moche, because
not enough is known about their population density or political
organization.

<P>
   For at least the next five years, NASA's Cassini spacecraft, six
tons of brute technology laboriously wending its way to Saturn and
its giant moon Titan, will serve nicely as a bloated billboard with
this message: The era of big, unmanned space missions is over. Not
only did the craft's considerable heft force an impressively
circuitous route that depends on the gravitational pull of three
heavenly bodies, but its $2 billion cost clashed ominously with the
U.S. space agency's shrinking budget.
</P>
<P>
   Just as the extinction of the dinosaurs cleared a place for
little, lithe mammals, so the termination of huge missions like
Cassini will create opportunities for petite but powerful
explorers. Under strict orders from NASA administrator Daniel
Goldin, whose mantra is ``better, faster, cheaper,'' the agency is
moving toward ideas reminiscent of science-fiction novels _ robots
that could fit on a spoon, solar sails and rockets no larger than a
computer chip. The technologies will be seen in the real world
surprisingly soon.
</P>
<P>
   At the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., ground
zero for NASA's tightened focus, a tiny rover called MUSES-CN
symbolizes the merits of miniaturization. MUSES resembles a
drastically downsized version of Sojourner, the remote-control
chariot that enchanted the public two summers ago as it rolled
across Mars. The reduced rover measures just six inches long and
weighs 42 ounces. Its size will allow it to ride piggyback on the
already-planned Japanese MUSES-C probe, to be launched at the
asteroid Nereus in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   MUSES is only a beginning. Rover mastermind Brian Wilcox is
developing tiny rovers that weigh no more than a few ounces.
Another little buggy may ride aboard the Near-Earth Asteroid
Prospector _ history's first privately funded deep-space probe. The
European Space Agency is working on ROSA, a six-wheeled robot
designed to tackle the worst terrain Mars has to offer. Other
exotic vehicles are in the works at JPL as well, such as a
``subsurface explorer'' _ a 2-inch-wide rod with a pressurized
gas-driven hammer that burrows eagerly underground.
</P>
<P>
   The spacecraft that fly the rovers are likewise dieting. Barry
Hebert's micro-spacecraft group at JPL is building radically
downsized vehicles, weighing as little as two pounds. Several could
fly into space on top of a single inexpensive Pegasus missile.
</P>
<P>
   They could then ``set up a virtual network _ a kind of Internet
in space,'' Hebert says. Networking would allow coordinated
activities such as observing an asteroid from all sides at once or
building a complex telescope that could reveal details far too fine
_ even for the Hubble Space Telescope. Hebert promises test flights
of his miniature spacecraft within the next couple of years.
</P>
<P>
   Featherweight spacecraft are a perfect fit with solar-sail
propulsion. Radiation from the sun could accelerate a huge but very
thin light collector to extremely high speeds. Later this year, the
space shuttle may carry a solar sail into Earth orbit to prove the
concept works.
</P>
<P>
   A few technological visionaries, such as inventor Forrest Bishop
of the Institute of Atomic-Scale Engineering, are planning machines
that can travel to other star systems and reconfigure themselves
molecule by molecule. Once they reach their target, they will seek
out raw materials, build sensors and an antenna, then relay images
back home.
</P>
<P>
   NASA scientists, staring at tight funding restrictions, dare not
embrace such dreaming. But that doesn't bother Bishop. ``In the
long term,'' he says, ``space will become a private venture.
Bureaucrats are not going to colonize the solar system.''

knit at the time of death. These confirmed the story, corresponding
eerily to scenes from the warrior narrative.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Moche art,'' Verano says, ``the artists often show
prisoners being smacked on the nose so their noses will bleed, and
that's often done at the time of capture.''
</P>
<P>
   Judging from the healing of wounds, the battered men survived
for nearly two weeks after their capture, their last weeks mired in
misery. Death, when it finally arrived, came swiftly.
</P>
<P>
   Verano's data suggests that the bodies at the Pyramid of the
Moon belonged to Moche warriors wounded and captured on the field
of battle. It is entirely possible, he says, that the ancient
desert dwellers, like the Aztecs, fought at least some battles
specifically to capture young males for sacrifice. Just how often
the Moche conducted sacrifices and how many lives they took has yet
to be determined.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, Verano discovered something strange about an
enormous mural on the site. The pre-Columbian mural, painted in
crimson and electric yellow, shows a row of Moche nobles dancing
above the heads of war captives. While studying the mural,
researchers found a fallen chunk of mud plaster from one of the
dancer's feet. A piece of bone protruded from one end. Verano could
see that it was the rounded end of a human femur. It had been
chopped from a cadaver, stripped of flesh, and incorporated into
the giant mural.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dancers are stepping on the bones of their enemies,'' he
says, ``or their victims.''
</P>
<P>
   While new evidence explains much about how sacrifices were
performed, it falls far short of answering why. Researchers such as
Elizabeth Benson have traced an intimate link between the offering
of human lives and agricultural fertility.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, people thought they could change the world by
ritual,'' Benson says. ``This was how you controlled the world, how
you had enough food for your people. And a human being was the most
important offering you could make.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SIDEBAR: WHY DID THE GODS DEMAND BLOOD? &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``To the people who say the Moche or the Aztecs did sacrifices
because their gods demanded it, I would say, Why did their gods
demand it and other peoples' gods did not?'' observes Michael
Winkelman, an anthropologist at Arizona State University in Tempe.
</P>
<P>
   Winkelman studied scientific accounts of 45 societies worldwide
and came up with seven sacrifice performing societies, from the
Marquesans of the South Pacific to the Romans. He detected several
common, distinguishing traits: nearly all suffered from high
population densities and fought wars over land and scarce
resources.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, all the sacrificing societies were ruled locally by a
leader from a powerful family; in such a system, treachery and
betrayal were constant threats. To intimidate those contemplating
betrayal, Winkelman says, leaders naturally gravitated toward human
sacrifice.
</P>
<P>
   Moche experts call Winkelman's work thought-provoking, but few
are ready to accept that his analyses apply to the Moche, because
not enough is known about their population density or political
organization.

   For at least the next five years, NASA's Cassini spacecraft, six
tons of brute technology laboriously wending its way to Saturn and
its giant moon Titan, will serve nicely as a bloated billboard with
this message: The era of big, unmanned space missions is over. Not
only did the craft's considerable heft force an impressively
circuitous route that depends on the gravitational pull of three
heavenly bodies, but its $2 billion cost clashed ominously with the
U.S. space agency's shrinking budget.
</P>
<P>
   Just as the extinction of the dinosaurs cleared a place for
little, lithe mammals, so the termination of huge missions like
Cassini will create opportunities for petite but powerful
explorers. Under strict orders from NASA administrator Daniel
Goldin, whose mantra is ``better, faster, cheaper,'' the agency is
moving toward ideas reminiscent of science-fiction novels _ robots
that could fit on a spoon, solar sails and rockets no larger than a
computer chip. The technologies will be seen in the real world
surprisingly soon.
</P>
<P>
   At the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., ground
zero for NASA's tightened focus, a tiny rover called MUSES-CN
symbolizes the merits of miniaturization. MUSES resembles a
drastically downsized version of Sojourner, the remote-control
chariot that enchanted the public two summers ago as it rolled
across Mars. The reduced rover measures just six inches long and
weighs 42 ounces. Its size will allow it to ride piggyback on the
already-planned Japanese MUSES-C probe, to be launched at the
asteroid Nereus in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   MUSES is only a beginning. Rover mastermind Brian Wilcox is
developing tiny rovers that weigh no more than a few ounces.
Another little buggy may ride aboard the Near-Earth Asteroid
Prospector _ history's first privately funded deep-space probe. The
European Space Agency is working on ROSA, a six-wheeled robot
designed to tackle the worst terrain Mars has to offer. Other
exotic vehicles are in the works at JPL as well, such as a
``subsurface explorer'' _ a 2-inch-wide rod with a pressurized
gas-driven hammer that burrows eagerly underground.
</P>
<P>
   The spacecraft that fly the rovers are likewise dieting. Barry
Hebert's micro-spacecraft group at JPL is building radically
downsized vehicles, weighing as little as two pounds. Several could
fly into space on top of a single inexpensive Pegasus missile.
</P>
<P>
   They could then ``set up a virtual network _ a kind of Internet
in space,'' Hebert says. Networking would allow coordinated
activities such as observing an asteroid from all sides at once or
building a complex telescope that could reveal details far too fine
_ even for the Hubble Space Telescope. Hebert promises test flights
of his miniature spacecraft within the next couple of years.
</P>
<P>
   Featherweight spacecraft are a perfect fit with solar-sail
propulsion. Radiation from the sun could accelerate a huge but very
thin light collector to extremely high speeds. Later this year, the
space shuttle may carry a solar sail into Earth orbit to prove the
concept works.
</P>
<P>
   A few technological visionaries, such as inventor Forrest Bishop
of the Institute of Atomic-Scale Engineering, are planning machines
that can travel to other star systems and reconfigure themselves
molecule by molecule. Once they reach their target, they will seek
out raw materials, build sensors and an antenna, then relay images
back home.
</P>
<P>
   NASA scientists, staring at tight funding restrictions, dare not
embrace such dreaming. But that doesn't bother Bishop. ``In the
long term,'' he says, ``space will become a private venture.
Bureaucrats are not going to colonize the solar system.''

STOVES OF YESTERYEAR COME WITH MODERN TOUCHES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By FRANCES INGRAHAM  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ By the turn of the century, the summer kitchen
was common in many houses. The summer kitchen could be either a
separate room or even a porch, providing a cooler space in which to
prepare family meals.
</P>
<P>
   While the kitchen stove of today quickly cools after cooking,
the cookstoves of the 1880s were made of cast iron, or cast iron
with soapstone inserts. They burned wood or coal and not only
produced a slow steady heat but kept the room warm for hours after
the meal was consumed.
</P>
<P>
   This period was also the height of the American stove industry.
</P>
<P>
   Stove makers took great pride in the craftsmanship of these
cast-iron beauties, producing them in a variety of styles that
included nickel trim and other ornamentation.
</P>
<P>
   The stoves were made so well and were so serviceable that they
lasted for decades, unlike many of today's cookstoves, which have
obsolescence built into them.
</P>
<P>
   To keep up with the modern kitchen of the 1920s, enamel stoves
became popular, giving the cook a choice of colors, plus the
convenience of cleaning the stove with a damp cloth, according to
the Good Time Stove Co., in Goshen, Mass. Beige, white, gray green
and a popular blue were typical colors.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1973, Good Time Stove Co. has been rescuing and restoring
these the old workhorses, which not only supplied heat to adjoining
rooms, but heated household water.
</P>
<P>
   Prices for a restored cast-iron or enamel range, adapted for
electric or gas heat, or a combination of the two, from Good Time
Stove are $2,850 to $7,650.
</P>
<P>
   Because these stoves are considered works of art, Elmira Stove
Works in Waterloo, Ontario, has been in business for 20 years
making new stoves with the latest technology, but designed to look
like models from the late 1800s.
</P>
<P>
   These feature gas or electric cooktops and self-cleaning ovens.
A convection oven is only available on electric models.
</P>
<P>
   Elmira stoves, which cost from $3,650 to $6,000, feature
matching microwave and wall ovens and refrigerators in a variety of
six jewel-tone colors with a choice of nickel, brass or copper
trim.
</P>
<P>
   Oil, gas and electrical stoves replaced original cast-iron range
by the 1930s.

<P>
   A company called EASE Simulation manufactures a product called
AutoWatch, which is essentially a way to spy on how your teen-agers
(or your employees) drive. It's the car equivalent of the ``black
box'' flight recorder on airplanes.
</P>
<P>
   After using a home computer to set limits such as maximum speed,
throttle position and RPMs, hook AutoWatch up to your vehicle's
diagnostic wiring. After a drive, use the PC to download printed
proof of, for example, the fact that the car was driven at 87 mph
for six minutes at 3 p.m. on Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   A battery backup even will tell you if AutoWatch has been
tampered with or the car's battery has been disconnected, and for
how long. The $300 device works on vehicles made since 1996.

   STAND-UP STUFF: Beanie Babies don't break, even if you toss 'em
at your loved ones. But other collectibles _ Hummels, for example,
or glass figurines _ are more fragile.
</P>
<P>
   A gust of wind or a jostle or a thump can cause a chip or knock
the noggin right off that porcelain cherubim. To the rescue comes a
trio of products designed to keep collectibles from falling over _
Museum Putty, Museum Wax and Museum Gel, all of which we find in a
catalog of household goods called Practica.
</P>
<P>
   Slap a glob of the stuff on the bottom of the valuable to keep
it upright, even during an earthquake, according to the catalog.
Use the restickable putty for pieces you move frequently, the wax
for objects that stay put, the clear-drying and re-usable gel on
glass shelves or beneath crystal.
</P>
<P>
   The products, priced at about $10 each, are available by calling
800-863-5613.

<P>
   SOUTHERN SCENE: A statue called The Bird Girl once stood in a
cemetery in Savannah, Ga., until author John Berendt came along,
wrote a book called ``Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil'' and
put a picture of the statue on the cover of the millions-selling
volume.
</P>
<P>
   So many people visited the city as a result of the book, and
tramped all over the graveyard, that the statue was moved to a
museum. Now you can have your own 2-foot version, courtesy of
Ballard Designs.
</P>
<P>
   The company says nothing about whether your house will be
overrun by visitors should you choose to add it to your decor.
Order the bronze-looking resin statue ($240 with base, $185
without) by calling 800-367-2775. Find Berendt's gripping tale in
bookstores, but never, ever rent the movie version, which Clint
Eastwood directed at a stupefying pace.

NOVEL BRINGS Y2K PROBLEM TO LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By HARRY THOMAS  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   This millennium actually ends on Dec. 31, 2000, but the Y2K
computer problem will hit a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Millions of computers, programs, critical systems and
established ways of life will come to a grinding halt, we're told.
Yet who knows what will really happen?
</P>
<P>
   For many of us, it's a scary notion looming on the horizon; but
for those who understand the ramifications of what's going to
happen, the nerds and technogeeks who write the software and build
the chips, it's the ultimate hack. They will come to rule the Earth
because they are the only ones who know how big the problem is and
what it will take to fix it.
</P>
<P>
   One can only hope that some of these nerds have a benevolent
streak, such as those in the gang that Mark Joseph describes in his
novel, ``Deadline Y2K'' (St. Martin's Press, $24.95).
</P>
<P>
   Headed by a computer genius named Doc, a group of hackers called
the Midnight Club concocts a plan to keep Manhattan running when
the rest of the world self-destructs as the clocks strike midnight
on Dec. 31, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   To succeed, the Midnight Club must hack into the major systems
that keep the city running on a pre-Y2K basis and replace them with
their own. They know there is no way that they can keep everyone
on-line, but they hope to prevent anarchy in the world's most
important financial center.
</P>
<P>
   Doc also has to thwart the unscrupulous plans of his boss,
Donald Copeland, who is determined to use the impending crisis to
steal millions from unsuspecting banks who will have no knowledge
of his crime.
</P>
<P>
   As the millennium bug sweeps across the planet, chaos ensues.
Companies that spent billions on Y2K measures still find themselves
brought down by overlooked systems; governments have to deal with
angry and cold citizens as the world's nuclear reactors and power
plants are forced to shut down.
</P>
<P>
   Planes crash, banks fail, cities burn.
</P>
<P>
   The timeline moves inexorably westward, and Doc's team is still
missing some important passwords that will make their plan a
success. The tension builds as the zero hour approaches America's
East Coast.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph does something here that most other books and news
articles on Y2K haven't done: He makes the problem comprehensible
to the layperson. His good characters are laid back and likable; he
demonstrates a strong feel for the intertwined worlds of the geek
and the Wall Street businessman.
</P>
<P>
   But the bad guy, Copeland, is too one-dimensional, his fate
almost an anticlimax.
</P>
<P>
   The real tension in the novel is based on the realization of how
connected to computers our current technological society is. Joseph
wryly notes that the Third World countries will fare best during
the crisis because they aren't dependent on technology as we are.
</P>
<P>
   If only 10 percent of what Joseph portrays in ``Deadline Y2K''
comes true, we're in for a hard year on Planet Earth.

BABY BOOMERS TOSS OFF DAILY GRIND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By L.M. SIXEL  
 c.1999 Houston Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ It always takes courage to make a sea change in
midlife _ especially if that means giving up a regular paycheck.
</P>
<P>
   That's something Saadat Syal discovered when he decided to chuck
his 16-year career of wooing companies to town as vice president of
economic development for the Greater Houston Partnership.
</P>
<P>
   Syal, 53, gave it up for the real estate development business.
</P>
<P>
   He and his family have been buying property in inner Houston
over the past several years and they want to build houses and town
houses on the vacant turf. He also has family business in Pakistan
that needs tending.
</P>
<P>
   And he's looking forward to doing volunteer work that he never
had time for. For instance, he spent the past week handling several
mediation cases for neighboring Fort Bend County.
</P>
<P>
   It was time to give up the daily grind, he said about his years
with the Partnership. He wanted a career that gave him more
flexibility and an opportunity to use the skills he has picked up
over the years.
</P>
<P>
   More and more baby boomers in their early to mid-50s are opting
to leave their steady jobs and move on to new ventures _ whether
that means joining the Peace Corps, volunteering full time or
launching their own business.
</P>
<P>
   There just seems to be a general mood of restlessness, Syal
said, speaking of his contemporaries. People have worked hard,
acquired lots of accouterments and now want something more out of
life.
</P>
<P>
   And it was really now or never, Syal said, since the economy is
so good right now.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't an overnight decision but more of an evolutionary
process, Syal said. He said he carefully planned his new real
estate venture for several years before setting out.
</P>
<P>
   Many baby boomers are feeling that same itch because the whole
concept of work has changed. People are healthier and live longer
and many can't fathom the idea of putting up their feet when they
hit 65, said Cheryl Matherly, director of the Career Services
Center at Rice University.
</P>
<P>
   People who are reaching the age of 40, 45, 50 are thinking about
all the productive years they've got left and wondering if they
want to keep doing what they've been doing, said Matherly, who
recalled a 60-year-old alum who came in and took some career tests
because he was looking for a change in direction.
</P>
<P>
   Many boomers can afford to sing the tune Johnny Paycheck made
famous, ``Take This Job and Shove It,'' because they've done well
in the stock market. They can afford to take a chance.
</P>
<P>
   Syal said he and his wife always lived below their means. They
bought less house than they could have, they didn't take elaborate
vacations and didn't accumulate any credit card debt.
</P>
<P>
   But while some boomers may have the assets to go out on a limb,
it's not always an easy decision.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Boynton said he sees a lot of senior executives who
develop a sense of wanderlust, but many don't have the nerve to
leave their organization and go out on their own.
</P>
<P>
   It's not because they lack courage. Rather, it's a reluctance to
move out of the comfort zone of the authority and infrastructure
that they've developed in their organization, said Boynton,
president of the Morganstern Co., an executive outplacement company
in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   When you're out on your own you have to make your own coffee and
answer your own phone, Boynton said.
</P>
<P>
   Irwin Miller also sees nervousness among midcareer folks who
might be thinking about jumping into a new career.
</P>
<P>
   They may be tired of their jobs but they're comfortable and it
provides a steady income, said Miller, chairman of the Houston
chapter of the Service Corps of Retired Executives. High-tech
employees seem to be an exception, he said.
</P>
<P>
   They seem a little more adveNt\97us and sure of themselves, he
said. And many have seen their friends' start-ups strike it big.
</P>
<P>
   Downsizing also appears to spawn entrepreneurship.
</P>
<P>
   Twice a month, SCORE conducts seminars on how to start a
business. When the economy is suffering, attendance at the seminars
soar, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Syal said he is already enjoying his new life. The volunteering
has been enjoyable and he is looking forward to lining up his first
real estate development.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day should be an adventure,'' he said.

MICROSOFT'S BROWSER TAKES A LEAP FORWARD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DWIGHT SILVERMAN  
 c.1999 Houston Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Boy, am I fickle when it comes to Web browsers.
</P>
<P>
   In November, I went gaga over Netscape Communications' latest
Web-surfing software, Communicator 4.5. While it was an incremental
upgrade, it was enough of a leap to push it past Internet Explorer
4.0.
</P>
<P>
   But now I've found a new love.
</P>
<P>
   For the past couple of weeks, I've been playing with the Windows
98 version of Internet Explorer 5.0, and I'm sold. While this may
not be the greatest thing since sliced bread, it's definitely the
best browser since ... well, Communicator 4.5.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has focused on making a product that's easy for
novices to use, but still powerful enough to delight savvy Web
surfers. It's faster, friendlier and more stable than its
competition.
</P>
<P>
   Say what you will about Microsoft, this is a great piece of
software. My initial reaction upon installing it was: ``Oh ... my
... gawd. Netscape is toast!'' And if that's the case, then
Internet Explorer 5 is the toaster, and it won't be because of
Microsoft's allegedly underhanded business practices or bullying
tactics. It will be because this browser is much better than
anything else out there. Period.
</P>
<P>
   Well, at least until Netscape Communicator 5 is released,
supposedly this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Those who go through the arduous process of downloading Internet
Explorer 5 _ Microsoft has not made downloading any easier,
unfortunately _ initially will see a browser that looks almost
identical to version 4.01, the product that ships with Windows 98.
</P>
<P>
   Once you begin using it, however, its differences become clear.
</P>
<P>
   Try clicking on the Search button on the toolbar. A pane opens
on the left with a list of choices _ find a Web page, someone's
address, a business. Enter a search, and you'll get results from
the Lycos search engine.
</P>
<P>
   But wait _ what if you prefer AltaVista, InfoSeek, Excite or
even the Microsoft Network? No problem. Click the Customize button
and you can change which search engine the browser queries first,
and preferentially order which of eight engines are checked next.
If you don't like the results from the first one, clicking the Next
button checks the next search engine in the list _ you don't have
to re-enter your data each time.
</P>
<P>
   This left-side pane also lets you search your history _ the list
of sites you've visited in the past _ as well as your favorites.
</P>
<P>
   Users of modern browsers are familiar with the feature that
fills in a Web address as it's being typed in the location field.
Microsoft has extended that capability into the forms you fill out
on Web pages themselves.
</P>
<P>
   For example, if you visit Web Site A and it requires a password,
Internet Explorer 5 will remember both your log-in name and
password.
</P>
<P>
   The next time you visit, the browser offers to fill in the
information for you.
</P>
<P>
   Like Communicator 4.5, Microsoft's new browser lets you enter a
simple word instead of a confusing URL, or Universal Resource
Locator, the familiar-but-maddening ``http://www'' address. For
example, if you enter Coca-Cola, you'll go to the Coke Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Internet Explorer 5 behaves differently from Communicator,
though, when it can't immediately link the keyword to a Web site.
With Communicator, a search is run through Netscape's Netcenter
portal. But with Internet Explorer, the keyword is checked against
whatever search engine you've listed as tops in the left-hand
search pane.
</P>
<P>
   There are other nifty bells and whistles. Internet Explorer 5
includes a toolbar that lets you connect to Net-based radio sites,
almost like punching radio buttons in your car. It has a built-in
control panel for managing multiple dial-up networking settings,
something's that been long overdue. And it can download whole Web
sites for off-line viewing.
</P>
<P>
   As enthusiastic as I am about this new version of Internet
Explorer, there are still some deficiencies. I still think
Communicator's method of storing favorite sites _ creating a single
Web page of bookmarked links _ is much easier to work with than the
individual shortcut icons Internet Explorer dumps into the
Favorites folder.
</P>
<P>
   And Communicator's links bar, a toolbar full of favorite sites,
is more versatile and easier to configure than Internet Explorer's.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the list of search engines from which you can choose is
limited by Microsoft's choices. It would be nice if you could add
your own preferred search sites.
</P>
<P>
   You can download it for free from www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/.

IF YOU RECEIVE `PASS IT ON' E-MAIL, YOU'D BE WELL ADVISED TO PASS
ON IT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DWIGHT SILVERMAN  
 c.1999 Houston Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: I have been getting e-mails from my friends that include a
warning that Congress is about to pass legislation in two weeks
that will force everyone to pay for Internet access by the minute,
like a long-distance call. Since I've been getting this ``in the
next two weeks'' message over several months' time, I presume it's
a hoax. Am I right?
</P>
<P>
   A: You are, although recent events at another governmental body
_ the Federal Communications Commission _ gave momentary credence
to what is actually a variation of an old, old online hoax.
</P>
<P>
   The message you are receiving probably reads something like
this: ``Guess we realized the government would sooner or later find
a way to tax us for using the Internet. Congress will be voting in
less than two weeks. CNN stated that the government would, in two
weeks time, decide to allow or not allow a charge to your phone
bill equal to a long distance call EACH time you access the
Internet. The address is www.house.gov/writerep/. If you choose,
visit the address above and fill out the necessary form. If EACH
one of us forwards this message on to others in a hurry, we may be
able to prevent this injustice from happening! Please Pass This
ON.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the direct descendant of an old hoax that began on
computer bulletin boards, prior to the popularity of the Internet,
of a ``modem tax.'' It was bogus then, and it's bogus now.
</P>
<P>
   However, several weeks ago the Federal Communications Commission
ruled that calls via Internet service providers to the Net could be
considered long-distance calls, since the Internet is a global
network. The FCC's chairman, however, was quick to point out that
it does not mean consumers will be charged as though the calls were
long-distance, but it may change the financial relationship between
providers and the phone companies on which they rely.
</P>
<P>
   In general, anytime you see some kind of dire warning that urges
you to ``pass it on,'' it's probably not worth passing on. But how
can you tell if something's phony or not? Try doing a search for
the words ``virus hoax'' at Yahoo (www.yahoo.com), where you'll
find several pages devoted to debunking hoaxes. One of my favorites
is the Stiller Research Virus Hoax News at
www.stiller.com/hoaxes.htm.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Somebody just sent me an e-mail, and then there was a
separate piece of mail from the same person with just an attachment
called Happy99.exe.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't run it, because I know better than to run programs
received as attachments, but I have heard this is a virus. Is this
true, or just another hoax?
</P>
<P>
   A: In this case, Happy99 is real. Most people who spread it
don't even know they're doing so.
</P>
<P>
   If you had run Happy99, you would have seen a pretty display of
fireworks on your screen. While you were enjoying the show, the
program _ which is technically not a virus, but a kind of Trojan
horse known as a worm _ would have been altering some of the key
files your computer uses to connect you to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Then, every time you post a message to a Usenet news group, or
send e-mail to someone, it sends a copy of itself along with that
mail, as a separate piece of mail with an attachment.
</P>
<P>
   If you receive it, simply delete it. Your computer is not
affected unless you run the program.
</P>
<P>
   If you have made the mistake of running it, it's easy to remove.
You can find the steps for doing so at
www.symantec.com/avcenter/venc/data/happy99.worm.html. This article
contains information both about restoring the files Happy99
changes, or _ if you have run it but not yet restarted your
computer _ how to prevent a full infection from taking place.

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    MEMPHIS -- For many people, the recent Amtrak crash in Illinois
was just another sad story reported one night and forgotten the
next. For those of us in Memphis, however, the story has lasted
longer.
 &HT;    Memphis was a stop along the train's route. Several local
families had members injured or killed. The most heartrending story
was of two sisters, ages 8 and 10, who died in the sleeping-car
fire.
 &HT;    In the days preceding their funeral, the parents, members of one
of the city's prominent evangelical churches, appeared on numerous
news programs professing faith in Christ and their confidence in
their daughters' salvation.
 &HT;    Reporters repeatedly commented on their deep faith with one
saying, ``If you miss faith in this story, you miss the story.''
 &HT;    It was impossible to miss the faith story in a Bible-belt town
like Memphis. Sadly, however, the faith presented by the parents
and pastors and the pundits did not seem much more than public
piety. A chance to witness about Jesus with the cameras on.
 &HT;    It pains me to say such a thing about suffering parents -- only
God knows how much they must be suffering. But their public display
of faith shocked me -- as I suspect it shocked Katie Couric on
their ``Today'' show interview.
 &HT;    Instead of tears and anger, they calmly spoke of accepting
Jesus. The mother even said she was ``happy'' for her daughters now
in heaven.
 &HT;    No questioning God's goodness? No doubt? No turning away from
the media glare in grief? No. Keep smiling and talk about Jesus on
NBC. Watching them, I confess I felt more embarrassed than
sympathetic.
 &HT;    The girls were not the only victims of this tragedy. The parents
also have been victims -- victims of bad theology.
 &HT;    Their church promotes this bad theology. Skip over the difficult
questions. Do not worry about pain. God is in control. Everything
is God's will. Come to Jesus and get saved. Your heavenly reward is
what matters.
 &HT;    Jesus, however, neither taught nor lived this theology.
 &HT;    Certainly Holy Week should remind Christians that theology with
easy answers is not God's way.
 &HT;    Jesus taught that his way was fraught with tension. He commanded
his followers to love God and love their neighbors as themselves.
He ordered his disciples to give up family and fortune -- and even
themselves -- to follow God.
 &HT;    He dined with the most objectionable people, touched
untouchables, and embraced outcasts. He broke nearly every rule of
polite religious society. And when cornered about his upsetting
behavior, he answered his critics with riddles and parables. The
way he advocated so threatened the authorities that they executed
him for treason.
 &HT;    Holy Week reminds Christians that Jesus' way was not easy. Jesus
walked a way of sorrow, the way of the cross. His way winds through
doubt, rejection, suffering, and death. He begged, ``Take this cup
from me.'' Instead, he drank from the cup of God's absence: ``My
God, my God, why have you forsaken me?''
 &HT;    Christianity is not a cheerful religion. Holy Week is a
wrenching reminder that the Christian faith is dark and dangerous,
a faith lived for and in the world that the world despises.
 &HT;    It is not easy. It was not easy for Jesus. It is not easy for
those who follow him.
 &HT;    In his new book, ``The Ironic Christian's Companion,'' Patrick
Henry writes, ``The gospel is no neurotic refusal to face death. It
is just the opposite -- a refusal to evade it. God died ... God has
gotten through to the other side by going through despair to get
there.''
 &HT;    The surprise of all this, of course, that this dark way
eventually leads to life. Holy Week leads to Easter -- but only
after loneliness and death. Bad theology gets there too quickly,
passing through death to resurrection without skipping a beat.
 &HT;    Even Jesus was dead for three days. And he was God. Surely, we
humans must pause and listen to the lessons of darkness before we
proclaim the victories of heavenly joy.
 &HT;    If we wait and listen, allowing suffering to shape our souls,
then we will not have facile answers.
 &HT;    I, too, feel certain those little girls are safe in God.
Perhaps, however, this was not the moment to say so. Perhaps we all
need to live with the sorrow and mystery of untimely death to
better love and serve God and God's people. We should not evade
death. We must refuse to evade it.
 &HT;    Who can say what could come from such tragedy? I do not know and
pray I will never know from personal experience.
 &HT;    I do know, however, that we would all be better off if not
victimized by bad theology that bypasses human pain.

 &HT;    
 &HT;    When I was a girl, Christmas far eclipsed Easter as my favorite
holiday.
 &HT;    Anticipation gripped me for weeks as I awaited Santa's visit and
all those presents.
 &HT;    Easter paled by comparison. Although my parents bought me a new
dress and spring coat, the Easter Bunny and his basket of candy
appeared Scrooge-like compared to Santa.
 &HT;    Then there was church. At Christmas, the baby Jesus, his
beautiful mother, the angels, shepherds and wise men entranced me.
Christmas' simplicity spoke to my childhood world.
 &HT;    But Easter? It made no sense. Although the baby grew up and
helped some people, others got so angry with him that they killed
him. God didn't like this, so he raised him from the dead.
 &HT;    Apparently, Easter doesn't make sense to many Americans.
Although 66 percent of us attend church on Easter Sunday, fully 20
percent admit to not understanding Easter's message.
 &HT;    The holiest day for Christians, Easter is about grown-up faith.
Jesus Christ, loving and sinless, suffers and dies at the hands of
fearful people. To prove the power of love, God raises Jesus from
the grave.
 &HT;    Easter's message startles: Christ has died. Christ has risen.
Death and resurrection.
 &HT;    Grown-up faith? Yes. Believing in a virgin birth, a cute baby,
and angelic hosts is easy stuff in comparison. But new life out of
death?
 &HT;    Mature faith gazes into the mystery of suffering and
resurrection. Only from life's unwanted pain and darkness can new
insight, wisdom and unconditional love arise.
 &HT;    Fifteen years ago, a friend suffered a terrible car accident.
Wrapped around a tree, his Volkswagen encased his twisted form
until paramedics cut him loose and rushed him to the hospital.
 &HT;    Amazed that he lived, the doctors said he would never regain
consciousness. Poised between life and death, he slept in a coma.
We anointed him with oil and prayed.
 &HT;    Unbelievably, he recovered _ even to the point of graduating
from college. As a result of his experience, he became a nurse who
treated those dying from AIDS.
 &HT;    For him, suffering brought forth compassion and service.
 &HT;    A few years ago, he died of AIDS. In the midst of his own pain,
he worked to heal others. No miraculous recovery this time. He
suffered only to suffer again.
 &HT;    Trying to come to terms with his death, I realized existence
moves from one death to another. Without the hope of new life, the
human story is little more than senseless tragedy.
 &HT;    But Easter insists upon _ indeed, Easter shouts _ triumph over
an endless cycle of suffering.
 &HT;    Hanging on the cross, Jesus suffered. In his pain, he cried out,
``Father, forgive them. They know not what they do.''
 &HT;    Breathing his last, he sighed, ``It is finished.'' Then he died.
 &HT;    Finished. Death is the ultimate end. As I grew up and began to
understand death, I reeled under its terror. Eternal nothingness.
It is finished.
 &HT;    The heart of the Easter story lies in Jesus' suffering. Good
Friday and Easter Sunday embrace in joyful triumph as the cross
leads to the empty tomb. Resurrection overcomes death.
 &HT;    Little children, charming in their Easter finery, chase each
other around the churchyard and hunt for colored eggs. They enjoy
Easter, but they don't grasp its power because, for the most part,
they haven't suffered.
 &HT;    Adults often do everything possible to escape pain and
suffering. But not until we grow up and face ``it is finished,''
can Easter have any meaning.
 &HT;    For Jesus it wasn't finished. After three days, God overcame the
horrifying injustice of the cross and raised him from the dead.
 &HT;    This fundamental theological insight _ that suffering brings
forth new life _ is adult faith. Although hard to believe, once it
is embraced, we find true freedom.
 &HT;    As the old hymn reminds us, ``He is risen! Death is conquered,
we are free!''

 &HT;    
 &HT;    When I was a girl, Christmas far eclipsed Easter as my favorite
holiday.
 &HT;    Anticipation gripped me for weeks as I awaited Santa's visit and
all those presents.
 &HT;    Easter paled by comparison. Although my parents bought me a new
dress and spring coat, the Easter Bunny and his basket of candy
appeared Scrooge-like compared to Santa.
 &HT;    Then there was church. At Christmas, the baby Jesus, his
beautiful mother, the angels, shepherds and wise men entranced me.

   &UR; By RABBI ELI HECHT &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   I walked into the supermarket to buy kosher food for the holiday
of Passover and to my amazement there were no less than five brands
of kosher wines and matzoh.
</P>
<P>
   The wines were from Italy, France, Israel, California and
upstate New York. The matzoh display had boxes from Israel,
Cincinnati and New York.
</P>
<P>
   When I was growing up we would eat special hand-made matzohs for
Passover.
</P>
<P>
   The matzoh was made from only two ingredients, flour and water.
The flour and water must be mixed and kneaded by hand and when the
dough is formed, small lumps of dough are given to a baker who
hand-flattens the dough with small rolling pins.
</P>
<P>
   Then, a special metal roller, with dozens of pins, is rolled
over the flat dough. The dough is shaped and baked in an open, flat
baker's stove -- all within 18 minutes from start to finish.
</P>
<P>
   Let me describe my first visit to a matzoh bakery before
Passover. I was 8 years old and my Chasidic grandfather, called
Zaydee, called me and said ``Eli, Pesach is coming and we need
shmura matzoh, come bake matzoh.''
</P>
<P>
   Let me try to describe a visit to a strange place in a strange
land. The bakery was located in a dilapidated area of Williamsburg,
in New York. It was an old, red-brick factory with rusty grates on
the windows. It must have been built in the late 1880s. The steps
leading into the building had cracks in the cement from the many
years of use. The heavy iron doors had gigantic hinges.
</P>
<P>
   The place looked like it was from the Dark Ages. I was afraid to
go in. Zaydee, however, had no time for my hesitation. He just held
on to my hand and said ``Sonny boy, come in and perform the mitzvah
of baking matzoh for Pesach.''
</P>
<P>
   Once inside I saw an incredible sight. There were men running
back and forth. Some were shouting at other men and women to roll
the rolling pins on the dough quicker. Others were singing songs
and the baker kept on yelling at the top of his voice, ``Le shaim
mitzvas matzoh -- for the sake of the deed of matzoh,'' meaning
that each matzoh was being baked for the express purpose of
fulfilling God's command of having unleavened bread -- matzoh. I
had never seen so many things happening at once.
</P>
<P>
   In one area stood an old man with a long beard and peyos (long
side locks). His only job was to be the water man. He wore a bright
white apron and every once in a while he would take a cup of water
from a 25-gallon jug prepared from the night before and pour it
into a new stainless steel basin.
</P>
<P>
   As he did that a second person would dump a huge cup of the
special flour into the basin while a third strong young man would
begin to mix the flour and water by hand. He would not stop moving
his hands until all the flour was mixed and had turned into dough.
</P>
<P>
   His hands twirled faster and faster like a tornado. It was magic
to me. Then another person would take the dough and make it into
little lumps and give it to workers at the kneading table. There
must have been five tables with eight workers to a table. All of
the workers were moving the rolling pins as fast as possible. The
heavier the person rolling the rolling pin, the flatter the dough
became and the matzohs were thinner.
</P>
<P>
   This answers the long unanswered question of why some hand-made
matzohs are thicker than others.
</P>
<P>
   Each matzoh was then carried to the oven on the rolling pin. The
baker put the matzoh into the oven and after a minute he removed
the baked matzoh. It was then placed on a table to be cooled by a
fan.
</P>
<P>
   The finished matzoh was then carried to the packer, who put
eight matzohs to a pound box.
</P>
<P>
   I remember seeing the people coming and going, the singing, and
the flour mixing with the water. The mixer had the largest muscular
hands I had ever seen. After kneading thousands of batches his
hands were like steel vises.
</P>
<P>
   The women of all ages were dressed, as prescribed by the Jewish
orthodox modesty code, with the hair on their heads completely
covered, their arms covered to the wrists and their dresses worn
over their knees.
</P>
<P>
   Their language was a United Nations of Yiddish, Hungarian,
Hebrew and a little English.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the arms of the men and women bore tattoo numbers from
the Aushwitz concentration death camp. For them, each matzoh baked
was a statement of their faith and good fortune.
</P>
<P>
   It was a strange but happy world to see all the ages thrown
together for the holiday. Passover commences Wednesday night, March
31 at sunset.
</P>
<P>
   The story of Passover is an inspirational one. It tells us how a
whole nation of people were freed from years of tyrany and
enslavement. They experienced total freedom from Egyptian bondage.
</P>
<P>
   The Passover night festive meal, called the seder, symbolizes
the ultimate liberation for all people in all places in all times.
</P>
<P>
   This year when we eat our matzoh we should break off a piece and
share it with our neighbor. telling him that the message of
liberation is for all people. A happy Passover to you all.

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES: GETTING DROOPY AND GROWING OLD
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANGELINA COUNTY, Texas _ At some point in life we stop growing
older and, instead, start growing old.
</P>
<P>
   You'll know it when it happens. Your doctor will tell you when
you show up for an appointment for some new ailment.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just part of growing old,'' he'll explain with a shrug.
Which is to say, nothing much you can do about it.
</P>
<P>
   That's why I hate going to the doctor. I hate hearing what's
newly amiss with me that will never be made right, least wise not
in my lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   That's why when my left eye started bothering me at night _
waking me up weeping and aching _ that I put off going to the eye
doctor.
</P>
<P>
   Instead I put on an eye patch and applied some ointment to the
offending eye each night at bedtime. It helped but it didn't heal.
The left eye was still blurring out on me on occasion.
</P>
<P>
   So it was that I finally sought professional eye doctor help.
</P>
<P>
   He took one long look into my bloodshot baby blues (actually,
they're greezer green) and pronounced judgment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's what we call, for lack of a better term . . .'' he began.
</P>
<P>
   I just knew he'd complete the sentence with:
</P>
<P>
   `` . . . black death.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that bad, as it turned out.
</P>
<P>
   `` . . . droopy eyelid,'' the doctor concluded.
</P>
<P>
   The corner of my eye, I'm told, has become sort of unraveled. At
night, with that side of my face pressed against the pillow, the
eyelid rubs against the eyeball. (Ah, there's the rub.)
</P>
<P>
   As a result . . . Well, let me use the doctor's precise
terminology:
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like raw meat,'' he advised me.
</P>
<P>
   Amazingly, there's even something they can do about it.
</P>
<P>
   They can tuck it back.
</P>
<P>
   ``A very minor surgery,'' the doctor said, which is to me the
magic words.
</P>
<P>
   (Of course, there are those who are of the opinion that the
difference between minor and major surgery is whether it's being
done to someone else or to you.)
</P>
<P>
   No matter. I'm all set for next month when a specialist from
Dallas comes visiting the provinces to perform his medical miracles
on country folk.
</P>
<P>
   At this point I'm not sure if they'll do both eyes or just one,
but you'll know next time you see me.
</P>
<P>
   I'll either look like Popeye or Betty Boop.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile I'm continuing with the eye patch and ointment. My
doctor, for a fact, couldn't improve on the treatment I'd devised.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have taken no telling how many ophthalmologists
probably thousands of work hours to have come up with the same
solution,'' he said, obViously impressed.
</P>
<P>
   Just lucky, I guess.
</P>
<P>
   Lucky, too, that it's an affliction that can be cured.
</P>
<P>
   Of everything that I have drooping, this is the one thing that
can be fixed.
</P>
<P>
   Here's looking at you, kid.

VIAGRA REMAINS A HOT COMMODITY YEAR AFTER APPROVAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SYLVIA WOOD  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ When Viagra hit the pharmacy shelves last year,
it was love at first sight. Many Americans finally found what
they'd been longing for: an easier way to treat erectile
dysfunction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, the real excitement and enthusiasm, and all the
floods of phone calls have all calmed down,'' said Dr. Ronald
Kaufman, an assistant professor of surgery at Albany Medical
Center.
</P>
<P>
   The thrill hasn't gone from Wall Street either. Pfizer, the New
York-based manufacturer of the drug, reported sales of $788 million
last year, making it one of the most successful prescription drugs
ever. Stock in the company is up 44 percent from a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Considering that 20 million to 30 million American men suffer
from erection problems, demand isn't likely to subside.
</P>
<P>
   But as with any new fling, it's hard to sustain the enthusiasm,
even with former Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., promoting
it on television.
</P>
<P>
   Despite warnings that men with heart conditions should avoid
Viagra, the Food and Drug Administration has received reports of
130 deaths, including 77 from cardiovascular events, such as
strokes and heart attacks.
</P>
<P>
   In France, 10 men died after suspected Viagra use during the
first three months of the drug's availability.
</P>
<P>
   Because of those concerns, Pfizer, in conjunction with the FDA,
revised Viagra's label last year to include a stronger warning.
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser Permanente and MVP, two health maintenance organizations,
continue not to include Viagra in their prescription plans because
of the potential for problems. Another concern is the cost of
Viagra at about $10 per pill.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even some of those people with no complicating conditions
are now thinking twice about using Viagra.
</P>
<P>
   ``Patients are a little more cautious,'' said Dr. Daniel Finn, a
urologist in Albany. ``We've become very conscious of the fact that
some people have had a bad reaction.''
</P>
<P>
   For others, the drug has simply been a disappointment. In early
studies of 4,000 men with varying erectile dysfunction, the drug
worked for only 64 to 72 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Urologists say they've seen similar results among their
patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``While some patients fail, many patients are successful,''
Kaufman said. ``It's unpredictable.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the disappointment has been caused by hyped expectations
around the drug. For months, men and women waited for the FDA to
approve Viagra. The federal agency approved the drug on March 27,
1998.
</P>
<P>
   As Pfizer's stock soared, so did the hopes of couples affected
by erectile dysfunction.
</P>
<P>
   Viagra works by acting on an enzyme prevalent in the penis to
boost blood flow. Yet many doctors and therapists warned from the
start that Viagra couldn't solve every bedroom problem, even as it
raised awareness about sexual issues.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jennifer Berman, a urologist and director of the Women's
Sexual Health Clinic at Boston University, is conducting a study of
the effect of Viagra on postmenopausal women who have arousal
disorders, caused by vaginal dryness, surgery or other
physiological reasons.
</P>

piece of Reagan's political legacy. His picture appears on campaign
Web sites. His words are recited in speech after speech. By RON
HUTCHESON. Story will move in ``w'' Washington category. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   From the interview:
</P>
<P>
   ``I love the genre,'' Jackson says over lunch at the Four
Seasons Hotel in New York. ``I wanted to be in a `Star Wars' movie.
So the next time I was asked (which director he wished to work
with), I said, `I would love to work with George Lucas.'
</P>
<P>
   `` ... (On the set) some guy would come over to me and he'd open
a case,'' says Jackson, who recalls seeing the original ``Star
Wars'' movie on its opening day in 1977. ``Inside were, like, nine
lightsabers, and he'd say, `Choose yours.' I'd be there
hyperventilating. I'd say, `Oh, I'll take that one.' It was very
cool.''

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Hilfiger Internet hoax has too long a life
 &HT;    For release March 31, 1999.
 &HT;    By HOWARD KLEINBERG
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   An e-mail message last week was addressed to me and 15 others.
At the bottom of the page, I was able to see that the sender, along
with another 15 persons, received it from someone else.
</P>
<P>
   What he passed along to me, and to all those others, was an
extension of a venal hoax. My friend didn't recognize it as such
and, thus, compounded it.
</P>
<P>
   The gist of what he sent began: ``I'm not sure many of you
watched the recent taping of the Oprah Winfrey show where her guest
was Tommy Hilfiger . . .''
</P>
<P>
   What followed was a report claiming that clothing designer Tommy
Hilfiger went on Oprah Winfrey's TV show and said he did not make
his clothes for African-Americans, Hispanics, Jews and Asians, that
he made them only for upper-class white people; whereupon Oprah
ordered him off her show.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately upon reading that, more red flags flew in front of
my face than I might see at a May Day rally. If such a thing ever
occurred on TV, especially the Oprah Winfrey show, it would be
front page news and Hilfiger's name, and product, would turn to
instant mud.
</P>
<P>
   That was the apparent goal of the e-mail, to destroy the
Hilfiger name and line. The e-mail demanded a boycott of Hilfiger
products: ``Let's give Mr. Hilfiger what he asked for. Let's not
buy his clothes! Let's spread the word, so others won't buy his
clothes either.''
</P>
<P>
   And spread the word they did.
</P>
<P>
   What a vicious lie it was. And to make matters worse, what my
friend was passing on to me in late March was something that first
appeared on the Web in December and has been denied by both Winfrey
and Hilfiger ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Fact: Hilfiger never was on the Winfrey show; they have never
met each other. It did not happen.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the lie has endured and the appeals to ethnic and racial
knee-jerk reaction remain alive, spreading out to more and more
people.
</P>
<P>
   Where and how did this start? I can't be certain, but surfing
the Web, I was able to track the exact text back to a Web site
called IWW News. It was dated Dec. 23, 1998. I don't know what IWW
News is, other than there are constant references through its Web
site listings to ``revolutionary unionism.''
</P>
<P>
   Anyone with a cause has as much right to the Internet as anyone
else. Eventually, however, there has to be something established to
deal with Internet lies, hoaxes and libels without endangering our
First Amendment rights or, since the Web is worldwide, the rights
of people in other countries. Placing limits on speech is a risky
business.
</P>
<P>
   But what needs to come out of this hoax, cited in the Hilfiger
denial as being the same story spread about designer Liz Claiborne
in 1992, is for the gullible public to realize that what appears on
the Internet ain't, as Ira Gershwin wrote, necessarily so.
</P>
<P>
   There have been hoaxes before and will continue to be. In 1997,
a lot of people _ including former JFK press chief Pierre Salinger
_ made fools of themselves abetting the Internet-initiated report
that a U.S. Navy missile took down TWA Flight 800.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the originator of this unprincipled hoax admitted
what he did was ``reckless and a mistake.'' Indeed!
</P>
<P>
   Don't even accept, unconditionally, the photos you see on the
Internet, or anywhere for that matter, as they can be falsified
with computer software. You want a photo of Meg Ryan out fishing
with Adolf Hitler? Piece of cake!
</P>
<P>
   In the Hilfiger hoax, the knee-jerkers who stand ready and
willing to destroy people and businesses based on an
unsubstantiated report can be most dangerous. I would guess that
thousands of people received the ``Boycott Hilfiger'' e-mail during
the past three months and shamefully did just that.
</P>
<P>
   These are great days for cynics like me; so much to do, so much
to distrust.
</P>
<P>
   We need more cynics and less sheep.

BENIGNI BEFORE `LIFE' BEGAN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If your appetite has been whetted for more Roberto Benigni
films, here are some videos that can be rented with a bit of
hunting:
</P>
<P>
   ``Down by Law'': Cult director Jim Jarmusch's stubbornly
nonconformist 1986 road comedy is so leisurely, it's like looking
at a series of black-and-white Polaroids. But Benigni, as a
cockeyed Italian optimist who falls in with losers Tom Waits and
John Lurie, gives it a much-needed steroid injection. His refrain
here _ ``It's a sad and beautiful world!'' _ could have been a
dress rehearsal for his Oscar speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``Night on Earth'': Jarmusch's unhurried style was much better
suited to this 1991 series of vignettes about taxi drivers.
Benigni's bit, in which he plays a Rome cabby who makes an
outrageous impromptu confession to a stunned priest, is hilariously
off-color and easily the movie's most memorable sequence. The
movie's non-English portions are subtitled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Johnny Stecchino'': Here's a double dose of Benigni: In this
1992 film, he plays a mild-mannered Roman bus driver who's seduced
into switching identities with a notorious gangster. Italian with
English subtitles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Son of the Pink Panther'': A big mistake from 1993, this
desperate sequel cast Benigni as the son of Peter Sellers'
Inspector Clouseau _ an Italian playing the son of a French
detective made famous by a Brit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Monster'': More mistaken identity, as Benigni stars as a
bumbling petty thief mistaken for a serial killer. This 1996 film
is one of the highest-grossing films in Italian history. Subtitled.

THOUGHT-PROVOKING PLAYTHINGS FROM THE ANNUAL TOY FAIR
</HEADLINE>
 (Accompanied by BC-NEWTOYS) 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KELLY DeGARMO 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Moms have spoken. They want toys that teach their children while
entertaining them. And toy manufacturers are delivering.
</P>
<P>
   Known as ``electronic learning aids,'' or ELAs, today's
electronic brain boosters drill kids about the alphabet, phonics,
animals, colors, numbers, spelling, geography and more.
</P>
<P>
   Housed in the form of plush dolls, mini-laptops or palm-size
toys, these electronic learning aids are activated by the push of a
button. Then the fun begins. Using voice technology, a toy designed
for infants might recite a color, letter or shape; a product for
elementary school-age children may quiz students on state capitals
and simple mathematics.
</P>
<P>
   The ELA products sold last year _ $200 million worth _ was up 20
percent from 1997, according to the Toy Manufacturers of America.
</P>
<P>
   Good news for consumers is that prices are coming down as
computer technology becomes less expensive, says New York toy
consultant Christopher Byrne, an editor for several trade
publications. Eight years ago, ELAs cost $40 or more; now some can
be had for $20 and under. And with the increasingly cheaper
technology, the field for age 6 months and older is getting
crowded.
</P>
<P>
   Age-appropriate ELAs are a good idea for most kids, but parents
shouldn't go overboard. ``You only need one or two,'' Byrne said.
</P>
<P>
   One way to pick an ELA is by brand, said Byrne. Industry leaders
include Educational Insights, VTech, Tiger Electronics, ToyMax,
Mattel and newcomer Leap Frog.
</P>
<P>
   Also, parents will soon be able to choose more ELAs linked to
licensed characters, such as Nickelodeon's popular ``Blue's
Clues.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, one of the most challenging parts of these toys is
getting kids to play with one, said Michael Wood, president of Leap
Frog, maker of the hot-selling Hug &AMP; Learn Little Leap. The plush
frog uses interactive games to encourage thinking and reasoning
skills for preschoolers. New this year is Hug &AMP; Learn Baby Tad for
little ones 6 to 24 months.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most innovative new product is the Leap Pad ($50),
an electronic reading pad that uses magnetic pen technology to
allow a child to interact with the book while reading it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want kids to be as excited about reading as they are about
Nintendo,'' said Wood.
</P>
<P>
   Eight book titles will be available, including favorites Richard
Scarry and Winnie-the-Pooh. The battery-operated electronic pad
folds up to be portable and comes with a headphone jack for travel.
These, like many of the new ELAs, are compact enough to be
portable, making them ideal companions for car trips, plane trips
and other excursions.

   Matt Groening told ``Entertainment Weekly'' that he doesn't want
critics to say that his new animated sitcom, ``Futurama,'' isn't as
good as that other show he created, ``The Simpsons.'' He thinks
that would be an unfair comparison, because ``The Simpsons'' is
perhaps the funniest sitcom ever.
</P>
<P>
   Fine. Matt Groening's new show, ``Futurama,'' isn't as good as
``The PJs.'' In fact, judging by its first episode (the only one
sent to critics), ``Futurama'' _ which aired Sunday night and airs
again April 4 before moving to Tuesdays at 7:30 p.m. beginning
April 6 _ could become to Groening what ``Leonard, Part 6'' was to
Bill Cosby: a huge comedy embarrassment.
</P>
<P>
   Could, but probably won't. One would think that Groening is too
smart and funny to not punch up the sometimes horribly stale jokes
in ``Futurama.'' Like this one: When the hero, Fry, awakes 1,000
years in the future, he's told that his only living relative is his
``Great-great-great-great-great-great-great ...
great-great-nephew.'' His response: ``Great!''
</P>
<P>
   Besides the spotty writing, the overriding problem with
``Futurama'' is that the show really isn't satire. (What are we to
relate to? That the New York Tube System sure is a wacky way to
travel?) It plays more like a man-out-of-his-element movie, most of
which (''Crocodile Dundee,'' ``Stripes'') depend on the charm of
their lead characters to engage us. In this case, Fry (voiced by
``Ren &AMP; Stimpy's'' Billy West), is so whiny and annoying that he
makes us cringe.
</P>
<P>
   The show begins showing us another rotten day in his dreadful
life as a pizza delivery boy. On his way to deliver a pizza (from
crank caller ``I.C. Weiner'' _ the first of several recycled
``Simpsons'' jokes) his bike is stolen and he finds out his
girlfriend is leaving him. The opening is so much like the first 10
minutes of ``Stripes'' you almost expect Fry to yell to his now
ex-lover, ``You can't go! All the plants will die!''
</P>
<P>
   The bogus address leads Fry to a cryogenics chamber, where,
during the New Year's Eve countdown, he inadvertently falls into
one of the chambers that freeze people. His timer is set for 1,000
years. The time-lapse scene out the window behind him offers one of
the few really good sight gags in the show.
</P>
<P>
   Once he's out, it's New Year's Eve, 2999. He meets Leela (Katey
Sagal), a ``Fate Assignment Officer.'' Seems everyone in the future
has their job destiny programmed into a chip and implanted into
their hand. That's why the future's slogan is, ``You gotta do what
you gotta do.'' Fry is scheduled to be a _ don't guess, now; it's
not fair _ a delivery boy! He rebels! He runs away, she follows.
</P>
<P>
   Hilarity does not ensue, though there are a few good lines. The
best such scenes come with the hard-drinking robot buddy Fry finds
when they both end up in a suicide booth together. (Sounds funnier
than it plays.) The robot, Bender, is depressed because his job,
bending girders, is so limiting. Not that he isn't good at it. As
he tells Fry while they're tossing back brews in a pub, ``I could
bend a girder to any angle: 30 degrees, 32 degrees ... (he takes a
swig, pauses, then says wistfully) ... 31.''
</P>
<P>
   That the show has little of the wit or even good crude humor of
``The Simpsons'' is inescapable. Especially because there are
several knowing winks toward the show in ``Futurama,'' including a
sighting of Blinky, the three-eyed fish that lived in the stream
near Mr. Burn's nuclear power plant. But do we really need to see a
guest shot of Leonard Nimoy, who made two such appearances on ``The
Simpsons''? (OK, technically only his animated head appears, but
you get the point.) And why in the world is there an Indian
character (Leela's boss) who speaks just like Apu if Groening is
trying to avoid comparisons?
</P>
<P>
   Groening may not like this, but facts are facts: A decade ago,
he created a brilliant show that began as an idea sketched on a
piece of paper five minutes before his interview with network
executives. Now, with 10 years to think about it, he has tried to
create what he describes as a ``sci-fi epic disguised as a
sitcom.'' It may get much, much better. We can hope. But if the
first episode is an indication, he failed _ it is barely sci-fi,
and a sitcom must have comedy to go with the wacky situations. Matt
Groening loves irony, so even he should appreciate that sometimes
success and riches can dull the impish genius that brought them
about in the first place.

REAGAN CASTS LONG SHADOW OVER GOP HOPEFULS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RON HUTCHESON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ His mind and body are gripped by Alzheimer's
disease, but former President Ronald Reagan's spirit infuses
Campaign 2000 almost as if he were on the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Although Reagan's place in history remains under debate, there's
little doubt about his status as a Republican campaign icon. Nearly
every GOP presidential hopeful is claiming a piece of Reagan's
political legacy. His picture appears on campaign Web sites. His
words are recited in speech after speech.
</P>
<P>
   Millionaire publisher Steve Forbes calls himself ``a Reagan
conservative.'' Sen. John McCain of Arizona boasts that he was `'an
early foot soldier in the Reagan revolution.'' Pat Buchanan, the
conservative firebrand, promises to ``complete the final chapter of
Ronald Reagan's legacy.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Vice President Dan Quayle, who served under George Bush,
a more recent Republican president, says he wants to ``resurrect
Ronald Reagan's vision of government.''
</P>
<P>
   Other candidates or likely candidates tout their service in the
Reagan administration. Elizabeth Dole served as Reagan's
transportation secretary after a stint as a White House aide.
Former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander's Internet resume says that
he headed Reagan's ``Commission to Celebrate Great Americans
Outdoors.''
</P>
<P>
   (News reports from the time indicate that the panel was actually
called the Commission on Americans Outdoors.)
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the search for another Reagan has led some
Republicans to the one likely candidate who rarely mentions him:
Texas Gov. George W. Bush. Many of Bush's boosters contend that he
is the party's best hope for reuniting the coalition of economic
and social conservatives that helped Reagan win two White House
terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Bush is a phenomenon in California we haven't seen
since Ronald Reagan,'' said California Assemblyman Keith Olberg,
one of a number of recent visitors to the Governor's Mansion in
Austin. ``He understands what America is all about, what the
founding of this country is all about. He's absolutely,
passionately committed to it. People get that from him.''
</P>
<P>
   But comparisons to Reagan cut both ways for Bush, whose father
was never fully trusted by some Reagan conservatives. Conservative
activist Brent Bozell III, who is backing Forbes, said Bush's quest
for the Republican nomination will hinge on his ability to prove
himself a worthy Reagan heir.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Bush were to make a determined and believable appeal to the
conservative base, it would be very difficult for anybody to beat
him,'' Bozell said. ``He's putting a lot of people in his camp who
never understood the conservative movement. To the degree that he
listens to them, he will find himself in trouble very fast.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who often jokes that he inherited half his father's
friends and all his enemies, speaks of his parents with obvious
affection. At the same time, he has made it clear that his personal
devotion does not mean he walks in lock step with his father.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not the candidate. I am,'' Bush told the national news
media in declaring his interest in the White House and forming an
exploratory committee for a possible presidential bid.
</P>
<P>
   When asked in an interview to name three political heroes
besides his father, Bush put Reagan at the top of the list, in
front of Winston Churchill and Theodore Roosevelt. He said Reagan
played a pivotal role in ending the era of big government that
began with Franklin Roosevelt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ronald Reagan was president in a defining moment in history,''
Bush said. ``He ended the Rooseveltian era (by) putting government
in its proper perspective. The government's role is to herald the
individual and encourage individuals to reach their fullest
potential.''
</P>
<P>
   But Reagan's legacy means different things to different people.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something of a Rorschach _ you see in it what you want,''
said Rod Hart, an expert on political communication at the
University of Texas at Austin. ``I don't think they mean they want
soaring deficits and break-the-back expenditures from the federal
government.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Reagan's admirers acknowledge that his accomplishments
sometimes fell short of his goals. He was an outspoken foe of big
government who watched the federal deficit balloon to record levels
during his eight years in office. He was an outspoken foe of
abortion who failed to win any significant victories for his
anti-abortion allies.
</P>
<P>
   His record on defense was more clear-cut. By almost any
yardstick, Reagan delivered on his promise to beef up the nation's
military. Conservatives also credit his hard-line approach with
hastening the breakup of the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   And even Reagan's harshest critics acknowledge the skills that
earned him the nickname The Great Communicator. Reagan, who turned
88 in February, is spending his final years in virtual seclusion,
but he remains a beloved figure for many Americans who identified
with his cheerful optimism.
</P>
<P>
   ``He believed in the American spirit. He believed in freedom. He
believed in the goodness of the American people,'' Forbes said in
an interview. ``No one can imitate Ronald Reagan. People would see
through that, but the spirit of Ronald Reagan is what people are
looking for.''

SCREEN PARTNER COAXES STEVE MARTIN INTO `OUT-OF-TOWNERS'
</HEADLINE>
 By MARLA MATZER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; LOS ANGELES _ ``The Out-of-Towners'' was a slight comedy the
first time around, when Jack Lemmon and Sandy Dennis co-starred in
the 1970 film about a middle-age couple menaced by a series of
misfortunes in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-nine years later, the new version _ based on the original
Neil Simon script, but this time penned by Marc Lawrence _ is still
basically a parade of harrowing events loosely strung together and
played for laughs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This movie is not a cure for cancer,'' star Goldie Hawn
admits.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even with (or especially with) light comedy, remaking is
hard to do. Hawn's co-star, Steve Martin, was quite aware of this
going in. The actor admits he was hesitant to take on the lead role
made famous by Lemmon. What convinced him?
</P>
<P>
   ``Goldie,'' he says simply.
</P>
<P>
   The two TV veterans (she cut her teeth on ``Laugh-In,'' he as a
comedian on ``The Tonight Show'') were first an on-screen couple in
1992's ``HouseSitter.'' That quirky romantic comedy portrayed Hawn
as a free spirit determined to loosen up the strait-laced Martin.
Now, they're reunited in a romantic caper comedy that stars Hawn as
a free spirit ... well, you get the idea.
</P>
<P>
   Those types don't seem too far from the mark. Both 53, the
actors have distinctly different personalities. Hawn comes
flouncing into an interview, wearing a tight mint-colored sweater
and no bra, talking freely about her most personal relationships.
She's an active, encouraging listener, often nodding and saying,
``good question.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin is buttoned-up in a sports jacket and slacks, and is very
reserved when interviewed. Even the movie's director, Sam Weisman,
admits he was a bit intimidated by Martin at first. ``He's quiet.
You think, maybe he doesn't like me,'' says Sam Weisman, who most
recently directed Brendan Fraser in the comedy hit ``George of the
Jungle.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin admits he's come a long way from his stand-up days, and
is a lot choosier about his work today. ``I'm at a place now where
I don't want to go to Edmonton for three months,'' says Martin. He
quickly adds, though, that for the right person and project, he's
willing to travel. ``When I did `The Spanish Prisoner' (the 1998
David Mamet film), believe me, I didn't mind going to the Florida
Keys.
</P>
<P>
   Hawn happily chats about her belief in psychics, and about
keeping her relationship with Kurt Russell fresh. ``We got a hotel
room the other night, just to change the surroundings,'' she
volunteers. By contrast, the raciest Martin gets is when he jokes
that the secret to his camaraderie with Hawn is ``no sex.''
</P>
<P>
   Opposites seem to attract in this case, and make for a natural
comedy team. ``I think it's apparent on the screen that we get
along well,'' Martin says. Even director Weisman was in on the
Martin-Hawn love fest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never had a bad moment ... making this movie was a very
wonderful, loving experience,'' says Weisman. ``There was never a
day I didn't look forward to seeing (Martin and Hawn), which is
something I haven't ever been able to say about actors before.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Weisman and Hawn say that even when Martin switches from
introvert to wild-and-crazy guy, the source of his humor remains a
mystery to them. Asked about his thoughts on this, Martin allows,
``Humor comes from so many different places,'' he said. ``It comes
from joy, it comes from anger, it comes from desperation.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin adds, though, that humor theory is not something he
discusses much with his fellow comedians. Asked whether he talked
about their profession with ``Monty Python'' veteran John Cleese,
who has a flashy supporting part, Martin replied: ``Martin Mull
once said to me that when painters get together, they don't talk
about painting. They talk about where they buy their brushes.''
</P>
<P>
   Cleese has a memorably Cleese-ian part as a snooty hotel manager
who turns out to be a secret cross-dresser. He employs the ``silly
walk'' of his ``Python'' days, as he struts in furs and stiletto
heels.
</P>
<P>
   Like Cleese, Martin has been known most notably for his physical
comedy, from his ``Happy Feet'' days to his remarkable role as a
man inhabited by the spirit of a woman in 1984's ``All of Me.'' In
``The Out-of-Towners,'' Martin does get to draw on this physical
humor, but also has to express the quiet frustration of the urban
white male, which Lemmon practically trademarked decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   Though at first reluctant to do the role, Hawn won him over.
``Goldie said, `We have to do this, because it's what so many
people are going through: Your children are grown, what do you
do?' &UR;  &LR; '' recalls Martin. ``So, I said, `OK, I'm going with you. I'm
going to trust your instincts,' &UR;  &LR; '' he continues.
</P>
<P>
   However, Martin admits a moment of doubt did flash across his
mind even as he took Goldie up on the challenge. ``But then I said,
`Goldie, if you tell me a year later, your psychic told you to do
this, I'm going to kill you,' &UR;  &LR; '' he says, mock-seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Hawn had the last laugh, though. ``After we did the movie, we
all liked it,'' Martin says, ``and it was !ital!then !off! that
Goldie, said, `That was &UR;  &LR; exactly what my psychic said would
happen.' &UR;  &LR; '' &UR;  &QL;

AUTHOR KEEPS HIS EYE ON THE Y2K CLOCK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ALAN WECHSLER  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Victor Porlier still remembers a cocktail party,
many years before anyone would coin the term Y2K, when he got his
first premonition of things to come.
</P>
<P>
   It was around 1968, and Porlier was helping to set up a
mainframe computer for the U.S. Agency for Economic Development. At
the party, someone told him how the high-tech IBM system would not
recognize the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good thing this is going to be fixed by the next
century,'' the man told Porlier. ``Otherwise it'll be hell.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, it's not hell. But it is expensive. The cost of solving
the so-called year 2000 problem is expected to climb into the
hundreds of billions of dollars, or higher, and all work may not be
done by Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Porlier (pronounced ``Por-lee-ay''), who lives near Albany
in upstate New York. Thirty years after that cocktail party
conversation, the former investment specialist and college
professor has become a Y2K guru. He recently published the book
Y2K: ``An Action Plan for Jan. 1, 2000,'' a manual for preparing
for Y2K's worst-case scenarios.
</P>
<P>
   Computer specialists fear that many computers originally
programmed to recognize only the last two digits of a year will
fail or malfunction on Jan. 1, 2000, when the machines will assume
it is 1900.
</P>
<P>
   In the past few months, Porlier has gone from founder of the
nonprofit Center for Civic Renewal to a Y2K spokesman in demand
across the country.
</P>
<P>
   He estimates that spreading his message on Y2K consumes about 25
percent of his frenetic work schedule. And that message, he says,
is ``be prepared.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's now clear that this is a real problem,'' Porlier said.
``It is not hype. And there is very deep concern all over the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem also affects computer chips in factories and
machinery all over the world, although many say the problem will be
fixed in time for next year.
</P>
<P>
   What scares some people is the idea that crashing computers will
have a domino effect. Though many technology specialists disagree,
some believe Y2K crashes could cause power blackouts, shipping
problems, food and medicine shortages and perhaps even a
stock-market crash _ in short, a disaster on a global scale.
</P>
<P>
   Porlier's book is like a giant list: what kind of food to stock
up on, how to get your finances in order, how to make sure your
family is safe and can stay warm and remain in good spirits if the
power goes out.
</P>
<P>
   The publisher, HarperCollins, has printed 100,000 and will soon
print a second batch.
</P>
<P>
   Porlier, 61, makes no recommendation for how much food to
stockpile. Instead, the book lists the type of food that stocks
well and how to be ready to cook it and eat it while staying
healthy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people aren't doing anything and some are heading for the
wilderness,'' he said. ``Each person has to make their own judgment
call.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Porlier first realized how serious Y2K was. He was at a
seminar at Cambridge and Oxford universities and spent nearly every
night on the Internet. He was amazed how many Web sites were
dedicated to Y2K, and most of them spoke of bad things to come.
Porlier started to research the problem. In February 1998 he began
writing a weekly column for John Westergaard's Year 2000 Web page
(http://www.y2ktimebomb.com) one of the oldest and most popular Y2K
sites on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   People were starting to pay attention. Porlier received from 40
to 60 electronic mail messages a day from readers, many asking how
they should prepare. Finally, he decided to write the book,
reprinting some columns and adding new information.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's done an excellent job,'' said Norman Kurland, a
member of the group Computer Professionals for Social
Responsibility. The group is dedicated to keeping people from
panicking about Y2K and other technology issues. But not everyone
shares Porlier's pessimism.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a more extreme approach than is probably necessary,''
said Cliff Kurtzman, president and chief executive of Houston-based
Internet marketing company Tenagra Corp. ``The amount of stocking
up you would reasonably do to support Y2K isn't too much different
than what you might do for a blizzard, or a three-day holiday
weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   Tenagra publishes the popular Y2K Web page run by Peter de
Jager, a Canadian computer specialist who helped bring Y2K to the
forefront. On March 1, de Jager announced that Y2K doomsday had
been avoided because so many countries were finally paying
attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've broken the back of Y2K,'' he wrote.
</P>

</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Don Meyer, a spokesman for the U.S. Senate's Y2K committee, said
the committee advocated that people speak to doctors, pharmacists,
bankers and others before determining how much, if any, Y2K
preparations are needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not of the mind-set that people need to stockpile for a
long time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Emergency Management Agency says three days supply
of food and supplies is enough to weather any Y2K problems. The
American Red Cross says a week, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police
advocate two weeks and certain hurricane-prone municipalities in
Florida are saying even longer.
</P>
<P>
   As for his own family, Porlier says he has enough of a cache to
keep him and his wife, Lois, warm and fed for six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Porlier's own New Year won't be too exciting. He plans to sit by
a short-wave radio, listening to reports all over the world about
what's happening as the day progresses.
</P>
<P>
   And if Y2K turns out to be nothing but hype? That'll make up the
subject of Porlier's next book: ``What we've learned from this, and
what we should do in the future,'' he said. ``There'll be a lot of
postmortems on this.''

IT'S NOT TOO LATE FOR THE `LATE, LATE SHOW' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TIM GOODMAN  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ When Craig Kilborn walks onstage Tuesday night
as the host of CBS' ``The Late, Late Show,'' it's not just going to
be a ceremonial passing of the baton from Tom Snyder to the new kid
on the block.
</P>
<P>
   It's going to be a historic exchange _ the hip, wired age
breaking away from the industrial era as the millennium approaches.
</P>
<P>
   Kilborn and Snyder offer two very different styles.
</P>
<P>
   Kilborn has more potential than many people give him credit for,
a man who could not only be ``the next Letterman,'' but the brand
new model of the 21st century talk show host.
</P>
<P>
   In that respect, he's closer to Snyder than anyone imagined
because both are originals.
</P>
<P>
   Snyder is an odd, fascinating man on his own _ often more so
than the people he interviewed.
</P>
<P>
   In 1973, when he hosted a throwaway programming idea called
``The Tomorrow Show,'' he was an eye-opener. The hair, the
eyebrows, the mannerisms, the vocal tics, the homespun personal
view of television and its connection to the people on the other
side of the screen _ a trademark right up until the end.
</P>
<P>
   Snyder has always been a sort of misunderstood visionary, a guy
who could talk your ear off and simultaneously keep you interested,
then as you drifted back to your inner thoughts as he kept yakking,
you'd say, ``This guy is unbelievable.'' His style kept people
watching.
</P>
<P>
   But talk has gone in many directions since Snyder's debut.
</P>
<P>
   Johnny Carson became king because he made everything fun without
getting overly cerebral. He was a master at controlling the
interview and the audience simultaneously, a feat that hasn't yet
been equalled.
</P>
<P>
   Others have been amusing and erudite, like Dick Cavett. And then
we got a latter-day combination of Cavett and Snyder in the talky
Charlie Rose, but that was to be expected on PBS. Network
television evolved to a smoother, snarkier area with David
Letterman and Jay Leno, Arsenio Hall, Joan Rivers and Conan
O'Brien. They made Snyder more than a retro curiosity, they made
him nearly extinct.
</P>
<P>
   Newer viewers were used to a lot of sass and a considerable
dollop of irony with their talk. For them, to watch Snyder sit down
with a single guest and not have any Stupid Pet Tricks or video
shenanigans was tantamount to watching a silent movie.
</P>
<P>
   But that's the beauty of Snyder. He was and always will be the
old car that feels better, looks better and was more fun to drive
than this year's model.
</P>
<P>
   That, however, takes nothing away from Kilborn. Despite the
popularity of Nick At Nite and TV Land, television is not about
nostalgia, it's about moving forward, about digging the new breed.
And for all the hype about Jon Stewart being the Next Big Thing,
there's no question the future belongs to Kilborn.
</P>
<P>
   Provided, of course, he can harness his own immense potential
and craft it into a niche that people will not only love, but will
return to year after year. Give Conan credit for beating back death
and creating his own distinctive humor. Now it's Kilborn's turn,
and just watching this guy go under a spotlight as bright as ``The
Late, Late Show'' ought to provide fascinating viewing.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did Kilborn once stand out as the smarmy guy on ESPN's
benchmark sports highlight show, ``SportsCenter,'' his faux-smug
personality and his brand of thickly-dipped-in-irony humor
enlivened ``The Daily Show'' on Comedy Central. Granted, he can
alienate people who don't get the act and he's not above shooting
off his mouth in eye-popping ways, but Kilborn is a rollercoaster
ride of fun when he's on.
</P>
<P>
   The question isn't will he be on, but how soon. Here's a guy who
has worked in cable his whole life and is now going network on us _
to the most staid of them, CBS. Detractors may say that he can't
handle interview duties on his own, that he has the potential to
turn off more celebrities than Letterman (without the built-in fear
that they have to appear on the show or else).
</P>
<P>
   But forget about that. Look to Kilborn as an incredibly talented
new basketball star trying to make a name for himself in the
post-Michael Jordan landscape. Viewers may be sentimental and old
school at first, but time will tell them that the next generation
is upon us.

IT'S TIME TO DROP CUBA EMBARGO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PEDRO GOMEZ  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Editor's note: Baseball columnist Pedro Gomez, a
first-generation Cuban-American, describes his impressions of his
parents' homeland. He was in Havana for Sunday's historic
exhibition game between the Baltimore Orioles and the Cuban
National Team.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   HAVANA, Cuba - Dear President Clinton,
</P>
<P>
   My name is Pedro Gomez, and I am a first-generation
Cuban-American, born just three weeks after my parents arrived in
the United States in 1962.
</P>
<P>
   Because of my upbringing, it is not easy for me to say this
publicly, but you must do everything in your power to halt the U.S.
embargo against Cuba. It simply makes no sense whatsoever anymore.
</P>
<P>
   You see, I am making my first-ever visit to the land of my
roots. Cuba is no longer just an idea to me. It will forever have a
heartbeat now. After gazing into the eyes of the Cuban people, I
have discovered that I see so much of myself.
</P>
<P>
   I wish every Cuban exile living in the United States had the
opportunity to return and peer into the souls of the people here.
For it is they who give Cuba its strength and make this such a
beautiful country.
</P>
<P>
   For years, I thought of Rodolfo Fernandez-Guzman as an evil man.
He is the man who lived in the home above my parents', the one who
pleaded with them to keep me in Cuba, where I might one day become
a good communist. Just the idea of him was wretched.
</P>
<P>
   I met Guzman a few days ago, and although I had my preconceived
notions of him, they were nowhere near what I saw. He was a
charming gentleman of 84 years with a quick mind who greatly
reminded me of my maternal grandfather, to whom I was extremely
close. He was no monster, just someone who thinks differently.
</P>
<P>
   For so many Cubans living in the United States, it is easy to
stand on a platform and declare how the U.S. economic embargo must
never be lifted as long as Fidel Castro remains in power. I am
sympathetic to that point of view, having been raised with that
idea.
</P>
<P>
   All I can say is that after talking to regular everyday Cubans,
not the elite from the Communist Party, my feelings have changed
dramatically. It is so simple to dictate foreign policy from a
living room, but quite another when you actually encounter the
pained look in Cubans' eyes and absorb their impoverished
lifestyle, which could be eased with the lifting of the embargo.
</P>
<P>
   The Cuban people are not the enemy of Cubans living in the
United States. The enemy is Castro.
</P>
<P>
   Who is really being affected by this blockade, which was imposed
during the Kennedy administration? Certainly not Castro or his top
lieutenants. They continue to live their privileged lifestyles,
even as Cuba's economy crumbles since the loss of Soviet aid. I'm
talking about the person who must scramble each day to earn money
so that his family can eat well.
</P>
<P>
   The nationalistic pride of the common Cuban people is both
inspirational and admirable. I only wish some Americans could
realize what utterly fabulous lives we live and stop taking so many
of our liberties for granted.
</P>
<P>
   There are several reasons Cuba won't back down from its stance
as a socialist country. The first being that the government wields
unyielding power over the people, using scare tactics to remain in
control. But the second, which I believe is far more important, is
the tremendous and unwavering pride that Cubans possess. They will
simply not get down on their knees to beg, whether it be Cubans
living in Cuba or in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The one aspect of this trip that has opened my eyes more than
anything else is the incredible similarities between Cubans living
here and those of us in the United States. Among Latin Americans,
Cubans are considered somewhat arrogant. In fact, we are filled
with pride _ which is sometimes construed as arrogance _ at who we
are. It is arguably the single greatest gift handed down to each
new generation of Cubans, no matter where we call home.
</P>
<P>
   When all is said and done, it is that bullheadedness on both
sides that perpetuates the trade cutoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``By nature, I am not a political person,'' Abilio Valdes said
as he rocked in a chair sipping cool water on his mother's porch.
``All I ask is that we be given a chance without the embargo to see
what happens. If we drown, like so many believe, then OK, we can
say you were right, we were wrong. But if we can manage to survive,
then let us be.''
</P>
<P>
   It's the type of rhetoric that would get a person stoned on the
streets of Miami, where I grew up. I, too, was one who believed the
embargo should stand forever. Powerful Cuban-American lobbyists in
Washington have spent their careers keeping the embargo in place,
refusing to yield to Castro. But after putting faces behind what
for so many years were faceless, I cannot in good conscience
continue the same way of thinking.
</P>
<P>
   We deal with China and Vietnam and had civil relations with the
former Soviet Union. And who knows, maybe our softened stance with
the U.S.S.R. led to the crumbling of the Eastern Bloc. People far
smarter than me certainly believe so.
</P>
<P>
   The embargo has lasted nearly 40 years, and what has really
changed? Absolutely nothing. The embargo has not come close to
putting an end to Cuba's domestic problems, either in terms of
economics or human rights. It is time to try a different course.
</P>
<P>
   I have no idea what my father, mother and brother will think of
me after they read this. For that matter, many of my friends in
Miami may abandon me for what I am saying. I do know, though, that
for the most part, they have not had the same opportunity I have
had this past week, of walking through the streets of Havana and
getting to know the Cubans here.
</P>
<P>
   What makes Cuba so very special is its people. Even as I write
this, I can barely contain myself, for now that I have met what I
consider my countrymen, I can't help but feel an overwhelming sense
of pride to say I am both Cuban and American. In a way, I feel I
have been twice blessed.
</P>
<P>
   I am not _ I repeat not _ a Castro sympathizer. His regime has
undoubtedly committed many atrocities. I believe he is a
contemptible person who has single-handedly guided a once-thriving
country into the gutter. The question now is, what to do to rectify
that?
</P>
<P>
   A bold man would have the vision to do the right thing, not what
a group of powerful people insist he do. I have no idea how family
and friends will react to me now. I do know that after visiting
Cuba, it's time for a new game plan. &QL; 
Sincerely,
</P>

WHAT A TANGLED WIRE WEB WE WEAVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID HOYE  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - There's a problem with our wired world: wires.
</P>
<P>
   This fact was pointed out to me the other day by my wife, Mary.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is that pile of junk down there?'' she asked, as we slid
my computer table away from the wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ah, wires,'' I answered, wondering where the conversation was
going.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe this mess,'' she continued. ``Haven't you ever
heard of wire management?''
</P>
<P>
   I must admit that I, too, was a bit amazed at the tangle of
black, gray and white wires that sat, twisted and ugly like some
lazy python, against the wall.
</P>
<P>
   When I set up my computer, I distinctly remember carefully
running each of those wires between various pieces of equipment. I
avoided tangles, and made sure none of the wires wrapped around
anything, like a table leg. I even coiled and lightly bound wires
that were extra long.
</P>
<P>
   Several months later, it looked as though a gremlin had done the
wiring job. I couldn't even tell where some wires connected. I'd
start at a plug and work backwards, only to get lost in a jumble of
plastic between the surge protector and my computer.
</P>
<P>
   How did this happen?
</P>
<P>
   That's what my wife wanted to know, as we set into position a
nice, new computer table, which, unfortunately, revealed more of
the wire nightmare than the old table.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's this connected to?'' Mary asked, gripping a slim black
wire.
</P>
<P>
   ``My speakers,'' I said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you really need them?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ack! Of course!'' I answered.
</P>
<P>
   And so my afternoon went.
</P>
<P>
   Now, a week later, I sit at my machine writing this column.
Everything appears to be working OK, which means we got all the
wires plugged back in properly. And, I must admit, ``wire
management'' and a few of those plastic wire ties really made
things look nice.
</P>
<P>
   Well, perhaps not nice. But better.
</P>
<P>
   How long will the organization last? I'm not sure, but I think I
already hear gremlins giggling . . . &QL; 
 &QL; 
MP3 making lots of noise
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Since I last wrote about MP3, the file compression format used
to distribute music via the Internet has really taken off.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's incredible. It's astounding,'' said Michael Robertson,
chief executive officer of San Diego-based MP3.com, perhaps the
biggest player in the MP3 music business.
</P>
<P>
   Now, I know that Robertson is in business, and it's his job to
talk-up MP3. But he offered statistics and information to back up
his assessment.
</P>
<P>
   First off, MP3.com is signing 125 new bands each day, Robertson
said. The Web site (www.mp3.com) already offers downloadable music
from more than 10,000 bands from around the world.
</P>
<P>
   MP3.com also is adding new functionality to its site. Last week,
for example, the site unveiled a new search function that allows
visitors to find the hottest bands from any given city. Previously,
searches could only be conducted by genre.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, MP3.com has become a record company _ of sorts.
Via its Digital Automatic Music system, artists can compile a list
of songs that MP3.com will put on CDs and sell. Artists have no
start-up costs, and they get half the CD-sales revenue.
</P>
<P>
   And, finally, MP3.com earned a major shot of respectability last
week, when Ted Waitt, chairman, CEO and co-founder of Gateway 2000
Inc., joined the MP3.com board of directors.
</P>
<P>
   What else is in store for the MP3 crowd? Robertson says
enthusiasts should expect ``MP3.com's Guide to MP3,'' a soft-bound
book, to become available next month. Expect sales via MP3.com and
Amazon.com. Retail sales are possible.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, Robertson predicted that this summer will see a
host of new MP3 hardware hit the market. He said different
companies are jumping into the business, and the goal is to get MP3
players out that can handle more than an hour's worth of music.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, MP3 lovers don't have much more than the Rio, a $200
Walkman-like portable player that has memory enough for about 60
minutes of music. They're on sale at various electronics stores,
including CompUSA.
</P>
<P>
   All is not rosy for MP3, however. Despite legitimate
applications such as those employed by MP3.com, the MP3 technology
is considered by the established music industry to be little more
than organized piracy, because of the ease of which it allows
anyone using free software from the Internet to rip music off
traditional audio CDs, compress them into the MP3 format and
redistribute them via rogue Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   And a recent survey by the Recording Industry Association of
America will likely fan the fires of anti-MP3 sentiment. The
survey, released last week, found that 15- to 24-year-olds are
buying less music, something the survey partly blamed on MP3.
</P>
<P>
   ``The continuing drop-off in the proportion of purchases
accounted for by 15- to 24-year-olds (32.2 percent in 1996 vs. 28
percent in 1998), once the mainstay of the market, is puzzling,''
the report states. ``Potentially the rise of the Internet as a free
entertainment center, and the accompanying availability of free MP3
music files, could be contributing factors.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps spurred by such findings, the recording industry
intensified its attack on MP3. Last week, the International
Federation of the Phonographic Industry launched legal proceedings
against the Norwegian partner of Lycos.
</P>
<P>
   Lycos (www.lycos.com) is a popular U.S.-based search engine
site. Over the past few months, it has launched FAST MP3 Search
(mp3.lycos.com), which can instantly link users with tens or
hundreds of Web sites offering MP3 files for download.
</P>
<P>
   It's my guess that if MP3 continues to grow in popularity and if
the format isn't replaced by something better, the recording
industry will take over and dominate the MP3 distribution business
within a year. It'll be the old ``if you can't beat 'em, join 'em''

WHY AMERICA SHOULD CARE ABOUT THE WORLD BEYOND 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By HARRY ROSENFELD  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ It is striking how much debate followed the NATO
aerial assault on Yugoslavia compared to how little preceded the
fateful decision.
</P>
<P>
   Warnings of drastic action, specifically bombing, issued by both
President Clinton and British Prime Minister Tony Blair weren't
seriously heeded during weeks of negotiations on some form of
truce.
</P>
<P>
   In part, the lack of debate may have been the natural
consequence of the president frequently invoking the use of force
during the tedious negotiations. Again and again, he threatened
that the European allies, all 19 of them in NATO, would use air
power to force the Serbians in Yugoslavia to accept a compromise
over the future of the province of Kosovo, assuring the cessation
of brutal attacks by the Serbians on the ethnic Albanians who live
there.
</P>
<P>
   In part, the lack of debate may have resulted from the
complexity of the rights and wrongs on either side, and the
difficulty of sorting out grievances of such ancient vintage that
they go back many more years than the United States is old.
</P>
<P>
   The fact remains that there was only modest discussion and
dispute about whether or why the United States might unleash its
military might against Yugoslavia. There was hardly a political
debate in the halls of Congress, and certainly the American people
were not seen to be caught up in the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Today, all that is different. Congress resounds with expressions
of criticism and warnings of failure for a policy that is seen by
presidential critics as ill-defined. Warnings of another Vietnam
abound with questions forcefully posed about now that we are in it,
how do we intend to get out?
</P>
<P>
   Opinion polls reflect the uncertainty among the public about the
course upon which this country is embarked, with the president
receiving relatively modest and tentative support for his policy.
</P>
<P>
   In making his best case for the intervention, Clinton painfully
spelled out the details of the situation on the ground, putting it
into the context of the historical role the tempestuous Balkans
have played in the history of this bloodiest of centuries.
</P>
<P>
   He needed to do so, because the American people, in their
aggregate, appeared to know so little about it, and cared even
less.
</P>
<P>
   For that, much of the blame must be borne by the mainstream news
media, electronic and print, which did not much to inform their
viewers and readers about the issues when there was time. It isn't
that there was no reporting, because there was some. Looking back,
with honorable exceptions, it was comparatively modest, nothing
compared to what Monica and Bill received even on a dull day in
their year-long saga.
</P>
<P>
   Peering out from the inside of the media beast, this appears to
be largely the result of marketing strategies that command that the
local news dominate, out of concern that nothing else will interest
the audience. The rubric that ``all politics is local'' has its
clone in journalism.
</P>
<P>
   What this has meant is that local concerns came to dominate
American news, because that is where the audiences are to be found,
and all the good things like popularity and higher profits that
come with it.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, happenings in far-off places have received
shrinking attention, even among such publications as the New York
Times. For all this time, foreign news journalists diminished in
number, overseas bureaus were closed or reduced in size, and ever
smaller parts of the daily newspaper paid attention to what was
happening in other countries.
</P>
<P>
   The exceptions only came when a major crisis flared. Then the
foreign news would fight its way onto the front pages and the leads
of telecasts, just as it has with the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
   By this time, there has been a great transformation: the foreign
has become the local. American military personnel are dispatched
into combat. The happenings in distant places appear to be much
closer to our local concerns than earlier would seem possible.
</P>
<P>
   It serves this nation little to be self-absorbed and live
indifferently to what transpires in remote parts of the world. It
is an indulgence, in cultural and intellectual terms. It should be
practical to care both about those things that impact us
immediately while not being indifferent to the greater world.
</P>
<P>
   The least we should do for ourselves is to arm ourselves with
the necessary background to give us some awareness of what is
happening and why, before history bites us in the back.

WHO CARES ABOUT SERBIA? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ It was a perfect afternoon, and I tried to find
someone who cared about the war against Serbia instead of sunshine
or the rising price of gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   No luck in my household. ``It's another Clinton thing,'' said my
wife, who is as cynical and isolationist as any American. ``I won't
care until the bombs start falling in my back yard.''
</P>
<P>
   I called the Marine Corps recruiting office to see if kids were
enlisting to fight Serbs. The recruiter told me no one was signing
up for that particular cause.
</P>
<P>
   As I walked to Market Street I heard chanting. ``Peace Now!''
yelled hundreds of people in Hallidie Plaza waving an unfamiliar
foreign flag. Ah, Serbian Americans, I thought. I'll go interview a
few.
</P>
<P>
   As I got closer, I wondered why so many black people were
demonstrating against U.S. intervention in Serbia. Then I got even
closer and read the signs that said, ``Peace in Eritrea.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a demonstration about another war in a place most
Americans don't know much about. Eritrea is a former province of
Ethiopia. The two countries are well-armed and killing thousands of
each other's troops over disputed territory.
</P>
<P>
   ``We accepted the peace accords and the Ethiopians didn't,''
said Negusee Gidey, one of the marshals who was guiding Eritrean
Americans across traffic.
</P>
<P>
   So many civil wars, so few Americans paying attention.
</P>
<P>
   If America really is policeman to the world, we're not doing a
very good job. The world is a giant bar fight raging around us,
while we try to put the cuffs on one of the bigger creeps.
</P>
<P>
   In the reference room of the main library here, I asked
librarians Dennis Maness and John Nelson if they had an atlas
showing Kosovo and Serbia. They found a 1997 ``World Atlas'' that
had a map of Yugoslavia, but no outlines of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The atlas cost $60 but can't be revised fast enough to keep up
with the world.
</P>
<P>
   The librarians said no one had come in asking where Kosovo is on
the map. The last question they got on Yugoslavia was before the
bombing, when a woman called wanting to be filled in on the history
of the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   It was a little hard to do, especially over the phone.
</P>
<P>
   Librarians are circumspect, but Nelson felt strongly enough to
say, ``It's this new thing, that our government bombs countries
whenever it wants. It's a new American right.''
</P>
<P>
   The government never asked us either. It's as if they're
counting on us not paying attention to these modern high-tech wars
in which no Americans are supposed to die.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there's hell and the media to pay if American pilots
are dragged through the streets of countries we can't find on a
map.
</P>
<P>
   As I walked through United Nations Plaza, named for an
organization whose goals seem rather quaint, I talked to a few guys
on a park bench about the war against Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't been following it. I don't have a TV,'' said one
man.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a war right here in this plaza, a war with the
police. They started my career in crime,'' he said, ``first
arresting me for sleeping on a bench, then sending me to jail.
There's a lot worse problems in the world than that war.''
</P>
<P>
   I guess when you're living under a bridge, you think a lot more
locally than globally.
</P>
<P>
   At Pioneer Army-Navy store on Market Street, there wasn't a run
on military gear. Most of it is bought by pacifists anyway.
</P>
<P>
   When I asked the bored salesman where they got their stuff, he
said, ``Some war we had.''
</P>
<P>
   Let's hope Gulf War desert camouflage isn't joined on the rack
by Kosovo mountain camouflage.
</P>
<P>
   A few storefronts down Market is the office of Swords to
Ploughshares, a veterans' rights group that assists homeless
veterans. Behind the counter, answering the phones, was a man who
cared and knew about what was going on in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Hanson, a former helicopter door gunner in Vietnam, spoke
almost Socraticly, posing everything as a question _ which seemed
appropriate when speaking of the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   ``What if people are fighting a 16th century religious war with
20th century weapons? What are we supposed to do?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do people want America to be the world's policeman or not? We
have 14 carrier groups, what does that mean?'' Hanson wondered
about the different interests of the military, the State
Department, big business and the Clinton administration. It all
seemed to be out of our hands, anyway, we agreed.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of our conversation, the former First Cav door gunner
had to take a call from a veteran with problems. His last words to
me were sympathy for a Yugoslavia torn up by Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's real sad that this country which almost made it into the
First World has to have this happen to it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   I walked out into the sun, where people talked about the high
price of gasoline.

SUCCESS LEADS TO TROUBLES FOR ON-LINE BROKERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDs: Note optional trim)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By EDWARD IWATA  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Thousands of consumers have been hurt by recent
system crashes and delays that have plagued on-line brokerages, and
lawsuits filed against ETrade Group Inc. highlight the growing
pains of the young Internet brokerage industry.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the case of Chris Miller, 31, a software developer in
San Francisco. His electronic trading saga turned ugly almost
immediately after opening an account with ETrade Group Inc. in Palo
Alto. Like a kid in a candy shop, he logged on Feb. 4 and bought
$7,700 worth of shares in Intel, Microsoft and Sun Microsystems.
</P>
<P>
   A few moments later, Miller clicked on ETrade's Web site,
looking for his orders _ nothing. He checked his portfolio _
nothing. He looked for an e-mail from ETrade, confirming the orders
_ nothing. He called ETrade, but gave up after waiting on hold for
45 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   With no sign that his trades had gone through, he replaced the
orders four hours later. The next day, he checked his account. The
shocked Miller discovered his orders had been processed twice _ to
the tune of $15,400.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was quite miffed, very mad,'' Miller said. ``It even showed
my account had a negative balance.''
</P>
<P>
   After waiting on the phone for an hour, Miller reached an ETrade
representative, who agreed to cancel his second set of trading
orders.
</P>
<P>
   But Miller was angry enough to join one of two potential
class-action lawsuits filed against ETrade earlier this year in
Santa Clara County Superior Court.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuits allege that ETrade's trading system crashes, which
have occurred several times since 1997, have cost its customers
money. The suits also accuse ETrade of misleading consumers in its
$25 million marketing campaign, which promised fast, 24-hour stock
trading via the Internet _ even when ETrade knew its computer and
telephone systems could not handle heavy trading during peak hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``ETrade is a marketing machine that hasn't lived up to its
fiduciary duty to customers,'' said Seth Lesser, a lawyer at
Bernstein, Litowitz, Berger &AMP; Grossmann in New York who represents
Miller. ``I'm convinced that tens of thousands of customers have
lost money.''
</P>
<P>
   ETrade did not return calls for comment on the lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly every on-line brokerage house _ Charles Schwab Corp. in
San Francisco, Ameritrade Holding Corp. in Omaha, Neb., Datek
Online Brokerage Services Corp. in Iselin, N.J., and others _ has
been troubled by system breakdowns over the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   On-line brokerages are revolutionizing Wall Street. Internet
investing used to be the realm of technogeeks and professional
traders, but no more: Personal computers and on-line brokerages
have given every person the power to invest with the click of a
mouse.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, on-line brokerage accounts grew to 7 million with
$420 billion in assets, according to Piper Jaffray Inc., a
Minneapolis investment firm. Nearly one-third of all trades in
stocks and mutual funds were done on-line.
</P>
<P>
   As customers sign up in droves, technology problems are to be
expected, analysts say. No other on-line businesses are handling
the same rapid growth and volume of transactions as ETrade, Schwab
and others.
</P>
<P>
   ``They totally blow other sites away,'' said Larry Tabb, an
electronic commerce expert and group director at Tower Group in
Needham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   When on-line brokers launched their sites three years ago, they
woefully underestimated the public's interest in Internet trading.
The original technology wasn't designed to handle millions of
transactions.
</P>
<P>
   ``There really is no good traffic model now, and they're running
out of capacity more quickly than they thought,'' said Rob Enderle,
an on-line analyst at Giga Information Group in Santa Clara.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like building a dam and filling it to the brim,'' Enderle
said. ``You can model and test the heck out of it, but you won't
know whether the dam will hold until the water hits the top. ETrade
and Schwab are not used to building dams of this size.''
</P>
<P>
   Scared of bad publicity and losing customers, on-line brokerages
are frantically redesigning their systems. To handle the crush of
new investors, Schwab recently had an IBM mainframe rushed
overnight to San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a learning experience,'' Enderle said, ``and they're
improving.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ETrade has found itself in the spotlight because of its
high-profile ad campaign (``Someday, we'll all invest this way'')
and a big series of crashes last month.
</P>
<P>
   For three days _ Feb. 3, 4 and 5 _ ETrade's trading system
conked out for nearly four hours altogether. About 20,000 of
ETrade's 676,000 customers were affected. ETrade engineers blamed a
routine hardware and software upgrade ironically meant to speed up
customers' orders.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, ETrade spokeswoman Lisa Nash said the breakdowns
were glitches _ not major problems. ETrade still can handle up to
170,000 trades a day _ four times its daily average. The brokerage,
which will spend $75 million this year on new technology, also is
opening a third technology center near Atlanta that will triple its
trading capacity.
</P>
<P>
   With lawsuits pending and regulators studying the issue, though,
ETrade is playing it cautious. In a recent filing with the
Securities and Exchange Commission, ETrade told investors that its
trading system could slow or fail because of software problems,
power failure, human error or heavy stress on the system during
peak trading hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``There can be no assurance that we will be able to prevent an
extended systems failure,'' ETrade wrote. ``Any such systems
failure that interrupts our operations could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating
results.''
</P>
<P>
   It's unknown how many customers have fled electronic brokerages
because of the breakdowns. The crashes have been costly to some
firms, though. During its fiscal first quarter, Ameritrade took a
$3.1 million pretax writeoff to pay customers who lost profits from
delayed on-line trades.
</P>
<P>
   On the consumer and regulatory front, thousands of small
investors have flooded state and federal agencies with complaints
about the Internet brokers.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, the SEC, the National Association of Securities
Dealers and the North American Securities Administrators
Association _ the professional group for state securities
regulators _ are looking closely at the on-line brokerages.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to make sure the on-line brokers are keeping faith
with customers,'' said Mark Beauchamp, a spokesman for the North
American Securities Administrators Association. ``They're growing
very fast and advertising very aggressively, and we want to make
sure they're not promising more than they can deliver.''

<P>
   PARIS _ Slobodan Milosevic has again forced intermediaries to
extend the deadline for agreement on autonomy for Kosovo. This
adjournment poses more urgently than ever the question of
protection of civilian populations.
</P>
<P>
   Civilians have been forgotten in the negotiation process. Their
fate is being left exclusively to humanitarian aid organizations.
</P>
<P>
   The plight of Kosovo's civilians worsens by the hour as the
fighting between Serbs and the Kosovo Liberation Army escalates.
Once again, entire families are being forced to flee their
villages.
</P>
<P>
   Mobile clinics operated by Medecins du Monde in four
municipalities are assisting thousands of displaced persons, many
of them destitute, terrorized and exhausted after trekking for
several days without sustenance.
</P>
<P>
   These newly displaced persons join other thousands already in
the four towns, which were partly destroyed during Serbian
offensives last year.
</P>
<P>
   A study of the four zones by Medecins du Monde found that close
to 7,000 homes were destroyed. Yet 30,000 refugees were on hand
last month before the current influx.
</P>
<P>
   The health and food situation is extremely precarious. As many
as 50 men, women and children can be found sharing a single room.
They take turns sleeping and keeping warm.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the new arrivals say they had to leave elderly people or
invalids behind in their home villages. Some families have
abandoned their homes for the second or third time.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the displaced children are unable to attend school
because the schools are already overcrowded. Many show signs of
extreme anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   The uncertainty with which these people are confronted, as they
constantly fear a new attack, aggravates the general deterioration
of health.
</P>
<P>
   Medecins du Monde is trying as best it can to protect these
people. As a humanitarian organization, it cannot interfere in the
fighting or prevent the flow of displaced persons. It can only
provide health care and food, and let these refugees know that they
have not been completely forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   The civilians of Kosovo should not have to pay the price for the
slow pace of negotiations and the power struggle between Milosevic
and the international community.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a case of a disembodied diplomatic negotiation. The
lives of many thousands of people are at stake.
</P>
<P>
   Every day that passes without a political resolution results in
more displaced persons and heightens the humanitarian emergency in
Kosovo. &QL;

   PRAGUE _ The decision by NATO to bomb Serbian forces has
provided NATO's newest members with an abrupt test of their
commitment to the alliance.
</P>
<P>
   Already, leaders of the Czech opposition and the government of
Hungary, which borders Serbia and has a large ethnic minority
there, have expressed reservations about the air attacks.
</P>
<P>
   The Polish government and President Vaclav Havel of the Czech
Republic have expressed their full support for the action by the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first great test, not only of our government but
also of our political elites and of public opinion which has never
been enthusiastic for conflict,'' said Jiri Sedivy, deputy director
of the Institute for International Relations in Prague.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clear now what NATO is,'' said Jan Skorzynski, foreign
editor of the Polish newspaper Rzeczpospolita. ``The simple view in
Poland was that NATO was here to protect us, and now the moment
comes when we have to do something for others.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 10 years after they threw off over four decades of
Communist rule and left the Warsaw Pact, Poland, the Czech Republic
and Hungary became members of NATO on March 12, and the new
members' armies have been eager to show they are now firmly on the
Western side.
</P>
<P>
   Poland has established a joint army corps with two other NATO
members, Germany and Denmark, and pledged a parachute brigade to
any NATO peacekeeping force in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The Czechs, who have peacekeepers in Bosnia, have pledged a
field hospital to any new NATO force, despite some resistance from
the conservative opposition led by former Prime Minister Vaclav
Klaus, now chairman of the Czech Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking hours after Secretary-General Javier Solana ordered air
strikes on Serbian targets Klaus said he still favored a diplomatic
solution, saying it was necessary to ``remembers the pain and
suffering which is mostly borne by innocent people.''
</P>
<P>
   Senior members of Klaus's party also questioned the government's
offer of a field hospital to support NATO peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   But Havel said that while deciding to bomb was not easy, ``there
was no alternative.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The sovereignty and freedom of the Serbs must not be asserted
at the cost of suppressing human rights and at the cost of the free
development of other nations in Yugoslavia,'' he said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In Hungary, the only NATO member state to share a border with
Serbia, the government took a low-key approach.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Viktor Orban stopped short of endorsing the
raids, telling state-run radio only that ``there is no sign that
Hungary is in any danger'' and pledging not to deploy Hungarian
troops in Yugoslavia. However, Hungary agreed to open its air space
to NATO for the raids and to provide a field hospital in
Macedonia. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   The West has stumbled into one of its riskiest ventures since
the Second World War.
</P>
<P>
   It may pick itself up, and emerge standing proud and erect,
having been a decisive force for good. Or it may fall flat, with
NATO, its military club, weaker than at any time in its 50 years of
life, and the Balkans ablaze.
</P>
<P>
   To armchair strategists, bombing Serbia may not seem especially
risky. When NATO took to the air to strike the Bosnian Serbs, in
1995, none of the dire consequences predicted by doubters ensued;
in due course a peace treaty was signed, which has worked
remarkably well.
</P>
<P>
   Western aircraft now routinely bomb Iraq; they may not unseat
Saddam Hussein, but they appear to run no great risks.
</P>
<P>
   This latest operation, however, is not quite like those others.
First, it is NATO's first unambiguous attack on a sovereign state
that stands accused of being vile not to its neighbors but only to
its own people.
</P>
<P>
   Such behavior, offensive as it is, has long been considered the
prerogative of properly constituted governments. It is widely
practiced, and often without much more than a tut-tut from the
West.
</P>
<P>
   Where was NATO, for instance, when Russia tried to squelch the
Chechens, at a cost of 50,000-100,000 lives?
</P>
<P>
   This week's attack on Serbia may be the start of an admirable
new trend to restrain thugs and despots, though that does not look
terribly likely. What is undeniable is that the attack is something
new, and it could set an awkward precedent.
</P>
<P>
   How would the West respond if one day China, say, were to carry
out air strikes against an Indian government fighting to prevent
its Muslim-majority province of Jammu and Kashmir from seceding?
</P>
<P>
   Second, Serbia is better armed and militarily more sophisticated
than the Bosnian Serbs and even latter-day Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   In recognition of this, NATO's political bosses have drawn
exactly the wrong conclusion. Instead of maximizing their military
power, they have forsworn the use of ground troops, except to
uphold a peace agreement that may never come into being.
</P>
<P>
   Beguiled by technology, they may perhaps believe that smart
bombs and Tomahawk missiles can nowadays win military victories
without the help of foot soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Events may prove them correct. But right now, as the operation
begins, many military men say they are wrong, especially in the
terrain of Kosovo, where military targets and civilians are
inextricably mixed.
</P>
<P>
   Even in Iraq, where conditions are much more favorable,
sustained bombing has yet to produce an outcome satisfactory to the
West.
</P>
<P>
   In Serbia, if NATO was not prepared to commit itself fully and
wholeheartedly, it might have been better not to threaten to attack
at all, rather than to attack from the relative safety of the sky
alone.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, NATO's 19 members, despite their initial unity, are
deeply uneasy about the operation. Several _ including Italy, whose
proximity makes it valuable as a base from which to stage attacks _
are generally reluctant warriors unless they see some imminent
threat to their national security.
</P>
<P>
   Their hesitations have already encouraged Serbia's president,
Slobodan Milosevic, in his refusal to make concessions at the
negotiating table; they could yet curtail a military campaign that
should go on for weeks if it is to have any chance of achieving its
aims.
</P>
<P>
   And what are those aims? Ostensibly, just to put an end to
Serbia's brutal treatment of the ethnic Albanians who make up
nine-tenths of the population of the province of Kosovo, and to do
so without breaking up the country.
</P>
<P>
   But if the blunt instrument of bombing succeeds in this, it will
owe as much to luck as to precision.
</P>
<P>
   The hope must be that, after a mind-concentrating battery from
the air, discontented members of Serbia's armed forces will
speedily remove Milosevic and replace him with someone more
conciliatory. Or perhaps they might leave him in office, but
persuade him to come to terms with the West.
</P>
<P>
   It is also possible, however, that the Serbs will fight on,
possibly with greater determination than ever. If so, the Albanians
of Kosovo may well be killed or driven from their homes in ever
greater numbers.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, if the bombardment were to tip the balance of
power against the Serbs in Kosovo, the guerrillas there might well
exact horrible revenge on the Serb minority in the province.
Without ground troops, NATO would be hard put to stop this.
</P>
<P>
   What can the West do to increase the chances of success, however
defined? For a start, it can and should do its utmost to tell the
Serb people at large that the outside world bears no animus against
them; that in western eyes, and not just those of Russia, Serbia's
declared ally, their country is a pivotal state with an important
role to play in Europe; and that sanctions of all kinds will be
lifted as soon as it shows itself ready to behave decently.
</P>
<P>
   Since this sort of message cannot be conveyed through Serbia's
controlled press and radio, it should be broadcast from abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Other means should be used to undermine Milosevic. Montenegro,
Serbia's tiny sister-component in what remains of the Yugoslav
federation, should be encouraged to break free, even though it has
not been spared airborne attack.
</P>
<P>
   The Kosovars, however, should be told that the West is not
intervening to give them their independence, even though events, if
they spin out of control, may well lead ultimately to secession.
</P>
<P>
   In time, NATO may have to declare Kosovo, or at least a large
part of it, an area into which the Serb authorities should not
venture on pain of retribution, much as parts of Iraq have been
declared off-limits to those who do Saddam's bidding.
</P>
<P>
   But first the province will have to be rid of the Serb forces
that are concentrated there, and without, in so doing, turning its
capital Pristina into a slaughterhouse.
</P>
<P>
   None of this will be easy. At every turn lies the possibility
that fighting will spill over into nearby states, most of which are
an unstable cocktail of minorities.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps in time there can be a general redrawing of Balkan
borders, with Serbia losing Kosovo and gaining a bit of Bosnia. But
that must await a general cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the West has a war to fight. If it makes a mess
of it, NATO's 50th birthday party next month will be a sad affair.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, the world's diminished but by no means extinct band of
dictators will judge that they can, after all, treat their own
people as brutally as they like. &QL;

<P>
   Monetary policy is often likened to driving with a blacked-out
windshield, a wonky speedometer and a cracked rear-view mirror. But
at least a motorist knows that if he touches the brake or the
accelerator, the car will respond immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Interest rates are more complex. A rise in rates seems like a
tightening of policy and a cut like an easing; so keeping rates
constant seems ``neutral'' (i.e., neither stimulating nor reining
in the economy).
</P>
<P>
   This thinking is flawed _ a point America's Federal Reserve
should remember when its policy-making open-market committee meets
next week.
</P>
<P>
   Most commentators argue that the Fed does not need to raise
interest rates now because inflation remains low, making a neutral
monetary policy appropriate. But current policy is not neutral: it
is deliberately loose.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed, remember, cut rates three times last autumn, by a total
of three-quarters of a percentage point. Its justification was the
financial-market turmoil in the wake of Russia's default _ and
notably a sharp rise in credit spreads and a plunge in share
prices.
</P>
<P>
   Since last September, fears of a credit crunch have dissipated;
the Dow has risen by some 25 percent; and, rather than being harmed
by global economic slowdown, the American economy has grown even
more briskly than had been predicted.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, merely to return its policy stance to the position of last
summer, the Fed needs to nudge interest rates up again.
</P>
<P>
   It is true that real interest rates in America are above their
30-year average of 2 percent _ but that does not mean that policy
is tight. The appropriate interest rate depends not only on the
level of inflation, but also on the amount of slack in the economy.
</P>
<P>
   With GDP surging by an annual rate of over 6 percent in the
fourth quarter of 1998, and with unemployment unusually low, the
American economy is running well above its sustainable growth rate.
</P>
<P>
   In such circumstances, a small rise in interest rates is
equivalent not to stamping on the brakes, but to easing up slightly
on the accelerator. Keeping rates where they are amounts to driving
at a constant high speed even when the road ahead bends sharply.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, financial conditions are more lax than they seem. A
rise in share prices boosts spending in similar ways to a cut in
interest rates or a cheaper dollar. This is no small matter, given
that the assets of mutual funds overtook those of banks last year.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, taking account of the impact on the economy of higher
share prices, as well as last year's cuts in interest rates,
financial conditions in America are now at their most accommodating
since 1993, when the economy was crawling out of recession. Rapid
growth in America's broad money supply bears this out.
</P>
<P>
   Yet why worry when inflation remains low? Increased competition
and technological advances may have helped America's economy to
grow faster without pushing up inflation, but the drop in inflation
has also owed a lot to falling oil prices.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the recent rise in oil prices is not sustained, that
windfall is likely to disappear over the next year; so inflation
could well creep up.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, even if inflation in the prices of goods and services
remains subdued, lax financial conditions carry risks of their own.
</P>
<P>
   Asset-price inflation can harm the economy as much as
consumer-price inflation. It can distort the allocation of
resources by encouraging reckless spending, for example. The
combined saving rate of households and firms in America has already
fallen to its lowest level ever.
</P>
<P>
   There is, of course, a risk that a rise in rates might instantly
trigger a sharp fall on Wall Street, bringing America's economy to
a grinding halt and thus harming the world too.
</P>
<P>
   But American policy should not be seen in isolation: while the
Fed should be raising rates, the European Central Bank should be
cutting them, and Japan needs reflation too.
</P>
<P>
   For the Fed, in the longer run doing nothing is riskier still.
It is not the central bank's job to prop up an overvalued stock
market. &QL;

   Since last September, fears of a credit crunch have dissipated;
the Dow has risen by some 25 percent; and, rather than being harmed
by global economic slowdown, the American economy has grown even
more briskly than had been predicted.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, merely to return its policy stance to the position of last
summer, the Fed needs to nudge interest rates up again.
</P>
<P>
   It is true that real interest rates in America are above their
30-year average of 2 percent _ but that does not mean that policy
is tight. The appropriate interest rate depends not only on the
level of inflation, but also on the amount of slack in the economy.
</P>
<P>
   With GDP surging by an annual rate of over 6 percent in the
fourth quarter of 1998, and with unemployment unusually low, the
American economy is running well above its sustainable growth rate.
</P>
<P>
   In such circumstances, a small rise in interest rates is
equivalent not to stamping on the brakes, but to easing up slightly
on the accelerator. Keeping rates where they are amounts to driving
at a constant high speed even when the road ahead bends sharply.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, financial conditions are more lax than they seem. A
rise in share prices boosts spending in similar ways to a cut in
interest rates or a cheaper dollar. This is no small matter, given
that the assets of mutual funds overtook those of banks last year.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, taking account of the impact on the economy of higher
share prices, as well as last year's cuts in interest rates,
financial conditions in America are now at their most accommodating
since 1993, when the economy was crawling out of recession. Rapid
growth in America's broad money supply bears this out.
</P>
<P>
   Yet why worry when inflation remains low? Increased competition
and technological advances may have helped America's economy to
grow faster without pushing up inflation, but the drop in inflation
has also owed a lot to falling oil prices.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the recent rise in oil prices is not sustained, that
windfall is likely to disappear over the next year; so inflation
could well creep up.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, even if inflation in the prices of goods and services
remains subdued, lax financial conditions carry risks of their own.
</P>
<P>
   Asset-price inflation can harm the economy as much as
consumer-price inflation. It can distort the allocation of
resources by encouraging reckless spending, for example. The
combined saving rate of households and firms in America has already
fallen to its lowest level ever.
</P>
<P>
   There is, of course, a risk that a rise in rates might instantly
trigger a sharp fall on Wall Street, bringing America's economy to
a grinding halt and thus harming the world too.
</P>
<P>
   But American policy should not be seen in isolation: while the
Fed should be raising rates, the European Central Bank should be
cutting them, and Japan needs reflation too.
</P>
<P>
   For the Fed, in the longer run doing nothing is riskier still.
It is not the central bank's job to prop up an overvalued stock
market. &QL;

<P>
   Monetary policy is often likened to driving with a blacked-out
windshield, a wonky speedometer and a cracked rear-view mirror. But
at least a motorist knows that if he touches the brake or the
accelerator, the car will respond immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Interest rates are more complex. A rise in rates seems like a
tightening of policy and a cut like an easing; so keeping rates
constant seems ``neutral'' (i.e., neither stimulating nor reining
in the economy).
</P>
<P>
   This thinking is flawed _ a point America's Federal Reserve
should remember when its policy-making open-market committee meets
next week.
</P>
<P>
   Most commentators argue that the Fed does not need to raise
interest rates now because inflation remains low, making a neutral
monetary policy appropriate. But current policy is not neutral: it
is deliberately loose.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed, remember, cut rates three times last autumn, by a total
of three-quarters of a percentage point. Its justification was the
financial-market turmoil in the wake of Russia's default _ and
notably a sharp rise in credit spreads and a plunge in share
prices.
</P>
<P>
   Since last September, fears of a credit crunch have dissipated;
the Dow has risen by some 25 percent; and, rather than being harmed
by global economic slowdown, the American economy has grown even
more briskly than had been predicted.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ``There are no second acts in American lives,'' wrote Scott
Fitzgerald. But there is plenty of contemporary evidence that he
was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton is the archetypal comeback kid. Donald Trump once
again stands as tall and flashy as his buildings. Oliver North,
would you believe it, hosts his own television show.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the most intriguing example of all is Michael
Milken, the junk-bond king who symbolized the no-holds-barred
capitalism of the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   After serving a two-year prison term for breaking securities
laws, Milken is now back among America's movers and shakers.
</P>
<P>
   He oversees a fast-growing business empire and extensive charity
work and, as this month's conference at the institute that bears
his name confirmed, his ideas are taken increasingly seriously.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, Milken's life is the stuff of American myth. Born
on the Fourth of July, in 1946, to a modest Californian family, by
the mid-1980s he was a billionaire and one of the world's most
feared financiers.
</P>
<P>
   Working for a then modestly-sized investment-banking firm,
Drexel Burnham Lambert, he took on the Wall Street nobs by creating
a market for bonds issued by companies which, before, would have
been barely creditworthy enough to get a bank loan, let alone issue
bonds.
</P>
<P>
   By 1987, the value of these bonds had soared from nearly nothing
to $200 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Persistent investigations into Drexel's activities by an
ambitious young lawyer, Rudolph Giuliani, now New York's mayor,
eventually led Milken to plead guilty to six breaches of securities
law. He was fined over $1 billion and sent to jail, his reputation
destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Junk bonds had been heavily bought by savings-and-loan
companies; when junk-bond prices fell, many of these S&AMP;Ls went
bust, leading to a government bail-out that cost taxpayers billions
of dollars. Drexel Burnham Lambert went bust, too.
</P>
<P>
   Blame for much of this was laid at Milken's cell door, and worse
was to follow. Soon after leaving prison he was told he had
prostate cancer, and 18 months to live.
</P>
<P>
   Today he is alive and well enough to joke about looking forward
to watching the Rolling Stones when ``they're 85 and I'm 75.''
</P>
<P>
   He seems to be as energetic and hard-working as he was in the
1980s, and looks almost as youthful (thanks, in part, to ditching
his ghastly toupee).
</P>
<P>
   This recovery he attributes to meditation (he is, after all, a
Californian) and abandoning a diet as junky as his bonds for one
almost free of fat and meat.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Taste for Living Cookbook: Mike Milken's Favorite Recipes
for Fighting Cancer'' was published last September, with revenues
going to a charity, CaP CURE, for which he has already raised more
than $63 million for research into prostate cancer.
</P>
<P>
   A lifetime ban has prevented his returning to the securities
business. But he is developing another fast-growing enterprise,
Knowledge Universe, a ``cradle-to-grave learning company,'' founded
in 1997 with his younger brother, Lowell, and Larry Ellison, the
boss of Oracle, a software company.
</P>
<P>
   Its various activities, which span the largest vocational
training business in Britain, operating elementary schools in
Pennsylvania and LeapFrog educational toys, already generate sales
of $1.2 billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   Within the next few weeks, Milken will see if he can still sell
to Wall Street when he tries to float Knowledge Universe's
consulting arm, Nextera Enterprises, for an estimated $90 million.
</P>
<P>
   Were privatization to sweep through education as it has through
health care, business analysts reckon that Knowledge Universe might
well become the dominant brand.
</P>
<P>
   Judging by the turnout to hear him at this month's ``global
conference'' at the Milken Institute _ founded in 1991 _ his social
standing has been fully restored, too.
</P>
<P>
   Wealthy capitalists such as Rupert Murdoch and Mort Zuckerman
chewed the low-fat with four Nobel prize-winning economists and a
clutch of politicians in the same Beverly Hills hotel where Milken
once hosted a junk-bond conference called the ``Predators' Ball.''
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to imagine their European counterparts turning up to
honor a disgraced tycoon _ Ernest Saunders, say, or Jurgen
Schneider. But the Milken Institute is a serious outfit, a
nonprofit think-tank concerned (to quote the website) with ``the
global economy, capital markets...and the role of education and
human capital.''
</P>
<P>
   It is tempting to see Milken's life as a contemporary morality
tale: greedy capitalist bad boy redeems his life by devoting
himself to good works. Intriguingly, Milken does not see himself
that way.
</P>
<P>
   As he tells it, his current and former activities are different
aspects of the same mission he has been on since witnessing the
Watts riots in Los Angeles in 1965. Put simply, this is to extend
capital, in all its forms, to people with too little of it.
</P>
<P>
   He has even come up with an equation to prove the point,
P &QC; FT(HC+SC+RA):
prosperity equals financial technology (of which junk bonds are an
important part) times the sum of human capital (which will rise if
people are better educated, live longer) and social capital (which
the Milken Institute may help increase) and real assets (stocks,
bonds, property, and so on).
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, Milken's financial innovations are regarded much more
warmly now than they were in the 1980s. High-yield bonds (no longer
dismissed as junk) are credited with fueling much of America's
rampant economic growth, by enabling companies with bright ideas to
get the money they need to develop them.
</P>
<P>
   Some Wall Streeters reckon that Milken was jailed on
technicalities, after an investigation that makes Ken Starr's look
halfhearted. Some admirers of Milken even suggest that his
contributions to human well-being exceeded those of, say, Mother
Teresa, even before he switched his attention from finance to
healing the sick and educating the poor.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes America can seem too forgiving, especially of those
who are, or were, rich or famous enough to hire a good lawyer or
public-relations adviser. But Michael Milken shows it can pay not
to keep people down when they fall. &QL;

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Like the overgrown college kid he too often
resembles, Bill Clinton plunged into the Kosovo battle as though he
were cramming for exams.
</P>
<P>
   For months he had done his best to ignore this approaching test
of his leadership, preparing neither public nor Congress for the
possibility of war. Then, with the breakdown of peace talks in
France on March 19, the president scrambled to make up for his past
negligence.
</P>
<P>
   He called a press conference, his first in nine months. He
devoted a speech to Kosovo, even though his audience that day
happened to be a union group. And, in telephone calls, letters and
White House meetings, he pleaded for the sympathy of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   By the eve of Serbia's bombing, he had just about succeeded in
uniting America behind his policy. But only just.
</P>
<P>
   The president's first challenge was a House vote on Kosovo
policy on March 11. For reasons good and bad, the Republican
leadership seemed disinclined to support military action.
</P>
<P>
   Tom DeLay and Dick Armey, still smarting from the impeachment
battle, wanted to score electoral points. Christopher Cox, the most
sophisticated of the senior House Republicans, argued that the
president had not discharged his constitutional obligation to ask
Congress for money for his Balkan plans.
</P>
<P>
   The administration was so worried that it might lose the vote
that it pleaded for its postponement.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, a fifth of the House Republicans supported a tepid
resolution approving military involvement in Kosovo, narrowly
saving the administration from humiliation.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate proved still trickier. On March 19 Clinton invited a
few key senators over to the White House to press his case for
intervention, and on March 23 he did it again. He also wrote a
letter to Trent Lott, the Senate majority leader, who had earlier
drafted a resolution that would have barred money for air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   For a time, it seemed as though Clinton might have waited too
long to launch his charm offensive.
</P>
<P>
   Many senators were already on the record opposing intervention,
on the ground that America should on principle avoid getting
embroiled in civil wars, or that the president had exceeded his
prerogative by planning for war without consulting Congress first.
</P>
<P>
   When the vote came, however, the Senate shrank from pulling the
rug from under him. On March 23 it voted, 58 to 41, to support air
strikes.
</P>
<P>
   The House vote supporting military intervention was hedged about
with conditions and provisos: it required the president to explain
the precise nature of American interests in Kosovo, the cost of
intervention, his exit strategy, and so on.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate's support was just as qualified. Senator John McCain,
a Republican presidential aspirant, emphasized that he voted for
air strikes in order to produce unity in crisis, not because he
supported the president's policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congress and the American people have good reason to fear that
we are heading toward another permanent garrison of Americans in a
Balkan country,'' growled the senator.
</P>
<P>
   The half-support in Congress mirrored the mood in the country. A
Gallup poll taken just after the president's press conference
showed narrow support for air strikes: 46 percent favored them, but
43 percent were opposed.
</P>
<P>
   The same poll found that a clear majority (58 percent) believed
America had a moral obligation to help keep the peace in Kosovo,
whereas only a minority (42 percent) was persuaded that America
ought to get involved to protect its national interests.
</P>
<P>
   The striking thing about these findings, however, was the
contrast with the same poll a month earlier. The support for
intervention, and the belief in the various justifications for it,
had all strengthened.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, this strengthening was roughly proportional to the
rise in the percentage of respondents saying that they followed the
Kosovo question closely. The more Americans focus on foreign
policy, the more they are willing to accept its risks and costs.
</P>
<P>
   The polling data, together with the shift in favor of the
administration in Congress, pose an obvious question. If Clinton is
able to increase support for his policy by explaining it
energetically, why did he not do so earlier?
</P>
<P>
   The simplest answer is temperament: the president lacks the
discipline to work steadily on big issues, and so is reduced to
last-minute scrambling.
</P>
<P>
   But there is also a more complicated answer. On some issues, the
president's party and advisers are so divided that firm leadership
is not easy. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (150-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 750) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Such divisions certainly exist on trade, for example. Clinton's
economic team, led by Bob Rubin and Larry Summers at Treasury, is
by and large supportive of trade liberalization, whereas the
labor-union base of the Democratic Party is hostile.
</P>
<P>
   This explains why Clinton never made a convincing case for
fast-track trade-negotiating authority, which Congress consequently
blocked.
</P>
<P>
   On Kosovo, too, there are splits. Madeleine Albright, the
secretary of state, is a staunch interventionist. Richard
Holbrooke, the administration's chief negotiator with Serbia, ought
to be an ally, but his personal rivalry with Mrs. Albright gets in
the way.
</P>
<P>
   William Cohen, the defense secretary, plays up the potential
risks of bombing Serbia. The Pentagon top brass hates the idea of
getting embroiled in Kosovo peacekeeping, which it regards as
``social work.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather than impose unity on these squabbling parties, Clinton
kept his head down _ until crisis obliged him to sit up. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM; TOTAL UNCUT VERSION IS 1,100 WORDS) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Contemplating this chaos, Republican strategists are
increasingly inclined to make foreign policy an election issue.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's China policy has been tarnished by a spy
scandal; its support for Boris Yeltsin has not prevented Russia
from descending into chaos; it hardly pretends any longer to have a
policy on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   If the Kosovo crisis ends badly, Republicans reckon that they
have a powerful stick with which to beat Democratic foes.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the truth is that Republicans are as divided on foreign
policy as the Democrats. The Senate debate on Kosovo featured
virulent exchanges between Republican interventionists and
stay-at-homers; and most of the party's usual heavyweights ended
the debate sitting inelegantly on the fence.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign policy used to be an election winner for Republicans
because they were clear what they believed in. Now the party wants
to get tough on China but soft on Serbia; it wants to assert
American power, but only if there is a quick way out.
</P>
<P>
   How nice it would be if a change of team at the White House
could be counted upon to bring firmness to American foreign policy.
Alas, it cannot. &QL;

   DALLAS _ Along the busiest street in downtown Dallas, opposite a
billboard reading ``Who's the Father? Call 1-800-DNA-TYPE,'' there
is a message from a father of a different sort, one without a
genetic code.
</P>
<P>
   The sign reads ``What part of `Thou Shalt Not' didn't you
understand? _ God.''
</P>
<P>
   Farther down the road, another billboard carries a second
message attributed to the Almighty: ``You think it's hot here?''
</P>
<P>
   Since last month, similar black billboards with stark white
lettering have sprung up in more than 100 places about the city,
generally along Dallas's busiest roads. Drivers stuck in rush-hour
traffic may think twice before cursing the heavens in frustration.
</P>
<P>
   Begun in south Florida last September, the ``God Speaks''
advertising campaign was at first financed by a wealthy individual
(insisting on anonymity) who believes the American ship has tossed
its moral compass overboard.
</P>
<P>
   According to Andy Smith, whose advertising agency created the
messages, ``Our society these days is a mess of murder, rape and
adultery. God gave us rules, and it is His rules we need to live
by.''
</P>
<P>
   The signs are meant to be a lighthearted way to get people to
think about God as the day rolls by.
</P>
<P>
   The response from Florida and Dallas has been so positive that
billboard companies around the country have agreed to donate
millions of dollars' worth of space.
</P>
<P>
   In a press conference on March 16, the campaign's organizers
said their goal was to have 10,000 billboards in more than 200
American markets by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it may be that these messages from God are, as they say,
``preaching to the choir.'' According to Gallup, which tracks
worldwide trends in religious beliefs, the United States is among
the most devout nations of the industrialized world.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent Gallup poll, 63 percent of Americans said they
believe that religion can solve the vast majority of today's social
problems, a percentage which has remained stable for 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   Over 70 percent of Americans are members of a church or
synagogue, and 40 percent attend regularly, compared with only 12
percent in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it is a good thing, then, that the God Speaks campaign
will soon go international. Advertising agencies around the world
have expressed interest in bringing the billboards to other
countries.
</P>
<P>
   By next year, drivers in Europe, South America and Africa may be
starting their day with one-liners from the Almighty.
</P>
<P>
   The organizers of the campaign point out that the messages are
strictly non-denominational, and should have meaning to anyone who
believes in a Supreme Being. Among these people, at least, there is
at last hope for a worldwide decline in road rage. &QL;

   DALLAS _ Along the busiest street in downtown Dallas, opposite a
billboard reading ``Who's the Father? Call 1-800-DNA-TYPE,'' there
is a message from a father of a different sort, one without a
genetic code.
</P>
<P>
   The sign reads ``What part of `Thou Shalt Not' didn't you
understand? _ God.''
</P>
<P>
   Farther down the road, another billboard carries a second
message attributed to the Almighty: ``You think it's hot here?''
</P>
<P>
   Since last month, similar black billboards with stark white
lettering have sprung up in more than 100 places about the city,
generally along Dallas's busiest roads. Drivers stuck in rush-hour
traffic may think twice before cursing the heavens in frustration.
</P>
<P>
   Begun in south Florida last September, the ``God Speaks''
advertising campaign was at first financed by a wealthy individual
(insisting on anonymity) who believes the American ship has tossed
its moral compass overboard.
</P>
<P>
   According to Andy Smith, whose advertising agency created the
messages, ``Our society these days is a mess of murder, rape and
adultery. God gave us rules, and it is His rules we need to live
by.''
</P>
<P>
   The signs are meant to be a lighthearted way to get people to
think about God as the day rolls by.
</P>
<P>
   The response from Florida and Dallas has been so positive that
billboard companies around the country have agreed to donate
millions of dollars' worth of space.
</P>
<P>
   In a press conference on March 16, the campaign's organizers
said their goal was to have 10,000 billboards in more than 200
American markets by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it may be that these messages from God are, as they say,
``preaching to the choir.'' According to Gallup, which tracks
worldwide trends in religious beliefs, the United States is among
the most devout nations of the industrialized world.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent Gallup poll, 63 percent of Americans said they
believe that religion can solve the vast majority of today's social
problems, a percentage which has remained stable for 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   Over 70 percent of Americans are members of a church or
synagogue, and 40 percent attend regularly, compared with only 12
percent in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it is a good thing, then, that the God Speaks campaign
will soon go international. Advertising agencies around the world
have expressed interest in bringing the billboards to other
countries.
</P>
<P>
   By next year, drivers in Europe, South America and Africa may be
starting their day with one-liners from the Almighty.
</P>
<P>
   The organizers of the campaign point out that the messages are
strictly non-denominational, and should have meaning to anyone who
believes in a Supreme Being. Among these people, at least, there is
at last hope for a worldwide decline in road rage. &QL;

   BELGRADE _ Just ten days short of its 50th anniversary, the
Atlantic alliance has gone into battle with a medium-sized European
country, while vowing to protect all other states in the
neighborhood from the fallout.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of starting with pinpricks, dozens of NATO aircraft
began a spectacular bombing campaign on the night of March 24 with
raids on airfields and arms factories near Belgrade, Serbia's
capital, and targets near Pristina, capital of Serbia's already
battered southern province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Cruise missiles were launched from air and sea. Bombs also fell
on Montenegro _ Serbia's reluctant junior partner in the rump state
of Yugoslavia _ dashing its hopes of being spared.
</P>
<P>
   NATO raids continued on March 25.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the week, Javier Solana, the NATO secretary-general,
had promised on the allies' behalf to ``disrupt'' Yugoslavia's war
against Kosovo's ethnic Albanians and their villages.
</P>
<P>
   The scale of the latest repression ordered by Yugoslavia's
president, Slobodan Milosevic, convinced even NATO's doubters _
France, for one _ that something had to be done.
</P>
<P>
   His forces have uprooted at least 65,000 people in the past
month, bringing to 250,000 the number now homeless in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But right from the start there was confusion about NATO's
precise purpose and legal justification.
</P>
<P>
   As the bombs started falling, President Bill Clinton said the
raids were intended to demonstrate NATO's ``opposition to
aggression''; to deter further attacks on civilians; and ``if
necessary'' to damage Serbia's capacity to make war.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the first wave of bombs was intended as a
warning _ and only if it were ignored would NATO start seriously
destroying the Yugoslav arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   Solana, for his part, suggested that Serbia was being punished
for its refusal to accept a settlement in Kosovo and let NATO
police it. He also stressed, however, that the alliance ``was not
waging war against Yugoslavia'' and had no quarrel with its (mainly
Serb) people.
</P>
<P>
   In practice, the distinction between warnings and war could
vanish from sight if the conflict develops into a broader test of
wills between the western alliance and Serbia's power broker.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's trump cards include vast firepower and fairly solid unity
of purpose in its own ranks.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic, for his part, will be banking on his own people's
greater willingness to accept and inflict casualties _ and on the
fact that all nations, even exhausted and divided ones, tend to
rally around the flag when under attack.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav government (which formally speaks for Serbia and an
increasingly restive Montenegro) has given grim warnings to
Romania, Albania, Bulgaria, Hungary and Macedonia not to take part
``directly or indirectly'' in any NATO actions.
</P>
<P>
   Of these countries, only Hungary (one of three ex-communist ones
to join the alliance last month) is covered by NATO's mutual
defense guarantee.
</P>
<P>
   But NATO has told the other four _ plus Slovenia _ that it would
view a Yugoslav attack on them very gravely.
</P>
<P>
   The reassurance is timely: Macedonia is host to 12,000 NATO
troops, in range of Serbian artillery fire.
</P>
<P>
   As NATO's aircraft revved up their engines, the Yugoslav
leader's first moves were to complete a purge of the security
forces, and silence the voices of domestic opposition.
</P>
<P>
   The army's intelligence chief was replaced by someone even more
loyal; this, combined with the replacement in recent months of the
heads of both the armed forces and the secret service, will dampen
western hopes of a palace coup.
</P>
<P>
   As Belgrade's few remaining lights of independence went out, a
dissident radio station, B-92, was shut down.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic can certainly count, at least initially, on support
among his fellow Serbs. Most have no idea of the scale of the
refugee crisis, or the atrocities committed by their police; many
regard Kosovo as a symbol of their history and faith.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Serbia's propaganda has kept many citizens so
cocooned from reality that nobody can predict how they will react
when they realize NATO is not bluffing this time.
</P>
<P>
   Serbia's forces are the rusting but still serviceable remnants
of an army that was built up during the Cold War as a defender of
Yugoslavia's non-aligned status. As well as buying Soviet-made
aircraft and air-defenses, the communist state made aircraft, tanks
and ships of its own.
</P>
<P>
   A well-integrated network of surface-to-air missile launchers,
including the mobile SA-6 which brought down an American aircraft
over Bosnia in 1995, means that western bombers will have a harder
time weaving through the Serbian skies than they do when swooping
over Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Bosnia, the Serbs proved to be skilled at electronic
warfare,'' says a British missile-watcher. ``They could tell when
NATO aircraft were targeting their air-defense sites with
anti-radar missiles, and switched off their radar in time to avoid
destruction.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO's war plan therefore calls for the firing of at least 100
cruise missiles, based at sea or on B-52 aircraft, to mess up the
Serbs' air defenses. Because these projectiles have satellite-based
guidance, they should be even ``smarter'' than they were during the
Gulf war.
</P>
<P>
   More accurate still _ so long as the weather is good _ are the
laser-guided bombs that America's stealthy F-117 bombers may
unleash.
</P>
<P>
   And another stealthy giant, the B-2, is having its war debut. If
NATO singles out the heavy armor that is wrecking Kosovo's
villages, it can call on the A-10 ``tank buster'' aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Some veteran Balkan observers believe the Belgrade regime could
crumble as popular anger over the corruption and cynicism of
Milosevic's circle replaces patriotic fervor.
</P>
<P>
   In Kosovo, though, events could spin out of all control. The
rebels of the loosely knit Kosovo Liberation Army may use any
opportunity provided by NATO firepower to take revenge on Serb
civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Another worry is that any restraint Serbia might exercise on its
special forces and paramilitary units could be lost if
communication systems are destroyed by bombing.
</P>
<P>
   And Pristina's warren of hillside settlements and communist-era
apartment buildings could become another Beirut. &QL;

   TOULOUSE _ When it comes to new products, few businesses are
more perilous than making civil aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Airplanes cost billins to develop and are designed to last a
generation. Boeing bet the company when it launched the 747,
spending $2 billion on the project, 2 times the value of the firm.
</P>
<P>
   Twice as big and efficient as anything else in the air, the
jumbo jet has earned the Seattle company over $20 billion in
profits since it first flew, 30 years ago almost to the day.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing's rivals, Lockheed and McDonnell Douglas, bet heavily too
_ and lost. Their wide-body jets, the Tristar and the DC-10, never
earned a penny.
</P>
<P>
   In 1981 Lockheed quit the civil-jet business altogether; two
years ago McDonnell Douglas was taken over by Boeing.
</P>
<P>
   Had either of them developed a twin-engined wide-body aircraft,
it would have avoided head-on competition with the 747, and might
have prevented Airbus from getting off the ground. Instead, over
the past 20 years the European consortium has encroached on
Boeing's dominant market share.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing used to account for well over two-thirds of orders, but
now it is being challenged in most parts of the market by Airbus.
Boeing reigns supreme only with the largest 747s.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, Airbus had been content to attack the 747 from
below, with bigger versions of its long-range A340. The latest,
soon to go into production, can carry 385 passengers.
</P>
<P>
   Virgin Atlantic will have an A340 with bedrooms below the main
deck, where passengers can sleep on the night flight that it is
starting between London and Buenos Aires.
</P>
<P>
   But Airbus, led by Noel Forgeard, hired from the French private
sector last year, is determined also to launch an attack from
above.
</P>
<P>
   Forgeard reasons that air traffic is growing by 5 percent a year
and that crowded airport hubs will need bigger aircraft. He reckons
that over the next 20 years there is a market for 1,400
``super-jumbos'' that are equipped to carry 550-660 passengers.
</P>
<P>
   Only about 20 airlines, half of them in Asia, are seen as
potential customers and only 10 percent of the total number of
planes would be super-jumbos. But they would be worth 25 percent of
the market, or $300 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Hence Airbus, which is owned by France's Aerospatiale, Germany's
DaimlerChrysler Aerospace, British Aerospace and Spain's CASA, is
stepping up work on its super-jumbo, the A3XX.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the partners and the consortium headquarters in Toulouse
have 1,000 staff working on the design of this huge double-decker.
And Airbus lobbyists are starting to ask their governments for
loans to help launch the aircraft. &QL;

   Of the $10 billion that it will cost to get the A3XX off the
ground, a third is supposed to come from Airbus; a third from
associates, including Italy's Alenia, Sweden's Saab Aircraft and
(Forgeard hopes) a Japanese company; and the remaining third from
European governments.
</P>
<P>
   Under an agreement signed with the United States in 1992,
governments can finance up to that proportion of the launch cost of
a new aircraft. In return, indirect government aid to Boeing,
through defense contracts with civilian spin-offs, is meant to be
limited to 3 percent of turnover.
</P>
<P>
   The Airbus launch aid is repayable at commercial interest rates
as the aircraft are sold. But it is still a subsidy, because it
would cost Airbus far more to raise finance on the market. &QL;

   Thus the paper A3XX could, at last, become real. Forgeard thinks
he will have an aircraft to sell to airlines by the end of this
year.
</P>
<P>
   He hopes to win the first orders by the end of 2000, at which
point Airbus could start production. But the launch timetable has
slipped, as nervousness about the slump in Asian travel has given
airlines cold feet. The earliest an A3XX could take wing now would
be 2005. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the project faces other hurdles. The money-conscious
British and German governments increasingly take the view that
Airbus should fly by itself.
</P>
<P>
   At the least, they would be happier financing Airbus if it had
the clarity of a company, rather than the obscurity of the
groupement d'interet economique (GIE), its current status under
French law.
</P>
<P>
   Conversion was supposed to happen in January, but squabbling
over valuations, shareholdings and control brought the process to
an embarrassing halt in October.
</P>
<P>
   The fault lies mainly with the French partner, Aerospatiale _
though its partial privatization in June, when it is merging into
part of the Lagardere Group, might help.
</P>
<P>
   Forgeard is visibly irritated at the delay, but the soonest he
can expect a conversion into a proper company is now the autumn of
next year.
</P>
<P>
   It is not only governments who are unhappy. Under the GIE
structure, all partners are jointly liable for all the total risks
assumed by Airbus. The Airbus partners, which will mostly be big
defense aerospace firms once Aerospatiale is part of Lagardere,
might prefer the more certain returns of defense projects to a big
and risky civil bet. &QL;

<P>
   One of the strongest signs that the A3XX will overcome these
obstacles comes from Boeing.
</P>
<P>
   The firm believes that air travel is fragmenting, with most
growth coming not on the big trunk routes that connect crowded
hubs, but from long-haul point-to-point services, such as Singapore
to Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Such ``long, thin routes,'' as they are known, are best served
by 300-400 seaters such as the A340 or Boeing's 777.
</P>
<P>
   Randolph Baseler, Boeing's boss of commercial-aircraft
marketing, says that increasingly liberal bilateral air-traffic
deals have boosted these routes. He thinks Pacific air travel may
become like Atlantic travel, where many flights bypass such hubs as
London's Heathrow.
</P>
<P>
   In the past few years Boeing has maintained that there was not
enough demand to justify spending $16 billion on a replacement for
the jumbo.
</P>
<P>
   It has dismissed Airbus's forecast for super-jumbos, and cut its
estimate by 100 aircraft, to 350 aircraft over 20 years _ though it
takes a narrower view of the market, counting only demand for
something bigger than the 747. (Airbus, by contrast, sees its A3XX
replacing the 747 too.)
</P>
<P>
   Despite these differences, Boeing is now looking at ways of
stretching and updating the 747. It is also quietly reexamining an
alternative.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago Boeing touted simple stretch versions of the
747, but airlines were not interested; they wanted an aircraft that
would offer big savings, not just more seats. Now, thanks to
technology that it acquired with McDonnell Douglas, Boeing can use
better wing-aerodynamics to save 7 percent on fuel.
</P>
<P>
   Its engineers are looking at a 550-seat 747, which would employ
the fly-by-wire technology pioneered by Airbus. Such a remake would
still cost several billion dollars; but it would be cheaper than a
new aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   The best explanation for Boeing's change of heart is the A3XX.
Even Virgin, which has pursued a strategy of creating a network of
thin routes, sees the need for a super-jumbo to ease congestion at
hub airports.
</P>
<P>
   Other airlines are more enthusiastic still. When the Asian
market caused the launch date to slip, Virgin's arch-rival, British
Airways, one of the airlines closest to the A3XX, sought
reassurance from Airbus that the consortium was not about to go
cool on the project.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing needs to boost productivity and repair its margins before
embarking on any big investments. Since it got its factories into a
tangle two years ago Boeing's profits and share price have both
tumbled.
</P>
<P>
   The continuing delays in converting Airbus into a proper company
might be just the opportunity it needs. After all, any delay in the
A3XX provides Boeing with more years of near-monopoly profits.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Airbus should bet the company now. The trouble is, it
doesn't have a proper company to bet. &QL;

   TOULOUSE _ When it comes to new products, few businesses are
more perilous than making civil aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Airplanes cost billions to develop and are designed to last a
generation. Boeing bet the company when it launched the 747,
spending $2 billion on the project, 2 times the value of the firm.
</P>
<P>
   Twice as big and efficient as anything else in the air, the
jumbo jet has earned the Seattle company over $20 billion in
profits since it first flew, 30 years ago almost to the day.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing's rivals, Lockheed and McDonnell Douglas, bet heavily too
_ and lost. Their wide-body jets, the Tristar and the DC-10, never
earned a penny.
</P>
<P>
   In 1981 Lockheed quit the civil-jet business altogether; two
years ago McDonnell Douglas was taken over by Boeing.
</P>
<P>
   Had either of them developed a twin-engined wide-body aircraft,
it would have avoided head-on competition with the 747, and might
have prevented Airbus from getting off the ground. Instead, over
the past 20 years the European consortium has encroached on
Boeing's dominant market share.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing used to account for well over two-thirds of orders, but
now it is being challenged in most parts of the market by Airbus.
Boeing reigns supreme only with the largest 747s.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, Airbus had been content to attack the 747 from
below, with bigger versions of its long-range A340. The latest,
soon to go into production, can carry 385 passengers.
</P>
<P>
   Virgin Atlantic will have an A340 with bedrooms below the main
deck, where passengers can sleep on the night flight that it is
starting between London and Buenos Aires.
</P>
<P>
   But Airbus, led by Noel Forgeard, hired from the French private
sector last year, is determined also to launch an attack from
above.
</P>
<P>
   Forgeard reasons that air traffic is growing by 5 percent a year
and that crowded airport hubs will need bigger aircraft. He reckons
that over the next 20 years there is a market for 1,400
``super-jumbos'' that are equipped to carry 550-660 passengers.
</P>
<P>
   Only about 20 airlines, half of them in Asia, are seen as
potential customers and only 10 percent of the total number of
planes would be super-jumbos. But they would be worth 25 percent of
the market, or $300 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Hence Airbus, which is owned by France's Aerospatiale, Germany's
DaimlerChrysler Aerospace, British Aerospace and Spain's CASA, is
stepping up work on its super-jumbo, the A3XX.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the partners and the consortium headquarters in Toulouse
have 1,000 staff working on the design of this huge double-decker.
And Airbus lobbyists are starting to ask their governments for
loans to help launch the aircraft. &QL;

   Such ``long, thin routes,'' as they are known, are best served
by 300-400 seaters such as the A340 or Boeing's 777.
</P>
<P>
   Randolph Baseler, Boeing's boss of commercial-aircraft
marketing, says that increasingly liberal bilateral air-traffic
deals have boosted these routes. He thinks Pacific air travel may
become like Atlantic travel, where many flights bypass such hubs as
London's Heathrow.
</P>
<P>
   In the past few years Boeing has maintained that there was not
enough demand to justify spending $16 billion on a replacement for
the jumbo.
</P>
<P>
   It has dismissed Airbus's forecast for super-jumbos, and cut its
estimate by 100 aircraft, to 350 aircraft over 20 years _ though it
takes a narrower view of the market, counting only demand for
something bigger than the 747. (Airbus, by contrast, sees its A3XX
replacing the 747 too.)
</P>
<P>
   Despite these differences, Boeing is now looking at ways of
stretching and updating the 747. It is also quietly reexamining an
alternative.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago Boeing touted simple stretch versions of the
747, but airlines were not interested; they wanted an aircraft that
would offer big savings, not just more seats. Now, thanks to
technology that it acquired with McDonnell Douglas, Boeing can use
better wing-aerodynamics to save 7 percent on fuel.
</P>
<P>
   Its engineers are looking at a 550-seat 747, which would employ
the fly-by-wire technology pioneered by Airbus. Such a remake would
still cost several billion dollars; but it would be cheaper than a
new aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   The best explanation for Boeing's change of heart is the A3XX.
Even Virgin, which has pursued a strategy of creating a network of
thin routes, sees the need for a super-jumbo to ease congestion at
hub airports.
</P>
<P>
   Other airlines are more enthusiastic still. When the Asian
market caused the launch date to slip, Virgin's arch-rival, British
Airways, one of the airlines closest to the A3XX, sought
reassurance from Airbus that the consortium was not about to go
cool on the project.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing needs to boost productivity and repair its margins before
embarking on any big investments. Since it got its factories into a
tangle two years ago Boeing's profits and share price have both
tumbled.
</P>
<P>
   The continuing delays in converting Airbus into a proper company
might be just the opportunity it needs. After all, any delay in the
A3XX provides Boeing with more years of near-monopoly profits.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Airbus should bet the company now. The trouble is, it
doesn't have a proper company to bet. &QL;

<P>
   OLD GREENWICH, CONN. _ Katherine Ellenthal's class of
8-year-olds wanted to know more. Most of them understood that
something unusual was going on and a few had watched President Bill
Clinton talking about it on the television.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does the war have a name?,'' one boy wanted to know. ``I think
we're bombing Siberia,'' offered another.
</P>
<P>
   In his address, President Clinton had suggested that Americans
look for Kosovo in an atlas. And so, like thousands of teachers
across America, Ms. Ellenthal started the school day by reaching
for the map _ one of those multi-colored canvases that rolls down
over the blackboard.
</P>
<P>
   It was an old one, though, and not tremendously helpful. It had
the former Yugoslavia but no place named Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody could blame these children for being a touch vague about
NATO operations in the Balkans. In fact, they measured up fairly
well against some of the adults interviewed Thursday outside.
(Certainly they seemed less confused than the lady heard on the
radio suggesting that Kosovo was a chain of gas stations.)
</P>
<P>
   Most had grasped this: There is someone bad doing bad things a
long way away and America wants to stop him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know its happening around Rome and Greece and people are
getting killed,'' one freckled boy volunteered, his hand in the
air.
</P>
<P>
   Another interrupted: ``We're being attacked by an ally and so
we're going to try to get a peace but if that doesn't work we're
going to make a war.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was talking to my Dad,'' another boy chimes in. ``He told me
we were bombing them because the were having a war and so we have
declared war too.''
</P>
<P>
   Someone offered this vivid picture (perhaps a little too vivid
for Ms. Ellenthal): ``People have been taken out of their homes and
put in line and told to go on their knees. And then they've been
shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Only three of the children _ it is a class of boys and girls _
had heard of Slobodan Milosevic (though everyone thought the name
funny). Saddam Hussein they knew _ he has been America's villain
for longer.
</P>
<P>
   And most had trouble with the concept of civil war. ``It's the
North fighting South,'' one boy noted. One of the girls in the
class, then spoke with great authority of Israel and Egypt once
going to war over Sinai. The same girl added that stopping wars is
important because sometimes they spread.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton would have applauded her. He would have been
pleased too that this class had a sense that going into a war can
be dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   One boy turned anxiously to this visiting reporter to ask:
``Will they be sending planes here?'' Somebody else was worried
about the distance involved and the fact that U.S. soldiers had to
cross the Atlantic. ``That's where the Titanic sank,'' he reminded
his friends.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Brown is the manager of the gas station just across the
road from the Old Greenwich School. It's a Sunoco station. (I
suggested that maybe it was Sunoco that the lady on the radio had
confused with Kosovo _ or, more likely, Conoco).
</P>
<P>
   He was not much further ahead than the school children on what
was going on. ``I usually try to keep up on it, the news, but you
know...'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Recently he has working shifts from 6 a.m. to 11 p.m. Give him a
map, he said, and he could point to Yugoslavia, but as for... Where
was it again? ``You see I can't even pronounce it.''
</P>
<P>
   Right next to the school is the ``Off Center Barber Shop.''
Behind the counter was Leslie Porter. She had seen most of
President Clinton's address and was more or less convinced that
bombing the Serbs was a good idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess it's a good idea,'' she said. ``But in some aspects
its stinks because people are going to get killed for something
that will never get resolved. Is it going to fix anything?''
</P>
<P>
   As for the president suggesting that she may not know where
Kosovo is, well, he was more or less right, she admitted. ``I heard
about it over the last couple of months, but it wasn't anything
important to me. What's Kosovo going to do for me? I never heard of
any new hairstyles coming out of there!'' &QL;

requested to use these Best Sellers lists in full or not at all.
This particularly applies to the Paperbacks. The ``Advice, How-To,

list for important reasons, and not to print ``Advice, How-To and

criticism from publishing houses.)

   Rankings reflect sales figures for the week ending March 20, at
almost 4,000 bookstores plus wholesalers serving 60,000 other

<P>
   OLD GREENWICH, CONN. _ Katherine Ellenthal's class of
8-year-olds wanted to know more. Most of them understood that
something unusual was going on and a few had watched President Bill
Clinton talking about it on the television.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does the war have a name?,'' one boy wanted to know. ``I think
we're bombing Siberia,'' offered another.
</P>
<P>
   In his address, President Clinton had suggested that Americans
look for Kosovo in an atlas. And so, like thousands of teachers
across America, Ms. Ellenthal started the school day by reaching
for the map _ one of those multi-colored canvases that rolls down
over the blackboard.
</P>
<P>
   It was an old one, though, and not tremendously helpful. It had
the former Yugoslavia but no place named Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody could blame these children for being a touch vague about
NATO operations in the Balkans. In fact, they measured up fairly
well against some of the adults interviewed Thursday outside.
(Certainly they seemed less confused than the lady heard on the
radio suggesting that Kosovo was a chain of gas stations.)
</P>
<P>
   Most had grasped this: There is someone bad doing bad things a
long way away and America wants to stop him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know its happening around Rome and Greece and people are
getting killed,'' one freckled boy volunteered, his hand in the
air.
</P>
<P>
   Another interrupted: ``We're being attacked by an ally and so
we're going to try to get a peace but if that doesn't work we're
going to make a war.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was talking to my Dad,'' another boy chimes in. ``He told me
we were bombing them because they were having a war and so we have
declared war too.''
</P>
<P>
   Someone offered this vivid picture (perhaps a little too vivid
for Ms. Ellenthal): ``People have been taken out of their homes and
put in line and told to go on their knees. And then they've been
shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Only three of the children _ it is a class of boys and girls _
had heard of Slobodan Milosevic (though everyone thought the name
funny). Saddam Hussein they knew _ he has been America's villain
for longer.
</P>
<P>
   And most had trouble with the concept of civil war. ``It's the
North fighting South,'' one boy noted. One of the girls in the
class, then spoke with great authority of Israel and Egypt once
going to war over Sinai. The same girl added that stopping wars is
important because sometimes they spread.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton would have applauded her. He would have been
pleased too that this class had a sense that going into a war can
be dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   One boy turned anxiously to this visiting reporter to ask:
``Will they be sending planes here?'' Somebody else was worried
about the distance involved and the fact that U.S. soldiers had to
cross the Atlantic. ``That's where the Titanic sank,'' he reminded
his friends.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Brown is the manager of the gas station just across the
road from the Old Greenwich School. It's a Sunoco station. (I
suggested that maybe it was Sunoco that the lady on the radio had
confused with Kosovo _ or, more likely, Conoco).
</P>
<P>
   He was not much further ahead than the school children on what
was going on. ``I usually try to keep up on it, the news, but you
know...'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Recently he has working shifts from 6 a.m. to 11 p.m. Give him a
map, he said, and he could point to Yugoslavia, but as for... Where
was it again? ``You see I can't even pronounce it.''
</P>
<P>
   Right next to the school is the ``Off Center Barber Shop.''
Behind the counter was Leslie Porter. She had seen most of
President Clinton's address and was more or less convinced that
bombing the Serbs was a good idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess it's a good idea,'' she said. ``But in some aspects
its stinks because people are going to get killed for something
that will never get resolved. Is it going to fix anything?''
</P>
<P>
   As for the president suggesting that she may not know where
Kosovo is, well, he was more or less right, she admitted. ``I heard
about it over the last couple of months, but it wasn't anything
important to me. What's Kosovo going to do for me? I never heard of
any new hairstyles coming out of there!'' &QL;

<P>
   War is never easy, and all the high technology in the world will
never make it so.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's new military toughness in Yugoslavia constitutes a deadly
gamble with many lives, and may become painful and unpopular. But
it remains necessary, in spite of all the final reservations that
accompany the fateful step of attacking a fellow sovereign state in
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Our first instinct is to welcome military action against a
regime that has systematically attacked the rights of the people of
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   This century has witnessed too many betrayals of small and
defenseless peoples in Europe, and it is to be hoped that the
action in Kosovo marks an end to that sad and shameful record.
</P>
<P>
   It is President Slobodan Milosevic who has forced the
predominantly Albanian population of that province into desperate
resistance. His government has denied them legitimate cultural
expression and legislative autonomy, discriminated against the
Albanian language and most Kosovars' Muslim faith, and finally
adopted the same techniques of ``ethnic cleansing'' that he
mobilized in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   For years we forced our troops in the Balkans to scuttle around
in armored personnel carriers, dealing out charity rather than
tackling the root cause of conflict: Serb aggression. Now that
humiliation may be over.
</P>
<P>
   But we must go further than emotional spasm. NATO's actions are
not the end of the struggle with Milosevic. In fact, they herald a
new level of conflict with this tough and cunning operator whose
capacity to trick, delay and dissemble will not be ended by
military action alone.
</P>
<P>
   On the contrary: military action raises the stakes, creating new
situations for the Belgrade strongman to exploit, and forcing the
Western allies to concentrate every step of the way.
</P>
<P>
   Only a strategy for the whole course of this new and more
intense confrontation can hope to isolate and contain such
initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   There is a need for such clear thinking over every aspect of
this new and dangerous conflagration. Having escalated the crisis,
we must face the consequences, building strategies for dealing with
the results of our actions.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomacy must remain to the fore, for in this field NATO's
position is far from secure. Russia and China oppose military
action, a stance Serbia will attempt to take advantage of. Without
unanimous international support or U.N. authorization, NATO must
not give the impression of go-it-alone warmongering.
</P>
<P>
   The diplomatic situation may get worse, as the conflict could
spread to Macedonia, Albania, and beyond. The political and
military groundwork must be laid to deal with that eventuality.
That means extra troops if necessary, and security agreements with
countries who share a border with Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   But there are technical and operational problems on a similar
scale. Serbia is no Iraq. With well-equipped air defenses and a
trained, tested and committed army, she will be no military
pushover.
</P>
<P>
   The lives of NATO personnel may be lost, perhaps in large
numbers. Alliance troops are strung out across Bosnia and
Macedonia, and will need protecting. For that there must be a plan,
for ultimate extraction or deeper and more forceful involvement.
</P>
<P>
   Provision must be made for refugees streaming across the border
into Macedonia and northern Greece. Once war is launched, there can
be no half-measures.
</P>
<P>
   There will be no quick or bloodless victory; in the Balkans,
there never are any simple solutions. But Milosevic has torn up
every agreement he has made in the last six months, and his ability
to defy sense and diplomacy must now be brought to an end.
</P>
<P>
   NATO should stand firm for the stark principles that necessitate
action. The credibility of the Western alliance, the Kosovar right
to self-determination and democracy, and the security of Europe
itself are at stake. &QL;

BEAUTIFUL VANCOUVER DOESN'T DISAPPOINT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(HAS ART) 
By ERIC NOLAND  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   VANCOUVER, British Columbia _ It seems unfathomable that one of
the first modern-day visitors to Vancouver was bitterly
disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1800s, fur trader Simon Fraser followed a river he
thought was the Columbia, hoping to beat Lewis and Clark to its
mouth and establish a British claim to the region. Except Fraser
chose the wrong tributary, strayed north and wound up picking his
way along a treacherous river that would come to bear his name.
</P>
<P>
   He got to the river's mouth _ now the site of Vancouver _
realized his folly, and declared his mission an abject failure.
</P>
<P>
   Fraser should have taken a few more moments to look around.
</P>
<P>
   A peninsula location perfect for a downtown district. An
adjacent thumb of land ideal for a 1,000-acre urban park. Water all
around, soon to bear the names Burrard Inlet, English Bay and False
Creek. The towering peaks of the Coast Mountains directly to the
north, in winter framing the scene in white-tipped splendor. And an
unusually temperate climate for a locale this far north _ mild if
wet winters, early springs (ideal for English flower gardens) and
dry, glistening summers.
</P>
<P>
   Subsequent visitors would find the spot much more to their
liking. From all points of the compass they came and stayed. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; As a result, Vancouver today is richly overlaid with ethnic
texture and is one of the most vibrantly cosmopolitan cities in
North America.
</P>
<P>
   When heads were last counted, nearly three years ago, it was
determined that 45 percent of Vancouver's half-million population
identifies itself as ``visible minority'' (a Canadian census term).
Chinese account for more than 28 percent of the city's population,
with other significant representation found among South Asians,
Filipinos, Southeast Asians, indigenous peoples (called aboriginal
in the census) and Japanese.
</P>
<P>
   Don't presume, however, that the majority of these people are
recently arrived _ the norm in most North American cities. ``Many
have been in the country for multiple generations,'' said Dr. Susan
McDaniel, a sociology professor who specializes in demographics at
the University of Alberta in Edmonton. ``Vancouver has had a
longstanding Chinese community; there have been a number of
Chinatowns. Chinese workers were brought in to build the (Canadian
Pacific) railway, and many stayed. That's a very big part of the
vibrant ethnic life in Canada.''
</P>
<P>
   Accordingly, a visit to this city tends to be an eclectic
experience, one of strikingly varied sights and experiences.
</P>
<P>
   A stop here several weeks ago revealed that winter is not a
particularly good time to sample its charms _ and this had nothing
to do with the weather, which has been some of the wettest,
windiest and grayest in Vancouver's past 20 years, according to the
country's meteorological service, Environment Canada. Rather, many
of the offerings that appeal to tourists are scaled way back in the
winter months.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _  &LR; A delightful trolley service provides a guided tour of the
city. It allows passengers to get off to enjoy a particular point
of interest and stay as long as they wish, then reboard another
trolley and resume the guided tour exactly where they left off. It
operates daily from April to September _ but only on weekends the
rest of the year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _  &LR; Harbour Cruises ply Vancouver's watery borders _ but not in
winter, not even on weekends.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _  &LR; In Stanley Park, there is a miniature railroad and a petting
zoo to delight young visitors. Don't look for these features on
weekdays between Labor Day and Easter, though. And if the weather
is foul on winter weekends, they'll shut down then, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, our tourist season is about three months long,'' Al
Regan, supervisor of the two Stanley Park attractions, said with a
laugh. ``And the rest of the time it's quite wet.''
</P>
<P>
   Residents of this city trudge about in long coats, resigned to
the conditions. They throw hoods over their heads as a shield
against the drizzle and unfurl umbrellas only when the heavy stuff
comes down.
</P>
<P>
   There's no reason tourists can't show similar pluck. And the
rewards, even while exploring without the aid of organized tours,
can be considerable. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
CULTURE SHOCK
</P>
<P>
   The young man was making his way down a dark hallway, carrying
over his shoulder something that looked distinctly like a body. And
it was. A butchered hog. A big one at that.
</P>
<P>
   The location was a meat market along East Pender Street in
Chinatown. This is a scene the folks at the Farmer John packing
plant would never want you to see, but you're not in the United
States anymore. Or even Canada. This is China.
</P>
<P>
   Butchers stood at wooden counter tops wielding heavy cleavers as
Chinese women clustered around, insistently pointing out the exact
cuts of pork they desired, arguing over the quality of this
particular flank of meat, specifying thickness before the cleaver
fell. At one end of the counter was an entire pile of hooves.
</P>
<P>
   Hanging along one wall were the boned carcasses of some kind of
fowl, likely duck, pounded out so thoroughly that as they hung
there, they looked like leather throw rugs.
</P>
<P>
   Every sign in the place was in Chinese _ prices, poundage, cuts
of meat. Not a word of English was being spoken.
</P>
<P>
   Out on the street, other establishments along an open-air
marketplace offered up similar mysteries. Little silvery fish.
Dried vegetables and musky roots.
</P>
<P>
   The walking tours spelled out in guide books usually concentrate
on the historic buildings of Chinatown, but a stroll through this
district is much more memorable just for the sensory impressions.
</P>
<P>
   Vancouver's trolley services Chinatown. Another option is to
purchase a Vancouver daily transit pass (about $4.20 U.S. per
adult), available all over town at locations displaying
``FareDealer'' symbols. It is good on all public transit, including
the SkyTrain, a magnetic-rail service that slashes diagonally
across the city. The stop for Chinatown is Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The pass is also good for a boat ride. Of sorts. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
GOING TO MARKET
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who hails from Los Angeles, where the automobile reigns
supreme, can't resist a mode of mass transit that crosses a body of
water.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, however, Vancouver's SeaBus is true to its name.
It shuttles back and forth across the Burrard Inlet between
downtown and north Vancouver, but does so about as glamorously as a
Greyhound bus shuttles between Brawley and El Centro. There are
long rows of hard plastic seats in which people assume standard bus
demeanor _ staring vacantly forward.
</P>
<P>
   Forget about breathing in some fresh, salty air. This vessel has
no decks, and it's not permissible to climb up on the roof.
</P>
<P>
   The only reward to be found at Lonsdale Quay, the destination of
this short (11 minutes) trip, is the view back across the inlet at
the Vancouver skyline. Tourist officials will trumpet the dockside
market, but it felt a bit too much like a strip mall with an ocean
view.
</P>
<P>
   An infinitely better market option lies across town at Granville
Island.
</P>
<P>
   It is no longer an island and never really was much of one. It
began as a sandbar, then was heaped with sludge and ultimately
became an industrial site as False Creek was dredged early in the
20th century.
</P>
<P>
   An urban-renewal project in the late '70s transformed it into a
finger of land that now houses art studios, boutiques, trendy
watering holes and one impressive public market.
</P>
<P>
   In early February, the array and quality of produce on display
was mind-boggling. Granville Island Florist, meanwhile, featured 20
different varieties of tulips in a dazzling display. There were
also bonanzas of fresh seafood, bakery items and ethnic delis.
</P>
<P>
   The place, even on a weekday, was teeming with people, many of
them corporate refugees seeking coffee or lunch.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, ``I would say that within the last three years,
business has dropped at Granville Island,'' said Gordon Lowes,
manager of Duso's Italian deli.
</P>
<P>
   There are multiple reasons for this. Auto access from the foot
of the Granville Bridge can get congested, and parking is at a
premium. Also, other entrepreneurs, who have watched Granville
Island tap a demand for specialty market items, have opened shops
nearby that are more convenient.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can get really busy here on the weekends,'' said Lowes,
``and the parking regulations are enforced just a little bit too
heavily, in my opinion. It's like they're out there with their
stopwatches, with the tow trucks waiting in the distance.''
</P>
<P>
   Visitors not wanting to brave this tangle, even in a taxi, might
be advised to approach Granville Island from the other side _
across the water. Tiny boats, called Aquabuses, ferry passengers
across False Creek from the foot of Howe Street (about $1.25 U.S.
per adult each way; the transit pass isn't applicable here). &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
STUDIES IN CIVILIZATION
</P>
<P>
   The Great Hall features a glass front and towering ceilings. It
has to in order to house _ and highlight _ the most cherished
artifacts of the Museum of Anthropology at the University of
British Columbia: totem poles.
</P>
<P>
   They soar toward the rafters, the sculpted wood expressions
glowering down on intruders below. The red-cedar carvings depict
the characters from family stories of British Columbia's First
Nations people (as the region's indigenous residents prefer to be
called).
</P>
<P>
   The exhibit halls at this museum on the western edge of
Vancouver also feature wood boxes, feast dishes, wood sculptures,
baskets. Although some of the items are contemporary, constructed
30 or 40 years ago, hundreds of carvings are from mid-19th century
Haida villages. Other archeological specimens in the museum's
collection date back thousands of years.
</P>
<P>
   At the reception desk, where adult admission is about $4.30
U.S., you'll be given a map of the exhibition halls, but make sure
you pick up a free brochure titled ``MOA, A Guide to the
Galleries.'' In a museum where placards don't yield much helpful
information, this is indispensable for understanding the specific
items you're marveling at (and no one at the reception desk was
urging visitors to take a copy).
</P>
<P>
   Even the MOA guide, however, won't be of much help in the
museum's warehouselike ``visible storage'' area. Artifacts of
native people from all over the world are on display, and it's
worth wandering through for a look, but this area was clearly
geared for scholarly research. Items are not described, they're
simply assigned catalog numbers, and you're left to search through
thick data books for specific information.
</P>
<P>
   After the anthropology museum, Vancouver will jolt you back to
modern day. Simply return to downtown and take a walk down Robson
Street.
</P>
<P>
   This is the near-exclusive domain of young adults oblivious to
debt. It offers clothing boutiques, restaurants, music stores,
coffeehouses, nightclubs _ all in a blaze of light, chrome and
glass.
</P>
<P>
   At Joe Fortes Seafood House, a red-brick atrium establishment
named after a turn-of-the-century lifeguard, the cell phones were
ringing so frequently along the bar one afternoon that patrons were
repeatedly digging into pockets to see if they were the ones being
summoned.
</P>
<P>
   It was enough to make a guy fumble a Malpeque oyster right out
of the half shell. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
INTO THE NIGHT
</P>
<P>
   Vancouver's fine-dining options understandably revolve around
its bountiful seafood, and it's probably heresy to visit here
without eating salmon somewhere, sometime, in some form.
</P>
<P>
   British Columbia myth holds that the salmon once crammed so
thickly into the Strait of San Juan de Fuca (between the mainland
and Vancouver Island) that you could practically walk across
without getting your feet wet.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps one of the best places to eat this fish is west
Vancouver's Salmon House on the Hill, which also affords a
spectacular view of downtown Vancouver across the Burrard Inlet.
(Dinner for two, with one of the lower-priced bottles of local
wine, about $75 U.S.)
</P>
<P>
   On a recent evening, one excellent dinner special featured three
different types of salmon _ sockeye, steelhead, Atlantic _ prepared
on the restaurant's famed alderwood broiler.
</P>
<P>
   On another night, Le Crocodile, a French-themed restaurant
downtown, proved worthy of the high marks it has gotten in guide
books. It offers the requisite exotica _ venison, snails in pastry
shells, terrine of goose liver _ without forsaking such classics as
lobster thermidor. (Dinner for two, with wine, $80-$100 U.S.)
</P>
<P>
   After the latter dinner, a sampling of entertainment was
desired, but optimism was guarded. It was a Monday in winter. Wet.
Cold. A school night. The recovery from the weekend not yet
complete.
</P>
<P>
   Wrong time to expect much from a blues club?
</P>
<P>
   Not in Vancouver. The Yale Hotel had a strong turnout as a
somewhat long-in-the-tooth blues band hit the stage at about 10
p.m. This was the genuine article: Flannel shirts. Only one
microphone. The drummer warmed up for the first set by throwing
back two pints of amber ale _ on stage.
</P>
<P>
   Canada hasn't yet adopted the nonsense of smokeless bars, and it
hasn't imposed any embargoes on any Communist regimes in the
Caribbean, so it affords a pleasure that conforms nicely with its
multicultural personality.
</P>
<P>
   On a single evening in Vancouver, a visitor can enjoy a French
dinner, listen to American Deep South blues while sipping Canadian
beer and smoking a Cuban cigar, then ride with a Punjabi cabbie
back to the deferential British comfort of a room at the Hotel
Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, Canada.

 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ To say that I have mixed feelings about the
nasty fight between the Catholic Archdiocese here and the
nuns-in-drag charity troupe, the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence,
is like saying that it isn't always easy to be a Christian.
</P>
<P>
   Or an American.
</P>
<P>
   As a dyed-in-the-wool liberal, I feel blessed to live in the
U.S. city that symbolizes ``tolerance'' to liberals and ``excess''
to conservatives. I'm proud to belong to the ACLU and to call
myself a feminist. The First Amendment is my favorite, and Dr.
Laura's arrogant brand of Old Testament condemnation makes my skin
crawl.
</P>
<P>
   Some of my very best friends are lesbian and gay.
</P>
<P>
   I am also an adult convert to Roman Catholicism. Nobody
``indoctrinated'' me as a child. In my mid-30s, after years of
spiritual searching (and a decade of spiritual torpor), I chose a
path. It led to the Catholic Church, and life has been radically
different _ remarkably beautiful and difficult _ ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Some of my very best friends are nuns and priests.
</P>
<P>
   Like most fights, the one between the Archdiocese and the
Sisters looks simple: This city should allow (and thus partially
finance through police and traffic services) a two-block closure of
Castro Street on Easter Sunday for the Sisters' 20th anniversary
celebration _ or it should not.
</P>
<P>
   But this fight is about as simple as society itself.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents for both sides are dug-in. Both claim exclusive
status as The Victim. Both are lobbying politicians and their own
communities for active support. Both have, despite rhetoric to the
contrary, one-dimensionalized the other.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides also have been more than a little disingenuous.
</P>
<P>
   After the Archdiocese asked that the Sisters' street permit be
revoked, the group's public image underwent amazing transformation.
The ``nuns'' went from a campy, raunchy guerrilla theater troupe,
which often lends its name and energy to fund-raising projects, to
the collective reincarnation of Florence Nightingale.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Sisters plan to hold a ``Hunky Jesus'' contest this
Easter, have passed out folded condoms as if they were consecrated
wafers, and never miss an opportunity to lambaste Pope John Paul II
or any sacred aspect of the Catholic Church, San Francisco
Supervisor Mark Leno insists, ``They mean no disrespect.''
</P>
<P>
   The Archdiocese is equally guilty of minimizing some truths.
</P>
<P>
   In its innocent martyr role (executed best by groups like
Catholics for Truth and Justice), the church is behaving as though
its flock is back in the Roman Forum being ripped up by lions.
While over-reaching to compare the Sisters' offensiveness to that
of Nazis and the Ku Klux Klan, church spokesmen ignore the ominous
power and impact that are part and parcel of their mighty
2,000-year-old institution.
</P>
<P>
   In their hurt and anger over insulted nuns and desecrated holy
symbols, they dismiss the deeply painful insult that the pope
inflicted on every gay man and woman when he classified
homosexuality as ``an objective disorder.'' They discount the
soulful anger that results from his insistence that homosexual acts
_ no matter how loving and monogamous _ ``cannot contribute to the
authentic good of the human person.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the many things I've learned on the Catholic path is, when
you have mixed feelings, you try to figure out what Jesus likely
would say or do. While you're figuring, you pray.
</P>
<P>
   So, with everything the church has taught me about the heart of
Jesus, this is my Easter prayer: Please, God, let the Sisters of
Perpetual Indulgence hold their party on Easter but inspire them to
take up a collection to defray the cost to San Francisco taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   After Easter, help the Sisters' supporters to acknowledge the
oceans of AIDS charity that Catholics produce and remind them that
the one-billion-person Catholic Church is not a monolith.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, God, please encourage the Archdiocese to ask the New
York-based Catholic League to withdraw its threatened economic
boycott of San Francisco. Help Archbishop William Levada, the staff
of his weekly newspaper and all angry Catholics to remember that
this is the United States of America where even the
Holocaust-surviving Jews of Skokie, Ill., had to accept real Nazis
_ not drag queens _ marching through their main streets.
</P>
<P>
   On Easter Sunday, turn the attention of all hurting Catholics
away from that little two-block segment of Castro Street and make
them focus on some wise words from the late, great Mother Teresa:
``Never let anything so fill you with sorrow as to make you forget
the joy of the risen Christ.''

   The New York Times News Service plans the following  &UR; Science
Times &LR;  stories for papers of Tuesday, March 30:
</P>
<P>
   SCI-HAU-PHYSICS (Undated) _ Scientist at Work: Dr. Lene
Vestergaard Hau, a teacher at Harvard, has gained a formidable
reputation in a branch of science traditionally dominated by men:
physics. But most of all, she is known as the scientist who slowed
light down to a walk. Perfectly at home with such subjects as
quantum mechanics, Hilbert spaces and Bose-Einstein condensates,
Dr. Hau, at 39, is rapidly reaching the top of her profession, her
colleagues agree. By Malcolm W. Browne. (1850 words)
</P>
<P>
   With photo and graphic.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-INDIAN-ECOLOGY (Undated) _ Many experts have abandoned the
concept that Lewis and Clark explored a pristine land of the nature
untouched. In fact, evidence now suggests, Native American peoples
had a profound effect on the land and animals, driving some species
near extinction in vast homeland areas with expert hunting skills.
But in buffer zones between warring tribes, where hunters feared
spending time, game thrived, in effect becoming game preserves
where most species survived in narrow areas between warring
nations. The war-zone theory is laid out in the most recent issue
of the journal Conservation Biology, partly explaining why bison,
elk, deer and bears escaped the fate of other, even bigger North
American animal species that became extinct some 13,000 years ago,
which may have been hunted to extinction in a continentwide
blitzkriegs. By William K. Stevens. (1725 words)
</P>
<P>
   With map.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-DOCTORS-SELLING (Undated) _ Patients, doctors and
professional groups around the country are increasingly unsettled
by a trend toward merchandising in medical offices, attributing it
to physicians' desire to supplement incomes that have been squeezed
by managed care. No statistics are available to indicate how
widespread the practice is, but doctors' groups are quietly
drafting policies about when selling items to patients is an
acceptable part of medical practice. By Abigail Zuger. (2000 words)
</P>
<P>
   With photo.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-FOX-EVOLUTION (Undated) _ Experimenters have rushed
evolution to produce a new breed of fox _ one that whines for
attention from human beings without any prior conditioning, licks
its masters' faces, and has even begun to look something like a
domestic dog. In a long-term experiment at a Siberian fur farm,
geneticists have created this new version of Vulpes vulpes _ the
silver fox _ by allowing only the friendliest animals from each
generation to breed. Having selected only the most ``tamable'' of
some 45,000 foxes over 35 generations, the scientists have
compressed into a mere 40 years an evolutionary process that took
thousands of years to transform ancestral wolves into domestic
dogs. By Malcolm W. Browne. (1200 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-GALACTIC-CORES (Undated) _ Before its infrared camera shut
down in November, the Hubble Space Telescope focused on an
assortment of spiral galaxies for some of its last pictures in
those invisible wavelengths, giving astronomers penetrating looks
through thick galactic dust into the glowing hydrogen clouds where
stars are being born. By John Noble Wilford. (440 words)
</P>
<P>
   With photo.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-CHOOSING-MATES (Undated) _ Essay. Evolutionary psychology
and other branches of science explain what people want in terms of
a mate. But in reality, people choose mates (or have them chosen
for them), in myriad ways. Our brains are not designed specifically
to desire this or that, but to weigh the options, and then get down
to the business of having babies. By Meredith Small. (1750 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-LANGUAGE (Undated) _ The Berinmo language of Papua New
Guinea categorizes colors with just five words. This makes the
tribe a good subject for studying a linguistic concept that first
gained wide currency in the 1950's. Called the linguistic
relativity hypothesis, it argues that humans see the world less
with their eyes than with their language. Each language filters
experience differently, and thus there are no universal principles
of meaning. By Henry Fountain. (650 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-WATCH (Undated) _ Items on clothing that may absorb
pesticides, pesticides in the water supply and a glowing form of E.
coli used for keep pesticides out of the food chain. (675 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-BRODY-HEALTH (Undated) _ The Personal Health column:
Breast-feeding has enjoyed a well-deserved burst in popularity in
recent decades, when pediatric specialists finally succeeded in
overcoming the commercial pressures on modern women to feed their
babies formula. However, lately the numbers have been dropping from
their peak, and now only about 60 percent of mothers are nursing
their babies when they leave the hospital and only 30 percent are
still nursing six months later. By the end of this year according
to the goals set in Healthy People 2000, the Surgeon General had
hoped that three-fourths of all new mothers would be nursing when
they take their babies home. By Jane E. Brody. (1250 words)
</P>
<P>
   With graphic.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-SWEAT-SURGERY (Undated) _ A little-known disease afflicts
more than 200,000 Americans: hyperhidrosis _ the production of
chronic, drenching sweat. People with the disease drip water from
their hands, feet or underarms, and sometimes even their chest or
back. But now an operation called sympathectomy, in which surgeons
snip the sympathetic nerve chain that causes the excess sweating,
eliminates the problem. By Anne Eisenberg. (700 words)
</P>
<P>
   With photo.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-CONTRACEPTIVE-SPONGE (Undated) _ The contraceptive sponge,
once the most popular nonprescription birth control device for
women, could be available once more on drugstore shelves by fall.
The Today Sponge, a convenient and well-liked contraceptive that
was sold from 1983 until 1995, is scheduled to make a comeback
through the efforts of a small pharmaceutical company which
purchased the rights to the product from the manufacturer that
earlier ceased production of it. By Warren E. Leary) (1350 words)
</P>
<P>
   With graphic.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-EBOLA-VIRUS (Undated) _ The early moments after patients are
infected with the feared Ebola virus may be the most important to
their survival, researchers report this week in the journal Nature
Medicine. By Philip J. Hilts. (675 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-VITAL-SIGNS (Undated) _ Shorts on health and fitness:
</P>
<P>
   _ Researchers are working on a vaccine combat peanut allergies,
and so far are having success in mice. (420 words)
</P>
<P>
   _ Teen-agers fretting over how they look may not be just going
through a phase. Some may be suffering from body dysmorphic
disorder. This often secret and little recognized malady that can
lead to dropping out of school, shunning social contacts and even
suicide, say a Brown University research team. (400 words)
</P>
<P>
   _ The researchers found that 3 percent of the men reported
having had nonconsensual sexual experiences as adults, and 5
percent said they had been sexually abused as children.
Surprisingly, when the abuse occurred in adulthood, women were just
as likely to be the perpetrators as men, the researchers found,
while men were the most frequent perpetrators of abuse in children.
(350 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-HELICOPTER-SKIING (Undated) _ The Novice. Learning what's
commonly called helicopter skiing, in which participants fly by
copter to the mountain peaks and ski in deep powder snow. The skis
are wider and shorter. Important differences also involve turning
methods and basic body stance. By Holcomb B. Noble (900 words)
</P>
<P>
   With graphic.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-LEMURS-MAD-COW (Undated) _ Lemurs at a zoo in France appear
to be dying of mad cow disease. By Sandra Blakeslee. (550 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-MEN-FERTILITY (Undated) _ A popular technique to help
infertile men become fathers results in an abnormal process of
fertilization, researchers have found. While it is not clear
whether there are any effects on the babies conceived with the
method, the finding is expected to raise troubling questions. The
technique is called ICSI, for intercytoplasmic sperm injection.
Instead of allowing sperm to swim up to an egg and penetrate it on
their own, doctors directly inject a sperm cell into an egg. Now,
researchers have determined that ICSI risks damaging the proteins
that push and pull chromosomes into line before cell division and
that it skews the egg's otherwise orderly removal of proteins from
sperm. By Gina Kolata. (1200 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-Q&AMP;A (Undated) _ Why are the orbits of the Sun's planets
arranged in a more-or-less flat plane? The planets are believed by
many authorities to have coalesced from a disk-shaped cloud of gas
in the evolution of our solar system, beginning roughly five
billion years ago. (284 words)

<P>
   Children are risk-takers. Part of growing up means pushing their
physical limits, and playgrounds are one of the prime testing
sites.
</P>
<P>
   But the swings and jungle gyms that attract active young people
can also cause serious injury.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, more than 200,000 children received playground-related
injuries, according to the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission.
About 15 to 20 children die from these injuries every year.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 200,000 children who are injured, about three-fourths are
hurt in public playgrounds at parks or schools. The other 50,000
have backyard accidents, says Ken Giles, a Safety Commission
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Monkey bars and jungle gyms, called ``climbers'' by safety
experts, are among the most dangerous equipment. The majority of
serious playground injuries _ head trauma, skull fractures,
concussions, broken bones _ involve falls onto hard surfaces.
</P>
<P>
   ``The deaths usually occur when children fall and hit their
heads,'' says Giles. ``A few are from clothing strangulation, which
we've tried to reduce by getting rid of drawstrings, or
entrapment.''
</P>
<P>
   Donna Thompson, director of the National Program for Playground
Safety at the University of Northern Iowa, says she believes that
safety standards she helped develop with the U.S. Consumer Product
Safety Commission and the American Society of Testing and Materials
can reduce the number of playground accidents.
</P>
<P>
   The guidelines, first issued in the early 1980s and updated in
1991 and 1997, include criteria for swings, climbers, slides and
other common playground equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're good guidelines,'' Thompson said. ``Probably the best
in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Early figures of a new national survey on playground injuries
show that the voluntary guidelines seem to be having a modest
impact. The number of playground accidents is staying about the
same, she said, while the number of youngsters using playgrounds is
going up.
</P>
<P>
   But the Consumer Federation of America, an advocacy group based
in Washington, D.C., wants even more stringent federal standards
for playgrounds. These include:
</P>
<P>
   _ Limiting the height of all playground slides and platforms to
6 feet.
</P>
<P>
   _ Banning glider-style and animal-shaped swings.
</P>
<P>
   _ Eliminating exercise rings and trapeze bars.
</P>
<P>
   _ Requiring up to a foot of sand, wood chips or other cushioning
material under all playground equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Many states and cities are adopting the federal playground
safety guidelines as local ordinances, says Giles, of the Safety
Commission.
</P>
<P>
   A California law aims to have all of that state's playgrounds up
to code by 2000, including making them accessible to disabled
children. In San Francisco, the city's tallest slide _ a 14-footer
at West Portal playground _ is gone. In Oakland, where a 7-year-old
died in 1993 after falling from the monkey bars at his elementary
school, the school district is still working to replace equipment
that was declared off-limits to kids.
</P>
<P>
   Cities and schools are eliminating other traditional equipment,
as well. Seesaws are disappearing because of the back injuries
children suffer when their partner jumps off. Animal-shaped swings
and gliders are too heavy, and can cause serious injuries if they
hit someone. New slides are being made of fiberglass to eliminate
the sun-heated metal, with hoods at the top so children are forced
to sit down to slide. Swing chains are being shortened. And hard
surfaces under the equipment are being replaced with materials that
can cushion a fall.
</P>
<P>
   In Brunswick County, N.C., last year, the school system put wood
chips underneath its schools' playground equipment to bring the
playground up to the state standard.
</P>
<P>
   The action came a few months after 5-year-old Brian Oswalt fell
off 8-foot-high monkey bars, breaking his arm during a recess at
his elementary school. A suit filed by the Oswalt family is winding
its way through the courts.
</P>
<P>
   Clarence Willie, Brunswick's assistant operations
superintendent, says upgrading school playgrounds is one of the
school administration's top priorities. ``It's expensive, it's
ongoing,'' he said. ``Every budget opportunity we get, we include
funding for the playgrounds. We believe we're just about there.''
</P>
<P>
   Making a playground safer can be expensive. Traditional fixtures
_ towering slides, metal monkey bars and fast-spinning
merry-go-rounds _ are being replaced by brightly colored play
structures of wood, plastic or fiberglass.
</P>
<P>
   These sprawling, multipurpose structures are designed to enhance
motor skills, increase upper body strength and encourage
imaginative play.
</P>
<P>
   Wooden structures are susceptible to deterioration over time,
and must be restored regularly. Rubber-coated metal structures,
which won't create sharp splinters or rot, can cost up to $40,000
apiece.
</P>
<P>
   The new structures avoid the small openings that can catch heads
or limbs and the open upper decks from which children can fall.
</P>

   ``The danger zone for openings is 3 1/2 inches to 9 inches. The
openings should be less than or larger than that. In between is
where kids get entrapped,'' Giles says.
</P>
<P>
   At state-of-the-art playgrounds, slides are plastic and free of
sharp edges or protrusions; stairs are wide and easy to navigate,
bolts are flush to the coated metal bars on the climbers. The only
open areas from the higher decks, about 5 feet off the ground, have
easy-to-climb rungs leading to the ground. The surface below the
climbers is soft and spongy _ not quite as soft as a mattress, but
softer than many gym mats.
</P>
<P>
   One popular surface is made of 6 inches of mortar sand, covered
with fabric, then topped with another 6 inches of wood chips. The
wood pieces are specially made to avoid splintering or burning.
</P>
<P>
   Beneath swings, the surface is deep sand to avoid sprains or
broken bones. The sandy area is wide, about 16 feet both front and
back. And the number of swings from the set is two per support _
older swing sets can have three or four seats on a support.
</P>
<P>
   Playground areas for active play should be separated from areas
for quiet play, advises the American Academy of Orthopedic
Surgeons. The AAOS offers a brochure, ``Play it Safe, a Guide to
Playground Safety.'' For a copy, call 1-800-824-BONES.

Box 12099, Washington, D.C., 20005-0999.
</P>
<P>
   Child-safe playgrounds can reduce injuries, but no amount of
design improvement can make up for adult supervision. Accidents
will happen, even at a park with rubber-coated metal bars and soft
landing surfaces.
</P>
<P>
   Children must be old enough and big enough to navigate the
equipment, and parents or teachers must be vigilant.

   SAEFTY STANDARDS:
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, the American
Society of Testing and Materials, the National Program for
Playground Safety and other agencies have recommended standards to
minimize the risk of playground-related injuries.
</P>
<P>
   _ Surfaces: Make sure the surface underneath equipment,
especially climbing structures and slides, is soft. The standard is
for at least a 12-inch depth of shock-absorbing material. Sand is
recommended underneath swing sets. Many playground injuries occur
on hard-packed earth, asphalt or concrete surfaces.
</P>
<P>
   _ Heights: Climbing equipment and slides should be no higher
than 6 feet off the ground.
</P>
<P>
   _ Equipment: All equipment should be firmly anchored. Swings,
which can become dangerous projectiles, should be made of
lightweight, impact-absorbing materials like plastic or rubber. The
hangers at the top of the swings should be spaced slightly wider
than the seat to reduce side-to-side motion. Slides should not have
more than a 30-degree incline. The platform should be as wide as
the slide (at least 22 inches) and all elevated platforms should
have handrails. Plastic is considered safer than metal. Spaces
between rungs in any equipment should be large enough to prevent a
child's head from getting trapped. Watch for loose, damaged or
missing supports, anchors or footings. Protruding bolts, sharp
edges or points, wood splinters, swing hangers or chains can cut or
puncture children.

WHEN YOUR CHURCH SAYS NO
</HEADLINE>
  By CARY MCMULLEN 
 c.1999 New York Time Regional Newspapers 
 World rights 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   On a recent trip to New England, the Rev. Bill Boulet saw an
example of how churches used to discipline their members: it was a
dunking chair. In the days of the Puritans, those who broke the
strict rules of church law were strapped into a chair at the end of
a seesaw-like device at the edge of a pond.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then, everybody who came along was supposed to dunk them,''
said Boulet, pastor of Heritage Baptist Church in Lakeland, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Such measures may seem quaint _ or cruel _ today. In these more
sensitive times, it's hard to imagine any church member standing
for a verbal reprimand, let alone a dunking in an icy pond. It's
not unknown for people kicked out of churches to file lawsuits
alleging defamation of character.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in the wake of the Monica Lewinsky scandal, some church
leaders have raised the issue of more stringent accountability for
lay people. Following President Clinton's admission of an improper
relationship with Lewinsky, Southern Baptist Theological Seminary
President Albert Mohler called on Clinton's home church, Immanuel
Baptist Church in Little Rock, Ark., to discipline him.
</P>
<P>
   Mohler wrote in a syndicated column last year, ``How can the
church in which he holds membership ignore what even the secular
world considers scandalous? Southern Baptists will be watching
Immanuel Baptist Church to see if it musters the courage to make
clear its own convictions.''
</P>
<P>
   Because Southern Baptist congregations are autonomous, Mohler's
comments provoked controversy, including retorts that he was
meddling where he had no authority. The Little Rock-based Pulaski
Baptist Association unanimously adopted a resolution of support for
Immanuel Baptist and its pastor, Rex Horne, ``allowing them to
conduct their ministry as they see fit under the direction of God's
Holy Spirit.''
</P>
<P>
   The moral dimension of Clinton's conduct raises the question of
how churches deal with errant members, especially if their behavior
has become common knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   Religious leaders generally agree that some sort of discipline
is necessary to maintain moral integrity. E. Brooks Holifield,
professor of church history at Candler School of Theology in
Atlanta, said Christians began to regulate their behavior as early
as the second century and that all Christian denominations have
practiced it.
</P>
<P>
   Into the 19th and early 20th centuries, it was common for
Protestant churches to reprimand or expel their members for
infractions such as angry outbursts or public drunkenness,
Holifield said.
</P>
<P>
   Some groups, such as the Amish and Mennonites, are still noted
for their strict observances. But enforcing discipline became
increasingly difficult for American churches.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things I've discovered about discipline in churches
is that they generally don't do it,'' said the Rev. Greg Champagne,
pastor of First Baptist Church in Brooksville, Fla., who wrote his
doctoral dissertation on the subject. ``It's so thorny, they just
avoid it.''
</P>
<P>
   Champagne said that because of past abuses, disciplining members
for moral infractions fell out of favor. ``It hasn't been practiced
consistently for 100 years. More and more generations haven't been
trained how to do it,'' he said. ``It's a lost art.''
</P>
<P>
   Most churches have disciplinary procedures. The United Methodist
Church and the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) have rule books that
spell out how to handle misconduct by clergy or laity. In fact,
Methodists call theirs ``The Book of Discipline.''
</P>
<P>
   Congregational or independent churches tend to rely on the
pattern spelled out in Matthew 18, where Jesus tells his followers
to begin with private confrontation and, if no repentance is
evident, to involve others in the effort to bring a sinner back to
the fold.
</P>
<P>
   As a last resort, the offender can be expelled from the church.
Although all churches have members who break one or more of the Ten
Commandments, few get thrown out.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Sherouse, pastor of Lakeside Baptist Church in Lakeland,
Fla., said he has never seen it carried that far in any of the
three churches he has served. There were cases, Sherouse said,
involving extramarital affairs in which the initial step was taken
of visiting the people involved, but instead of expulsion, the
members were eventually moved to an inactive or ``watch care''
list.
</P>
<P>
   People on watch care lists are still considered members of a
church, but may not hold positions of responsibility or vote in
congregational meetings. In Southern Baptist churches, it is up to
the board of deacons to decide if a member should be placed on
watch care or restored to full membership.
</P>
<P>
   Boulet saw a church he served in Scranton, Pa., threatened with
a lawsuit because of a vote to ``disfellowship'' a member. He said
the church should exercise discipline not because of delight in
pointing out others' failures but because the church carries a
responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's probably the most difficult thing to do as a pastor, but
if I see someone playing in traffic, I'm not going to let them get
hit,'' he said. ``If a guy is involved in an extramarital affair,
it's going to destroy his marriage, destroy lives. You have to
confront him with a spirit of meekness and say, TI care for you.'
''
</P>
<P>
   In cases where people are removed from church rolls, Boulet
said, it's not because of the sin committed but because the sinner
refused to admit the problem. ``If you're going to do it for the
sin itself, there wouldn't be anyone left in church,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   This kind of tough love is always aimed at bringing people back
into the church, not driving them off, pastors unanimously say.
Terry Rayburn, district superintendent of the Assemblies of God's
Peninsular Florida District Council, said, ``Our first response is
always toward reconciliation. We are in the ministry of the gospel
and the crux of that is forgiveness. If we don't practice it, we're
ridiculous hypocrites.''
</P>
<P>
   For Catholics, discipline is usually a matter of individual
conscience and the sacrament of reconciliation, popularly known as
confession. It's all done privately, said Sister Lucy Vazquez,
chancellor of the Diocese of Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   ``Conscience is our guide, but it should be formed. The hope is
that the church forms people from the time they're young to
recognize when they've fallen short. That motivates us to go to
confession,'' Vazquez said.
</P>
<P>
   In the sacrament, a priest acts as a mediator between the guilty
party and God, hears the confession of wrongdoing and prescribes a
penance _ prayers to be said or some action to correct the wrong.
Then he grants absolution and the offender is forgiven.
</P>
<P>
   Even in a case such as Clinton's, where a sin has become public
knowledge, a priest wouldn't necessarily seek out the person,
because he might have sought absolution in another parish.
</P>
<P>
   Excommunication _ which cuts off a Catholic from the sacraments
_ is a dramatic measure, but one rarely used, according to Vazquez.
It can be imposed by a bishop, as in cases of heresy, or fall
automatically as the result of certain offenses, like taking the
life of the pope, performing or having an abortion _ and even then
the person must be aware of the penalty beforehand.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's reluctance to admit to his affair points to one of the
main obstacles in exercising discipline: the shame factor.
</P>
<P>
   Diana Butler Bass, assistant professor of religion at Rhodes
College in Memphis, said the strict rules observed by the Puritans
were gradually relaxed as settlements expanded and it became easy
to escape the shame of church censure simply by moving.
</P>
<P>
   ``Peer pressure was the most effective form of discipline, like
shunning people who got divorced, but it was informal pressure
rather than formal censure,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Freedom of choice poses the same problem today for church
discipline. A couple facing a reprimand could simply go to another
church that would ask no questions about moving their membership.
</P>
<P>
   ``All church discipline has got to be based on a covenant where
I willingly submit myself to this family,'' Champagne said. ``As
long as it functions within a covenant, discipline can be done.''
</P>
<P>
   But even in a simpler era, in which Methodist, Presbyterian and
Baptist preachers thundered about the evils of drinking, dancing
and card-playing, discipline was only intermittently practiced.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a large genre of American church literature about the
lack of church discipline. Mohler's jeremiad might fit in that,''
said Bass with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   The issue represents a struggle between popular culture and
attempts by clergy to reassert control over standards of behavior,
swinging between permissiveness and more restrictive attitudes,
Bass said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Popular culture,'' she said, ``almost always tends to win
out.''

 &HT;    The decision of the United States and its NATO allies to strike
Yugoslavia is a very dangerous step fraught with unpredictable
consequences not only for Europe but for the whole world. Let us
call a spade a spade; it's an aggression.
 &HT;    War has effectively been declared on a sovereign state going
through an internal conflict. The behavior of the Yugoslav
government in the conflict and in the talks aimed at settling it
deserves, at the very least, severe criticism.
 &HT;    But the fact remains: NATO's military action is a blatant
violation of international law. The U.N. Charter permits such
action only in self-defense or with authority from the U.N.
Security Council. Neither was present.
 &HT;    What the Western alliance led by the United States is in effect
saying is that might is right and it wants a monopoly position in
the world power system. Clearly, a ``victory complex'' is at work
here, born of the heady conviction that the West won the Cold War.
But in international affairs, superiority complexes can be at least
as dangerous as inferiority complexes. ``Acting with resolve''
should imply a great sense of responsibility and vision.
 &HT;    Western negotiators in the talks on Kosovo settlement told us
again and again that without the threat of force the talks would go
nowhere. It is now clear that the threat was counterproductive.
Instead of recognizing the failure of that course and persevering
in a search for compromise, NATO is compounding the mistake. We are
now being told that bombs and cruise missiles will help to
``prevent a humanitarian catastrophe in Kosovo'' _ an argument that
is nothing but thinly veiled hypocrisy.
 &HT;    The use of force always points to a fiasco of policy and
policy-makers. Even when, in early 1991, there was legal
justification for the use of force against Iraq, I insisted on the
use of all political means and stressed that the military operation
could be avoided. Today, we see that Western politicians are making
a habit of using force. But is it not clear that this has not made
the world more secure?
 &HT;    It is amazing how quickly the United States and NATO have fallen
into a double standard in assessing internal conflicts and ways of
solving them. I won't cite the all-too-familiar examples where such
conflicts _ and even some governments' waging war on their own
people _ caused but a mild rebuke from the United States. Was it
alliance ties that influenced the response, or perhaps fear of
becoming involved in a conflict fraught with the risk of major
American casualties?
 &HT;    There are dozens of conflicts and crises, raging or latent, in
the world today. Should air strikes and military operations be used
to deal with all those conflicts? What would be the outcome of
that? Could it be another Cold War?
 &HT;    I urge Western policy-makers to give thought to these questions.
I endorse Russia's firm stand against the use of force. True,
Russia is no longer a superpower, but that kind of strength is not
the only factor that makes for strong policies.
 &HT;    Yevgeni Primakov's decision to cancel his visit to Washington
was dramatic and probably difficult to take, but I believe it was
right under the circumstances. For the West, it would be another
mistake to try to ``punish'' Russia for this position of principle.
I think that acting in this way, Russia is defending not just its
own interests.
 &HT;    There is still room for a political solution to the conflict.
Every opportunity should be used. A way has to be found out of a
situation brought about by wrongheaded policies. The problem must
be examined by the U.N. Security Council, and a negotiating
mechanism should be recreated.
 &HT;    I call upon the Yugoslav government to accept the political part
of the agreement worked out in Paris and to discuss a mechanism for
its implementation that would involve the participation of the
international community. Russia could play a major constructive
role in this process, whose resumption is indispensable if we are
not to slip into another Cold War.

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    PARIS _ Talking about Kosovo, an unnamed foreign policy adviser
to President Bill Clinton pointed out, ``There are massive
bloodbaths all over the world and we're not intervening in them.
...(But) this one's in the heart of Europe.''
 &HT;    Nobody could say the United States was straining at the leash to
blast Serb forces. Nobody could say that it failed to support an
effort for a political solution or that it charged alone without
full consultation and participation of allies.
 &HT;    In fact, the West's reluctance to resort to force has been made
clear at every step since Slobodan Milosevic launched an armed
campaign against the Kosovars a year ago, so much so that NATO came
under severe criticism for ``bluffing'' on its intention to bomb.
 &HT;    And yet, by any conventional definition of international rules,
the attack is an act of aggression against a sovereign state.
Further, Serbia argues that the West has it all wrong, that
actually Serb troops and police are only putting down rebellious
terrorists within their own borders and, what's more, it's nobody
else's business.
 &HT;    That argument doesn't hold today. The new air strikes do show a
profound change in the Euro-American community, a change in
attitude, analysis and ambition. During the war in Bosnia,
government leaders were ridiculed and maligned for failing to stop
the massacres; repeatedly they vowed to do something, waffled and
backed down.
 &HT;    This time we were told again and again that the Western powers
could not simply sit on their hands and let it happen again. Not to
intervene would be a form of collusion with repression _ with the
scorched-earth, ethnic cleansing policy of Milosevic.
 &HT;    The decision to act, not to tolerate a repetition of Bosnia,
shows the gradual evolution of a sense of responsibility,
humanitarian obligation, political need and moral duty. When the
Serbian parliament learned its only choice was to admit foreign
troops to impose peace in Kosovo or be bombed, a question was
raised: Why bomb?
 &HT;    The answer is that there is a new consensus that limits must be
set on outrageous national behavior. Those limits haven't yet been
strictly defined, but they are being drawn now.
 &HT;    At first, France had insisted that action could be taken only
with a U.N. Security Council mandate. But this was impossible
because Russia, which has a veto, is opposed to any attack on
Serbia. That left the question _ how many civilians have to die to
pass the threshold of circumstance? There have already been too

the NATO military plan.
 &HT;    There is currently a kind of interim stage in the understanding

precedent.
 &HT;    There are all kinds of risks, not only military and of widening
the war. Relations with Russia will be seriously set back, and this
will affect pending agreements on nuclear arms control as well as
controversial sales of missiles to Iran. The very fate of NATO is
being challenged.
 &HT;    No doubt Moscow would not have minded seeing NATO weakened by
inaction and internal dispute, but it isn't happening. When they
thought it over, the alliance members fixed on priorities. They
decided that because there is a real feeling of need for minimal
standards of how to treat people in Europe, a reaction must occur
when they are violated.
 &HT;    It doesn't matter that Yugoslavia is not directly threatening
any other recognized state. It is bad for the neighborhood. To
punish Milosovic for that is a big step beyond tradition, and the
decision will cast a serious shadow on the argument about NATO's
new mandate. Nobody likes making America ``the global policeman,''
but neither can Europe ignore troubles in its region.
 &HT;    Why do only European conflicts get the benefit of this new
maturing responsibility for peace? Is it a sign of racism to ignore
those other bloodbaths? Maybe. However, Europe's willingness with
America to act at last is surely a sign that people can change,
that this continent has had its fill of wars. It's a shame to have
to bomb to prove it, but it must be proved.

 &HT;    PARIS _ Talking about Kosovo, an unnamed foreign policy adviser
to President Bill Clinton pointed out, ``There are massive
bloodbaths all over the world and we're not intervening in them.
...(But) this one's in the heart of Europe.''
 &HT;    Nobody could say the United States was straining at the leash to
blast Serb forces. Nobody could say that it failed to support an
effort for a political solution or that it charged alone without
full consultation and participation of allies.
 &HT;    In fact, the West's reluctance to resort to force has been made
clear at every step since Slobodan Milosevic launched an armed
campaign against the Kosovars a year ago, so much so that NATO came
under severe criticism for ``bluffing'' on its intention to bomb.
 &HT;    And yet, by any conventional definition of international rules,
the attack is an act of aggression against a sovereign state.
Further, Serbia argues that the West has it all wrong, that
actually Serb troops and police are only putting down rebellious
terrorists within their own borders and, what's more, it's nobody
else's business.
 &HT;    That argument doesn't hold today. The new air strikes do show a
profound change in the Euro-American community, a change in
attitude, analysis and ambition. During the war in Bosnia,
government leaders were ridiculed and maligned for failing to stop
the massacres; repeatedly they vowed to do something, waffled and
backed down.
 &HT;    This time we were told again and again that the Western powers

CAMPUSES TOIL WITH FOOTNOTE OF INTERNET AGE: TERM PAPERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ANDREW BROWNSTEIN  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The good news about higher education is this:
Shakespeare, Euripides and other icons of Western civilization are
still being taught in universities throughout the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The bad news is that a lot of students aren't reading them.
</P>
<P>
   With as many as 70 Internet Web sites offering term papers for
as much as $200 each, the procrastinators who once scoured
fraternity files or hoarded Cliff Notes are now finding that
cheating comes on-line.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet enablers are not subtle. With names like ``School
Sucks'' or ``The Evil House of Cheat,'' they're not exactly
marketing to members of Mensa.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find it pretty offensive,'' said Brad Lewis, associate dean
for undergraduate education at Union College in Schenectady, N.Y.
``It shows total contempt for the whole academic enterprise.''
</P>
<P>
   The phenomenon will receive its first official study this spring
when the Center for Academic Integrity at Duke University examines
cheating at 12 universities.
</P>
<P>
   Rutgers University Professor Donald McCabe, who founded the
center, has previously conducted studies showing that nearly 70
percent of students cheat in college. The ease and anonymity of the
Internet can only have increased that percentage, he said recently.
</P>
<P>
   ``The use of the Internet for plagiarism purposes is clearly on
the rise,'' McCabe said. ``But I don't think people fully
understand it yet. There's a lot of conversation, but very little
action.''
</P>
<P>
   On-line services vary greatly in quality and price. Some charge
nothing _ simply gathering a class's essays and posting them to
read. Others offer teams of ``experts'' who custom-design papers
and require a credit card to browse. Some employ complex search
engines with offerings as diverse as ``Castration as a Metaphor''
and ``The Epic Poetry of Medieval Ireland.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Gotta deadline?'' asks one of the more prosaic sites,
schoolsucks.com. ``Click here for research papers online.''
</P>
<P>
   Kenny Sahr, the 27-year-old college drop-out who runs the site,
makes little attempt to vouch for the quality of his papers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could be turning out garbage,'' he said in a telephone
interview from his home in Tel Aviv, Israel. ``If the papers in
schoolsucks are bad, and professors are accepting them, that's a
reflection of our higher education system.''
</P>
<P>
   Academics are divided on how to deal with on-line cheating.
</P>
<P>
   By far the most extreme response came from Boston University,
which filed a federal racketeering lawsuit against five on-line
term paper mills in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Employing a graduate student, BU discovered that these companies
were willing to send papers even when the student made it clear she
would falsely claim the work as her own. Some sent papers tailored
to student's exact specifications.
</P>
<P>
   The case was thrown out by a federal judge in November, but the
university plans to refile at the state level.
</P>
<P>
   Some professors, in an effort to catch cheaters, are employing
the cheat's own high-tech tools. If a phrase seems a little too
witty or too pithy for a particular student, the professor can plug
it into a term paper search engine and find the paper from which it
was taken.
</P>
<P>
   That's how a Union College English professor caught a Web-cheat
last spring. By plugging one phrase into a search engine, the
teacher found the suspect paper.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took about 15 seconds,'' Lewis said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago-based Glatt Plagiarism Services offers the software
equivalent of a mandatory drug test with a program that copies
student papers with every fifth word missing. Professors can call
their suspect students into the office and ask that they fill in
the missing words.
</P>
<P>
   Most educators, however, have reacted to the Internet
controversy with typical academic introspection. Some blame the
large lecture format, which sometimes offers all of the intimacy of
a rock concert.
</P>
<P>
   If cribbed papers pass muster, observers say, that's a sign that
a professor doesn't know his students _ and therein lies the
problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Students suggest to us that the less personal the relationship
with the professor, the less guilty they feel about cheating,''
McCabe said.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Simon, who runs the Expository Writing Program at Skidmore
College in Saratoga Springs, N.Y., asks her students to submit
several drafts, lists of sources and thesis statements _ procedures
that promote good writing while preventing cheating.
</P>
<P>
   ``In order to cheat, the student would have to download it, mess
it up, and then submit it,'' she said. ``By that point, it's almost
worth writing your own paper.''

   SCI-HAU-PHYSICS (Undated) _ Scientist at Work: Dr. Lene
Vestergaard Hau, a teacher at Harvard, has gained a formidable
reputation in a branch of science traditionally dominated by men:
physics. But most of all, she is known as the scientist who slowed
light down to a walk. Perfectly at home with such subjects as
quantum mechanics, Hilbert spaces and Bose-Einstein condensates,
Dr. Hau, at 39, is rapidly reaching the top of her profession, her
colleagues agree. By Malcolm W. Browne. (1850 words)

   With photo and graphic.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-INDIAN-ECOLOGY (Undated) _ Many experts have abandoned the
concept that Lewis and Clark explored a pristine land of the nature
untouched. In fact, evidence now suggests, Native American peoples
had a profound effect on the land and animals, driving some species
near extinction in vast homeland areas with expert hunting skills.
But in buffer zones between warring tribes, where hunters feared
spending time, game thrived, in effect becoming game preserves
where most species survived in narrow areas between warring
nations. The war-zone theory is laid out in the most recent issue
of the journal Conservation Biology, partly explaining why bison,
elk, deer and bears escaped the fate of other, even bigger North
American animal species that became extinct some 13,000 years ago,
which may have been hunted to extinction in a continentwide
blitzkriegs. By William K. Stevens. (1725 words)

   SCI-DOCTORS-SELLING (Undated) _ Patients, doctors and
professional groups around the country are increasingly unsettled
by a trend toward merchandising in medical offices, attributing it
to physicians' desire to supplement incomes that have been squeezed
by managed care. No statistics are available to indicate how
widespread the practice is, but doctors' groups are quietly
drafting policies about when selling items to patients is an
acceptable part of medical practice. By Abigail Zuger. (2000 words)

   SCI-FOX-EVOLUTION (Undated) _ Experimenters have rushed
evolution to produce a new breed of fox _ one that whines for
attention from human beings without any prior conditioning, licks
its masters' faces, and has even begun to look something like a
domestic dog. In a long-term experiment at a Siberian fur farm,
geneticists have created this new version of Vulpes vulpes _ the
silver fox _ by allowing only the friendliest animals from each
generation to breed. Having selected only the most ``tamable'' of
some 45,000 foxes over 35 generations, the scientists have
compressed into a mere 40 years an evolutionary process that took
thousands of years to transform ancestral wolves into domestic
dogs. By Malcolm W. Browne. (1200 words)

   SCI-GALACTIC-CORES (Undated) _ Before its infrared camera shut

stars are being born. By John Noble Wilford. (440 words)

   SCI-CHOOSING-MATES (Undated) _ Essay. Evolutionary psychology
and other branches of science explain what people want in terms of
a mate. But in reality, people choose mates (or have them chosen
for them), in myriad ways. Our brains are not designed specifically
to desire this or that, but to weigh the options, and then get down
to the business of having babies. By Meredith Small. (1750 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-LANGUAGE (Undated) _ The Berinmo language of Papua New
Guinea categorizes colors with just five words. This makes the
tribe a good subject for studying a linguistic concept that first
gained wide currency in the 1950's. Called the linguistic
relativity hypothesis, it argues that humans see the world less
with their eyes than with their language. Each language filters
experience differently, and thus there are no universal principles
of meaning. By Henry Fountain. (650 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-WATCH (Undated) _ Items on clothing that may absorb
pesticides, pesticides in the water supply and a glowing form of E.
coli used for keep pesticides out of the food chain. (675 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-BRODY-HEALTH (Undated) _ The Personal Health column:
Breast-feeding has enjoyed a well-deserved burst in popularity in
recent decades, when pediatric specialists finally succeeded in
overcoming the commercial pressures on modern women to feed their
babies formula. However, lately the numbers have been dropping from
their peak, and now only about 60 percent of mothers are nursing
their babies when they leave the hospital and only 30 percent are
still nursing six months later. By the end of this year according
to the goals set in Healthy People 2000, the Surgeon General had
hoped that three-fourths of all new mothers would be nursing when
they take their babies home. By Jane E. Brody. (1250 words)

</P>
<P>
   SCI-SWEAT-SURGERY (Undated) _ A little-known disease afflicts
more than 200,000 Americans: hyperhidrosis _ the production of
chronic, drenching sweat. People with the disease drip water from
their hands, feet or underarms, and sometimes even their chest or
back. But now an operation called sympathectomy, in which surgeons
snip the sympathetic nerve chain that causes the excess sweating,
eliminates the problem. By Anne Eisenberg. (700 words)

</P>
<P>
   SCI-CONTRACEPTIVE-SPONGE (Undated) _ The contraceptive sponge,
once the most popular nonprescription birth control device for
women, could be available once more on drugstore shelves by fall.
The Today Sponge, a convenient and well-liked contraceptive that
was sold from 1983 until 1995, is scheduled to make a comeback
through the efforts of a small pharmaceutical company which
purchased the rights to the product from the manufacturer that
earlier ceased production of it. By Warren E. Leary) (1350 words)

   SCI-EBOLA-VIRUS (Undated) _ The early moments after patients are

<P>
   _ Teen-agers fretting over how they look may not be just going
through a phase. Some may be suffering from body dysmorphic
disorder. This often secret and little recognized malady that can
lead to dropping out of school, shunning social contacts and even
suicide, say a Brown University research team. (400 words)
</P>
<P>
   _ The researchers found that 3 percent of the men reported
having had nonconsensual sexual experiences as adults, and 5
percent said they had been sexually abused as children.
Surprisingly, when the abuse occurred in adulthood, women were just
as likely to be the perpetrators as men, the researchers found,
while men were the most frequent perpetrators of abuse in children.

   SCI-HELICOPTER-SKIING (Undated) _ The Novice. Learning what's
commonly called helicopter skiing, in which participants fly by

methods and basic body stance. By Holcomb B. Noble (900 words)

   SCI-MEN-FERTILITY (Undated) _ A popular technique to help
infertile men become fathers results in an abnormal process of
fertilization, researchers have found. While it is not clear
whether there are any effects on the babies conceived with the
method, the finding is expected to raise troubling questions. The
technique is called ICSI, for intercytoplasmic sperm injection.
Instead of allowing sperm to swim up to an egg and penetrate it on
their own, doctors directly inject a sperm cell into an egg. Now,
researchers have determined that ICSI risks damaging the proteins
that push and pull chromosomes into line before cell division and
that it skews the egg's otherwise orderly removal of proteins from
sperm. By Gina Kolata. (1200 words)

   SCI-Q&AMP;A (Undated) _ Why are the orbits of the Sun's planets

billion years ago. (284 words)

DANGER PART OF JOB FOR ELITE AIR FORCE RESCUE UNIT

 By COLUM LYNCH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Their motto _ ``that others may live'' _ may seem a
bit melodramatic. But the elite US Air Force pararescue unit that
penetrated deep behind Serbian lines to rescue the first downed
pilot of NATO's air war against the former Yugoslavia lived up to
the billing.
</P>
<P>
   The secret operation Saturday night transformed a major military
loss _ the first crash in combat of the super-secret F-117 Stealth
fighter _ into an emotional boost for the NATO allies.
</P>
<P>
   Within hours of the crash, a team of Air Force special
operations commandos headed into action under the cover of night in
a squadron of fixed-wing aircraft as well as HH-60 Black Hawk and
HH-53 Super Jolly Green helicopters.
</P>
<P>
   The mission, which snagged the American pilot within six hours,
signaled the latest achievement for one of the most decorated units
in the US military.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon officials say that a series of technological advances,
including night-vision devices and the global positioning system,
have enabled the United States to carry out search and rescue
operations unimaginable in previous wars. A pilot can transmit a
radio beacon through one of a number of spy satellites.
</P>
<P>
   ``We now have the capability of learning the precise location of
a downed pilot,'' Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said. ``And we
have a bunch of well-trained, brave people willing at a moment's
notice to fly into enemy territory under fire, facing unknown
risks, and succeed.''
</P>
<P>
   Bacon said the Pentagon was not releasing any details about the
operation out of concern that it would help the Serbs thwart future
rescue missions.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second successful rescue of a stranded American in
the Balkans in four years. In June 1995, a US Marine rescue team
plucked Captain Scott O'Grady out of the Bosnian woods and the
clutches of Bosnian Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Trainers at the US Air Force rescue base outside Albuquerque
said they are well aware of the risks in their profession. Members
of the unit have won 10 of the 19 Air Force Crosses awarded, the
highest mark of bravery for the service.
</P>
<P>
   Two of those awarded _ Tim Wilkinson and Scott Fales _ earned
the medals for their work the bloody ambush that killed 18
servicemen in Mogadishu, Somalia in October 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The commandos were dropped into the middle of a raging gunbattle
in an attempt to administer first aid to a team of US Rangers and
Delta Force commandos, according to Mark Bowden, the author of
Black Hawk Down, an account of the operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fales was injured early on but he continued to provide first
aid to the others and fight to set up a perimeter,'' Bowden said.
``Wilkinson's training and cool'' contributed to saving the lives
of a number of the Americans, added Bowden.
</P>
<P>
   The latest successes of the unit show how far the Air Force has
come since airpower debuted in World War I. In those days, the best
a downed combat pilot could hope for was a safe life as a prisoner.
</P>
<P>
   The US Air Force formed its first rescue operation in the summer
of 1943, when 21 people bailed out of a disabled C-46 transport
plane over remote jungle near the Chinese-Burmese border. Three
rescuers dropped out of the skies with first aid kits and tended to
the wounded for more than a month. Among the survivors: newsman
Eric Severeid.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a volunteer force,'' said Sergeant Joseph Barnard, an
instructor at the US Air Force rescue center in Albuquerque. ``We
understand we are willing to put our lives on the line for somebody
else.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When something has gone wrong or someone is in bad shape,''
said Master Sergeant Brian Stephens, the director of the training
center. ``That's when we get the 8 o'clock wake-up call.''

NATO UNITS WONDER WHEN US TROOPS WILL ARRIVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SKOPJE, Macedonia _ As they wait here for the Serb attack that
may or may not come, NATO commanders and soldiers have one
question: Where are the Yanks?
</P>
<P>
   Of the leading countries that have committed troops to the
Kosovo peace implementation force, only the Americans are not part
of the ground force in neighboring Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   As they have engaged in a mutual game of ``chicken'' with Serb
forces dug in just over the border in Kosovo, NATO troops say they
want Americans with them to deter a Serb attack.
</P>
<P>
   European politicians share the frustration of their troops that
as they attempt to stare down Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   While US pilots are at the forefront of airstrikes against the
Serbs, the absence of US ground troops here is raising questions
about the solidarity of the NATO alliance. It also has prompted the
divisive suggestion that there are two sets of rules for NATO
forces: one for the Americans, another for everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration said it would contribute up to 4,000
troops to a 28,000-member peacekeeping force, but insisted on
waiting until the Serbs signed the deal that ethnic Albanians
approved in Paris two weeks ago before deploying them. Now, as the
threat of the conflict spilling over grows, the administration is
seeking congressional approval to get troops here to deter Serb
attacks, or retaliate if they do.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking privately, NATO officers say that one of their American
colleagues from the Allied Command Europe Rapid Reaction Corps,
based in Germany, arrived in Macedonia with them three weeks ago
but was ordered back by American superiors. ``He was as frustrated
about it as we were,'' said one senior NATO officer.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, President Clinton said he had authorized the
deployment of 100 Marines to protect the US Embassy here after it
was stormed and heavily damaged by a pro-Serbian mob. Clinton also
said US officers in Germany could join colleagues in Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   Between 30 and 40 US officers, part of the Allied Command Europe
Rapid Reaction Corps, are expected to arrive here in the next few
days, said Major Jan Joosten, a NATO officer in Skopje.
</P>
<P>
   There also are about 300 US troops who have just finished a UN
mission of guarding the Macedonian border, but Joosten said it was
unclear whether those troops will be put under NATO command here.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has said he would ask Congress for approval to move US
peacekeepers into Macedonia. That those troops are not here already
is a subject of irritation among some 10,000 British, French,
German, Italian, and Dutch soldiers who have been here a month.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why the Americans were not here already, Joosten, a Dutch
officer, said: ``That is a congressional matter. I can tell you our
American colleagues want to be here.''
</P>
<P>
   The official NATO line is that Milosevic's troops would be
foolish to fire across the border at NATO troops in Macedonia.
First, it would make moot Milosevic's argument against accepting
the peace plan. Milosevic contends that NATO's insistence that its
troops are needed in Kosovo to enforce the settlement violates his
nation's sovereignty. Firing into Macedonia would violate its
sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   The situation here is volatile. Unlike UN peacekeepers in
Bosnia, NATO troops operate under rules of engagement that give
them far more leeway to respond if attacked. Put bluntly, if Serb
forces fire across into Macedonia, NATO will unleash a ferocious
counterattack.
</P>
<P>
   The danger of the conflict spilling over throughout the Balkans
is serious, underscoring the frustration among European NATO troops
here that the Americans are absent.
</P>
<P>
   There are 4,000 British, 3,000 German, 2,500 French, 800
Italian, and 200 Dutch troops in Macedonia. Interviews with the
troops suggest they believe the Clinton administration is so unsure
of congressional and popular support for its Kosovo policy that it
did not want to risk having troops here vulnerable to retaliation
from the airstrikes.
</P>
<P>
   Others suggest the delay is because of an institutional flap
over US troops for the first time being under the direct command of
a European general.
</P>
<P>
   Breaking with precedent, US troops here would be under the
command of British General Mike Jackson. The Clinton administration
made that concession in exchange for keeping the US troop level
lower. The British and French will supply the bulk of troops, if
the peacekeeping plan is implemented.
</P>
<P>
   Some officers say they understand US sensitivities. They believe
the legacy of Vietnam informs the reluctance to get involved in
foreign conflicts in which US interests are ill-defined. They also
believe Americans do not have a realistic appreciation of the
inherent dangers of military operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The British people accept, I think more than Americans, that
this is a dangerous business and soldiers get killed,'' said
Lieutenant Colonel Andrew Venus, a British officer. ``In every year
since the end of World War II, except 1963, British soldiers have
been killed in combat.''
</P>
<P>
   While there is grumbling about the reticence of the Clinton
administration, European officers and soldiers speak with
admiration for US troops, with a grudging acknowledgement that the
Americans make them a far more formidable force.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need the Americans,'' Joosten said. ``They have equipment
and technology that we don't. They are very much part of this
alliance.''

THE TRAIN THAT TOLD A TALE OF YOUGOSLAVIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALAN LUPO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The year is 1965. The place, on the old Orient Express, out of
Milan on its way to Athens via Marshal Tito's Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The train cars are old, the dining car windows covered with
thick, plush drapes; the meals are meat and potatoes, as thick as
the midsummer Balkan heat. There are no cold drinks, just bottles
of warm, fruity liquid, too thick, heavy as applesauce.
</P>
<P>
   The toilets have stopped functioning. Peasants sit on the
floors. A chicken roams one car. Yugoslav guards, dressed in dull
brown uniforms with black boots and belts and red stars on their
caps, wander about. They are unsmiling, like caricatures from a
newspaper cartoon.
</P>
<P>
   In an airless compartment containing eight passengers, Yugoslav
citizens ask an American to claim ownership of what they had bought
in Paris, so they would not encounter problems with those
brown-suited guards. What they bought includes an accordion. The
American fears a guard will say, ``This is yours? Play something,''
and the tourist will spend the next two decades in a cell, learning
Balkan folk songs.
</P>
<P>
   The guards, however, do not care about Americans, and the
American tourists never bother to ask if the accordion's owners are
Serbs, Croats, Bosnians, for this was Tito's nation, and he
repressed any hint of ethnic nationalism.
</P>
<P>
   That was then. Now, the successors to the guardians of whatever
remains of Yugoslavia care much about Americans and their allies.
Missiles and bombs these past four days have focused their
attention.
</P>
<P>
   We are at war in the Balkans, which means we are ending the
century pretty much as it started. That fact is fraught with
historic irony, not only because Balkan violence triggered the
Great War, which set the stage for the rest of this century, but
also because at the onset of this century, many Europeans believed
there could be no more war on a continent that had known little
else.
</P>
<P>
   They pointed to a 1910 book, ``The Great Illusion,'' by Norman
Angell, which, as historian Barbara Tuchman recounted in her own
work ``The Guns of August,'' contended that war was impossible.
After all, Angell argued, the financial interdependence of nations
meant both winners and losers would suffer equally.
</P>
<P>
   Factor in the belief that the 20th century would be one of
enlightenment and scientific achievement, and one could have
concluded that war was out of the question.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as we prepare for the 21st century, we marvel at
technological achievement and its promise for the future, we talk
of a global economy, of interdependence. The European Union exists,
a miracle in the light of that continent's history. Yet now, as
then, it seems nobody counted on the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   Well, almost nobody. Late in the last century, Otto von
Bismarck, chancellor of the German Empire, predicted that ``some
damned foolish thing in the Balkans'' would trigger a war.
</P>
<P>
   That is precisely what happened, when, on June 28, 1914, a
Serbian nationalist killed Austrian Archduke Franz Ferdinand in
Sarajevo, thereby setting off a chain of events that propelled
nations and empires, against the inclinations of their own common
sense, into World War I.
</P>
<P>
   For Americans, history is symbolized by what clothes, what music
marked the era. For the Serbs, Croats, Albanians, Montenegrans,
Slovenes, Macedonians, Bosnians, Gypsies, and others in the
Balkans, history is a compendium of centuries of warfare,
repression, revenge, blood feuds, and unredressed grievances.
</P>
<P>
   In his 1936 book ``Inside Europe,'' John Gunther wrote, ``The
basic passion of most Balkan folk is nationalism. Their primitive
and turbulent energies are directed to the preservation of their
own political minority or country, rather than social revolution;
nationalism is the pipe through which their energies are
discharged.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody knows that phenomenon better than Slobodan Milosevic, the
Serbian strongman. More than a half-century after Gunther's work
appeared, Robert D. Kaplan, in his book ``Balkan Ghosts,'' echoed
the theme as he described Milosevic's secret to retaining power:
</P>
<P>
   ``The only Eastern European Communist leader in the late 1980s
who managed to save himself and his party from collapse did so by
making a direct appeal to racial hatred.''
</P>
<P>
   So, it is again in the Balkans, in Serbia, Croatia, Bosnia, and
now Kosovo, that the renewed optimism of a new century crashes
head-on with a bloodied history of resentment that seems to forever
defy both closure and the forces of enlightenment evident elsewhere
in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The Balkans are like an ancient, airless railroad car, its
windows to the modern world covered with thick drapes.

COURT REFUSES TO EXAMINE CONDEMNED AFFIRMATIVE ACTION PROGRAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a blow to affirmative action supporters, the
Supreme Court refused Monday to review a program once used by the
Dallas Fire Department to promote more blacks, Hispanics and women.
</P>
<P>
   The justices, with two dissenting votes, let stand a ruling by
the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals that struck down the program
saying it discriminated against white men.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Supreme Court's refusal to examine the program does
not set a precedent, the denial was another indication that the
justices believe only narrowly-tailored affirmative action programs
are constitutional.
</P>
<P>
   Voting to review the program, Justice Stephen Breyer said his
colleagues should use the case to resolve seemly conflicting
rulings by lower federal courts. ``In light of the many affirmative
action plans in effect throughout the nation, the question
presented ... is an important one,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg joined Breyer in his dissent. The
votes of four of the court's nine members are needed to approve the
review of a case.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the court refused to review another ruling by the 5th
Circuit Court that barred universities in the states under its
jurisdiction _ Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi _ from considering
race in admitting students.
</P>
<P>
   A year earlier, the Supreme Court ruled 5-4 that race-based
federal programs must undergo ``strict scrutiny'' by the courts. To
survive, they must serve a compelling governmental interest and
must be narrowly tailored to address identifiable past
discrimination, the high court held. A month later, in July 1995,
President Clinton endorsed the government's preference program,
saying, ``Mend it, but don't end it.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1998 the city of Dallas adopted a five-year plan for
promoting qualified blacks, Hispanics and women ahead of white men
who had scored higher on the fire department's promotion tests.
</P>
<P>
   But the plan provided that no more than half of the promotions
to any one rank could be made under the affirmative action plan.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, white men comprised 85 percent of all
driver-engineer jobs within the department and 97 percent of the
103 lieutenant positions. Five years after the plan was
implemented, those percentages dropped to 77 percent and 88
percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, the city council voted to extend the plan for another
five years. But between 1991 and 1994, the Dallas Fire Fighters
Association and 33 of its white and American-Indian male members
sued the city, alleging that the program itself promoted racial and
gender discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   City officials said the affirmative action program was needed to
remedy past discrimination against blacks, Hispanics and women that
had been proved in 1976 by the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   But a federal judge ruled against the city and invalidated the
program. That decision was upheld last August by the 5th Circuit
Court of Appeals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The record is devoid of proof of a history of egregious and
pervasive discrimination or resistance to affirmative action that
has warranted more serious measures in other cases,'' Chief Judge
Henry A. Politz said in the appeals court ruling.
</P>
<P>
   The city appealed the decision to the Supreme Court, saying in
its brief, ``One cannot seriously argue that after decades of
exclusion ... that the lingering present effects of past
discrimination are not a reality today.''
</P>
<P>
   But on Monday the high court refused to hear the Dallas appeal.

A NEW TERRITORY, WITH OLD PROBLEMS

<P>
   IQALUIT, Northwest Territories _ Already the hunters are fanning
out across the frozen tundra to bag sufficent caribou for a feast
the likes of which has never been seen in Canada's Arctic. There
will be fireworks, much chest-thumping, and grand oratory. There
will be drum dancing and traditional throat singing.
</P>
<P>
   On April 1, the eastern half of the Northwest Territories splits
off to form the new territory of Nunavut: ``Our Land'' in the
language of the Inuit, or Eskimos, who comprise 85 percent of the
27,200 inhabitants of one of the most remote, forbidding, and
sparsely inhabited regions on earth.
</P>
<P>
   The creation of the territory marks the beginning of a bold and
risky experiment in native self-government, one that has fired the
hopes of aboriginal people around the world, from the Maori of New
Zealand to the Mohawks of New York. For Nunavut is not to be just
another tribal reserve. It will be both a full-fledged Canadian
territory, governed by its own 19-member legislature, as well as
North America's first true Inuit homeland.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are walking around with big smiles on their faces,''
said John Amagoalik, an Inuit leader who has worked so long toward
this day he is often called ``the Father of Nunavut.'' ``Finally,
we will have our own government, one which speaks our language,
understands our history, and knows our priorities.''
</P>
<P>
   He did add: ``But people are also nervous and maybe even a
little frightened of what lies ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   With good reason.
</P>
<P>
   Nunavut might be a symbol of hope, but it is also a stronghold
of despair. On the instant of its birth, it becomes the poorest
territory, by far, in Canada _ a welfare basket case where
desperate social conditions are made even worse by physical
isolation and brutal climate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nunavut will be a rude awakening for many,'' said Goo
Arlookto, an Inuit leader. ``Too many people have convinced
themselves that their lives are going to change immediately, as if
having a territory to call our own is some miracle that will make
groceries cheap and give everyone a job. In reality, this is just
the first step of a long, long journey.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the emergence of Nunavut will mark the first
significant redrawing of the map of Canada since Newfoundland quit
the British Empire in 1949 to become the 10th province.
</P>
<P>
   Celebrations will be held in each of the 28
</P>
<P>
   settlements scattered across a territory stretch
</P>
<P>
   ing nearly 2000 miles from Belcher Island in Hudson Bay to the
northern tip of Ellesmere Island, last
</P>
<P>
   stop before the North Pole. Nunavut encom
</P>
<P>
   passes 769,684 square miles, a region bigger
</P>
<P>
   than Alaska and the six New England states
</P>
<P>
   combined. From Resolution Island on Davis Strait to Banks Island
on the Beaufort Sea, the territory measures more than 1200 miles
east to west.
</P>
<P>
   But the epicenter of festivities will be in this ramshackle bush
metropolis perched on the permafrost. With 4,500 people plus a
hospital, weekly newspaper, government offices, a handful of
prospecting and adventure tourism outfits, a pair of tanning
salons, and two fast-food joints _ Pizza Hut and Kentucky Fried
Chicken _ Iqualit is far and away Nunavut's largest community and
will serve as the territorial capital.
</P>
<P>
   More than 1,000 foreign and Canadian dignitaries, plus an
onslaught of media, are expected to descend on Iqaluit. To cope,
snowmobiles are being pressed into taxi service while army cots are
set up in makeshift dormitories. Blue portable toilets have been
plunked into snowdrifts all over town, much to the hilarity of
Inuit children who jostle and wrestle for the right to christen
these latest strange contraptions from the south.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone's hoping for a mild spring day _ meaning, oh, a degree
or two on either side of zero, Farenheit. Which is to say
seasonable and even cozy if that cutthroat's razor of a north wind
would only back off a bit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Down in the States, I'm told, the TV weathermen are always
warning about `Canadian cold air masses' coming to chill
Americans,'' said Joannie Kaludjak. ``Nunavut is the land where
Canada's cold is born.''
</P>
<P>
   And if there's a blizzard on Nunavut's day? Well, the Inuit have
a word that covers every eventuality: ``ayurnamat,'' which roughly
translates into ``That's the way of it, can't be helped, better
luck next time.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all of the territory is tundra, the haunt of polar bears
and spectacular herds of caribou. No roads lead to Nunavut; the
only connections to the outside world are by air and supply ferries
that ply the Arctic sea lanes during the few months of semi-thaw
called summer.
</P>
<P>
   Dog sleds are mostly for tourists or resident ``qallunaat,''
white people, trying to prove themselves more native than the
natives. The most common form of transport is the snowmobile, whose
rip-roar has become as much a sound of the northland as the croak
of ravens and thunderous cracking of ocean ice.
</P>
<P>
   The territory's southernmost village, Sanikiluaq on Belcher
Island in Hudson Bay, lies 1,500 miles from the northernmost, Grise
Fiord in the High Arctic. But the far-flung communities are bound
by a common culture, and beset by the same daunting problems.
</P>
<P>
   Unemployment is officially reckoned to be 30 percent, but in
some villages nearly half the inhabitants subsist on government
doles. The suicide rate is six times the national average.
Alcoholism is epidemic, while aerosol highs and other
solvent-sniffing is off the charts; health officials peg it at 26
times levels of abuse elsewhere in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   The birth rate _ 29 births per 1,000, often to unwed teenagers _
is higher than Mexico's, and similar to that of developing
countries. More than half the population is under age 25, and
almost 40 percent of adults have less than a ninth-grade education.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've gone from igloos to e-mail in a generation, and the
changes have left some people stranded far behind,'' said Peter
Ernerk, Nunavut's deputy minister for culture and language. ``But
Inuit are also showing themselves very adapatable.''
</P>
<P>
   In a strange way, the geographical isolation of Nunavut has
proved a blessing for the Inuit. It has allowed them to keep their
culture far more intact than any other native society in North
America. The Inuktitut language is still going strong, for example,
and the survival of traditions gives the Inuit an identity and
confidence lacking on the battered Indian reservations of southern
Canada and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Partly for that reason, the Inuit struggle for a homeland has
been waged with extraordinary patience and good humor, with almost
none of the stridency and violence that has charged aboriginal
rights movements elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our attitude is, `Why make enemies when you can negotiate with
friends?' '' Amagoalik said. ``We like Canada and Canadians. We
want to be a part of Canada. We simply want to be our own part.''
</P>
<P>
   The Inuit are descendants of the Thule Eskimos who settled what
is now Canada's eastern Arctic after wandering into the region some
1000 years ago by way of the Bering Strait and Alaska. Aside from
occasional encounters with the intrepid Elizabethan mariners
seeking the Northwest Passage, there was little contact with the
outside world until whalers, missionaries, and traders with the
Hudson's Bay Company started arriving on the scene in the late
1800s.
</P>
<P>
   No white colonists coveted this merciless land, so no tricky
treaties were signed. Canada pretty much left the Inuit alone until
the 1950s and '60s, when the semi-nomadic people were more or less
compelled to settle in villages to make it easier for the
government to provide formal schooling, health care, and other
services. There was also an insidious reason: By moving Inuit to
artificial settlements in the High Arctic, Canada was better able
to argue that it had legitimate political claim to the far north, a
claim contested by both the United States and Soviet Union during
the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, Parliament approved the Nunavut Claims Agreement,
setting the stage for creation of the new territory and
guaranteeing the Inuit exclusive mineral rights to 35,000 square
miles of land believed to contain a treasure trove of metal ores
and oil.
</P>
<P>
   But for decades to come, even the most optimistic leaders
concede, non-Inuits will hold the best jobs as teachers, engineers,
health professionals, technicians, and bureaucrats simply because
there are too few natives with necessary skills and education. At
the same time, taxpayers in southern Canada will have to cover 95
percent of the estimated $500 million annual costs of running the
territory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is to diversify our economy, create jobs, and, above
all, educate our young people,'' said Paul Okalik, a 34-year-old
Inuit lawyer who this month was elected to become the first premier
of the territory, although he has no political experience. ``That
is the dream of Nunavut.''

GORE, NEW HAMPSHIRE GET TO KNOW ONE ANOTHER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, N.H. _ Al Gore slept here.
</P>
<P>
   Not in a hotel, but at Sylvia and Bob Larsen's grand white
colonial on the hill. The vice president went for a jog Saturday
morning with the neighbors, and he hung out with more people at
house parties in Concord, Manchester, and Nashua. He also stopped
for a cheese omelette at the Capital City Diner in Concord, and ate
lunch at Chez Vachon in Manchester, a French-Canadian greasy spoon.
</P>
<P>
   This is part of Gore's answer to the inevitability problem that
plagued Walter F. Mondale in 1984, and the identity problem that
dogged George Bush in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and his campaign team have been studying history, hoping to
avoid the pitfalls of former vice presidents who stumped here for
their party's presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   The result: Gore will visit New Hampshire often this year, and
he jokes he is trying to meet everyone in the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really is true that an institution that lets presidential
candidates in living rooms in front of small groups is a good
thing,'' Gore said in an interview Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a completely different venue and it weeds out those who
are simply performance artists in front of large staged events,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   His campaign team is trying to keep Gore close to the ground _
and the voters _ as much as possible. They are trying to keep their
campaign organization open and inviting, too, to prevent activists
from drifting off to Bill Bradley's camp. And they are trying to
help Gore step out from behind President Clinton and define himself
in his own way.
</P>
<P>
   In the first-in-the-nation primary state, it is particularly
difficult being a front-runner with an entourage as you try to cut
through the clutter to reintroduce yourself.
</P>
<P>
   ``In New Hampshire, if you're a front-runner, it's a little like
putting a target on your chest,'' said Dayton Duncan, a Gore
supporter who worked for Mondale.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a tradition of people wanting to see you personally
and in smaller rather than larger settings,'' he said. ``For a
sitting vice president, that's more difficult than for Lamar
Alexander.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Gore says he understands that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think people know much of anything about the
candidates, me included,'' Gore said. ``I think you introduce
yourself to the American people over an extended period of time.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the weekend, Gore tried to show himself off as spontaneous
and warm, attentive to all. On his way to North Conway Friday, he
jumped out of his Suburban in Dover, stopping to buy daffodils at
Harvey's Bakery to benefit the American Cancer Society. There, he
had his picture snapped with 8-year-old Jessica Cummings, who was
walking by with her mother, Cindy.
</P>
<P>
   At the annual Grover Cleveland dinner for Carroll County
Democrats, Gore would not leave until he shook hands with each of
the 250 people in the room. While staying with the Larsens, he
answered the telephone for them, surprising their friends.
</P>
<P>
   To a certain extent, the personal contact seemed to be working.
When Jim Craig, a Manchester attorney, walked in the door of Dan
and Marcy Lyman's home Saturday afternoon, he was undecided. After
listening to Gore speak, Craig signed a pledge agreeing to help the
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard all the criticism about him being wooden,'' said
Craig. ``But I didn't think that was true today.''
</P>
<P>
   And that is the point Gore's staff and advisers are making.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always done a certain amount of it, but you're going to
see more of it,'' promised Ronald Klain, Gore's chief of staff,
referring to the one-on-one contacts. ``People just need to get to
know him better.''
</P>
<P>
   Mondale, the former vice president with the large organization,
was considered the likely _ perhaps inevitable _ nominee in 1984.
He ran into trouble in New Hampshire as Gary Hart drubbed him for
being a captive of special interests. When Hart's surprisingly
strong showing in the Iowa caucuses lit a fire under his candidacy,
Mondale began campaigning in the South, rather than staying in the
state.
</P>
<P>
   Members of Gore's inner circle say they are determined to
include everyone in New Hampshire who wants to help Gore become
president. When Mondale ran, many activists felt they could make
more of an impact with a less-established candidate. Even though
Mondale had received every big-name endorsement in the state, Hart
upended him in the voting booth.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're paranoid of history and should be, quite frankly,''
said Jeff Woodburn, a key Gore player and former chairman of New
Hampshire's Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   Advisers see even closer parallels to Bush's situation in 1988,
as he sought to establish his own identity apart from a popular
president, Ronald Reagan. Just as Gore is frequently described as
boring, Bush was labeled a cautious wimp.
</P>
<P>
   Bush ran into further trouble rehabilitating his image when he
delayed campaigning in New Hampshire and Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   But with the help of then-Governor John Sununu, Bush managed to
pull his campaign together and resurrect his image in the final
days to win the New Hampshire primary.
</P>
<P>
   At age 50, Gore is philosophical, however, about how much he can
change from his slightly stilted ways in front of a microphone,
saying he's old enough to believe he'll never entirely be rid of
his habits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think as I get older, I'm learning how to express myself
more easily in large groups the way I do in small groups,'' Gore
said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, his advisers are urging him to step out front and show
his own agenda, to complement the personal greetings.
</P>
<P>
   By the time New Hampshire voters go to the polls on primary day
next year, William H. Shaheen, his state chairman here, is hoping
Gore's identity will have been forged: ``They're going to look at
him as a man and not as a vice president.''

PRIMARY SEASON: SHORT AND SWEET? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOT LEHIGH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It will all be decided in one short month.
</P>
<P>
   That's the growing consensus about the 2000 presidential primary
campaign. It will start next Feb. 7 in Iowa, and in all likelihood
end on March 7, when at least 11 states, including California, New
York, and all of New England save New Hampshire, go to the polls.
The schedule isn't final, but it seems probable that as many as 41
percent of the total delegates will be chosen that day alone.
</P>
<P>
   And if the process doesn't end then, it almost surely will on
the following Tuesday, when another six states, including Texas and
Florida vote. That is, if Florida doesn't move up to March 7. One
way or another, the four most populous states in the country _
California, Texas, New York, and Florida _ will have held their
primaries by March 14.
</P>
<P>
   The rules, of course, are never neutral. The new system, which
has come about haphazardly as states have pushed their primaries up
in search of greater influence in choosing the nominees, will
dramatically change the process.
</P>
<P>
   Consider this:
</P>
<P>
   In 1972, antiwar Senator George McGovern couldn't claim the
Democratic Party nomination until he beat former vice president
Hubert H. Humphrey in California on June 6. In 1976, challengers
pursued Jimmy Carter until he wrapped up the Democratic nomination
by winning the Ohio primary on June 8.
</P>
<P>
   That same year, Ronald Reagan chased President Ford almost all
the way to the Republican convention. Similarly, in 1984, Senator
Gary Hart battled former vice president Walter F. Mondale to the
June primaries and beyond before Mondale's pull with
super-delegates let him claim the party's mantle.
</P>
<P>
   Or this. In 1968, only 8 percent of the Democratic delegates
chosen by primary had been allocated by week five of the primary
process. By 1996, 59 percent of comparable delegates had been
picked by that point. On the Republican side in 1968, only 7
percent of delegates were chosen after five weeks; by 1996, the
figure was 65 percent. (These statistics are drawn from the
upcoming book ``In Pursuit of the White House 2000: How We Choose
Our Presidential Nominees'' by William Mayer, a professor of
political science at Northeastern University.
</P>
<P>
   Collapsing what was once four to five months of voting into one
inevitably tilts the process toward the well-known and the
well-financed. Indeed, many think the campaign no longer allows for
a lesser-known, underfunded candidate who can make his or her case
in the retail politics of Iowa, improve his showing in New
Hampshire, and catapult from there into national contention.
</P>
<P>
   ``The current process obviously helps those candidates who have
better name ID, are better financed, and are better organized
across the country,'' said Ron Kaufman, White House political
director in the Bush administration. ``The truth is, it is almost
like a national primary.''
</P>
<P>
   And it's not just the little-knowns _ Fred Harris in 1976, say,
or Reuben Askew in 1984, or Pierre du Pont in 1988 _ who will be
squeezed out. A McGovern, a Carter, or even a Bill Clinton might
not emerge from such a system  &UR; today &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   Just last month when he decided not to run for president, US
Senator John F. Kerry of Massachusetts, a smart, substantial,
experienced third-term Democrat who would have been counted as a
serious contender in slower years, cited the syncopated primary
system as one of his reasons. A process that demands $15 million as
minimum table stakes was just too much, too fast, Kerry said.
</P>
<P>
   Fans of the European style of short campaigns may argue that a
truncated campaign is a plus. Still, there's something particularly
American about a staggered system of primaries that tests a
prospective leader week by week, trying a candidate's skills in the
crucible of campaign combat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is a very good test,'' said Michael S. Dukakis, the
former Massachusetts governor and 1988 Democratic presidential
nominee. ``It's kind of a gradual test of who you are and what
you're made of, and it gives a less well-known candidate an
opportunity to demonstrate what he has got.''
</P>
<P>
   Is there a way to modify the system so that states that want
early influence can have it, but that keeps the nomination process
staggered enough to permit lesser-known candidates to emerge and be
tested?
</P>
<P>
   One of the most interesting proposals so far comes from the
National Association of Secretaries of State, the nation's top
election officials. At their February meeting, the secretaries
called for a system of rotating primaries, with the hope that it
will be in place for 2004.
</P>
<P>
   It would work this way. As small states that can nurture an
underdog candidacy, Iowa and New Hampshire would preserve their
season-starting spots.
</P>
<P>
   After that, the country would be broken into regions: West,
South, Midwest, and Northeast. Regional primaries would be held the
first Tuesday of each month, from March to June, with the region
that went first moving to end of the line the next time. About a
quarter of the delegates would be selected each Tuesday, which
would mean that, in a contested field, no candidate could secure
the nomination for at least three months.
</P>
<P>
   William Galvin, the Massachusetts secretary of state and
chairman of the association's Committee on Presidential Primaries,
thinks such a system would give candidates time to campaign, to
prove themselves, perhaps even to recover from a stumble, and all
in a matrix that preserves time, money, and sanity. Dukakis agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be able to stay in one region a couple of weeks and
campaign intensively makes a lot of sense,'' Dukakis says. ``I
think there are all sorts of arguments for it, and I don't know
what the argument against it is.''
</P>
<P>
   There are some. Mayer believes the regions are still too large.
``You still may be facing a situation where it is difficult for a
less-established candidate to compete in the system,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Unnatural advantage is another argument against regionalizing.
That's why Steven Grossman, recently retired Democratic National
Committee chairman, is skeptical of Galvin's proposal, even though
Grossman favors a longer primary season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The favorite son from a particular region may not be the best
candidate, but it will inevitably propel him forward,'' says
Grossman, who says the governor of California would become the
instant front-runner in years when the West held its primaries
first.
</P>
<P>
   There's something to that concern, certainly, although Grossman
may be overstating the problems. Any well-performing California
governor probably deserves to be considered a serious candidate in
his or her own right. As for other favorite sons, voters have a
knack for separating the serious from the symbolic (witness US
Senator Bob Smith's single-digit showing in home-state New
Hampshire polls). And any smaller-state candidate who could
dominate an entire region would hardly fit the favorite-son
category.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Galvin concedes there might be some regional
advantage.
</P>
<P>
   But the current system has long had such advantages: a shared
border is the reason so many Massachusetts Democrats have a toehold
in the New Hampshire primary. When it comes to proposals for
improving the nominating process, it's best not to make the perfect
the enemy of the good (as Voltaire might have put it), particularly
since, in politics, perfect is not realistic.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal Galvin and his fellow election officials favor is
realistic, in no small part because it builds on the geographic
blocks of the current system, which has seen New England, the
South, and the intermountain West all establish regional primary
days.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is far from a perfect system,'' Galvin concedes. ``I don't
think it is as good as what we had, when the system was truly
spread out. But it is far better than what we have now.''

impossible to ever negotiate with him again? For now, the political
process that NATO's bombing of Serbia is supposed to bolster is

autonomy to the Albanians and accept the presence of a NATO-led

BOSTON'S RAT PACK TAKES A HIT

<P>
   BOSTON _ Adecade ago, the city's Central Artery highway project
produced The Great Rat Scare. It was a wondrous thing.
</P>
<P>
   According to this nightmare, millions of enraged rats uprooted
from their subterranean digs by construction would stream through
the North End and Chinatown neighborhoods, pausing to infest City
Hall before moving at warp speed across the Common toward the Back
Bay matrons sipping lapsong souchong at the Ritz.
</P>
<P>
   The specter was appalling. And fascinating. It had Hollywood
written all over it. The media loved it. Local news at 6 and 11
salivated.
</P>
<P>
   ``The topic became sexier and sexier,'' recalls Bruce Colvin,
who led the rat war from early 1989 until last June, when he was
laid off in a round of cost-cutting. ``We were astounded by the
myths and misinformation floating everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   The rat stampede never materialized. For starters, there were
never millions of rats under the Central Artery. More important,
rats are not marathon runners. Like all smart gourmands, they
usually stay within 150 feet of their food source. And,
counterintuitively, they adore construction projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole media had it backwards,'' notes Colvin.
</P>
<P>
   But not the Big Dig, the massive project to bury the busy
highway that goes through center of the city. Today, Boston is
known for its innovative efforts to keep the Norway rat (Rattus
norvegicus) at bay. Last year, for example, the Chinese government
invited Colvin to lecture on the subject at the august Chinese
Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   The program has been so successful that the consumption of rat
poison in sewers is down almost 95 percent from the start of
hostilities in 1990. Poison consumption, specialists say, is the
best way to gauge success because no one has a clue how many rats
there were at the beginning or are making trouble now.
</P>
<P>
   But chew on this: The gestation period for a female rat is 21
days. A male and female, who produce litters of eight to 10 pups,
will be logarithmically responsible for 15,000 offspring in optimum
conditions over the course of a year.
</P>
<P>
   So the rats can still win this war. The Massachusetts Turnpike
Authority, which now runs the Central Artery project, has cut the
number of rat busters from seven to two. The entire operation is
heading toward extinction early in 2005. What level of effort will
there be in the interim? And what will happen after completion?
</P>
<P>
   Much of the burden has already shifted to the city's
Inspectional Services Department, according to John Eade, who ran
ISD for 4 1/2 years until last November and worked closely with the
Big Dig rat cadre. ``They only have two people left to handle the
whole thing, and we're only halfway through the project. That is
ludicrous,'' says Eade.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question,'' he asks, ``is whether the Central Artery is
still committed to making this program work.''
</P>
<P>
   The Big Dig says yes. ``We will not, cannot, walk away from the
commitment we made when this project began regarding rodent
control,'' says Big Dig spokesman Andrew Paven. But he would give
no specifics about funding or staffing for future rat control
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Neither will ISD, which faces an increased challenge as the Big
Dig effort declines. Spokeswoman Julie Fothergill simply promises
that the city will meet its obligations to win the rat war.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't take much for rats to mount a spirited counterattack.
Just relax sanitation enforcement and watch the fun. In fact, you
can look elsewhere in Boston to get a taste of what's ahead if the
Big Dig effort flags. It is mystifying, then, that Boston still
allows residents in areas like the North End, Chinatown, and the
Back Bay to leave their garbage out in plastic bags the night
before pickup three times a week. It's Denny's All You Can Eat for
rats.
</P>
<P>
   This spring, as usual, the rat busters are baiting the sewers.
We're talking five 20-gram paraffin blocks of Talon, the
second-generation anticoagulant that kills rats through internal
bleeding. The rats last three to five days after munching on the
stuff, which is hung on a wire in sewers from manhole covers or
placed in plastic boxes in high-use surface areas. (Not to worry,
the rats go underground to die. This is why Boston is not littered
with their carcasses.)
</P>
<P>
   Poison is tricky stuff. Use too much of it and the results can
be terrifying: Rats can develop a genetic resistance to
anticoagulants, as they did in Chicago in the '70s.
</P>
<P>
   The second generation of anticoagulant in use here, to the best
of anyone's knowledge, is resistant-proof. So far. Colvin cautions
that European countries now have problems with resistant rats
because of overuse of poison. While there is no evidence yet of
such super rats in the United States, he adds, `No one is tracking
here. The US government eliminated all research in that arena 20
years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Rats are also canny. They can become ``trap-shy'' if confronted
with too many such devices. When that happens, they may face the
dreaded glueboard. This eponymous device is to rats what the La
Brea tarpits were to dinosaurs. The rats literally stick to the
glue as they walk across it and die a long, horrible death.
</P>
<P>
   Long before the glueboard, there was the plan. Colvin's team
divided the Big Dig and contiguous zones into six areas stretching
from Charlestown to the South End. Area Four, which includes the
North End, and Area Five, dominated by Chinatown, have always been
where the action is. Both are dense and teeming with restaurants.
(The North End alone has 135 restaurant licenses.) And in the
beginning, both had terrible garbage problems.
</P>
<P>
   The scariest turf, hands down, was Haymarket, the open food
arena in the shadow of City Hall where rats gorged themselves on
the mountains of garbage left by the pushcart operators. One night
in 1991, Colvin sat with a hand counter to document the rat
activity there. In one hour, he clicked 104 times.
</P>
<P>
   ``A tremendous battle was fought there,'' he says, speaking both
of rodents and politicians. Privately, the rat busters chafed at
the political cover given by the city to the pushcart operators,
Boston tourist icons, whose lax produce-disposal habits contributed
mightily to the rat problem.
</P>
<P>
   Long before Big Dig construction began, Colvin and his team
embarked on a yearlong public information campaign in the
neighborhoods most affected by the project. Garbage was the main
topic. People needed to know that rats are unamused when deprived
of food and will depart for gamier pastures.
</P>
<P>
   The state even bought 900 securely lidded garbage cans for
restaurants and residents at high rat risk located near the
construction corridor.
</P>
<P>
   Then they surveyed accessible sewer manholes that were potential
problems. In the downtown area, baiting began more than six months
before construction in all manholes up to five blocks on either
side of the construction zone. Particular attention was paid to the
old brick sewer pipes less than 2 feet in diameter, which are
favored by rats as their very own central arteries. Before the Big
Dig, Boston had never baited its sewers in a coherent way that
included relentless poisoning, rebaiting, and monitoring.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the baiting has been done by three local pest-control
companies working for the Big Dig. In theory, the city ISD handles
rat problems in private property near construction, while the Big
Dig has responsibility for public areas. In practice, the two
groups overlap, and the efforts of the city will have to grow if it
is to win the rat war as the scope of the Big Dig effort declines.
</P>
<P>
   The jurisdictional questions can be confusing. ``Once you have a
rat, you can't prove where it comes from,'' says John Meaney, ISD's
chief inspector. ``Is it their rat or our rat?''
</P>
<P>
   The other key part of the end game in the Big Dig rat war will
be the design of the 20-odd acres of green space to be located
above the depressed artery highway. Landscaping, it turns out, has
a lot to do with rat activity. Colvin's team studied 650 sites in
downtown Boston and found that rats love ground cover, the thicker
the better. They also adore juniper and yews, and will vault over
walls from adjacent bushes. What they don't like is open grass.
</P>
<P>
   Colvin and others involved in the rat project say that issues
such as landscaping underscore the need for continued commitment by
the Big Dig and the city to maintain the gains they have made
together. Thus far, the two operations have stayed ahead of the
rats. But brave promises from both groups are running headlong into
funding realities.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the rat busters just keep baiting. ``Dead rats
don't run,'' intones Big Dig environmental biologist Trygve Swift.

DRAWING A LINE IN THE BALKANS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (k and w coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Time for a new parallel.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 50 years ago, the world's attention was drawn to the 38th
parallel, dividing South from North Korea. In Vietnam, the line
through the 17th, which divided South from North Vietnam, made Big
Power sense, but none at all to most Vietnamese. Now it's time to
pay some attention to the 44th.
</P>
<P>
   In the Balkans, the line doesn't denote an international
boundary. But south of it, in the lower part of Serbia and into
bleeding Kosovo, the presence of a tank, an artillery piece, or an
armored personnel carrier can only mean one thing _ slaughter.
</P>
<P>
   And as the NATO campaign against Serbia moves into its critical
phase of operations against those weapons, the time has come to
draw the line at that line.
</P>
<P>
   Anything below it _ a Serbian armed unit, a piece of serious
equipment, anything _ should be considered fair game, no
exceptions.
</P>
<P>
   That is basically the tacit NATO approach in the second stage of
its air campaign. But a clear public statement, what amounts to an
ultimatum, would focus the attention of both Western opinion and
the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   The most important word President Clinton has uttered since the
campaign moved beyond its initial focus on air-defense and other
basic elements of the Serb war machine has been ``persevere.'' It
implies no quick fix, because there is none, and readiness for an
effort of considerable duration, because that is almost certainly
required in the absence of Slobodan Milosevic's sudden
capitulation, for which senior US officials no longer entertain
realistic hopes.
</P>
<P>
   Perseverance is also the essential word because a campaign from
the air directed at anything that moves south of the 44th parallel
will make it clear to the Serbs involved that they are not only
targets, but that they can be largely isolated and cut off from
their supply lines from the north.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, perseverance is important in the context of the
possibility of using ground troops. It should be obvious from the
verbal dance by Clinton administration officials that the
introduction of combat forces has not been ruled out and
contingency plans are being worked on.
</P>
<P>
   However, the public hair-splitting about using them misses a
more important point about what is feasible in the weeks ahead.
Senior officials are at pains privately to point out that Kosovo is
no Kuwait _ wide open desert and thus easily accessible for armored
columns. In fact, it is remote and relatively primitive.
</P>
<P>
   There are, for example, only a handful of ways into the province
over bridges that can easily be blown up. Moreover, any
introduction of combat units should be preceded by the kind of
up-close bombing to which NATO is now committed for at least the
next few weeks. The best inside opinion is that it would take a
month or so to prepare to use an invading force, whose size would
have to be staggering (at least 100,000 troops).
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, NATO is capable of inflicting severe, daily
punishment on Serb units in Kosovo from the air, and that effort
has barely begun.
</P>
<P>
   However, that means that the forced evictions of ethnic
Albanians and the wholesale murder will continue, with real threats
to the stability of neighboring Montenegro, Albania, and Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   But it is preposterous to suggest that NATO's campaign is in any
way responsible for the escalating and spreading violence. The
truth is that the Serbian build-up began last fall, as did the
atrocities; as it continued, the situation in Kosovo worsened.
</P>
<P>
   Once the Kosovar Albanians agreed to sign the peace agreement
that the Serbs had rejected, the only evidence is that the NATO
plans to begin bombing were accelerated as the level of violence
raced out of control. That is why the decision to start was made
even as Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov's plane was flying
here, in the full knowledge that he would order its return to
Moscow. It was a gutsy move on President Clinton's behalf.
</P>
<P>
   Horrific days lie ahead. But that is why the proper course
should be not only perseverance, but a refusal to rule any action
in or out and a public announcement that anything Serbian south of
the 44th parallel is at mortal risk.
</P>
<P>
   The commitment to oppose any rape of Kosovo was right when
George Bush made it at the beginning of this decade; it was right
when Clinton reaffirmed it; and it was right when NATO acted on it.
</P>
<P>
   And that means that it's right to see it through to success.

BUDGET BALONEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARIANNE MEANS  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Congressional Republicans left the nation's capital
for a two-week recess patting themselves on the back for passing a
budget blueprint that expects us to believe in six impossible
things before breakfast, as the white queen demanded of Alice in
Wonderland.
</P>
<P>
   This is a small step _ a really small one _ aimed at avoiding
the partisan stalemate that bogged down the Newt Gingrich-era
Congress last year. The impasse led to last-minute budget chaos, in
which the GOP got rolled by President Clinton and the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the devil is in the details, as Ross Perot is fond of
saying, and the budget deal doesn't have many. This is a skeleton,
missing the necessary political muscle.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement promises to set aside funds for Social Security
(although not Medicare), vastly increase defense spending and
provide fat new tax cuts. Even with a looming surplus, the federal
government cannot afford such financial indulgence without busting
the spending limits Congress has set for itself. Something must
give here.
</P>
<P>
   The message is that the budget will be balanced by cutting
unnecessary, unwanted domestic programs. But the plan does not
specify which ones, or by how much. Why are we not surprised? Every
year Congress goes through this fanciful routine, and every year
it's a fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Precedent suggests the targets will be popular, essential
services _ nutrition programs, enforcement of health and safety
rules, drug and border control, Amtrak, the Coast Guard,
environmental protection, park maintenance, space exploration, Head
Start, the State Department and even the FBI. All are vulnerable as
legally unprotected examples of the big government that Republicans
love to bash.
</P>
<P>
   If the Republicans wish to retain their congressional-majority
status, however, they will not be caught whacking away. Voters
correctly expect government to provide these services, particularly
those that directly improve their daily lives or help the poor, the
elderly and the sick. No, the old shrink-government illusion will
not work.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the bombing of Yugoslavia, a big increase in
defense spending also seems inevitable. No one is in a mood to deny
the Pentagon what it claims to need. President Clinton and Congress
may still argue about what to spend where, but the military will
waggle its expensive Stealth bombers at us and have its way.
</P>
<P>
   As for Social Security and Medicare, neither the GOP
congressional leadership nor President Clinton are prepared to make
the accommodations essential for real reform. Consensus is not
possible until the 2000 elections have settled the next division of
political power.
</P>
<P>
   So there will be a lot of talk about saving the systems for the
elderly that will not necessarily mean much, except that the
politicians will compete to outspend and outpromise each other. No
radical cost-saving there, either.
</P>
<P>
   So if we are to avoid a return to budget deficits it is in the
size of the projected tax cut that things must give.
</P>
<P>
   Some GOP conservatives are still singing the old song about the
absolutely imperative nature of a big break for the pitiful,
overtaxed rich. The right wing would eliminate federal agencies,
downgrade education and pinch domestic spending willy-nilly to pay
for that.
</P>
<P>
   But the message is not a winner in these days of economic
prosperity. With most voters, tax cuts get a lower priority than
improved education and protection of Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   The congressional budget calls for a tax cut of nearly $800
billion over the next 10 years, beginning slowly but accelerating
rapidly in later years. This would absorb nearly all the projected
budget surplus not set aside for Social Security. It is opposed by
President Clinton and most congressional Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The form these cuts would take is left to the House and Senate
to decide later. Initially the Republican congressional leadership
favored a 10 percent across-the-board cut in income tax rates, but,
despite a campaign push from Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, the
concept didn't pass the economic and political smell test.
</P>
<P>
   Far more likely and more responsible are smaller, targeted tax
reductions to which President Clinton can agree and for which both
parties can claim credit.
</P>
<P>
   Budgets are as boring as they are necessary, and easily
manipulated for political points by the few insiders who understand
them. We all know that liars can figure and figures can lie. When
it comes to arithmetic gyrations, most of us are condemned to
function on instinct, common sense and guess-work. Lucky thing for
Congress.

<P>
   The second generation of anticoagulant in use here, to the best
of anyone's knowledge, is resistant-proof. So far. Colvin cautions
that European countries now have problems with resistant rats
because of overuse of poison. While there is no evidence yet of
such super rats in the United States, he adds, `No one is tracking
here. The US government eliminated all research in that arena 20
years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Rats are also canny. They can become ``trap-shy'' if confronted
with too many such devices. When that happens, they may face the
dreaded glueboard. This eponymous device is to rats what the La
Brea tarpits were to dinosaurs. The rats literally stick to the
glue as they walk across it and die a long, horrible death.
</P>
<P>
   Long before the glueboard, there was the plan. Colvin's team
divided the Big Dig and contiguous zones into six areas stretching
from Charlestown to the South End. Area Four, which includes the
North End, and Area Five, dominated by Chinatown, have always been
where the action is. Both are dense and teeming with restaurants.
(The North End alone has 135 restaurant licenses.) And in the
beginning, both had terrible garbage problems.
</P>
<P>
   The scariest turf, hands down, was Haymarket, the open food
arena in the shadow of City Hall where rats gorged themselves on
the mountains of garbage left by the pushcart operators. One night
in 1991, Colvin sat with a hand counter to document the rat
activity there. In one hour, he clicked 104 times.
</P>
<P>
   ``A tremendous battle was fought there,'' he says, speaking both
of rodents and politicians. Privately, the rat busters chafed at
the political cover given by the city to the pushcart operators,
Boston tourist icons, whose lax produce-disposal habits contributed
mightily to the rat problem.
</P>
<P>
   Long before Big Dig construction began, Colvin and his team
embarked on a yearlong public information campaign in the
neighborhoods most affected by the project. Garbage was the main
topic. People needed to know that rats are unamused when deprived
of food and will depart for gamier pastures.
</P>
<P>
   The state even bought 900 securely lidded garbage cans for
restaurants and residents at high rat risk located near the
construction corridor.
</P>
<P>
   Then they surveyed accessible sewer manholes that were potential
problems. In the downtown area, baiting began more than six months
before construction in all manholes up to five blocks on either
side of the construction zone. Particular attention was paid to the
old brick sewer pipes less than 2 feet in diameter, which are
favored by rats as their very own central arteries. Before the Big
Dig, Boston had never baited its sewers in a coherent way that
included relentless poisoning, rebaiting, and monitoring.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the baiting has been done by three local pest-control
companies working for the Big Dig. In theory, the city ISD handles
rat problems in private property near construction, while the Big
Dig has responsibility for public areas. In practice, the two
groups overlap, and the efforts of the city will have to grow if it
is to win the rat war as the scope of the Big Dig effort declines.
</P>
<P>
   The jurisdictional questions can be confusing. ``Once you have a
rat, you can't prove where it comes from,'' says John Meaney, ISD's
chief inspector. ``Is it their rat or our rat?''
</P>
<P>
   The other key part of the end game in the Big Dig rat war will
be the design of the 20-odd acres of green space to be located
above the depressed artery highway. Landscaping, it turns out, has
a lot to do with rat activity. Colvin's team studied 650 sites in
downtown Boston and found that rats love ground cover, the thicker
the better. They also adore juniper and yews, and will vault over
walls from adjacent bushes. What they don't like is open grass.
</P>
<P>
   Colvin and others involved in the rat project say that issues
such as landscaping underscore the need for continued commitment by
the Big Dig and the city to maintain the gains they have made
together. Thus far, the two operations have stayed ahead of the
rats. But brave promises from both groups are running headlong into
funding realities.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the rat busters just keep baiting. ``Dead rats
don't run,'' intones Big Dig environmental biologist Trygve Swift.

ELITE FBI TEAM SEARCHES FOR KILLERS OF WOMAN, TWO GIRLS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   SONORA, Calif. _ While the FBI has imported a team of
professional profilers to narrow its search for the killers of a
women and two children, there are plenty of amateur profilers in
the Sierra foothills where the bodies were found.
</P>
<P>
   The elite FBI Behavioral Science Unit, which worked on the
Unabom investigation and was featured in the 1993 movie ``Silence
of the Lambs,'' develops profiles of possible suspects in violent
crimes or terrorist incidents. Its goal is to answer the anguished
question on the minds of most everybody here: Who could have done
this?
</P>
<P>
   At gas stations, coffee shops, convenience stores and
restaurants, there has been little talk of anything other than the
abduction and killings.
</P>
<P>
   The three disappeared from El Portal, just outside the Yosemite
National Park, on Feb. 15. The bodies of Carole Sund, 42, and
Silvina Pelosso, 16, were found three hours north of the park on
March 18 in the charred remains of a car they rented for their
trip. A third body, Sund's 15-year-old daughter, Julie, was found
Thursday near a vista point in Moccasin, about 32 miles southwest
of where her mother's body was found.
</P>
<P>
   The other significant location for the FBI profilers is Modesto,
where the search for the three turned up the first major piece of
evidence: Carole Sund's billfold.
</P>
<P>
   ``I bet it was an ex-convict, some guy who sat in jail for years
and thought about how much he hates women; who else would do this
evil thing?'' said Judy Shay, an Oakland resident who was staying
at her family's cabin in Tuolumne County.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a small town and people don't have anything else to do
but talk about it,'' said Louise Guthmiller, who said shed believed
the the woman and two children stopped at her gas station in Sierra
Village the day they disappeared. ``Everybody up here has a theory
about who did it or why they did it or how come they put the bodies
here. But we just can't all be right.''
</P>
<P>
   FBI Agent James Maddock conceded as much last week.
</P>
<P>
   The new task force, dubbed Tournap, now is focusing on analyzing
evidence, developing psychological profiles of the killer or
killers and eliminating possible suspects, according to FBI
spokesman Nick Rossi.
</P>
<P>
   For the past few weeks, the FBI and the Tuolumne County
Sheriff's Department have been questioning several former convicts
with records of violence or sexual offenses.

DRAWING A LINE IN THE BALKANS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (k and w coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Time for a new parallel.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 50 years ago, the world's attention was drawn to the 38th
parallel, dividing South from North Korea. In Vietnam, the line
through the 17th, which divided South from North Vietnam, made Big
Power sense, but none at all to most Vietnamese. Now it's time to
pay some attention to the 44th.
</P>
<P>
   In the Balkans, the line doesn't denote an international
boundary. But south of it, in the lower part of Serbia and into
bleeding Kosovo, the presence of a tank, an artillery piece, or an
armored personnel carrier can only mean one thing _ slaughter.
</P>
<P>
   And as the NATO campaign against Serbia moves into its critical
phase of operations against those weapons, the time has come to
draw the line at that line.
</P>
<P>
   Anything below it _ a Serbian armed unit, a piece of serious
equipment, anything _ should be considered fair game, no
exceptions.
</P>
<P>
   That is basically the tacit NATO approach in the second stage of
its air campaign. But a clear public statement, what amounts to an
ultimatum, would focus the attention of both Western opinion and
the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   The most important word President Clinton has uttered since the
campaign moved beyond its initial focus on air-defense and other
basic elements of the Serb war machine has been ``persevere.'' It
implies no quick fix, because there is none, and readiness for an
effort of considerable duration, because that is almost certainly
required in the absence of Slobodan Milosevic's sudden
capitulation, for which senior US officials no longer entertain
realistic hopes.
</P>
<P>
   Perseverance is also the essential word because a campaign from
the air directed at anything that moves south of the 44th parallel
will make it clear to the Serbs involved that they are not only
targets, but that they can be largely isolated and cut off from
their supply lines from the north.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, perseverance is important in the context of the
possibility of using ground troops. It should be obvious from the
verbal dance by Clinton administration officials that the
introduction of combat forces has not been ruled out and
contingency plans are being worked on.
</P>
<P>
   However, the public hair-splitting about using them misses a
more important point about what is feasible in the weeks ahead.
Senior officials are at pains privately to point out that Kosovo is
no Kuwait _ wide open desert and thus easily accessible for armored
columns. In fact, it is remote and relatively primitive.
</P>
<P>
   There are, for example, only a handful of ways into the province
over bridges that can easily be blown up. Moreover, any
introduction of combat units should be preceded by the kind of
up-close bombing to which NATO is now committed for at least the
next few weeks. The best inside opinion is that it would take a
month or so to prepare to use an invading force, whose size would
have to be staggering (at least 100,000 troops).
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, NATO is capable of inflicting severe, daily
punishment on Serb units in Kosovo from the air, and that effort
has barely begun.
</P>
<P>
   However, that means that the forced evictions of ethnic
Albanians and the wholesale murder will continue, with real threats
to the stability of neighboring Montenegro, Albania, and Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   But it is preposterous to suggest that NATO's campaign is in any
way responsible for the escalating and spreading violence. The
truth is that the Serbian build-up began last fall, as did the
atrocities; as it continued, the situation in Kosovo worsened.
</P>
<P>
   Once the Kosovar Albanians agreed to sign the peace agreement
that the Serbs had rejected, the only evidence is that the NATO
plans to begin bombing were accelerated as the level of violence
raced out of control. That is why the decision to start was made
even as Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov's plane was flying
here, in the full knowledge that he would order its return to
Moscow. It was a gutsy move on President Clinton's behalf.
</P>
<P>
   Horrific days lie ahead. But that is why the proper course
should be not only perseverance, but a refusal to rule any action
in or out and a public announcement that anything Serbian south of
the 44th parallel is at mortal risk.
</P>
<P>
   The commitment to oppose any rape of Kosovo was right when
George Bush made it at the beginning of this decade; it was right
when Clinton reaffirmed it; and it was right when NATO acted on it.
</P>
<P>
   And that means that it's right to see it through to success.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Perhaps no exploration in American history has more famously
combined intrepidity with scientific enterprise than the two-year
expedition of Lewis and Clark from the Mississippi to the Pacific
two centuries ago. The ecologist Daniel B. Botkin, in a 1995 book,
called it ``the greatest wilderness trip ever recorded.''
</P>
<P>
   But how pristine was that Western wilderness of 1804 to 1806?
The answer depends on how one conceives of the nature of nature,
and it has basic implications for present-day conservation policy.
</P>
<P>
   Fond tradition pictures the plains and mountains of the Lewis
and Clark era as a nature untouched by humans and apart from them:
a sort of original realm of the wild, undisturbed and eternal. Many
experts, however, have long since abandoned that vision.
</P>
<P>
   Today they see humans as longtime major players in nature's
grand drama, and Native Americans among the main ecological actors
of the old West _ not only in the days of Lewis and Clark but for
thousands of years before that.
</P>
<P>
   Now, citing as evidence the marvelously detailed journals of
Captains Meriwether Lewis and William Clark, some scientists are
proposing that even Indian warfare played a critical ecological
role, by regulating and maintaining both the numbers and
distribution of bison and other big animals of the West before
descendants of Europeans settled it.
</P>
<P>
   Basically, according to this ``war zone'' theory, Indian hunters
were so proficient that in an individual tribe's homeland,
populations of big game like bison and elk seriously declined and
in some cases disappeared. But in several big buffer zones between
warring tribes, where hunters were loath to spend much time lest
their enemies attack them, big game found more safety and
flourished.
</P>
<P>
   These no-man's-lands functioned, in effect, as game preserves
and may have kept the plains bison and other big animals from being
hunted to extinction well before Europeans arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone agrees wholly with the theory. But the spotlight it
casts on humans' impact on the pre-Columbian landscape also
highlights one of the major conceptual problems facing present-day
efforts to restore and conserve ``natural'' ecosystems: What target
should be aimed at? Should the goal be to maintain nature as nearly
as possible in the state it was in before the ancestors of the
Indians came to America many millenniums ago? Or to its state just
before Europeans appeared on the continent? Or to some other state
altogether?
</P>
<P>
   The war-zone theory is laid out in the February issue of the
journal Conservation Biology by Paul S. Martin, a paleoecologist at
the University of Arizona, and Christine R. Szuter, editor-in-chief
of the University of Arizona Press. Dr. Martin says the theory
could partly explain why bison, elk, deer and bears escaped the
fate of other, even bigger North American animal species that
became extinct some 13,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   These included, among others, mammoths, mastodons, camels, giant
sloths, tapirs and predators that depended on them, like giant
short-faced bears, a giant wolf called the dire wolf and the
saber-toothed cat.
</P>
<P>
   The bison is the largest surviving life form in North America,
and Martin is the chief advocate of the view that the earlier
vanished species of megafauna, as they are called, were hunted to
extinction in a continentwide ``blitzkrieg'' lasting several
centuries by human hunters who had migrated to North America from
Siberia 15,000 years ago or more.
</P>
<P>
   ``The land had been stripped of most of its native megafauna
through human influence'' long before Lewis and Clark appeared on
the scene, Martin and Szuter write. And except for the influence of
humans, they say, much larger populations of the surviving bison,
elk and deer would have greeted the white explorers.
</P>
<P>
   Other scientists contend that the ancient megafauna were
extinguished by climatic change or disease, or by a combination of
factors. Be that as it may, it is abundantly clear that Native
Americans and their ancestors, called paleo-Indians by scientists,
transformed the landscape and ecological relationships of the
Western Hemisphere, with both positive and negative effects.
</P>
<P>
   Indians rearranged the land with earthworks, farm fields,
houses, towns and trails. As top predators, the impact of their
hunting on many species rippled through pre-Columbian ecosystems.
</P>
<P>
   Indians also set frequent fires for one reason or another, and
many pre-Columbian forests were more open and parklike as a result.
</P>
<P>
   In the West, the Indians' fires helped create, renew and
maintain grassland ecosystems. Grasses with deep roots flourished,
and the tender new shoots that sprang from them after the fires
provided ideal forage for bison. The ecological loop came full
circle when the Indians killed the bison, the underpinning of their
hunter's way of life.
</P>
<P>
   The idea that Indian warfare created game sanctuaries in buffer
zones between tribes has been proposed by a number of authorities.
In the 1960s, Harold Hickerson, an anthropologist, found that in
the 18th and 19th centuries, a contested zone varying from 15,000
to 35,000 square miles separated the Chippewa and Lakota in
Wisconsin and Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   Indians did sometimes steal in to hunt there, but usually,
Hickerson wrote, ``in constant dread of being surprised by
enemies.'' Deer were abundant in this tract, but when the two
Indian nations made peace, hunting intensified in the zone and deer
declined.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Elliott West, a historian at the University of
Arkansas, identified contested zones of the central plains that in
the early and mid-1800's covered huge stretches of what are now
Colorado, Kansas and Nebraska. There, he wrote in a 1995 book,
``The Way to the West'' (University of New Mexico Press), bison
were ``spared the full devotion'' of Indians who were occupied
contending with each other. ``The buffalo, in short, got a break,''
he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Similar zones have been identified, Martin and Szuter report in
the article in Conservation Biology, between the Iroquois and
Algonquins around Lake Champlain and in the upper Amazon River
basin between a number of forest tribes.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Now, citing the Lewis and Clark journals, Martin suggests that
in their era, a great wedge of territory stretching for 46,000
square miles across the eastern two-thirds of what is now Montana,
between the Missouri and Yellowstone Rivers, was an important war
zone. This region, he and Szuter wrote, ``is commonly regarded by
historians, biologists and TV producers alike as the very essence
of `wild' America.''
</P>
<P>
   But in fact, they wrote, the plenitude of bison and other game
there ``reflected the status of the area as a buffer zone,'' where
``war parties of various tribes or nations were ever at hand, and
anyone hunting, processing and drying meat'' might be killed by
enemies.
</P>
<P>
   The abundance of game in that region was clearly detailed by
Lewis and Clark, says Martin. And Clark, in one journal passage,
explicitly states, ``I have observed that in the country between
the nations which are at war with each other the greatest numbers
of wild animals are to be found.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, there were no comparable buffer zones west of the
Rockies _ and little big game, even though there was plenty of food
for bison, elk and deer. Martin's interpretation is that the
trans-Rockies Indians simply hunted the big game until it
disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, the Indians there lived mainly on fish and roots.
Lewis and Clark's men found these unsatisfactory; unable to find
enough big game to sustain themselves, they cooked and ate horses
and dogs that they bought from the Indians.
</P>
<P>
   The upshot, wrote Martin and Szuter, is that neither the
scarcity of game west of the Rockies nor the abundance of it in the
war zone to the east was ``truly natural, that is, falling outside
human influence or control.'' The meaning for conservation efforts,
they wrote, is that ``the West in the time of Lewis and Clark was
long past any purely `natural' condition that might serve as an
absolute benchmark for planners.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Martin advocates the establishment of some nature
preserves where the pre-Indian natural world might be re-created as
closely as possible. African or Asian elephants, for instance,
might stand in for the extinct mammoths, enabling scientists to see
something of how the pre-human North American landscape functioned
ecologically.
</P>
<P>
   One dissenter who has problems with the Martin-Szuter view is
Botkin, an ecologist at George Mason University in northern
Virginia and president of the Center for the Study of the
Environment, a nonprofit research organization in Santa Barbara,
Calif. He wrote the 1995 book, ``Our Natural History; the Lessons
of Lewis and Clark'' (Grossett/Putnam).
</P>
<P>
   While there may have been more bison in war zones than
elsewhere, Botkin said, Martin seems to assume that the ecology of
the plains remained static. In fact, said Botkin, the bison were
highly migratory, and would probably have migrated in and out of
war zones.
</P>
<P>
   On a more fundamental level, he says, the Martin-Szuter paper
implies that humans are a force outside nature, that their impact
is unnatural and therefore undesirable. On the contrary, Botkin
says, humans are an integral part of nature, one of many forces
that have long kept the natural world in a constant state of flux.
</P>
<P>
   There have been many states of nature in the past; for instance,
many parts of North America have been covered by forests,
grasslands or ice in different eras, and the assemblages of animals
living there have varied accordingly. The transformations wrought
by Indians created yet other versions of nature.
</P>
<P>
   Varying states of nature, said Botkin, constitute a ``set of
designs'' from which today's conservation planners can choose in
deciding what model to use as a standard for conservation and
restoration projects. The durability of a particular design is not
necessarily relevant, he said: If one wanted to pick the most
durable design of the last few hundred thousand years in North
America, ``you go back to ice.''
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, he said, the state of nature encountered by Lewis and
Clark is as valid a model as any of a number of other versions that
have come and gone over the eons _ and is probably the one most
Americans today would prefer.
</P>
<P>
   The larger point, he said, is that ``there is not a single truth
about what's natural.'' The main value of the Martin-Szuter view,
he said, is that it ``points up that the discussion of what is
natural is alive and well, and that it's not yet resolved.''

CENSUS OFFICIALS COUNTING ON A DAUNTING TASK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY LEONARD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One year away from Census Day, the largest exercise in US
democracy _ bigger than Election Day or Tax Day _ federal officials
are afraid their carefully planned campaign may well fall short.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not an impossible task,'' said Kenneth Prewitt, US Census
Bureau director and commander of the 2000 Census operation, ``but
it is a challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   The challenge is not just the cost, which could soar to $7
billion, or the ongoing fight between Republicans and Democrats in
Congress over who will benefit most from the decennial count. The
census, among many other things, determines how the 435 seats in
the House of Representatives will be divided among the states.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it is a matter of how, with any high degree of
accuracy, the Census Bureau locates and counts an estimated US
population of 275 million that has never been as mobile,
multicultural, or mistrustful of government as Americans will be on
April 1, 2000, when the census formally starts.
</P>
<P>
   Census officials, armed with the most elaborately detailed plan
ever, have all sorts of strategies for crossing more than 100
language barriers, for counting children in joint custody, for
tracking down the homeless, the hospitalized, and people who dwell
on houseboats and on remote Hawaiian Islands.
</P>
<P>
   In cities across the country, thousands of census canvassers are
walking block by block, attempting to update a mailing list of 120
million addresses and match them with actual residences. Census
forms, available in only English or Spanish 10 years ago, are being
printed this time in Chinese, Korean, Vietnamese, and Tagalog, too.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, more than 400 Census Bureau field offices have
opened, and the agency has launched an unprecedented marketing
campaign to project a friendly image of the government census to
racial and ethnic minorities. To enhance census awareness, the
agency is ``partnering'' with thousands of grass-roots groups,
distributing lesson plans on the census to public-school teachers
nationwide, and spending $100 million on an advertising campaign
targeted at minority groups.
</P>
<P>
   But for all the effort, the bottom line is this: Demography is
not on the side of a successful 2000 Census.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Census Bureau is getting better at what it does, but the
demography of our mobile and multicultural society is moving
against us,'' Prewitt said. ``We're running faster and harder, but
we won't know until after the fact whether we ran hard enough to
stay in place, whether we caught up a few steps, or whether we
slipped behind.''
</P>
<P>
   Margo Anderson, a social historian who studies the census, said
contemporary living arrangements collide with the traditional
assumptions of the US census: that Americans reside in only one
place over some time and are either related to, or at least very
familiar with, everybody else who lives under the same roof.
</P>

   ``Two things make for interesting census problems in 2000,''
said Anderson, a University of Wisconsin professor. ``One is the
real changes in the way families and households are organized
today. The other is explaining to a very large and diverse pool of
immigrants, with different languages and political traditions, why
you need to do a census.''
</P>
<P>
   Decennial censuses were mandated in the Constitution for the
purposes of apportioning House seats and taxation. The census
numbers also guide political redistricting within states for their
legislatures and determine how nearly $200 billion in annual
federal aid to states and cities gets shared.
</P>
<P>
   The census survey, which seeks data on sex, age, race,
relationship, and home ownership for each member of a household,
also provides a wealth of updated demographics that determine
everything from how many new schools are needed to where a Wal-Mart
will get built.
</P>
<P>
   No US census has ever been totally accurate. President George
Washington, who hand-tabulated the first one, suspected the
reported 1790 population of 3.9 million people was too low.
</P>
<P>
   But it was not until the 1940s that statisticians were able to
calculate how far off the census enumeration was and that minority
groups and children were being disproportionately undercounted. In
1980, the US Census estimates it missed 1.2 percent of the
population. By 1990, the count was off by an estimated 1.6 percent;
8.4 million people were missed and 4.4 million were counted twice,
according to the bureau.
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau planned to use sampling, or statistical
estimates, to correct for an even higher population undercount _
1.9 percent _ in 2000. But since the Supreme Court ruled in January
that sampling is illegal, at least for apportionment, the bureau
has been scrambling to carry out what Prewitt calls the ``vast
task'' of doing a traditional head count.
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau's count will start April 1, 2000, with the
largest direct-mail campaign in history. Since trial runs show that
the rate of return of both the long and short form will be a low 60
percent, an army of more than 300,000 census enumerators will be
deployed into the field a month later for a door-to-door canvass of
the country.
</P>
<P>
   The census canvass used to come first, but due to demographic
changes _ working women are not home during the day to answer the
door _ the Census Bureau switched in 1970 to the mail-out,
mail-back form. Now the bureau's 2000 problem is that households
are so burdened with junk mail, telephone solicitations, and
instant communications like the fax and e-mail that the ``snail
mail'' census questionnaire has a hard time competing. For the
first time, the bureau is testing Internet responses.
</P>
<P>
   Conducting actual household head counts is even harder. The
problem is partly sociological: Many families are split or
reblended. More people cohabitate or live in group housing. An
increasing number reside in inaccessible high-rises or gated
communities. With a booming economy, people are more mobile,
working longer hours outside the home, and changing jobs and
locations more often.
</P>
<P>
   But the problem is also that many people, out of anxiety, anger,
apathy, or ignorance, are not about to cooperate with the census.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have always been groups suspicious of the government,
but never at this level of public cynicism and concern,'' Prewitt
said. ``We're a victim of that. Even though we are providing a
service, it's not always experienced that way.''
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau guarantees that the forms are confidential and
leans on the Immigration and Naturalization Service to lower its
profile during census-taking time. The agency is also working with
advocates for the homeless and migrant workers to become more
sensitive in 2000 to the fears of these groups.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Dukakis has headed the Census Bureau's New England
regional office since 1970, seeing a stunning growth in the area's
immigrant population. This time, he is preparing by setting up
language-assistance centers for Cape Verdeans in New Bedford,
Cambodians in Lowell, Latinos in Lawrence, and Haitians in
Cambridge.
</P>
<P>
   But Dukakis's biggest headache is the prospect of hiring 25,000
to 30,000 enumerators in a hot labor market.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been difficult, it's been very competitive,'' said
Dukakis, who this past winter hired 3,000 block canvassers at $8.50
to $12.50 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   The one thing that is easier this time, Dukakis said, is getting
local officials on board the census bandwagon. It could have
something to do with their worry that an urban undercount would
mean fewer federal dollars coming their way.

 By MALCOLM W. BROWNE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ Her hair is boyishly cropped, her clothes are
casual, and while riding her bike around Cape Cod she could pass as
a college freshman.
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Lene Vestergaard Hau is no freshman. A teacher at
Harvard University and an accomplished experimenter, she has gained
a formidable reputation in a branch of science traditionally
dominated by men: physics. Most of all, she is known as the
scientist who slowed light down to a walk.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Lene (pronounced LEE-nuh) Hau, at 39, is rapidly reaching
the top of her profession, her colleagues agree. On Feb. 18 the
prestigious scientific journal Nature selected for its cover
article a paper of which she was the leading author, and it caused
a mild sensation.
</P>
<P>
   In their paper, Dr. Hau, with Dr. Steve E. Harris of Stanford
University and two of Dr. Hau's Harvard students, reported the
results of their experiment in which a beam of laser light was
slowed to the astonishingly low speed of 38 miles an hour. (By
comparison, light in a vacuum travels about 186,000 miles per
second.)
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Hau's laboratory at the Rowland Institute for Science in
Cambridge (where she conducts research with the help of her
graduate and post-doctoral students from Harvard) is one of a
handful of organizations studying the interactions of lasers with a
very peculiar kind of matter called a Bose-Einstein condensate.
</P>
<P>
   It was by shining precisely tuned lasers on such a condensate,
or cloud, of ultra-cold sodium atoms that Dr. Hau and her team
reduced the speed of a light beam to a pace slower than her
bicycle.
</P>
<P>
   The achievement, noted by many newspapers, magazines and
broadcasters, was a tour de force of pure physics, and it may also
herald great practical applications. Among them could be the
development of optical switches that could enormously improve the
performance of computers.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Hau presides over a half million dollars' worth of apparatus
at the Rowland Institute, a research organization founded by the
late Edwin H. Land, the inventor of Polaroid instant photography,
to support innovative research. Unmarried, Dr. Hau lives near the
laboratory and spends most of her time either at the laboratory or
pondering the problems her next experiment will present.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find that the shower is a very good place to think things
out,'' she said, ``but sometimes I forget what I'm doing. Once I
even stepped into the shower with my clothes on.''
</P>
<P>
   Although increasing numbers of women have entered the sciences
in recent years, their participation in physics remains very
limited. Of several hundred scientists attending a typical physics
meeting, only a half dozen or so are likely to be women. Dr. Hau is
often asked how she came to be one of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``For one thing,'' she said, ``I was lucky to be a Dane. Denmark
has a long scientific tradition that included the great Niels Bohr,
one of the founders of quantum theory. In Denmark, physics is
widely respected by laymen as well as scientists, and laymen
contribute to physics. For instance, research in quantum mechanics
has been supported in Denmark by the makers of Carlsberg beer since
the 1920s. I myself was supported as a graduate student for one
year by a Carlsberg scholarship.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Hau was born in Vejle, a small town not far from the
University of Aarhus, on the east coast of Jutland.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neither of my parents had any background in science,'' she
said. ``My father was in the heating business and my mother worked
in a store. But both of them believed in giving me the same
advantages as my brother, which was very important to my
education.''
</P>
<P>
   A prodigy who skipped 10th grade, she was immediately accepted
at a ``gymnasium,'' a European upper school roughly equivalent to
the first two years of college in the United States. From childhood
Dr. Hau was fascinated by mathematics, especially geometry. ``All
my life I have needed to visualize things, even abstractions.
Without a visualization in my head I'm lost, and geometry is very
visual.''
</P>
<P>
   This approach to physics works, she said, even for visualizing
mathematical abstractions like Hilbert spaces (named for David
Hilbert, a German mathematician), which combine a variety of
physical states (or ``wave functions'') into a single mathematical
entity.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first entered Arhus University,'' Dr. Hau recalled, ``I
was bored by physics. They just taught us thermodynamics and
classical mechanics, and that bored me. But I loved mathematics. I
would rather do mathematics than go to the movies in those days.
</P>
<P>
   ``But after a while I discovered quantum mechanics, and that got
me interested in physics again, and I've been hooked ever since.''
</P>
<P>
   Quantum mechanics is a system of probabalistic rules governing
the discontinuos jumps in behavior of very small particles of
matter and energy. Transistors and many other electronic devices
work according to these rules.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Hau was awarded her PhD from the University of Arhus in 1991
after completing a dissertation on the ``channeling'' of electrons
along strings of atoms in a silicon crystal, as if the atomic
strings were miniature wave guides, like the optical fibers used to
guide light.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way she acquired a working knowledge of English,
German and French. French proved to be vital to her work during
seven months of research she conducted at CERN the European
Laboratory for Particle Physics near Geneva.
</P>
<P>
   ``The scientific papers were written in English, but the
meetings announcing the availability of various particle beams were
all in French, and without French I would have been lost,'' Dr. Hau
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I loved it at CERN. The people were really passionate about
their work. Even at 3 in the morning you would always see people in
the labs.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, while completing her PhD work, Dr. Hau made her first
trip to the United States, looking for a post-doctoral job. By then
she had received a one-year stipend from Carlsberg so she could
accept a post-doctoral university appointment without pay. Among
the scientists she met was Jene A. Golovchenko, a physicist at
Harvard, who also worked at the Rowland Institute.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   ``I told Jene what I had been doing and also that I wanted a
complete change in direction. I wanted to work on cooling atoms,''
she said. ``He told me he didn't know anything about cooling atoms
but said we could work together on it, so I was given a
post-doctoral appointment. Later, the Rowland Institute gave me a
staff job and my own laboratory.''
</P>
<P>
   Although she is a permanent United States resident, Dr. Hau has
not applied for citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to be a citizen so I could vote,'' she said,
``but I would have to give up Danish citizenship, and that would
make me feel disloyal. Last week the Danish comedian and pianist
Victor Borge performed in Boston for two straight hours _ and it
was hilarious _ even though he is 90 years old. Now there's a Dane
for you, one to make you feel proud.''
</P>
<P>
   Although much of Dr. Hau's work is done on a blackboard, she is
also a ``dirty hands'' physicist who builds and adjusts much of her
own complex apparatus.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, she and Dr. Golovchenko designed and built an ingenious
atomic beam source called the ``candlestick,'' which is now a part
of Dr. Lau's light-slowing apparatus.
</P>
<P>
   The device incorporates a ``wick'' made of gold-plated
stainless-steel cloth, which soaks up hot molten sodium metal and
wicks the sodium up to a heater that vaporizes it. A jet of hot
sodium atoms then shoots out of a pinhole into the cooling
apparatus that chills them to a tiny fraction of a degree above
absolute zero.
</P>
<P>
   An atom at room temperature moves at high speed, but when it is
bombarded from three directions by laser beams it loses energy and
slows down: it cools off. In a complicated series of stages, Dr.
Hau's apparatus uses lasers to cool the sodium atoms part way, and
then evaporates the fastest (and therefore hottest) of them, saving
the coolest in the trap.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of this cooling operation (which takes 38 seconds),
the cloud of atoms in the trap has been reduced to only 50
one-billionths of a degree above absolute zero, a temperature far
colder than any in nature, even in the depths of space.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the Uncertainty Principle _ one of the fundamental
rules of quantum mechanics _ the more precisely the momentum (or
velocity) of a particle is known, the less precisely is it possible
to measure its position, and vice versa. At exactly zero degrees
(which in practice could never be reached), a particle would have
zero momentum, a precise value.
</P>
<P>
   This would mean that the particle's position would be highly
uncertain; it might be found anywhere within a large volume of
possible places.
</P>
<P>
   The volume occupied by each ultra-cold sodium atom in Dr. Hau's
trap expands enormously, so much so that atoms in the trap are
forced to overlap and merge into what physicists call a
Bose-Einstein condensate (named for the theorists Satyendra Nath
Bose and Albert Einstein), in which the atoms' quantum wave
functions are combined.
</P>
<P>
   Once the condensate is created, a ``coupling'' laser tuned to
resonate with the trapped mass of atoms is beamed into the trap
chamber so that the atoms and photons of light become ``entangled''
with each other, behaving as if they were a single entity. A pulsed
laser probe is then shot into the ``laser dressed'' condensate from
a different direction, and some of its light passes through, but at
a speed 20 million times as slow as the speed of light in a vacuum.
</P>
<P>
   A table covered with a labyrinth of little mirrors guides a
network of beams requiring perfect adjustment, and Dr. Hau and her
team work long and tedious hours, sometimes around the clock. Their
eyes become strained from exposure to the glaring yellow laser
spots reflected from the apparatus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, we have to eat while we work, and we like pepperoni
pizza, but we have to be careful to keep the optical system
clean,'' she said. ``Each cooling cycle for the sodium atoms takes
38 seconds, and that gives us just enough time to take a bite of
pizza, change hands and flip up one of the mirrors in the optical
system to prepare for the next cooling cycle. It takes some
practice.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Hau is considering an experiment to measure localized wave
functions in the cooled atom trap, allowing her to explore the
structure of the condensate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people think it might be dangerous, that the trap might
explode. But the most worthwhile physics is often a bit
dangerous,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're looking at the computer monitor and you suddenly
see what you had hoped you would find,'' she added, ``it's the
greatest feeling in the world.''

PAPANDREOU'S GHOST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS _ Andreas Papandreou has been dead since 1996, but his
ghost still haunts Greek politics.
</P>
<P>
   These days, prominent Greeks insist that their nation has
abandoned the radicalism of the 1980s, when Papandreou was prime
minister and seemingly bent on ruining Greece's relations with the
West. An avowed Marxist, Papandreou routinely denounced the United
States and went out of his way to embrace the world's pariahs.
</P>
<P>
   Within weeks of taking office in 1981, he opened an embassy in
Cuba and invited terrorist Yasser Arafat to Athens. He flirted with
Moscow. He courted Libyan dictator Moammar Khadafy and Wojciech
Jaruzelski, Poland's military strongman. He periodically threatened
to pull out of NATO, was unequivocally pro-Arab in the Middle East,
and supported Serbia despite its atrocities in Croatia and Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   But that was then, Greeks say; things are different now. Today
Greece craves stability and warm relations with Washington and the
European democracies. ``Our main agenda,'' says Thanos Velemis,
president of the Hellenic Foundation for European and Foreign
Policy, a leading Athens think tank, ``is to integrate into the
European Union.''
</P>
<P>
   Greek politics have been roiled ever since last month, when
Turkish commandoes captured Abdullah Ocalan, leader of the Kurdish
terror group PKK. Ocalan had been secretly sheltered at the Greek
Embassy in Kenya; it was when the embassy put him in a vehicle and
sent him to the Nairobi airport that the Turks seized him. Greeks
were outraged _ not that Greece had been protecting a savage killer
but that it had failed to keep him out of Turkish hands. Three
government ministers were sacked, and there were calls as well for
the head of Prime Minister Costas Simitis.
</P>
<P>
   Try to talk to Athens policy mavens about any of this, though,
and they push the conversation back to Greece's drive to join the
new European currency, the euro. They point with justifiable pride
to the Simitis government's economic achievements: inflation is
sharply down, the growth rate is up, and both the deficit and the
public debt have fallen as a share of GDP. And they insist that
Greece's key foreign-policy goals are stability in the Balkans and
close integration with the West.
</P>
<P>
   Yet if it is clear that Greece has turned its back on the worst
excesses of Papandreou, it is equally clear that Papandreouism is
not quite a thing of the past.
</P>
<P>
   As the Ocalan affair suggests, Greece continues to carry a torch
for some of the world's bloodiest villains. Government officials
refuse to label the PKK a terrorist organization, despite its long
history of murder and mayhem. Some 30,000 people have died in PKK
attacks; it has killed teachers, journalists, and children; its
methods range from setting homes on fire to pulling drivers out of
cars and machine-gunning them. Yet Greeks persist in seeing Ocalan
as a freedom fighter, a stance that puts them sharply at odds with
the United States and Western Europe.
</P>
<P>
   There is no evidence that the PKK operates training camps on
Greek soil, as Turkey routinely alleges. Still, no one disputes
that the PKK raises substantial amounts of money in Greece, or that
its political support runs deep. At the national convention of the
ruling Socialist party earlier this month, delegates chanted,
``Freedom for Ocalan.''
</P>
<P>
   The same party congress welcomed a special foreign guest with a
thundering ovation. That guest was not one of Europe's left-leaning
leaders, such as Britain's Tony Blair or the new German chancellor,
Gerhard Schroeder. It was Papandreou's old favorite, Yasser Arafat.
Granted, the PLO boss is no longer the international leper he was
in 1981; he would receive a polite reception even in some Israeli
circles. But there was no mistaking the thrill in Simitis's voice
as he introduced Arafat, or the delirium in the hall as the
delegates cheered. This was not politeness; it was hero worship.
</P>
<P>
   Greek policy in the Middle East is not as bitterly anti-Israel
as it was in the 1980s. ``We have good relations with the whole
region,'' says George Papandreous, the soft-spoken foreign minister
(and son of the late prime minister). ``We want good relations with
Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet he does not say no when asked if Greece is moving closer to
rejectionist Arab and Muslim states like Syria and Iran. Instead he
asks, ``Shouldn't we try to help encourage the forces of reform in
Iran?''
</P>
<P>
   But there is more to it than that. In a widely noticed article
in Commentary last November, American scholar Daniel Pipes wrote:
``Greeks hate and fear Turks. And so, in the time-honored fashion
of the Middle East, they seek to befriend other enemies of Turkey,
whoever they may be.''
</P>
<P>
   Hence Greek military cooperation with Syria, which includes the
exchange of information and sale of equipment. Hence the Syrian
prime minister's description of Greece as the country friendliest
to Damascus outside the Arab world. The previous Greek foreign
minister said in 1996 that Greece's position on the Israeli-Arab
question is nearly identical to Syria's. The close ties between
Turkey and Israel, on the other hand, he called ``an alliance of
malefactors.'' That's the sort of remark Andreas Papandreou would
have made.
</P>
<P>
   Greeks, in short, feel tugged in two directions. There is no
mistaking their commitment to European unity, Western democracy,
and economic reform. At the same time, they still despise the
Turks, still chafe at American predominance, and still make common
cause with rogues and dictators. Papandreou may be gone, but the
politics he nurtured live on.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A gay New York pediatrician has enlisted 10 nursing mothers to
supply breast milk for the baby he and his partner have adopted.
The baby, now 5 months old, is thriving on the donated milk.
</P>
<P>
   In another part of town, a 19-year-old Bronx woman is being
prosecuted for the death from starvation of the 7-week-old baby she
had been faithfully nursing but inadequately nourishing.
</P>
<P>
   Each case dramatically illustrates well-known but little-heeded
facts about breast-feeding.
</P>
<P>
   Fact one: As good as infant formulas now are, breast milk is
still universally recognized as superior food for the first six
months of life, which is what prompted the pediatrician to go to
great lengths to get breast milk for his baby.
</P>
<P>
   Fact two: As the young Bronx woman so tragically learned,
nursing does not necessarily come naturally to either mothers or
babies, who often need help in mastering this skill.
</P>
<P>
   Corollaries to these facts are two problems.
</P>
<P>
   Problem one: American employers make few accommodations for new
mothers, most of whom get no or only brief paid maternity leave. In
Norway, mothers may get full pay for 42 weeks of maternity leave or
four-fifths pay for 52 weeks, but American law stipulates only 12
weeks of unpaid leave. Nor do most American employers provide child
care at the workplace so that mothers can nurse their babies during
the workday, or private areas where nursing mothers can pump and
refrigerate breast milk for later use.
</P>
<P>
   Problem two: Although most hospitals that deliver babies employ
a lactation specialist, new mothers generally leave the hospital
within two days of childbirth, before most problems with nursing
are likely to surface. Many mothers could benefit greatly from a
home visit from a lactation specialist within the first two weeks
of a birth. Experts say that the first few weeks of nursing are
pivotal, and this is the time that many struggling mothers give up.
They rarely get the kind of practical guidance on nursing from
pediatricians that they would get from lactation specialists
trained in solving breast-feeding problems.
</P>
<P>
   Breast-feeding has enjoyed a well-deserved burst in popularity
in recent decades, when pediatric specialists finally succeeded in
overcoming the commercial pressures on modern women to feed their
babies formula. Lately, however, the numbers have been dropping
from their peak in the 1980s. Now, only about 60 percent of mothers
are nursing their babies when they leave the hospital and only 30
percent are still nursing six months later. By the end of this
year, according to the goals set in Healthy People 2000, the
surgeon general had hoped that three-fourths of all new mothers
would be nursing when they took their babies home.
</P>
<P>
   And while well-educated women have the highest initial
breast-feeding rates, they are also the women most likely to run
into career conflicts should they wish to continue nursing for the
full first year of their babies' lives, as recommended by the
American Academy of Pediatrics.
</P>
<P>
   Advantages and Disadvantages
</P>
<P>
   Even before a new mother's milk comes in, the colostrum her
breasts secrete helps her baby's development. Colostrum contains
substances that promote maturation of the infant's gut and that
facilitate digestion. It also contains immune substances that
protect against infection.
</P>
<P>
   The protein in human milk is well absorbed and used, especially
by the infant's brain. Fats in breast milk are more digestible than
those in formula, and breast milk calories are used more
efficiently. Breast milk also contains growth factors, various
enzymes and hormones and other substances that may aid an infant's
development.
</P>
<P>
   Studies have shown that breast milk enhances the development of
the immune system. All other things being equal, babies who are
breast-fed suffer fewer bacterial and viral illnesses and are
better protected against allergies, diarrhea, ear infections,
diabetes and possibly cancer as well. They also respond better to
immunizations.
</P>
<P>
   But there are health disadvantages to breast-feeding as well.
Infection with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, can be transmitted
from mother to baby through breast milk. So can antibiotics and
other drugs a mother may have to take. Also, infants who inherit a
condition called galactosemia, an inability to process one of the
sugars in breast milk, should not be breast-fed.
</P>
<P>
   Mothers may have physical problems that interfere with nursing.
The Bronx teen-ager whose nursing infant died, for example, had
undergone breast reduction surgery, which greatly reduced her milk
supply. Her baby seemed to be nursing properly but, unbeknown to
her, got little nourishment. Lacking medical guidance and thinking
she was doing the best for her baby, the young inexperienced mother
never realized that the infant was starving.
</P>
<P>
   Learning to Nurse
</P>
<P>
   Every new mother needs and deserves some help with
breast-feeding. Even those with nursing experience may need help
since babies differ in their ability to nurse. Sometimes, too, a
mother's milk does not come in fully by the third day after
delivery _ stress, for example, can delay milk production _ and the
baby may need supplemental formula for nutrition or at least water
to prevent dehydration.
</P>
<P>
   Help should start well before the baby is born, with information
about the benefits and risks of breast-feeding and general guidance
on technique. A woman with inverted or flat nipples can correct
their shape by wearing a special shield in her bra during the last
months of pregnancy. Those who will have to return to work soon
after giving birth may want to work out a plan for part-time
nursing, supplementing with formula or perhaps breast milk that is
pumped during the workday.
</P>
<P>
   Even a mother who is determined to nurse can become discouraged
if her nipples get very sore or cracked. This problem can be
avoided or alleviated by learning how to remove the baby from the
breast by first sliding a finger into the corner of the infant's
mouth to break the suction. Soreness can be relieved by warm or
cold compresses or by blowing warm (not hot) air from a hair dryer
on the nipples.
</P>
<P>
   Nursing mothers also have to pay careful attention to their own
diets. This is no time to try to lose those extra pounds that
accumulated during pregnancy. A healthy diet can be achieved by
each day following the recommendations of the Food Guide Pyramid:
six to 11 servings of grain-based foods, three to five servings of
vegetables, two to three servings of fruits, two to three servings
of a high-protein food and two to three servings of dairy products
plus at least eight 8-ounce glasses of water a day. Many doctors
also recommend that nursing mothers continue to take their prenatal
vitamins. In general, experts recommend avoiding caffeinated
drinks. In addition, mothers often find that certain foods they
consume upset a nursing baby's digestion and are best avoided.
</P>
<P>
   As for medications, although most do get into breast milk, only
a relative few should be avoided when nursing. These include
doxorubicin, ergotamine preparations, lithium, methotrexate,
cyclosporin and bromocriptine.

<P>
   As Gary Pozsik waited in his doctor's examining room last April
for the final results of his yearly physical examination, he knew
he was in for yet another discussion of his high cholesterol and
his treatment options. But when the familiar subject came up,
Pozsik, 48, a radio journalist in Columbia, S.C., was startled by
what he heard.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of diet, exercise or one of the half-dozen prescription
medications commonly used to lower blood cholesterol, Pozsik's
doctor encouraged him to try something else: a nonprescription
compound that Pozsik would not find in any pharmacy but instead
could order right there in the doctor's office _ cash, check or
charge _ with his doctor's personal assurances of its safety and
effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   ``It bothered me, and it bothered me a lot,'' Pozsik said. The
host of a radio talk show focusing on health-related issues, Pozsik
recognized immediately that the supplement was a fiber-based
product whose merits had not been accepted in orthodox medical
circles, and whose sale was netting his doctor a tidy profit.
</P>
<P>
   Pozsik declined to buy the supplement, and although he and his
doctor are still on good terms, the memory of his doctor's brief
transformation from impartial consultant to entrepreneur still
disturbs him. ``I think this is taking advantage of your patients
and it's not the route to go,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Patients, doctors and professional groups around the country are
increasingly unsettled by a trend toward merchandising in medical
offices, attributing it to physicians' desire to supplement incomes
that have been squeezed by managed care. No statistics are
available to indicate how widespread the practice is, but doctors'
groups are quietly drafting policies about when selling items to
patients is an acceptable part of medical practice.
</P>
<P>
   State medical boards, the appointed bodies that license and
discipline physicians, have no specific prohibitions against
selling commodities to patients, making it a generally legal part
of medicine, said Dale L. Austin, deputy executive vice president
of the Federation of State Medical Boards.
</P>
<P>
   But these state boards are increasingly concerned about the
ethics of the practice, Austin said, and whether it unfairly
coerces patients into becoming customers.
</P>
<P>
   Selling goods out of medical offices is unquestionably becoming
more common, said Dr. Robert M. Tenery Jr., a Dallas
ophthalmologist who heads the American Medical Association's
Council on Ethical and Judicial Affairs. The association has
received repeated complaints from both doctors and patients about
the practice in the last few years, Tenery said.
</P>
<P>
   But doctors disagree so bitterly about the practice that the
association has not been able to adopt an overall policy on it,
despite several years of effort.
</P>
<P>
   Items for sale range from prescription eyeglasses and contact
lenses to vitamins and nutritional supplements to products that
have nothing to do with health care, like mops and magazine
subscriptions.
</P>
<P>
   Little controversy surrounds the items at either end of the
range. Although state policies on doctors' dispensing prescription
drugs and devices vary, the AMA has long held that it is a
generally permissible part of medical practice. Then, in December
1997, the group endorsed a policy that strongly discouraged doctors
from selling goods unrelated to health care, like cleaning
products, pointing out that the practice almost always exploits the
desire of patients to please their doctors.
</P>
<P>
   But those products in the gray zone where health, nutrition and
beauty meet _vitamins, dietary supplements, skin care products,
weight-loss aids _ have generated bitter debate about whether
doctors can be objective about their effects on health and sell
them for profit at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   Last June, the medical association considered adopting a policy
condemning the for-profit sales of these goods out of doctors'
offices, but then rejected it, reflecting doctors' profound
ambivalence on both the science and the ethics behind the practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was rejected because there are a lot of physicians out
there who really felt that we were denying their patients access to
proper care,'' Tenery said, ``and I think there were also a lot of
physicians out there who are now depending a great deal on income
coming from selling products to their patients.''
</P>
<P>
   In a recent editorial in The New England Journal of Medicine,
Dr. Jerome Kassirer called the office marketing of products a
result of doctors' pervasive discontent with the financial and
professional constraints that managed care had brought into their
lives.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, for the last five years, Dr. Fred Vasta, an internist in
Quakertown, Pa., has cut his medical work down to about 18 hours a
week, and has spent the remainder of his time distributing goods
and services through Amway, in which freelance entrepreneurs known
as distributors earn commissions on both their own sales of
products and services, like vitamins, household products and
airline tickets, and those of people they enlist to become
distributors.
</P>
<P>
   Vasta said he earned approximately equal incomes from both
halves of his professional life, and with his involvement in a new
Amway Internet venture he is anticipating quitting medicine
entirely.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you think I went through college and professional school
and professional training and all this to have managed care come
and tell me that I was worth eight cents on the dollar for a
patient each month?'' Vasta said. ``You can't even treat a patient
the way it's supposed to be done anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Some doctors say that medical considerations, rather than
financial ones, prompt them to recommend products. Dr. John David
Berryman, an obstetrician-gynecologist in Washington, estimates
that in the last year he has steered almost 500 of his patients to
a line of herbal compounds for weight loss and premenstrual
symptoms, products that are ordered through a member of his office
staff.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   He finds that patients who are leery of prescription
medications, like hormone replacement drugs, are often enthusiastic
about these nonprescription alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I pick the best product I can and tell patients what it does
and they can make the choice,'' Berryman said. ``I'm not wedded to
them taking it or not taking it.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Berryman carefully distances himself from the actual
transactions as well as the profits. ``I don't make money on
this,'' he said. ``That's unethical as far as I'm concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   Starlight International, whose products Berryman uses, is a
direct marketing company with headquarters in Monterey, Calif. The
staff member in the doctor's office who orders products for both
patients and staff members is a Starlight distributor.
</P>
<P>
   One of these companies with the greatest appeal to physicians
has been Rexall Showcase International, with headquarters in Boca
Raton, Fla. Rexall distributes vitamins, diet aids, homeopathic
medicines, skin-care products and home water-filtration systems. A
spokeswoman for the company estimated that about 30 percent of its
distributors were in the health-related professions.
</P>
<P>
   The company has created a distributor recruitment tape
specifically aimed at physicians on which nine doctors, including
board-certified internists, cardiologists and surgeons, deliver
testimonials about the efficacy of a patented fiber-based Rexall
product for lowering blood cholesterol, promoting weight loss and
preventing cancer. On the tape, the product is called ``a gift of
health and a gift of finance'' with a ``fair and lucrative
compensation plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Doctors emphasize that the additional income provided by selling
the products can enable them to practice medicine in a more
thorough fashion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things in medicine are changing,'' Dr. Franklin L. Murphy, a
cardiologist in Los Angeles, says on the Rexall tape. ``I want to
continue to practice medicine the way I feel it should be
practiced. I don't want to do the HMO medicine, and this provides
me a vehicle, another alternative source of income, where I don't
have to do the HMO medicine and I can do the fee-for-service
medicine.''
</P>
<P>
   In a recent telephone interview Murphy said of the Rexall
product, ``I think everyone should be on it.'' But he said he
recommended the product only to patients with elevated cholesterol
as an alternative to standard cholesterol-lowering agents. ``I
don't stock a big line of products in the office,'' he said.
``Patients order them directly from the company, and I get a very
small royalty from their purchase.''
</P>
<P>
   Rexall promotional material indicates that distributors earn 25
percent to 45 percent profits on retail sales and as much as 20
percent commission on the sales of people they enroll in the
company.
</P>
<P>
   None of the physicians on the tape specify their compensation.
</P>
<P>
   Although the vast majority of distributors in direct-selling
organizations like Rexall make relatively little for their efforts,
physician-distributors may net thousands of dollars a year from
their participation. They lend the products they offer for sale an
implicit professional endorsement, and may wind up selling them to
hundreds of patients and recruiting dozens of colleagues to do
likewise.
</P>
<P>
   Medical ethicists have repeatedly noted that in addition to the
perplexing questions about whether herbal preparations and
nutritional supplements do all that is claimed, the marketing of
these agents directly by doctor to patient raises other issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``It creates a financial conflict of interest,'' said Dr. Donald
E. Saunders Jr., a professor of medicine and bioethicist at the
University of South Carolina in Columbia, ``and it demeans the
practice of medicine. I think this kind of thing really wounds the
trust bond between the physician and the patient.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Doctors always have an unfair advantage in dealing with
patients,'' Saunders said. ``Fundamental to medical ethics is to
curb that power and work against our own interests if that's what
it takes to put the patient first.''
</P>
<P>
   Other physicians maintain that the ethical distinction between
accepting money for services rendered and selling a line of
products is new and artificial. Dermatologists, for example, have
historically made and sold their own skin-care products.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have more comfort with what my patients are getting from my
office compared with what they may be buying from the pharmacy or
department store,'' wrote Dr. David R. Harris, a dermatologist at
Stanford University in Palo Alto, Calif., in a debate on the
subject in the journal Dermatologic Surgery last July.
</P>
<P>
   Some individual physicians _ often those who have parted ways
with orthodox medicine _ now sponsor substantial product lines. Dr.
Robert Atkins, for instance, who has long advocated the importance
of a low-carbohydrate diet for weight loss and cardiovascular
health, sells more than a hundred products from a Web site and a
store attached to his Manhattan offices. The products range from
sugar-free maple syrup to capsules of the steroid hormone
pregnenolone.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't bother me at all,'' said one of Atkins' patients,
Malcolm Varon, a New York photographer who estimated that even with
a 25 percent patient discount he spent more than $200 a month on
Atkins' products. ``You're more likely to get people to take what
you want them to take if you have it right there. It's perfectly
legitimate as a way of promoting what he feels is the preferred way
of treating many diseases.''

   Jock Roy, 55, a businessman from Hanover, N.H., has suffered
from peanut allergies ever since he bit into a peanut butter
sandwich at a birthday party nearly 50 years ago. He described his
reactions as beginning with a prickly sensation in the mouth and
throat followed by a feeling of sickness and swelling of the throat
and sinuses lasting up to four hours.
</P>
<P>
   Every year, about 100 people die from complications associated
with allergic reactions to food, and peanuts and tree nuts are
often the culprits. Now researchers at Johns Hopkins University
School of Medicine have taken the first small step toward
preventing peanut allergy reactions in humans with an oral
vaccination that seems to work on mice. Their findings appear in
the current issue of the journal Nature Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers took the cloned gene for the peanut allergen,
Arah2, combined its DNA with a chemical that aids the delivery of
pharmaceutical agents to the intestines and fed it to mice. The
vaccinated mice were protected from the symptoms of peanut allergen
more efficiently than mice that were just given the DNA by itself
or that were not given any DNA.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know the exact mechanism,'' said Krishnendu Roy (no
relation to Jock), a graduate student at the biomedical engineering
department at Johns Hopkins University and lead author of the
study.
</P>
<P>
   The only proven treatment for people with the allergy has been
educating them to avoid peanuts. But even the cautious sometimes
accidentally ingest them. According to the report, 50 percent of
peanut allergy patients who are treated annually ingested the
peanuts by accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once I was at a restaurant and the pink ravioli with a white
wine-based cream sauce I ordered had crushed peanuts in the
sauce,'' said Robert Peters, 34, a sales executive from Hempstead,
N.Y., who suffers from a severe peanut allergy. ``I got two
ravenous bites into my mouth and then I felt the tingling.'' He
said the tingling usually gives way to a swelling in the lower
abdomen, and within an hour he passes out unless he gets to a
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Roy of Johns Hopkins is unsure about the possibilities of an
oral vaccination for patients like Peters and Roy. ``The study
looked at prevention rather than using this vaccination on someone
who has already had the allergy. We still don't know if the vaccine
will work in that way.''

   ADOLESCENCE: A Devastating Disorder, Beyond a Phase
</P>
<P>
   Teen-agers fretting over how they look may not be just going
through a phase. Some may be suffering from body dysmorphic
disorder (BDD), a severe preoccupation with an imagined or slight
defect in appearance. This often secret and little recognized
malady can lead sufferers to drop out of school, shun social
contacts and even try suicide, say researchers at Brown University.
</P>
<P>
   BDD is similar to anorexia nervosa except that sufferers worry
about any aspect of their appearance, not just weight, explained
Dr. Katharine Phillips, author of ``The Broken Mirror,'' a book on
the disorder. ``They look OK but think they don't,'' she said.
``They worry they will be considered superficial or vain if they
tell people about their concerns, but in reality they suffer
incredibly.''
</P>
<P>
   Reporting in the April issue of the Journal of the American
Academy of Child &AMP; Adolescent Psychiatry, Dr. Phillips and her
husband, Dr. Ralph Albertini, looked at 33 young people, ages 6 to
17, in whom BDD had been diagnosed. They say that this was the
largest study to date on adolescents with the disorder.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers found that the schooling, jobs and social life
of almost all had been disrupted. Twenty-two of them had considered
suicide; seven had tried. Five were were unable to leave their
homes even though what they considered physical defects were either
nonexistent or slight. Most preoccupations were with skin and hair,
but subjects also complained about short legs and gaps between
teeth.
</P>
<P>
   In studies with adults, Dr. Phillips found that one in 50
people, mainly women, may have the disorder. Most of them are in
their 30s, but she believes 70 percent of the cases begin before
age 18.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of the disorder is unknown, although biological,
psychological and socio-cultural factors are suspected, Dr.
Phillips said. The disorder is not simply the result of Madison
Avenue's rising power, she added. Relatives suspecting that a child
has BDD should consider it a serious problem, not just a phase, she
urged.
</P>
<P>
   In the study, symptoms were treated through cognitive-behavioral
therapy and antidepressants. A pharmaceutical company helped
support the project, but it was not a drug treatment trial, Dr.
Phillips said.
</P>
<P>
   More information about this disorder may be found at a Web site,
www.butler.org/bdd.html.

   BEHAVIOR: Sexual Abuse, When Men Are Victims
</P>
<P>
   Researchers have learned a great deal in recent years about
female victims of sexual abuse and its often tragic consequences.
But much less is known about men who are sexually abused. How often
does it happen? And what are its effects?
</P>
<P>
   A British survey, the largest epidemiological study of
nonconsensual sexual experiences in men to date, offers some
preliminary answers. In the study, which appears in the current
issue of The British Medical Journal, professor Michael King and
his colleagues at the Royal Free and University College Medical
School in London used computerized questionnaires to survey 2,474
male patients of 18 general practitioners in England.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers found that 3 percent of the men reported having
had nonconsensual sexual experiences after reaching age 16, and 5
percent said they had been sexually abused as children.
Surprisingly, when the abuse occurred at age 16 and above, women
were just as likely to be the perpetrators as men, the researchers
found, while men were the most frequent perpetrators of abuse in
children.
</P>
<P>
   Men in the study who had been sexually abused had higher rates
of psychological problems, alcohol misuse and self-destructive
behaviors than men who were not abused, the study found.
</P>
<P>
   The British researchers cited two other studies that have
examined sexual abuse in men. One was a 1987 study in Los Angeles,
which reported that 7 percent of 1,480 men were victims of
nonconsensual sex after the age of 16; the other was a British
study of 930 homosexual men, which found that more than 25 percent
had been subjected to nonconsensual sex.
</P>
<P>
   King said the rates of sexual abuse found in the new study might
turn out to be underestimates, because it was often hard to get
people to respond frankly to questions about sexual trauma. ``It's
very difficult to interview men cold about a serious problem in
their lives,'' King said.

NEW QUESTIONS ABOUT POPULAR FERTILIZATION TECHNIQUE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ore., Mo., Calif., Md.)  (The Science Times) 
(mk) 
 By GINA KOLATA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A popular technique to help infertile men become fathers,
injecting individual sperm into individual eggs, alters the
fertilization process, researchers have found. They said there was
no evidence so far that the technique affected babies conceived
with it, but they said the finding raised troubling questions of
what doctors should tell infertile couples.
</P>
<P>
   The technique, intercytoplasmic sperm injection, or ICSI
(pronounced ICK-see), was developed about seven years ago and has
been adopted by virtually every major infertility program. Tens of
thousands of babies have been born through ICSI, which costs about
$10,000 per pregnancy attempt.
</P>
<P>
   But in a paper published Tuesday in the journal Nature Medicine,
Dr. Gerald Schatten and his colleagues at Oregon Health Sciences
University in Portland, working with eggs and sperm from rhesus
monkeys, report that the actual injection can damage proteins in
the egg that push and pull chromosomes into line before cell
division and that fertilization through ICSI skews the egg's
otherwise orderly removal of proteins from sperm.
</P>
<P>
   ICSI was discovered by accident seven years ago when Belgian
doctors inadvertently injected a man's sperm directly into a
woman's egg while trying to inject the sperm into a space between
the egg's outer and inner membranes. No one thought the method
would work _ when scientists had injected whole sea urchin sperm
into sea urchin eggs, the sperm had briskly swum around in the
eggs' cytoplasm and showed no sign of fertilizing the eggs. But,
astonishingly, the human egg began to divide and turned into an
embryo, then a fetus, then a baby. Overnight, a revolutionary
treatment emerged.
</P>
<P>
   With ICSI, any man who produces sperm, even if he does not
ejaculate the sperm, even if sperm never mature in his testes, even
if sperm die on their way to being ejaculated, can become a father.
Doctors can take sperm that were ejaculated or can remove sperm
from the testicles and inject a single sperm cell into a single
egg, fertilizing it.
</P>
<P>
   Before ICSI, said Dr. Sherman Silber, the director of the
Infertility Center of St. Louis, at best 5 percent of infertile men
could be treated. Now, he said, 99 percent can father children. The
method, he added, ``has completely revolutionized the treatment of
male infertility.'' It is so successful, Silber said, that some
infertility centers do not even bother with normal fertilization,
but simply inject each man's sperm into his partner's egg,
reasoning that fertilization rates will be higher with ICSI.
</P>
<P>
   But even as the technique was coming into wide use in people,
some biologists wondered about its safety. The question was
difficult to study in the usual small mammals, like hamsters and
mice, because the molecular biology of fertilization is different
in these animals and even the size and texture of their eggs
differ. Until Schatten's studies, no one had used ICSI on any
primate other than humans.
</P>
<P>
   Schatten studied what he calls the ``molecular undressing'' of a
sperm cell by an egg. Sperm cells keep their genetic material
tamped down into a cramped space, held in place by at least two
proteins that form a sheathlike structure over the sperm's head.
Ordinarily, the egg removes one of these proteins as the sperm cell
passes through the egg's outer membrane and takes off others as the
sperm makes its way through the cytoplasm to the egg's nucleus. By
the time the sperm cell arrives at its destination, its genetic
material is freed and replication can begin.
</P>
<P>
   With ICSI, Schatten found, the sheathlike proteins remain in
place far longer and then, when the first protein comes off, the
sperm's genetic material starts to abruptly push its way out. The
carefully choreographed disrobing of the sperm is disrupted.
Schatten said he had preliminary evidence that the X chromosome is
at the tip of the sperm's genetic material, indicating that it may
be preferentially affected by the unusual way the sperm's
chromosomes spill out into the egg.
</P>
<P>
   But Schatten said there was no evidence from his studies of
monkeys that the differences affected the resulting infants. He
said he used ICSI to create 14 monkey embryos that resulted in six
pregnancies and four live offspring. One monkey was born dead but
appeared anatomically normal. The other pregnancy ended in a
miscarriage.
</P>
<P>
   With humans, said Dolores Lamb, a male infertility researcher at
Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, 20 percent to 40 percent of
the couples who use ICSI have live babies, a rate comparable to the
rate for in-vitro fertilization. But she said that couples who came
to Baylor typically went home to have their babies and did not
necessarily report back on how healthy the babies were. Chromosome
studies cost $500, she said, so no one does them. She said the
safety question was ``under-studied.''
</P>
<P>
   One reason, Schatten said, may be that parents do not want to
identify their children as having been conceived through ICSI.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents don't want their baby called an ICSI baby,'' Schatten
said. ``They just want a normal kid and so they often drop out of
studies.''
</P>
<P>
   The few attempts by infertility specialists to keep track of
ICSI babies yielded mixed results. Some studies found that the
babies appeared normal. Others reported slight increases in birth
defects, especially abnormalities of the sex chromosomes. But it
was not clear whether those were problems caused by the procedure
or inherited from the fathers who were, after all, infertile.
</P>
<P>
   Some doctors point out that virtually all chromosomal defects
are lethal to embryos and so, even if ICSI damages an embryo,
nature will screen out those with severe problems.
</P>
<P>
   If there were an epidemic of severely damaged ICSI babies, it
would be noticed, these doctors say. Dr. Alan DeCherney, a
fertility specialist at the University of California in Los
Angeles, said that when he counsels couples about ICSI, ``I tell
them the risks appear to be extremely small.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Barry Zirkin, a reproductive biologist at Johns Hopkins
University in Baltimore, is less sanguine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's important not to rush to ICSI,'' Zirkin said.
``There's a lot we don't understand.''
</P>
<P>
   Zirkin said that if he were infertile he would adopt.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that's me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Couples who choose ICSI, Zirkin said, ``need to understand what
we know for sure _ that you can get a baby _ and what we don't know
for sure _ a lot about what that baby is going to be like and what
his or her offspring are going to be like.''
</P>
<P>
   Schatten said he knew from personal experience the emotional
pull to have a baby and the reluctance of many couples to use a
sperm donor when the man's sperm are inadequate. He said he
understood the importance of ICSI and the reason many do not want
the technique taken away while scientists spend years, even
decades, studying whether the method could affect the genes of the
children conceived with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the first to say this is a miraculous technique,''
Schatten said. ``I can't see going to someone who would say, `Yeah,
I can give you a kid but I want another 35 years of research before
I'm going to touch this.'''

A FRESH, IF REVISIONIST, LOOK AT THE GREAT WAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID M. SHRIBMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   World War I is beyond almost anyone's memory, but it remains
vivid in our imagination. The terrible trenches. The poison gas.
The horrible price paid, in blood and treasure, for minimal gains.
The irresistible way big-power politics dragged Europe into war,
disillusionment, depression, and war again.
</P>
<P>
   For decades it has been fixed in historical memory as an
inevitable conflict caused by the rapacious militarism of Germany,
ignited by the hopelessly rigid system of European alliances, and
ending in a harsh peace that did little but bring on Hitler, World
War II, and the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing stays the same forever, not even the past, and now
Niall Ferguson, the enfant terrible of the Oxford history
establishment, has produced the modern revisionism that was, alas,
inevitable even if the war itself was not. His argument is simple:
Everything you thought about the start of the war is wrong, and so
is most of what you thought about how it was fought and how it
ended.
</P>
<P>
   The truth, of course, is that the war was so big, so
devastating, so portentous, and so significant that there is no
single truth about it _ just many truths, banging around like
pinballs in an arcade game, bouncing off one another, landing at
random but adding up to a set of conclusions that we already knew:
It was so unnecessary. Europe's leaders were fools. Europe's people
paid the price.
</P>
<P>
   Ferguson, the author of a well-received book on the Rothschild
banking dynasty, does shatter the display cases of the museum of
World War I. He argues, as any revisionist must, that the war
didn't have to happen, that Germany wasn't an overwhelming threat
to European peace, that the allies who won were far less adept at
the art of war than the Central Powers who lost, and that German
hegemony in Europe wouldn't have been so terrible anyhow, given
that three-quarters of a century later there is a peaceful German
hegemony in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The war, he concludes in this massive and oftentimes persuasive
book, was ``something worse than a tragedy, which is something we
are taught by the theatre to regard as ultimately unavoidable. It
was nothing less than the greatest error of modern history.''
</P>
<P>
   Ferguson draws his title and his sense of irony from Wilfred
Owen, the World War I poet who spoke of the ``truth untold'': ``the
pity of war.'' He argues in an affecting introduction that World
War I was ``the worst thing the people of my country have ever had
to endure.'' There is no argument there _ twice as many Britons
died as did in World War II _ but the reexamination that follows
his opening caused arguments galore last year in the senior commons
rooms of Oxford and in seminar rooms across the universities of
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the Ferguson book is the notion that World War I
wasn't inevitable. Nothing is, of course, so on the surface that's
not much of a revelation. But for decades historians have embraced
the notion that, as David Lloyd George wrote in his ``War
Memoirs,'' ``The nations slithered over the brink into the boiling
cauldron of war.'' Indeed, contemporary British politicians argued
_ as H. H. Asquith, the wartime prime minister, did with an eye on
the suffering Belgians in the early days of the conflict _ that it
was ``impossible for people of our blood and history to stand by .
. . while a big bully sets to work to thrash and trample to the
ground a victim who has given him no provocation.''
</P>
<P>
   Here are some of the other elements of Ferguson's revisionist
view: Militarism was in decline, not on the march, in Europe on the
eve of the war. The principal economic fact of early-20th-century
European life was not the growth of German power but the extent of
British power. Despite the broadly held British view that Germany
(as Eyre Crowe warned in 1907) wanted to play ``a much larger and
more dominant part than she finds allotted to herself,'' the most
significant factor in diplomatic affairs was the fact that Britain
ruled 444 million people in 1914. In sheer military strength,
British warship tonnage was more than twice that of Germany.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, according to this theory, the war began not because
of Germany's strength but because of its weakness. ``The key to the
arms race before 1914 is that one side lost it, or believed it was
losing it,'' Ferguson writes. ``It was this belief which persuaded
its leaders to gamble on war before they fell too far behind.''
That country was not Britain, as commonly believed (and taught). It
was Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Germany lurched toward war not because it was thirsting for
conflict but because it was worried that its position in Europe was
deteriorating, Ferguson argues. Some of the figures bear that out.
In the period 1870-1913, Britain devoted 3.1 percent of its net
national product to defense expenditures and France devoted 4.0
percent. Germany devoted 3.2 percent. The resulting calculation:
Together, the nations that Germany ended up fighting in World War I
were spending Berlin into subservience. And though one of the
cliches of the period is the rise of German commercial and
industrial power, the weakness of Germany's economy and the
constraints on its growth were well known in London. And in Berlin,
there was a clear sense of which way the tides of power were
running. ``Prospects could never come better for us,'' said the
German military leader Georg Count Waldersee in July 1914, with an
eye on new armament initiatives in France and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Once the war began, Britain was motivated far less by the peril
that Germany posed to Belgium than by the peril Germany posed to
Britain. It is quaint in this season of scandal to consider that
the essential historical evidence for this is contained in
Asquith's letter to his mistress and in the recollections of Lloyd
George's mistress. But so be it. One of the lessons of this book is
the irony of history, or of historians.
</P>
<P>
   It turned out, according to Ferguson, that Britain's involvement
in the war not only widened it but also widened Germany's war aims.
As early as July 1914, Germany was willing to guarantee the
territorial integrity of both France and Belgium. That fell by the
wayside, and a new notion _ thrusting Russia ``back as far as
possible from Germany's eastern frontier'' _ emerged.
</P>
<P>
   One of the way stations of the Ferguson volume is a disagreeable
digression on the efficiency of war, and he makes the point that
``the Central Powers were at least a third better at mass
slaughter'' than their opponents. That is ghoulish, to be sure,
even though it is impossible to separate war from death. A far more
interesting fact may be this: At no point in the war did the Allies
kill more Germans than the number who turned 18 that year. ``If
attrition really had been the way to win the war,'' Ferguson
writes, ``it still would have been going strong in 1919, with the
German cohort of new recruits at its highest level of any year
since 1914.''
</P>
<P>
   These are all fascinating facts, the building blocks perhaps of
a thesis, but, sad to say, not of themselves a thesis. Even if it
is true, for example, that Germany's national-security position was
better off in 1914 than it would have been in 1915 and 1916, why
does it follow that there had to be a war at all? Even if it is
true that Britain didn't have to go to the aid of Belgium, why
should the historian assume that Britain would abandon one of its
strategic imperatives, the integrity of the low countries?
</P>
<P>
   That said, the Ferguson volume is a significant contribution to
the historiography of the war, asking uncomfortable questions and
drawing uncomfortable conclusions. One uncomfortable set of
questions and conclusions involves the place of Germany in Europe,
with or without the war. Ferguson argues that the German war goals
_ reducing the power of Russia, creating a European customs union,
acquiring French colonies _ ``were all goals which were
complementary to British interests.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he answers Crowe's critical question: ``Should the war
come, and England stand aside . . . (and) Germany and Austria win,
crush France and humiliate Russia, what will then be the position
of a friendless England?''
</P>
<P>
   Here is Ferguson's answer: ``better than that of an exhausted
England in 1919.'' Ask an uncomfortable question, get an
uncomfortable answer.

`MAD COW DISEASE' SEEN IN FRENCH ZOOS 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)  
(lh) 
 By SANDRA BLAKESLEE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A large number of monkeys and lemurs in French zoos appear to be
infected with the agent that causes mad cow disease, according to a
provocative study published Tuesday in the Proceedings of the
National Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   Although it is not the first time that the disease has been
found in monkeys and lemurs, the extent of the infection is
surprising, researchers said. When 18 apparently healthy lemurs
were killed and their tissues examined, every single animal was
infected with what looked like mad cow disease. The finding is bad
news for people living in Britain who fear that a human form of mad
cow disease, called new variant Creutzfedlt-Jakob disease or CJD,
may have similar underpinnings.
</P>
<P>
   For many years, zoo animals throughout Europe were fed protein
supplements containing the rendered remains of British cattle, some
of which carried a mysterious disease agent called an infectious
prion. A number of species that ate the tainted animal feed,
including cats and hoofed animals, developed sponge-like holes in
their brains and died in much the same way that British cattle were
dying from mad cow disease. As a result, feed manufacturers stopped
adding British beef to their products in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   That same year, Dr. Noelle Bons, a neurobiologist at Montpellier
University in France reported that a rhesus monkey and two lemurs
from the local zoo died of a brain disease similar to mad cow
disease. But the link to animal feed could not be proved.
</P>
<P>
   In the study reported Tuesday, Dr. Bons and her colleagues fed a
large portion of infected cattle brain to two young lemurs that had
never before eaten meat. One animal received one dose, equivalent
to a 154 pound person eating a 1 pound hamburger made entirely from
cow brain. The second animal got two similar doses, a couple of
months apart. After five months, one animal showed ``a loss in
vitality'' and was killed by it's cage mates, Dr. Bons said.
Researchers then killed the other lemur and the tissues of both
animals were examined for the presence of infectious prions.
</P>
<P>
   Another 20 lemurs from three French zoos were also killed as
part of program to cull certain animals. Two showed subtle
neurological symptoms but the other 18 looked completely normal.
All had eaten animal feed containing British beef for many years.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, three young lemurs that had never eaten beef were also
killed; they showed no signs of infectious prions, Dr. Bons said.
But the two animals intentionally infected and the 20 lemurs living
in different zoos showed identical patterns of infection. In
primates, the infection first takes hold in epithelial tissues of
the gut, moves to tonsils, esophagus, lymph nodes and spleen and
then spreads up the spinal cord to the brain, Dr. Bons said.
</P>
<P>
   This is the first time that such a pattern has been shown in
animals incubating a prion disease, said Dr. Paul Brown, a senior
research scientist at the National Institute of Neurological
Diseases and Stroke in Bethesda, Md. and co-author of the paper.
Dr. Bons said that she suspects the pattern is typical of most
prion diseases, called spongiform encephalopathies, found in many
mammalian species. Prion diseases take many years to spread,
incubate and produce symptoms, though once symptoms appear the
disease usually progresses swiftly and is always fatal.
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, 39 people in Britain and one Frenchman have died from
new variant CJD, which most experts think is contracted from eating
infected beef, particularly brain tissue.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The contraceptive sponge, once the most popular nonprescription
birth-control device for women, could be available once more on
drugstore shelves by fall.
</P>
<P>
   The Today Sponge, a convenient and well-liked contraceptive that
was sold from 1983 until 1995, is scheduled to make a comeback
through the efforts of a small pharmaceutical company that bought
the rights to the product from the manufacturer that had ceased
production of it.
</P>
<P>
   Allendale Pharmaceuticals Inc., a privately held company in
Allendale, N.J., announced this month that it would resurrect the
contraceptive sponge for use by women in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since word of the return of the Today Sponge has gotten out,
we've heard from not only contraceptive experts but many women as
well,'' said Dr. Robert J. Staab, chairman of Allendale. ``And they
are all saying, `Thank goodness it's coming back.' This product had
a special place in the hearts of many consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   The sponge was popular with many women because its ease of use
and ready availability allowed more spontaneous sexual activity
than with many other contraceptives. Women also favored it because
it had a relatively low risk of adverse side effects and could be
used by those who had problems with hormonal contraceptives like
the birth-control pill.
</P>
<P>
   The device is a soft, disposable polyurethane sponge that is
permeated with the sperm-killing chemical nonoxynol-9. Looking like
a plump, rubbery disk with a deep dimple in the middle, and
measuring one and three-quarters inches in diameter and a half-inch
thick, the sponge is inserted into the vagina before sex and can be
left there for 24 hours of protection. The sponge has a ribbonlike
loop to grasp for removal.
</P>
<P>
   The sponge is believed to work in three ways: inactivating sperm
with the spermicide; absorbing semen, which traps sperm to prevent
them from entering the cervix, and acting as a mechanical barrier,
blocking the opening to the cervix.
</P>
<P>
   Experts in contraception and family planning generally praised
the return of the sponge because there are so few other
over-the-counter birth-control choices that are controlled by
women. These include spermicidal foams, jellies and suppositories,
which can be messy and inconvenient, and the female condom, which
is not widely available and has attracted little interest from
women since being introduced in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are not enough contraceptive methods available to
people, and when you lose one, it is felt,'' said Cynthia A.
Pearson, executive director of the National Women's Health Network.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Michael Burnhill, a vice president of the Planned Parenthood
Federation of America, said in a statement, ``The Today Sponge was
a very good local contraceptive and we would like to consider
returning it to the choices offered at Planned Parenthood.''
</P>
<P>
   Susan Tew, a spokeswoman for the Alan Guttmacher Institute, a
New York-based not-for-profit organization that advocates family
planning and does research on reproductive issues, said the group
applauded the return of the contraceptive sponge. ``Any
contraceptive method found safe and effective by the Food and Drug
Administration should be made available to women in the United
States,'' Ms. Tew said.
</P>
<P>
   Sterilization and the birth-control pill have long been the main
means of contraception in this country, experts said, followed by
prescription devices like the diaphragm. Although never used by
more than 1 percent of contraceptive users at any time, the sponge
was surprising popular among segments of the population, including
unmarried women who infrequently had intercourse and nursing
mothers who could not use their normal means of birth control.
</P>
<P>
   Surveys by the Guttmacher Institute showed that in 1988, 400,000
women used the sponge, but that dropped to 110,000 in 1995 after
production stopped and supplies dwindled. But over the period the
sponge was available, the institute's data indicate that 6.4
million women used the sponge at least once, representingr 11
percent of all women using contraceptives at the time.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Its drawbacks include a relatively high failure rate as a
contraceptive and a lack of protection against sexually transmitted
diseases. Tests showed the sponge had a failure rate of about 10
percent during a year's use when worn properly, similar to that of
condoms, diaphragms and other barrier methods, and about a 15
percent pregnancy rate when improper use was factored in.
</P>
<P>
   While condoms guard against transmission of disease-causing
viruses and bacteria, no such claims can be made for the sponge,
although some studies suggest that the device and its spermicide
may afford some protection. There was once concern that the sponge
could increase the risk of toxic-shock syndrome, but later research
showed that those fears were unwarranted.
</P>
<P>
   When the Today Sponge went out of production, it caused a minor
social phenomenon when some users reportedly scrambled to buy and
hoard remaining supplies.
</P>
<P>
   These concerns were chronicled in a popular 1995 episode of the
``Seinfeld'' television series, in which the character Elaine
bought every remaining Today Sponge in New York City and filled a
closet with the favorite contraceptive. Concerned with preserving
her treasured stash, she then judged potential lovers on how
``sponge worthy'' they were.
</P>
<P>
   The sponge, approved by the FDA in April 1983, was invented by
the late Bruce W. Vorhauer, a biomedical engineer, and first
produced by his company, the VLI Corp. The company and sponge were
later bought by Whitehall-Robins Healthcare, part of American Home
Products, which produced the product until withdrawing it from the
market in January 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The product was not discontinued or recalled for health reasons,
as some consumers believe, but because of manufacturing problems.
The company stopped production after a March 1994 federal
inspection of the only factory making the device found bacterial
contamination of the water used to make the sponge and other
products, and problems with sanitizing equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Weighing the costs of modifying the factory to bring it up to
standard, and the likely loss of Today's market by the time
upgrading was finished, the company decided to stop making the
contraceptive.
</P>
<P>
   Gene Detroyer, chief executive of Allendale, said his company
bought all rights to the Today Sponge, as well as manufacturing
equipment, from American Home Products for an undisclosed price.
The drug agency approved the companies' request for the change in
ownership. And because the agency never revoked approval of the
sponge, Detroyer said, it can be re-introduced without further
testing or licensing.
</P>
<P>
   Before sales can resume, Detroyer said, the federal agency must
inspect and approve Allendale's sponge production operations, which
are at a contract pharmaceutical factory outside Philadelphia that
already makes drugs for other companies in compliance with federal
regulations. If production begins this summer, the sponge should be
available nationwide by the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Both the sponge and its packaging will be exactly the same as
before, company officials said, and it should first be available in
packs of six. The devices should have a suggested retail price
$1.75 to $2 each, they said.
</P>
<P>
   When the sponge was previously available, some women had
problems learning to insert and remove it. Staab said that
Allendale would provide clearer instructions and would set up a
toll-free telephone service to answer questions.

<P>
   Before its infrared camera shut down in November, the Hubble
Space Telescope focused on an assortment of spiral galaxies for
some of its last pictures in those invisible wavelengths, giving
astronomers penetrating looks through thick galactic dust into the
glowing hydrogen clouds where stars are being born.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Torsten Boeker, an astronomer at the Space Telescope Science
Institute in Baltimore, said the pictures, part of the telescope's
concentrated study of about 100 nearby spiral galaxies, were
particularly useful for investigating the dynamics of
star-formation regions. In visible light, many of these regions are
hidden from view by the very clouds of gas and dust enveloping
them.
</P>
<P>
   The telescope's other camera and instruments are still operating
normally, but its near-infrared camera and multi-object
spectrometer, a single instrument, ran out of coolant and had to be
switched off.
</P>
<P>
   In a service mission scheduled in October, space shuttle
astronauts are to visit the orbiting observatory to install an
improved computer and new set of gyroscopes for stabilizing the
telescope. It will be at least another year before a second shuttle
mission can restore the infrared camera with a new cooling system.
</P>
<P>
   Describing the new pictures, Boeker said that an effort was made
to snap spiral galaxies at all angles, from the classic face-on
view of NGC 5653 to the edge-on shot of NGC 891. Other pictures
showed close-ups of the hubs of galaxies glowing in white light
from the dense concentration of stars.
</P>
<P>
   For all the pictures, filters introduced false colors to
highlight textures and material recorded in infrared wavelengths
that would otherwise be invisible to the human eye. Red, for
example, corresponds to glowing hydrogen, the raw material of star
birth. Blue represents the main galactic structure of spiral arms
composed of young and middle-aged stars. Green is a mixture of the
red and blue images. The galaxy cores are mostly white because of
their concentrations of stars.
</P>
<P>
   In most cases, astronomers said, red knots in the spiral arms
pinpointed rich star-forming regions. But the glowing hydrogen
inside the galactic cores, they said, could have several possible
explanations. They could reveal star birth or the radiation from
the vicinity of massive black holes, or a combination of both.
</P>
<P>
   Though galaxies come in many other shapes, like ellipticals and
dwarfs, Boeker said that esthetics largely dictated the Hubble's
picture selection. ``Spirals,'' he said, ``are more beautiful.''

   Corey Makowy of Maryland's Hunt Valley region loved school, but
on square-dancing day the 10-year-old begged his mother to let him
stay home. He knew no one would want to take his hand.
</P>
<P>
   Classmates did not want to touch a basketball or computer
keyboard Corey had used either, because his hands sweated _ sweated
so much that when he went to a friend's home to play video games,
he first had to wrap his hands in paper towels.
</P>
<P>
   Corey had a little-known condition known medically as
hyperhidrosis. The condition affects more than 200,000 Americans,
and those who have it sweat excessively, usually from the hands,
feet or underarms, but sometimes from the chest or back. The
sweating results from an overactive sympathetic nervous system,
although doctors are not sure of the underlying cause.
</P>
<P>
   But Corey's hands are warm and dry today, thanks to an operation
called sympathectomy, in which surgeons snip the sympathetic nerve
chain that is linked to the excessive sweating.
</P>
<P>
   ``It worked,'' Corey said. ``Now I can play Nintendo without
paper towels. And when I draw, the pictures don't smear.''
</P>
<P>
   Corey's surgeon, Dr. Mark Krasna, chief of thoracic surgery at
the University of Maryland Medical Center in Baltimore, is one of a
growing number specialists who treat the condition with a new
minimally invasive surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each year,'' Krasna said, ``advances make the procedure
quicker and easier on the patient.''
</P>
<P>
   Until about a decade ago, the operation was a serious one in
which surgeons typically opened the chest and removed ribs to get
to the nerves that caused the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Krasna makes a small incision _ less than an inch _ just
below the underarm of the anesthetized patient. He inserts
cauterizing scissors and a pencil-sized video camera into the
thoracic cavity. Watching a monitor, Krasna snips the sympathetic
nerve chain, then removes the instrument and closes the wound with
a single, dissolvable suture. Patients are discharged within 23
hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``We finally got it down from opening patients' chests to three
incisions per side to a single, 1-inch cut,'' Krasna said. ``For
bilateral surgery, the procedure is repeated on the other side.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Richard Whyte, head of the thoracic surgery division at
Stanford University Medical Center in Palo Alto, Calif., and an
expert in sympathectomy, said that the operation was safe and
effective.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of palm sweating,'' Whyte said, ``at least 95 percent
of patients have good to excellent results.''
</P>
<P>
   The operation can trigger sweating in other parts of the body, a
common side effect, but in Corey's case this has been all but
unnoticeable.
</P>
<P>
   ``The literature shows that after the operation, 30 to 40
percent of patients tend to have increased sweating in their feet
or trunk,'' Dr. Krasna said, ``but very few of them are bothered by
these less visible instances of sweating.''
</P>
<P>
   Another possible side effect of the surgery is Horner's
Syndrome, a drooping of the eyelid, but that has not happened in
the case of any patient of either Whyte or Krasna.
</P>
<P>
   Many patients elect surgery after repeated failures with salves,
drugs, electroshock and injections of Botox, a compound commonly
used to smooth wrinkles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried one cure after another,'' said Richard Lloyd, 34, of
Rosedale, Md. ``I work at a PC, and the keys have actual puddles
when I type.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People joke about this condition,'' said Lloyd, who is
scheduled for surgery with Dr. Krasna on April 15, ``but it's no
joke when I know I'm about to shake someone's hand and my hands are
soaked.''
</P>
<P>
   The procedure costs $8,000 to $10,000, Krasna said, and is
usually covered by insurance. He advises patients to carefully
weigh the decision.
</P>
<P>
   Corey and his parents discussed the possibility of an operation
for several years. They noticed the condition when Corey was 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``We kept hoping he would grow out of it, that it would go
away,'' said Suzanne Makowy, Corey's mother. ``It was awful to see
him cry because of the way people treated him. Finally, he decided
to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, Corey is happy. ``I can do anything I want,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   He can hold his mother's hand, and he no longer worries about
going to school on the days they have square dancing.

<P>
   Q. I am 56 years old and intend to work another six to nine
years. I think my portfolio is a little out of balance. I have five
common stocks worth $300,000, $7,000
</P>
<P>
   in Putnam New Opportunities fund, $4,500 in Janus Worldwide
fund, $3,000 in Franklin Balance Sheet
</P>
<P>
   Investment fund, $21,500 in Vanguard Asset Allocation fund,
$25,000 in Vanguard Index 500, $70,000 in money markets, a similar
amount in CDs, $12,500 in Savings Bonds, and $26,000 in the Thrift
Savings Plan. In the thrift plan, 69 percent is in
</P>
<P>
   an account tracking the Standard and Poor's 500 Index, and the
rest in bonds. I add $1,000 a month to the Vanguard Asset
Allocation account, and $200 a month to the Thrift Savings Plan. I
will have a pension annuity upon retirement. As you can see, the
portfolio is heavily weighted towards large-cap stocks. What
adjustments do you suggest? _ M.G., Medford, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. I'm not so terribly worried about the 67 percent of the
portfolio that's in large-cap stocks, but the fact that five
individual stocks represent 55.6 percent of it does bother me.
</P>
<P>
   I'm presuming here that the individual stocks which you don't
identify are large caps. If the positions are roughly equal, a
serious tumble from any one of them could cause you some real pain.
</P>
<P>
   It would be lovely if these common stock holdings were in some
sort of tax-deferred savings plan, which would allow you to make
sales and reinvest the proceeds with no immediate tax consequences.
But it doesn't sound as if that's the case.
</P>
<P>
   All I can suggest is that you analyze the tax implications of
selling some of these shares, and then make whatever sales you can
without unbearable tax implications. If you're not sure about the
tax implications, hiring a tax expert to do the analysis for you
would probably be worth the cost.
</P>
<P>
   But you can also take some steps with your ongoing investments
to get a better portfolio balance. For example, while you might
think of Vanguard Asset Allocation as a vehicle that's giving you
some considerable portfolio diversification, at the time of the
last report on the fund from Morningstar Mutual Funds, it held 80
percent of its assets in a stock portfolio dominated by large cap
domestic issues. If I were you, I would stop contributions to that
fund, establishing positions in Vanguard Specialized Health Care
and Vanguard Small-Cap Index and dividing the $1,000 monthly
contributions among those funds.
</P>
<P>
   Within the Thrift Savings Plan, you could also direct that no
more of your contributions go into the S&AMP;P Index fund, instead
adding to the fixed-income side with that money.
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am a 37-year-old man, single and with no children. Among my
investments is a $2,000 Roth IRA which is evenly divided between
American Century Twentieth Century's Ultra and Vista funds. Should
I roll this over into my company's 403(b) plan when I become
eligible to do so, or should I think about rolling over the money
into another investment? _ R.D., Brookline, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. You certainly don't want to move the Roth IRA money into a
tax-deferred account. Consider this: you sacrificed a tax deduction
that was probably somewhere in the neighborhood of $400 to $620 in
order to get the later tax advantage of the Roth IRA, which is that
the money and all of the earnings that it produces will be tax-free
when withdrawn after age 59 1/2. As for whether you want to change
the investment vehicle, the answer is yes and no.
</P>
<P>
   American Century Twentieth Century Ultra is a solid,
above-average large-cap growth fund, and although most of its
above-average rating from Morningstar can be tied to its 23.57
percents record for average annual returns over a decade, its
one-year-, three-year and five-year records are respectable,
although slightly trailing the peer averages for those periods. For
a long-term investment program such as your retirement savings,
it's a solid choice.
</P>
<P>
   American Century Twentieth Century Vista is another Share of
Poos, as the Brits might say in rhyming slang. This mid-cap growth
fund has compiled a miserable record, trailing its peer group in
every time period measured by Morningstar Mutual Funds, from
year-to-date to 10 years. Worse, some of the numbers are truly
awful, such as the one-year loss of 8.57 percent, comparing to a
peer average of 24.76, or the
</P>
<P>
   five-year gain of 5.82 percent, compared to a 15.25 percent peer
average. Morningstar's charts show that the sequence of portfolio
manager changes resemble bullpen calls for the 1962 Mets baseball
team. Big years in 1994 and 1995 built the year-end asset base to a
high of $2.24 billion at the end of 1996. But 1996, 1997 and 1998
brought bottom-quartile performances from the fund, and assets have
slid to $985 million, as of the March 4 report of Lipper Analytical
Services Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Morningstar reports that the latest portfolio manager has
analyzed the portfolio and determined that its problems stem from
buying stocks of companies that were growing fast, but whose
earnings were not necessarily following suit. They are now working
on correcting this.
</P>
<P>
   If I were you, I'd let them do it with someone else's money. Why
not move your investment to a small-cap growth fund. If you want to
keep the entire IRA within American Century Twentieth Century
family, why not try American Century Twentieth Century New
Opportunities fund, which posted a one-year record of 18.47
percent, comparing favorably to a peer average of 10.10 percent.

   Q. Why are the orbits of the sun's planets arranged in a
more-or-less flat plane?
</P>
<P>
   A. The planets are believed by many authorities to have
coalesced from a disk-shaped cloud of gas early in the evolution of
our solar system, beginning roughly 5 billion years ago, said Joe
Rao, lecturer at the Hayden Planetarium of the American Museum of
Natural History in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that the sun and planets evolved from a huge,
swirling cloud of gas and dust that condensed over a time span of
hundreds of millions of years,'' Rao said. ``This gas cloud was
very likely in the shape of a disk, and when the planets came to be
within this cloud, they pretty much all formed basically along the
same plane.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a notable exception, the tiny planet Pluto, which has
an orbit that is tipped as much as 17 degrees to the plane of the
solar system, Rao pointed out. It has been hypothesized that Pluto
might be everything from an escaped moon of Neptune to a special
type of minor planet or asteroid.
</P>
<P>
   The anomalous orbit of Pluto was one of the reasons for the
great debate earlier this year concerning Pluto's exact status as a
member of the solar system, Rao said.

BALANCED IMMUNE RESPONSE MAY FIGHT EBOLA 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)  
(lh) 
 By PHILIP J. HILTS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The early moments after patients are infected with the feared
Ebola virus may be the most important to their survival,
researchers report this week in the journal Nature Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   A French team working in Gabon in West Africa have successfully
taken and analyzed blood samples from 11 patients infected during
outbreaks in Gabon and the Congo. This is in itself a feat because
outbreaks have so far only taken place in very remote areas and
because those who contract the disease die swiftly.
</P>
<P>
   Ebola is a rare viral disease, confined to occasional outbreaks
in Africa since its first appearance in 1979. But this exotic virus
gets attention disproportionate to its human toll for two reasons.
First, the virus kills 70 percent of those it infects, and kills
horribly, with the disease advancing from fever to massive bloody
hemorrhaging in a space of 10 days. Second, researchers worry that
Ebola may not remain forever in its remote jungle confines, but may
one day break out.
</P>
<P>
   Led by Dr. Sylvain Baize and Eric M. Leroy of the International
Center for Medical Research in Gabon, the team found a striking
difference in the first days of the infection between those who
would eventually die and those who would survive.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 11 patients from whom blood was taken, four survived and
are now believed immune to further Ebola infection.
</P>
<P>
   The research focused on the differences between those who lived
and those who died. They discovered that the immune defenses in the
two groups were quite distinct.
</P>
<P>
   The immune system puts up two general types of defense against
invading microbes. In one, the humoral system, antibodies identify
and latch on to the invading bugs. In the other, the cellular
system, defenders spot cells that the invading bugs have infected.
</P>
<P>
   Among the surviving patients, the immune defenses were stable
enough to produce a good humoral response, including antibodies to
attack the virus, as well as a good cellular response, including a
substantial number of ``killer cells'' (or cytotoxic T cells) and
modest amounts of interferon, the body's own antiviral substance.
Thus, there appeared to be a balanced attack from both humoral and
cellular defenses.
</P>
<P>
   These patients were able to clear much of the Ebola out of their
blood, then continued to produce both ``killer'' cells and
interferon to suppress further multiplication of the viruses.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the immune systems of the majority, those who did
not survive the infection, failed to give a balanced defense within
the first two to three days after infection. They had a poor
showing of antibodies, but at the same time apparently produced too
much of the cellular kind of defense, as signaled by excessive
production of interferon.
</P>
<P>
   One possibility is that the too-strong response of one part of
the immune system may be giving falsely strong signals, thereby
passing information that would suppress the other side of the
defense. Or, possibly, the patient was infected by so much virus
that it overwhelmed one half of the immune system's defenses.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of one kind of defense and excess of another suggests
that a good strategy to attack Ebola infection may be to intervene
in the body to balance the two kinds of defenses by enhancing one
or depressing the other.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Philip K. Russell, emeritus professor at the Johns Hopkins
School of Public Health, said the work represented an important
step in understanding how Ebola works.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Pierre Rollin, of the Special Pathogens Branch at the
federal Centers for Disease Control, said the work would help
researchers test ideas. For example, therapies that would suppress
the interferon production and related cellular immune defenses
might now be put at the top of the list to try, he said. But
therapies that used interferon as a treatment might be ruled out.

A SURLEY SIBERIAN FOX IS BRED FOR MANNERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)  
(kd) 
 By MALCOLM W. BROWNE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ordinarily the silver fox is a canny, elusive creature, quick to
bite when cornered, and well nigh impossible to tame.
</P>
<P>
   This is hardly surprising, considering that foxes over the eons
have been hunted for sport, trapped for fur, and generally maligned
by human beings, especially those with hen houses.
</P>
<P>
   But because of selective pressure imposed by experimenters over
a 40-year period, a new and once undreamed of breed of fox has
evolved _ one that whines for attention from human beings without
any prior conditioning, licks its masters' faces, and has even
begun to look something like a domestic dog.
</P>
<P>
   It is as if by an act of will human beings had transformed an
innately hostile creature into a friend.
</P>
<P>
   In a long-term experiment at a Siberian fur farm, geneticists
have created this new version of Vulpes vulpes, the silver fox, by
allowing only the friendliest animals from each generation to
breed. Having selected only the most ``tamable'' of some 45,000
foxes over 35 generations, the scientists have compressed into a
mere 40 years an evolutionary process that took thousands of years
to transform ancestral wolves into domestic dogs.
</P>
<P>
   The original purpose of the breeding was to create a friendly
breed less likely than wild animals to fight when put to death. But
in time, geneticists saw that far-reaching changes they observed in
the foxes' physical and neurological makeup merited scientific
study. The scientists apparently underwent some changes, too. Close
bonds developed between the tame foxes and their human wardens, and
the staff at the fur farm is trying to find ways of saving the
animals from slaughter.
</P>
<P>
   To keep environmental influences to a minimum, none of the foxes
in the Siberian experiment received any training, and their
contacts with human beings were limited to brief behavioral tests.
</P>
<P>
   The director of the experiment is Dr. Lyudmila N. Trut of the
Institute of Cytology and Genetics of the Siberian Department of
the Russian Academy of Sciences at Novosibirsk. She reported in a
paper that selective breeding to create genetically docile animals
had resulted in a breed of ultra-tame foxes that make good house
pets ``as devoted as dogs but as independent as cats, capable of
forming deep-rooted pair bonds with human beings.''
</P>
<P>
   Selective breeding of farm animals to enhance commercially
useful traits is as old as human history. But a striking
consequence of the Russian program was that breeding foxes to
strengthen a single behavioral trait, ``tamability,'' brought about
a wide variety of seemingly unrelated physical changes.
</P>
<P>
   A paper by Trut discussing these changes, translated from
Russian, was published in the current issue of American Scientist,
the magazine of Sigma Xi, a scientific research society. Trut wrote
that by breeding the tamest animals from each of about 35
successive generations, the final offspring were not only tame from
early puppyhood but also looked different from their wild
forebears.
</P>
<P>
   The normal pattern of coat color that evolved in wild foxes as
camouflage changed markedly in the genetically tamed fox
population, with irregular piebald splotches of white fur appearing
in some animals. The tame foxes sometimes developed floppy ears in
place of the straight ones of wild foxes. The domesticated foxes
generally had shorter legs and tails than ordinary foxes, and often
had curly tails instead of straight, horizontal tails.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the faces of adult tame foxes came to look more
juvenile than the faces of wild adults, and many of the
experimental animals developed dog-like features, Trut reported.
Although no selective pressures relating to size or shape were used
in breeding the animals, the skulls of tamable foxes tended to be
narrower with shorter snouts than those of wild foxes.
</P>
<P>
   Even reproductive cycles changed in foxes bred to be docile;
wild vixens are receptive to sex only once a year, but some of the
docile females become receptive more often.
</P>
<P>
   Domestication also apparently affects genes controlling the
timing of physiological development. For example, the genetically
tamable fox puppies open their eyes sooner after birth than do
ordinary silver foxes, and they show a fear response to unfamiliar
stimuli about three weeks later than their wild counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   Over successive generations and increasing congenital tameness,
Trut wrote, the Russian team measured a steady decline in the
hormone-producing ability of the foxes' adrenal glands. Adrenal
hormones prepare an animal for fight or flight.
</P>
<P>
   Even the brain chemistry of the tame animals differed from that
of their wild ancestors; after 12 generations of selective
breeding, Trut reported, test animals' brains contained
significantly higher levels of serotonin than did their forbears.
Serotonin, a neurotransmitter, is intimately involved in an
animal's psychological state.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Darcy F. Morey, an anthropologist at the University of
Kansas who has studied the physical changes that ancestral wolves
underwent as they evolved into domesticated dogs, said that Trut's
report underscores the complexity of seemingly simple genetic
traits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly,'' he said in an interview, ``the link between
modifying the neurology of an animal and its biochemical balance is
all intertwined with other aspects of physiology.''
</P>
<P>
   Domestication, with all the physiological changes it brings, has
not been limited to the the dog family, he said. ``Human beings
more or less domesticated themselves,'' Morey said. ``Of course,
we're not as docile as we'd like to think.''
</P>

<P>

</P>
<P>
   The Russian breeding experiment began in 1959 under the
direction of a geneticist, Dr. Dmitry K. Belyaev, who started with
a population of 30 male foxes and 100 vixens from a commercial fur
farm in Estonia. From the offspring of these animals and from each
successive generation, Belyaev's team would winnow out about 5
percent of the tamest animals for further breeding. Belyaev died 14
years ago, but his experiment has continued.
</P>
<P>
   In nature, the process of domestication is long and complex.
</P>
<P>
   ``Behavioral responses,'' Trut wrote, ``are regulated by a fine
balance between neurotransmitters and hormones at the level of the
whole organism. Even slight alterations in those regulatory genes
can give rise to a wide network of changes in the developmental
processes they govern.''
</P>
<P>
   Changing a complex system of genes (or a ``polygene'') by
selectively breeding for some trait like docility is not
necessarily beneficial, she said. Even a slight alteration of a
polygene like that presumed to lead to docility ``might upset the
genetic balance in some animals, causing them to show unusual new
traits, most of them harmful to the fox,'' Trut wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Through selective breeding to enhance the docility of 45,000
foxes over the last 40 years, Trut said, ``we have compressed into
a few decades an ancient process that originally unfolded over
thousands of years.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Before our eyes, the `Beast' has turned into `Beauty,' as the
aggressive behavior of our herd's wild progenitors entirely
disappeared,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Trut concluded her paper with a prediction that the experiment
in tamability breeding would probably have to end soon; last year
there was no money in Russia's budget to pay the scientists or even
feed the foxes, most of which were destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Recently we have sold some of our foxes to Scandinavian fur
breeders who have been pressured by animal-rights groups to develop
animals that do not suffer stress in captivity,'' she wrote. ``We
also plan to market pups as house pets, a commercial venture that
should lead to some interesting, if informal, experiments in its
own right.'' &QL;

   Kansas _ Kay Cho sees a disaster looming for his busy truck stop
in Kansas City, Kan., just a mile from the Missouri border.
</P>
<P>
   Already gasoline prices have been going up, and now comes the
idea of a 5-cent-a-gallon gas tax increase in Kansas. That, Cho

low taxes.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it wouldn't be quite that bad. A variety of considerations
make up the pump price of gasoline, taxes being one of them.
</P>
<P>
   But Cho, part owner of Kansas City Truck Terminal, isn't alone
with his concern. Gasoline and diesel fuel dealers along the Kansas
border watch with apprehension as the Kansas Legislature considers
whether to raise the fuel tax to help finance a new transportation
plan.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of raising motor fuel taxes and other fees may provoke
the political fight of the year in Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, with an 18-cent-a-gallon tax, Kansas ranks below the
national average in state gasoline taxes. The Missouri gasoline tax
is 17 cents a gallon.
</P>
<P>
   If Kansas enacted a 5-cent increase, the state would jump above
the current national average of 19.4 cents and above the current
tax of every neighboring state.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do think a substantive hike in the gas tax would have an
impact on the border counties especially,'' said state Rep. David
Haley, whose Kansas City, Kan., district abuts the state line.
</P>
<P>
   Some legislators don't want to increase gasoline taxes, or any
taxes, for highways and bridges.
</P>
<P>
   Others believe it is essential that a higher fuel tax, one paid
by everyone who uses the highways, be part of the financing
component of any comprehensive transportation plan.
</P>
<P>
   A key part of the debate swirls around the question that worries
Haley: Will a higher fuel tax in Kansas put the state out of step
with its neighbors, causing motorists to pay higher prices at the
pump in Kansas than elsewhere?
</P>
<P>
   To some extent, the answer is yes, said Mike Right, vice
president of public affairs for AAA Missouri and an expert on
gasoline prices.
</P>
<P>
   Taxes aren't the only factor in setting the pump price of
gasoline, he said. But, he added, they are a factor producers and
retailers cannot control, so they are an important factor.
</P>
<P>
   States with higher fuel taxes tend to have higher fuel prices,
Right said.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, motor fuel taxes represent a time-honored way of
paying for highways.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas initiated its fuel tax in 1926. Missouri had done so two
years earlier. Today, every state in the nation _ and the federal
government _ levies a fuel tax.
</P>
<P>
   Increases aren't unusual. In the last 20 years, the Kansas
gasoline tax has risen six times.
</P>
<P>
   This year, various states around the country are considering
increases.
</P>
<P>
   Billy Higgins, director of congressional relations for the
American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials
in Washington, said the fuel tax has been the most popular source
of income for road programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your motor fuel tax is something that you call a user fee,''
he said. ``I think it is a little bit easier to explain to the
average voter.''
</P>
<P>
   In Arkansas, where current taxes are about the same as Kansas,
legislators have been debating a 3-cent-a-gallon gasoline tax
boost. Oklahoma is considering a 1-cent gasoline tax increase to
raise money for passenger train service. Some legislators in
Oregon, which already has a 24-cent-a-gallon tax, are proposing a
4-cent increase.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome of the debate in Kansas is far from certain.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, the Senate passed a transportation plan calling for
the 5-cent boost in the gasoline tax, higher motor vehicle
registration fees and borrowing through the use of bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, the House passed a smaller transportation plan that
shunned tax increases and designated new money for highways from
the general state budget.
</P>
<P>
   If the Kansas gasoline tax went up 5 cents, the state would take
in $90.5 million a year in new revenue.
</P>
<P>
   A motorist who drives 16,000 miles a year in a vehicle getting
25 miles a gallon would pay an extra $32 in gasoline taxes. Driving
10,000 miles a year, that same driver would pay an extra $20.
Advocates of the tax increase don't believe that having a higher
gasoline tax than neighboring states will cause serious problems
for Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always some sensitivity,'' said Mary Birch, president
of the Overland Park, Kan., Chamber of Commerce, which endorses a
higher motor fuel tax as one way of paying for highways.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1990, the Kansas fuel tax jumped 4 cents higher than
Missouri. ``We didn't hear complaints,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Many Johnson Countians both live and work within the county, and
make decisions on where to buy gasoline without regard to the state
line, she said.
</P>
<P>
   On the opposite side is Tom Palace, executive director of the
350-member Petroleum Marketers and Convenience Store Association of
Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our guys on the borders are screaming,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Palace is concerned that if motorists get used to driving across
the border to buy fuel, they will establish a habit that will be
hard to break even when prices eventually level out.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm on one corner and my gas is 95 cents and the guy across
the street is 92, where are you going to shop?'' Palace asked.
</P>
<P>
   A phased-in gasoline tax increase would be easier to swallow, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Raising the Kansas tax by 5 cents a gallon wouldn't
automatically bring about a 5-cent increase in fuel prices.
</P>
<P>
   What motorists pay at the pump for gasoline depends on a wide
range of things, including the cost of producing, transporting and
refining petroleum, and the competition among distributors and
service stations.
</P>
<P>
   Areas with the lowest gasoline prices aren't always in states
with the lowest gasoline taxes.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, for example, some of the cheapest pump prices
in the Kansas City region have been in Lawrence, Kan., even though
the Kansas gasoline tax is a penny higher than the Missouri tax.
</P>
<P>
   It appears likely that the Missouri tax will remain lower for a
while. State leaders this year considered, but shelved, a proposal
to spend more money on roads this year.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Fahey of Grandview, Mo., a leader of an organization of
highway industry, civic and business groups that recommended a fuel
tax increase for Missouri, said higher fuel taxes are coming.
</P>
<P>
   ``All it gets down to is, who's going to do it first,'' said
Fahey, who runs a construction company. ``It's going to have to
happen.''

<P>
   Kansas City, Mo. _ The biggest, baddest meth dealer in Jackson
County, Mo., history looked neither big nor bad.
</P>
<P>
   Willi Olsen looked old and tired, with gray hair and weathered
skin the color of ash. He was only 48, but service in Vietnam, a
wound that took much of his stomach, and almost two decades of
snorting methamphetamine had cost him. Standing before a federal
judge, hands manacled, head down, he looked years older than he
was.
</P>
<P>
   But there was a time.
</P>
<P>
   From about 1991 to 1995, the California man got rich selling
hundreds of pounds of meth to Jackson County distributors. He
bought classic cars and real estate, gambled millions in Las Vegas
and gave friends wads of cash.
</P>
<P>
   He made drug history in 1993 when he sent two men to Jackson
County with a new, fast and easy way to cook meth. The recipe
spread quickly, beyond Olsen's control, beyond anyone's control.
</P>
<P>
   By 1996, Olsen had become so big, so rich, they called him
``giant monster.'' He also had become the object of one of the
biggest meth conspiracy investigations in Jackson County history.
And Jackson County had more meth labs than any other area in the
nation.
</P>
<P>
   Olsen, court records, police and federal prosecutors told the
story...
</P>
<P>
   Olsen fought in Vietnam and fought well. He was an infantry
point man and won nine medals, including two purple hearts and the
Bronze Star for valor. He also was hit in the stomach by a bullet
that broke his back and shattered a hip. He was 19.
</P>
<P>
   When he returned to Riverside, Calif., in 1971 he could barely
walk because of his wounds. He took a job driving big trucks. On
long hauls, he kept awake with amphetamines. In about 1977, he
snorted his first meth. There was much of it in California,
produced by labs there or in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   He and plenty of others used it, Olsen said. ``People were
always asking me for the stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually he made more money selling meth than driving a truck.
He also found he could make more still by selling it in the
Midwest. Around late 1991, he started selling to two Jackson County
men.
</P>
<P>
   Olsen paid $16,000 for four pounds in California, added a pound
of filler and sold it in Jackson County for at least $80,000. The
Jackson County distributors added another two pounds of filler and
sold quarter pounds for $6,000. Olsen admitted selling about 300
pounds in Jackson County _ almost $5 million just on his take.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hardest thing was transporting it,'' Olsen said. He flew
in airliners with it taped to his body or stuffed into the tops of
his cowboy boots. He used false-bottomed suitcases and sometimes
overnight mail.
</P>
<P>
   Olsen decided to eliminate the problem with a new production
method.
</P>
<P>
   Californian Kenny Marsh claimed to be one of the inventors of a
method that could turn a few hundred dollars worth of cold medicine
and common household products into a pound of meth in just eight
hours. It was a preferable process to the three-day cooking method
that created odors and tended to cause explosions.
</P>
<P>
   Olsen said two words to Marsh before spreading the new process
to Missouri: ``Show me.''
</P>
<P>
   Convinced, Olsen sent Marsh and assistant Hugh Escobar to
Jackson County to cook meth. But Marsh suffered from congestive
heart failure from years of heavy meth use. Within months, he
returned to California and died at age 25.
</P>
<P>
   Escobar broke with Olsen and cooked with others, who taught
others. Labs spread through Jackson County like germs. Demand
spread faster.

 2ND TAKE-KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE LAMBE  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Olsen gave up his cooking scheme and hired someone to transport
meth from California to Jackson County. He piled up more money,
gambled some away and bought cars, motorcycles and property in
California and Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   The money left tracks. And colleagues called Kansas City
Detective Dave Parker one of the best money chasers in the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Parker teamed with Independence Detective Mike Skaggs.
For more than two years, they served search warrants, sifted
through garbage, traced fake property deeds and tailed meth users
and dealers.
</P>
<P>
   People said they made an odd pair.
</P>
<P>
   Parker, in his late 40s, was trim, dressed in knits and slacks
and knew everything about chasing money.
</P>
<P>
   Skaggs, in his 30s, was overweight and had long hair that
tumbled past an earring. He was the meth intelligence officer for
the Jackson County Drug Task Force.
</P>
<P>
   Both believed a conspiracy was involved in Jackson County's
sudden surge in meth.
</P>
<P>
   But who was behind it?
</P>
<P>
   In late 1994, an informant said a local meth dealer expected 40
pounds from California. The dealer was ``the leg of a giant
monster,'' the informer said.
</P>
<P>
   Olsen, meanwhile, continued his spending and sometimes tooled
around Independence, Mo., in a 60-foot travel bus. An informant
said some big supplier was driving the bus. Skaggs and Parker
learned that a mystery man bought the bus with a suitcase full of
cash.
</P>
<P>
   Then the bus disappeared from Independence streets. In spring of
1995, Skaggs got a call from police who had raided a farm Olsen
owned southeast of Independence. They'd found a big bus with some
meth and a gun inside, and they'd confiscated it.
</P>
<P>
   Inside it were stacks of gambling tax forms. The name on them
was that of a California man: Willi H. Olsen.
</P>
<P>
   They'd found the monster.
</P>
<P>
   Months later a federal judge in Des Moines, Iowa, sentenced one
of Olsen's big Jackson County buyers to 20 years for expanding a
meth operation into Iowa. Police learned more about Olsen from that
case.
</P>
<P>
   Early in 1996, Olsen was on his motorcycle by his California
home in the San Bernardino area when police cruisers arrived. He
gunned his bike and swerved onto pavement. Police chased him,
caught him and cuffed him.
</P>
<P>
   A drug conviction sent Olsen to prison in California. Then a
Kansas City federal grand jury indicted him on meth charges.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 5, 1997, Olsen pleaded guilty in federal court to
conspiring to distribute and manufacture meth and to money
laundering. Authorities confiscated his property, cars and cash and
left him with a stark choice: cooperate or go to prison for life.
</P>
<P>
   Olsen talked. So did most of the 15 others indicted with him and
sentenced before him. Escobar, the first meth cook known to use the
advanced technique in Jackson County, was sentenced last summer to
four years and two months on a drug conviction.
</P>
<P>
   As for Olsen, the key question at his sentencing last month was
how much his cooperation was worth. Mark Miller, assistant U.S.
attorney, told federal Judge Howard F. Sachs that Olsen's
information was critical in this case and others in South Dakota
and California.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Sachs countered, ``On the other side, he was a big
offender.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a kingpin,'' Miller said, and should get sentenced to
15 years.
</P>
<P>
   Olsen's lawyer, John Osgood, noted Olsen's cooperation and that
he was a war hero in poor health. Osgood asked for five years.
</P>
<P>
   Sachs took a short break, returned and peered down at Olsen over
the top of his glasses.
</P>
<P>
   As for Olsen's fine military record, Sachs told him, ``what's
happened since pretty much wipes that out.''
</P>
<P>
   He sentenced Olsen to 10 years and imposed a $5,000 fine.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. attorneys say Olsen clearly helped create a Jackson County
meth contagion that still rages. Even with Olsen and others in
prison, labs are spreading through the Midwest, and cheaper meth
from Mexico is plentiful in Jackson County.
</P>
<P>
   Olsen said education is the only way to stop demand for meth.
He's off the drug and knows its consequences.
</P>
<P>
   He has congestive heart failure, the same disease that killed
Marsh and other chronic meth users.
</P>
<P>
   Police saved his life, Olsen said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'd kept going the way I was,'' Olsen said, ``I probably
would have joined Kenny Marsh in another couple years.''

PROOF POSITIVE THAT PEOPLE SEE COLORS WITH THE TONGUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By HENRY FOUNTAIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When it comes to colors, the English language is at no loss for
words. Interior decorators and paint manufacturers, among others,
are constantly coming up with ever more fanciful color names.
</P>
<P>
   To linguists, however, all the sample chips in a paint store can
be categorized by 11 English words. While one decorator's buttercup
breeze may be another's desert bouquet, to a linguist they are both
yellow.
</P>
<P>
   But even 11 is a lot compared to the Berinmo, a small tribe of
hunter-gatherers that lives along the Sepik River in Papua New
Guinea. The Berinmo language categorizes colors with just five
words.
</P>
<P>
   This makes the tribe a good subject for studying a linguistic
concept that first gained wide currency in the 1950s. Called the
linguistic relativity hypothesis, it argues that humans see the
world less with their eyes than with their language.
</P>
<P>
   Each language filters experience differently, and thus there are
no universal principles of meaning. (In the most famous explanation
of the hypothesis, Benjamin Lee Whorf, one of its proponents,
argued that an Eskimo could never have just one word for snow,
because of the importance that different types of snow have for
Eskimo culture.)
</P>
<P>
   Following the hypothesis, if one people categorizes color
differently from another, they should perceive it differently as
well.
</P>
<P>
   That's not what researchers in the 1970s found with another
remote tribe, in a study that sent linguistic relativity into
something of a tailspin. The tribe, the Dani, who live about 200
miles from the Berinmo, have even fewer words for colors _ two. Yet
in tests, their ability to remember colors was much like that of
English speakers. The results seemed to indicate that there were
some kind of universal color categories that transcended language.
</P>
<P>
   Now, three psychologists in Britain have repeated the Dani
experiments with the Berinmo, and have come to the opposite
conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   In the study, which is described in the current issue of the
journal Nature, the Berinmo were shown samples from a standard
160-color chart and asked to categorize them. In addition to having
fewer categories than English speakers, the categories are
different.
</P>
<P>
   English speakers, for example, draw a distinction between blue
and green. Berinmo do not, but they draw a distinction within what
English speakers would consider yellow, with the word ``nol'' on
one side and ``wor'' on the other.
</P>
<P>
   The critical part of the study came when the researchers asked
the Berinmo to remember colors, by showing them one sample, waiting
a short time, and then asking them to match the first color from
two similar alternatives. Sometimes the two choices came from
within the same color category, and sometimes not.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers found that the Berinmo were much better at
matching colors across their ``nol'' and ``wor'' boundary than
across English blue and green categories (after having been shown
the blue-green distinction). And English speakers, given the same
tests, were similarly good at blue-green matches and poor at
matches across the Berinmo categories.
</P>
<P>
   By showing that color perception is dependent upon
categorization through language, the results support the idea of
linguistic relativity, said one of the authors of the study, Debi
Roberson of the University of London.
</P>
<P>
   ``Berinmo color vision is the same as ours,'' said Dr. Roberson,
who came to know the tribe during nine months in the jungle. ``If
they are asked to identify a single color from a group of colors,
they would do it in the same way as you or I.
</P>
<P>
   ``But say you have three colors, and call two of them blue and
one green,'' she continued. ``We would see them as being more
similar because we call them by the same name. Our linguistic
categories affect the way we perceive the world.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; LOS ANGELES _ ``The Out-of-Towners'' was a slight comedy the
first time around, when Jack Lemmon and Sandy Dennis co-starred in
the 1970 film about a middle-age couple menaced by a series of
misfortunes in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-nine years later, the new version _ based on the original
Neil Simon script, but this time penned by Marc Lawrence _ is still
basically a parade of harrowing events loosely strung together and
played for laughs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This movie is not a cure for cancer,'' star Goldie Hawn
admits.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even with (or especially with) light comedy, remaking is
hard to do. Hawn's co-star, Steve Martin, was quite aware of this
going in. The actor admits he was hesitant to take on the lead role
made famous by Lemmon. What convinced him?
</P>
<P>
   ``Goldie,'' he says simply.
</P>
<P>
   The two TV veterans (she cut her teeth on ``Laugh-In,'' he as a
comedian on ``The Tonight Show'') were first an on-screen couple in
1992's ``HouseSitter.'' That quirky romantic comedy portrayed Hawn
as a free spirit determined to loosen up the strait-laced Martin.
Now, they're reunited in a romantic caper comedy that stars Hawn as
a free spirit ... well, you get the idea.
</P>
<P>
   Those types don't seem too far from the mark. Both 53, the
actors have distinctly different personalities. Hawn comes
flouncing into an interview, wearing a tight mint-colored sweater
and no bra, talking freely about her most personal relationships.
She's an active, encouraging listener, often nodding and saying,
``good question.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin is buttoned-up in a sports jacket and slacks, and is very
reserved when interviewed. Even the movie's director, Sam Weisman,
admits he was a bit intimidated by Martin at first. ``He's quiet.
You think, maybe he doesn't like me,'' says Sam Weisman, who most
recently directed Brendan Fraser in the comedy hit ``George of the
Jungle.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin admits he's come a long way from his stand-up days, and
is a lot choosier about his work today. ``I'm at a place now where
I don't want to go to Edmonton for three months,'' says Martin. He
quickly adds, though, that for the right person and project, he's
willing to travel. ``When I did `The Spanish Prisoner' (the 1998
David Mamet film), believe me, I didn't mind going to the Florida
Keys.
</P>
<P>
   Hawn happily chats about her belief in psychics, and about
keeping her relationship with Kurt Russell fresh. ``We got a hotel
room the other night, just to change the surroundings,'' she
volunteers. By contrast, the raciest Martin gets is when he jokes
that the secret to his camaraderie with Hawn is ``no sex.''
</P>
<P>
   Opposites seem to attract in this case, and make for a natural
comedy team. ``I think it's apparent on the screen that we get
along well,'' Martin says. Even director Weisman was in on the
Martin-Hawn love fest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never had a bad moment ... making this movie was a very
wonderful, loving experience,'' says Weisman. ``There was never a
day I didn't look forward to seeing (Martin and Hawn), which is
something I haven't ever been able to say about actors before.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Weisman and Hawn say that even when Martin switches from
introvert to wild-and-crazy guy, the source of his humor remains a
mystery to them. Asked about his thoughts on this, Martin allows,
``Humor comes from so many different places,'' he said. ``It comes
from joy, it comes from anger, it comes from desperation.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin adds, though, that humor theory is not something he
discusses much with his fellow comedians. Asked whether he talked
about their profession with ``Monty Python'' veteran John Cleese,
who has a flashy supporting part, Martin replied: ``Martin Mull
once said to me that when painters get together, they don't talk
about painting. They talk about where they buy their brushes.''
</P>
<P>
   Cleese has a memorably Cleese-ian part as a snooty hotel manager
who turns out to be a secret cross-dresser. He employs the ``silly
walk'' of his ``Python'' days, as he struts in furs and stiletto
heels.
</P>
<P>
   Like Cleese, Martin has been known most notably for his physical
comedy, from his ``Happy Feet'' days to his remarkable role as a
man inhabited by the spirit of a woman in 1984's ``All of Me.'' In
``The Out-of-Towners,'' Martin does get to draw on this physical
humor, but also has to express the quiet frustration of the urban
white male, which Lemmon practically trademarked decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   Though at first reluctant to do the role, Hawn won him over.
``Goldie said, `We have to do this, because it's what so many
people are going through: Your children are grown, what do you
do?' &UR;  &LR; '' recalls Martin. ``So, I said, `OK, I'm going with you. I'm
going to trust your instincts,' &UR;  &LR; '' he continues.
</P>
<P>
   However, Martin admits a moment of doubt did flash across his
mind even as he took Goldie up on the challenge. ``But then I said,
`Goldie, if you tell me a year later, your psychic told you to do
this, I'm going to kill you,' &UR;  &LR; '' he says, mock-seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Hawn had the last laugh, though. ``After we did the movie, we
all liked it,'' Martin says, ``and it was !ital!then !off! that
Goldie, said, `That was &UR;  &LR; exactly what my psychic said would
happen.' &UR;  &LR; '' &UR;  &QL;

ARE WE LOSERS? PUTTING A MATING THEORY TO THE TEST 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)  
(kd) 
 By MEREDITH F. SMALL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I am such a loser. According to a branch of biology known as
evolutionary psychology, the human brain was designed to make
mating decisions that insure an individual's genes will be passed
along to the next generation. As a woman, these researchers
believe, I should look for a man of high status who will invest all
his money and goods in our kids. Knowing this theory, I have
nonetheless chosen to spend the last decade with an artist, a man
with no money and few goods beyond a bunch of paint brushes. Silly
me.
</P>
<P>
   But then he's a loser as well. As a man, the theory suggests, he
should have looked for a young, fertile woman with a tight waist
and big hips, which signal her good health. But no. He has chosen
me, a woman much older than himself, one with low fertility who
hasn't seen a decent hip-to-waist ratio in years.
</P>
<P>
   What were we both thinking? Are we really losers? Or are we a
reality check on a theory that has gotten out of hand? Evolutionary
psychology is the current rubric for researchers who study the
biological basis of human behavior. They believe that the human
mind was shaped during a brief period about one and a half million
years ago when our lineage experienced a major rise in brain
expansion. During this Environment of Evolutionary Adaptiveness, or
EEA, as it is often called, we were hunters and gatherers and so
our minds today reflect this ancient way of life.
</P>
<P>
   The suggestion that evolution, or biology, or genes, has a major
impact on human behavior is nothing new. Soon after Charles Darwin
developed the theory of evolution by natural selection, Social
Darwinists used it to justify social inequality. But Social
Darwinists were discredited, and for the next 100 years, hardly
anyone talked about human behavior and evolution in the same
breath.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, Edward O. Wilson of Harvard University, proposed a
new discipline, sociobiology, as a theoretical framework for the
biological basis of all animal social behavior, including human
behavior. Although sociobiology was widely accepted in the academy,
and is still the basis of all animal behavior research today, the
public went wild. There were protests of genetic determinism,
screams that Social Darwinism was back. There were also
demonstrations at conferences and wide media coverage of the
confrontation. Sociobiology became a dirty word.
</P>
<P>
   The adherents of evolutionary psychology say that it is
different from sociobiology because it focuses on how the mind
makes decisions, not on actual behavior, although thought and
action are usually linked. They clearly feel the mind is hard-wired
in certain ways, but oddly enough, no one has yelled ``genetic
determinism.'' In fact, the public, and the media, eat this stuff
up. How come?
</P>
<P>
   The answer, I believe, lies with the major preoccupation of many
evolutionary psychologists _ sex _ and the fact that much of this
work reinforces male-female stereotypes.
</P>
<P>
   Not all of evolutionary psychology is about sex and mating, but
this work never receives the same kind of media coverage. Of course
not. How can it compete with titillating tidbits of evolutionary
psychology such as these: Male brains are designed to want any
number of sexual partners, while women want only one stable guy.
Men want young sexy things while women like older stable guys.
Evolution says it is true.
</P>
<P>
   Who can resist such talk? Well, women, for one thing, and not
just because _as we are often accused _ of emotional or political
reasons. We object because it doesn't sit right. It's hard to
explain to men the oppressive power of hearing all your life that
wanting sex as much as men do makes you a bad person. It makes you
want to keep those thoughts to yourself.
</P>
<P>
   Additional resistance is coming from anthropologists and
neuroscientists who are currently taking evolutionary psychology to
task.
</P>
<P>
   And it doesn't take much to find the holes in evolutionary
psychology. Most disconcerting is its use of questionnaires to
figure out what people think about the ideal mate, the ideal body,
the ideal face and so forth. As most social scientists know
already, people are notorious for lying on paper, especially in
research on sexuality; men typically exaggerate what they think and
do, and women always hide their true selves.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Also, the choice of research subjects is plain silly: college
kids. Yes, they are convenient, but do they represent the
collective human mind?
</P>
<P>
   More insidious is the tendency for researchers to interpret
their data to fit the ideology. The most cited studies about ideal
mates have been conducted by Dr. David Buss of the University of
Michigan. Buss gives subjects a list of traits to rate when
thinking about a mate. Traits such as ``kind and understanding''
and ``intelligent'' and ``exciting personality'' show up on the top
of the list for both men and women. But Buss is not interested in
those commonalties. Instead, he focuses on traits that appear half
way down the ranking _ physical attractiveness and good earning
capacity _ and the fact men rate looks a bit higher and women
wealth a bit higher.
</P>
<P>
   Buss maintains that these results reflect innate differences in
mate desires by men and women. But that ignores the obvious, and
higher rated, results that men and women surprisingly want the same
thing.
</P>
<P>
   When this methodology is applied to a wider sample, the results
are similar, and even more problematic. Men in 37 different
cultures rated attractiveness and youth as more important than
women did, and women rated earning capacity higher than men did.
The problem with this supposedly cross-cultural work, as an astute
undergraduate pointed out to me, is that the sample is across
countries, not cultures.
</P>
<P>
   There are also serious problems with the underlying assumptions
of evolutionary psychology. The idea that the human brain was
molded only during one period of history, the EEA, is misguided; we
have a long evolutionary path during which our brains and bodies
adapted, and are still adapting.
</P>
<P>
   And the notion that our thoughts about the ideal mate represent
some truth that is unsullied by cultural influences is ridiculous.
Culture in the form of family, religion and tradition impinges on
just about everything about sex, and clearly directs mate choices.
Women have to look for status in men because they can't get it
alone. And given the choice between an old wealthy guy of high
status and a young one, any sane woman would take the young one.
</P>
<P>
   And what person wouldn't want a partner who is judged ideal by
cultural standards? At the moment, skinny girls are offered up as
the ideal, and so men want that type. But in the real world, men
don't get anything close to a culturally manufactured ideal, and
they know it.
</P>
<P>
   But who cares about fantasies anyway? Genes are passed along in
the real world where attraction, love, mating and marriage are not
always linked. In reality, people choose mates (or have them chosen
for them), in myriad ways. Our brains are not designed specifically
to desire this or that, but to weigh the options, and then get down
to the business of having babies.
</P>
<P>
   Given that scenario, my partner and I are not anomalous; we're
typical.

A RUGGED PAIR OF JEANS  
 GROUNDWATER CHEMICALS  
 BACTERIA THAT GLOW 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Wis., Del.)  (The Science Times) 
(mk) 
 By HENRY FOUNTAIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   Disposable synthetic clothing designed to protect the skin from
hazardous chemicals is no one's idea of casual wear. The same
qualities that keep harmful compounds away from the body can keep
heat and moisture in, making such garments uncomfortable at best.
</P>
<P>
   Now, researchers at the University of California at Davis have
developed a process that could make protective clothing as
comfortable as an old pair of blue jeans. In fact, with their
process, protective clothing might even be an old pair of blue
jeans.
</P>
<P>
   The research, reported at a meeting last week of the American
Chemical Society, is intended to protect farm workers from the
pesticides they encounter in the field. Rather than trying to block
the chemicals, the goal is to destroy them, by incorporating into
the surface of ordinary cotton-polyester fabric a compound that
breaks down the harmful chemicals on contact. By wearing clothes
made from the treated fabric, a farm worker would become a walking
detoxification plant, rendering a pesticide harmless before it
reached the skin.
</P>
<P>
   The compound used, called a hydantoin, needs to be activated by
the addition of a chlorine atom. And that leads to another
advantage of the process: Simply by washing the clothes in bleach,
their pesticide-destroying capabilities are renewed.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers found that the fabric destroyed up to 99 percent
of some kinds of pesticides. They caution, however, that the
treatment has not been tested with organophosphates like malathion,
which account for a large portion of the total pesticides in use.
</P>
<P>
   Chemical Concoctions
</P>
<P>
   Once a pesticide seeps from the field into groundwater,
protecting against it is a different matter. Even low levels of the
chemicals in water can have health effects, as studies have shown.
</P>
<P>
   But most of those studies have looked at one chemical in
isolation. Groundwater in agricultural areas contains a mix of
compounds _ insecticides, herbicides and fertilizer. Might the
effects of this chemical cocktail be different from that of each of
the ingredients alone?
</P>
<P>
   Yes, say researchers at the University of Wisconsin. After a
five-year study, they suggest that combinations of agricultural
chemicals can influence the immune, endocrine and nervous systems.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers gave mice drinking water with various
combinations of chemicals at concentrations equal to those often
found in groundwater. The most pronounced effects were found when
one pesticide _ either an herbicide or an insecticide _ was
combined with nitrate fertilizer. The results were reported in the
current issue of the journal Toxicology and Industrial Health.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers suggest that current testing methods for most
agricultural chemicals are flawed, both because they focus on the
chemical in isolation, and because they mainly look for
carcinogenic effects rather than systemic impact.
</P>
<P>
   A Glow for E. Coli
</P>
<P>
   One way to avoid pesticides is to keep them out of the food
chain. Researchers at the University of Delaware and Du Pont Co.
have figured out a way to do that, at least for chicken feed.
</P>
<P>
   The technique uses a genetically engineered strain of E. coli
that acts as a biosensor, glowing in the presence of certain kinds
of chemicals, including pesticides.
</P>
<P>
   When normal E. coli encounters a damaging compound in its
environment, it responds by making proteins. The researchers fused
genetic material from a bioluminescent bacteria with E. coli,
creating a form of E. coli that responds to environmental stress by
making glow-in-the-dark proteins.
</P>
<P>
   By adding the bacteria to poultry feed and then measuring the
bioluminescent response, the scientists were able to detect a
variety of compounds like the herbicide known as 2-4D and aflatoxin
B1, a carcinogen that can kill chickens. The researchers foresee a
day when a farmer can use a hand-held light detector to screen feed
for harmful compounds.

<P>
   Back a thousand years ago, as a fearless beginner on the
groomed, hard-packed slopes of the Northeast, I seemed to favor the
point-the-skis-downhill-and-crash-at-the-bottom approach.
</P>
<P>
   A few years later, after a moderately undistinguished
college-racing career, that basic style remained intact with a
brief, and aborted, attempt at an entirely new discipline in the
Austrian Alps: deep-powder skiing. That attempt ended with a crash
at the top of the mountain, not the bottom, and two broken skis.
</P>
<P>
   Now, lured by the promise of warm spring sun, in high pure,
untouched virgin snow, attracted as well by the idea of soaring
with ease by helicopter up among the remote spires of the Canadian
Rockies set in the greatest of imagined beauty, I ventured, several
decades after that, to try again.
</P>
<P>
   The seven-day skiing adventure began the day before skis
actually touched snow with two very important lessons of survival.
Forty of us were assembled in the unfancy Gothics lodge, in an
abandoned gold-mining camp, one of 11 ski areas run by Canadian
Mountain Holidays over some 11,000 square miles of mountains in
British Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   Our instructors first offered a set of specific instructions on
precisely how to board and get out of the helicopter. Then we
learned how to use the radio transmitter-receivers provided by the
company to tune in and locate the transmitters strapped to the
bodies of other members of the group, should they be buried in an
avalanche.
</P>
<P>
   Our first day on the snow was a rousing success _ depending on
how you define success. It was actually closer to a disaster, but
no one was decapitated by helicopter blades, buried in an
avalanche, and I did not fall up to the neck more than 20 times in
the hip-deep powder.
</P>
<P>
   At the start of the day, in heavy snowfall, 10 of us kneel in a
tight huddle, at just the right point near two red flags on the pad
outside the lodge to avoid the whirling blades of the helicopter as
it descends. We climb properly aboard, and the pilot manages
somehow to sweep through the storm, up along the high mountain
cirques and thread the eyes of the clouds.
</P>
<P>
   He drops slowly down on a snowy knoll, barely larger than his
craft. coldvery hard to see in the snowy, flat light. The descent
before us looks impossibly steep. I'm not sure we are having fun
yet.
</P>
<P>
   We buddy up, trying not, despite the blinding snow, to let our
buddies out of our sight. And all trying to heed the rule never to
get ahead of the guide. I get going too fast again, prompting a
warning: ``If you let yourself go below the guide one more time ...
you may be flying over a precipice, and it may be the last
precipice you fly over!''
</P>
<P>
   The helicopter, meanwhile, descends to pick up three more groups
of 10 dropping each group off a different mountain peak over a
1,000- square-mile area. They ski down to a designated spot, and
radio back to the helicopter to pick them up again and are able to
make eight or nine runs, with a total vertical descent of, say,
6,000 feet or more of skiing a day.
</P>
<P>
   There has not been much instruction so far on how deep-powder
skiing differs from groomed-trail, or hard-packed skiing _ apart
from learning about the skis themselves, the new ``fat boys,''
which are wider and shorter than downhill skis. The lack of
instruction is, particularly in my case, obvious: six falls,
exhausting to dig out of, on the first six turns.
</P>
<P>
   The differences in the two types of skiing are few, but they are
important. And they involve avoiding habits developed over a
lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   In deep powder do not keep your weight on the downhill ski when
turning. That is to say, do not shift all your weight to the left
ski when turning right, for example, as one must do in sharp fast
turns on most groomed or hard-packed snow.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, balance the weight evenly on both skis, keeping the
upper body turning with the skis, rather than away from them and
facing down the hill. (When I turn, with my old muscle memory
automatically shifting my weight to my downhill ski, the uphill ski
catches in the snow, spinning me out of control. I wonder if I will
ever get up.)
</P>
<P>
   Also, keep the ankles, knees and hips lightly bent but bouncy
and relaxed, with the body slightly _ but not too much _ forward
and in much more of a down and up motion, pressing down hard on the
snow and then rising up to take weight off the skis and ease the
turn in the powder. (The stuck brain keeps me bending the knees at
almost 90 degrees, which gives me stability at high speed on
groomed slopes but sets me too far back _ and this time backward in
another bad fall into the lovely, dark and deep.)
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Finally, avoid like another cold bath, sharp turns to check your
speed. Instead, start off straight down the mountain but then make
continuous shallow turns back and forth across the fall line, an
imaginary line straight down the slope.
</P>
<P>
   Turns in a kind of wavy, rhythmic way, singing a Viennese waltz,
or ``Love Me Tender,'' say, help establish the rhythm as you go. (I
have no trouble with the straight-down part. But the weight
distribution and the up-and-down motion continue to be problems.)
</P>
<P>
   By the second day, three feet of new powder has fallen
overnight, and it is still snowing. The mountains may be beautiful,
but who can see them. ``You are not doing well enough,'' Bryan, the
guide, informs me. ``You're out of control!'' (Me? What makes him
think that?) ``You're holding back the group.'' Bryan helps me
through the first successful series of shallow turns.
</P>
<P>
   On the third day, the first rays of sun are poking through to
lower elevations and the first tunes of glory. But with still more
fresh powder and the warming weather, the avalanche threat rises.
Todd, another of the guides, inches his way across the top of the
first peak of the day. He signals the group to stop. He surveys the
area. He jumps hard on the snow. And a crack opens up a foot or so
above him. This touches off an avalanche that knocks him over and
sweeps him instantly and silently away.
</P>
<P>
   But he is high enough that, though on his side, he is able to
ride the crashing snow like the crest of a wave and push himself
behind a tree. A small mountain, a Class 2 avalanche (Class 5 is
the worst ) 150 feet wide, 90 feet deep and 300 feet long _ big
enough to bury the group _ passes by. Todd is not hurt.
</P>
<P>
   The glory of the rest of the day comes in the body's finally
starting to do what it is told, in catching the rhythm of the
shallow turns. The back and forth, and back and forth, to the
strains, not to date this novice, of ``The Anniversary Waltz.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not that I had been out of shape. I had trained for weeks
at a gym. But I was not prepared for the constant falling early in
the week, and many of the deep falls required just about all the
strength I had to extricate myself from the snow and get up again.
Yet, once the correct techniques were, well, not mastered, but at
least seemed to register with both the brain and body, the effort
involved was surprisingly small.
</P>
<P>
   On later days, it stops snowing and patches of blue appear. It
even becomes possible to make entire runs skimming along the tops
of delicious snow dunes and through groves of beautiful pines
without so much as a fall. Yes, now we are definitely having fun.
</P>
<P>
   On the last day, the highest peaks finally clear. Halfway
through the morning, a realization hits: skiing in any other
conditions may never be the same. How else is it possible to float
over the world as smoothly and peacefully and quietly? Where else
is white as white, or blue as blue? Where else is the stillness and
majesty and stirring within as true?

HIGH COURT TO RULE ON USE OF STUDENT ACTIVITY FEES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court agreed Monday to decide whether
state-run universities can use part of the activity fees they
collect from all students to subsidize groups that pursue political
and ideological goals that some students find objectionable.
</P>
<P>
   The high court said it would review a ruling by the 7th Circuit
Court of Appeals that barred the University of Wisconsin at Madison
from using the fees when students objected.
</P>
<P>
   The case began in April 1996 when three law students at the
university sued the board of regents over the fees, arguing that
they did not want to subsidize groups that they disagreed with
politically or ideologically.
</P>
<P>
   The three students, who described themselves as conservative
Christians, identified at least 18 campus organizations _ including
the Women's Center, the Madison AIDS Support Network and the human
rights group Amnesty International _ that they did not want to
support.
</P>
<P>
   Student fees at the University of Wisconsin and other public
schools are distributed to applicants by the student government,
which decides how the money is allocated. At Madison, fees are $330
per year, with campus organizations receiving between 10 cents and
30 cents from each student.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the university defended the policy, saying the
student groups performed an important educational role.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1996, a federal trial judge ruled that the subsidies
unlawfully force some students to finance views they find
objectionable and thereby violate free-speech rights. The lower
court barred the university from using fees collected from
objecting students.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago agreed
with that decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``The forced funding of such organizations significantly adds to
the burdening of the students' free-speech rights,'' the appeals
court said. The three-judge panel added that the university
``cannot use the allocable portion of objecting students' mandatory
activity fees to fund (those) organizations.''
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court ruling did not shield objecting students from
paying any activity fees. Rather, the ruling allowed them to
identify the political or ideological groups they do not want to
support and have their fees reduced on a prorated basis.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, the Supreme Court ruled that public universities and
colleges cannot create a ``public forum'' for students and then
refuse to subsidize some student groups because of their viewpoint.
That decision said the University of Virginia wrongly refused to
subsidize a student-run Christian magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to that decision, the appeals court said in its 1997
ruling on student fees that if universities are not allowed to
discriminate in the disbursement of funds, ``it is imperative that
students not be compelled to fund organizations which engage in
political and ideological activities _ that is the only way to
protect the individual's rights.''
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court is expected to rule on the case next year.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Unseasonable warmth will embrace parts of the central Plains
Tuesday afternoon as winds from the southwest warm by compression
on descent from the lofty Rockies. Readings will approach 80
degrees in a few spots in sunny western Kansas and western
Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   Abundant sunshine will stir winds in the lower atmosphere,
blending momentum from fast winds aloft with winds near the
surface. As a result, winds will average 20 to 40 miles an hour
across parts of western Kansas and western Nebraska. Blowing dust
may restrict visibility in some areas. Winds will gust over 50
miles an hour across the high plains of eastern Colorado and
southeast Wyoming, where gusts may exceed hurricane-force in a few
of the traditionally windy spots downwind of mountain canyons.
</P>
<P>
   Moderately heavy rains will douse parts of northern California
and southern Oregon as a potent jet stream disturbance pivots
inland from the Pacific. Thunder may accompany rain in some areas.
</P>
<P>
   Showers and thunderstorms will flourish over the central Gulf
States Tuesday, with the heaviest rains likely occurring near the
central Gulf Coast, where the concentration of humid air will be
greatest. Extensive cloudiness and a few showers will extend
westward into Texas and southeast Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a gradual warming trend will continue in the sunny
Northeast, although winds from the west averaging 15 to 25 miles an
hour will detract from the mildness of the air along the New
England Seaboard. Gusts to 35 miles an hour are possible from Long
Island, N.Y., to Maine.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Still Formidable Arctic
</P>
<P>
   The high temperature at Prudhoe on Alaska's North Slope on
Sunday was minus 30 degrees, the latest date that such a frigid
maximum reading has been observed at the town. At night, the
temperature plummeted to a record minus 43 degrees. Despite
shortening nights and increasing hours of daylight, the Arctic is
still capable of producing frigid air. During the day, clouds or
snow-covered landscape reflect sunlight, limiting the rise in
daytime temperatures. At night, clear, calm conditions promote
rapid cooling, completing one cycle in the production of Arctic air
masses in spring.

`WINSTON AND CLEMENTINE': LOVE LETTERS INTERTWINED WITH HISTORY 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Publication notes at end of review.) 
(lh) 
 By MICHIKO KAKUTANI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Winston Churchill's life spanned nine decades and his public
life a momentous six. He not only presided over one of the most
crucial turning points in modern history, galvanizing the British
people's will to survive during the darkest days of World War II,
but he also bore witness to most of the formative developments of
the 20th century, from the prosecution of World War I to the
dismantling of the British Empire to the opening salvos of the Cold
War.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout these tumultuous events and the wild ups and downs of
his own political career, Churchill received love, succor and lots
of hardheaded political advice from his beloved wife, Clementine,
whom he married in 1908 after a short, intense courtship. As this
wonderful new volume of letters, judiciously edited by their
daughter, Mary Soames, attests, the two were prolific
correspondents, even slipping each other notes and memos while
under the same roof. Their letters form a lifelong dialogue, a
passionate record of their 57-year marriage and the public events
that formed a backdrop to their lives.
</P>
<P>
   The Churchill the public has come to know _ confident,
egotistical, purposeful and romantic _ is very much in evidence in
these pages. With the advent of World War I he writes Clementine:
``Everything trends towards catastrophe &AMP; collapse. I am
interested, geared-up &AMP; happy. Is it not horrible to be built like
that?'' Energized by adversity, this Churchill can declare from the
trenches of World War I France that he knows that ``the greatest of
my work is still to be done'' and that ``now _ naked _ nothing can
assail me.''
</P>
<P>
   His descriptions of people and places are pithy, to the point
and often unforgiving. He observes that de Gaulle ``thinks he is
Clemenceau (having dropped Joan of Arc for the time being)'' and
adds that ``many of these Frenchmen hate each other far more than
they do the Germans.'' He confides that President Franklin D.
Roosevelt does not tell his wife ``secrets because she is always
making speeches and writing articles and he is afraid she might
forget what was secret and what was not.'' And he complains that
Yalta proves ``that the Big Three in their first and most important
action have managed to pick out the very worst place in the whole
world for their Meeting.''
</P>
<P>
   There is another Churchill in these pages, too, however: a
playful, boyish, plaintive Churchill, eager to please his wife and
quick to apologize for his absorption in politics. He decorates his
letters to her with charming animal drawings (he calls himself
``Pug'' or ``Pig,'' Clementine ``Cat'' or ``Kat'' and their
children the ``puppy-kittens'') and prattles on about the swans and
chickens at their country estate. Her love, he declares, ``is the
greatest glory &AMP; recognition that has or will ever befall me.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1916 he writes, ``Sometimes also I think I wd not mind
stopping living vy much _ I am so devoured by egoism that I wd like
to have another soul in another world &AMP; meet you in another
setting, &AMP; pay you all the love &AMP; honour of the gt romances.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Clementine's letters, they evolve from girlish
exclamations to sophisticated epistles, filled with affection,
concern and political counsel. Although Churchill does not always
follow her advice, it is clear that he relies upon her willingness
to offer contradictory or moderating opinions. She warns him about
David Lloyd George, the Liberal Welsh statesman, whom she regards
as ``a sneak,'' and though she fears for Winston's safety as a
soldier on the front lines during World War I, she cautions him not
to return prematurely to the battlefields of English politics. ``To
gain a share of War direction you are contemplating a terrible
risk, the risk of life-long disappointment &AMP; bitterness,'' she
writes. ``My Darling Love _ For once only I pray be patient. It
will come if you wait.''
</P>
<P>
   These World War I letters, written after the debacle of the
Dardanelles campaign (for which Winston was largely blamed) and his
precipitous fall from political grace, represent some of the most
moving and illuminating exchanges. At the nadir of his fortunes,
Winston pours out his feelings to Clementine: his regrets, hopes,
frustrations and dreams. He tells her what a relief it is to
``write one's heart out to you'' when he must keep a stiff upper
lip in front of his men on the Western front, and he implores her
to stay in touch with his political allies back home. ``It is fatal
to let the threads drop,'' he writes, reminding her to ``represent
me in their circle.''
</P>
<P>
   These wartime exchanges, like the Churchills' World War II
correspondence, vacillate between events of the gravest national
concern and daily domestic matters, between allusions to
life-and-death decisions and talk about their children's schooling
and haircuts. While Churchill often seems invigorated by the
enormous pressures upon him, it is Clementine, fearful for his
safety, who usually sounds anxious, despite her best efforts to
keep both their spirits up.
</P>
<P>
   As ever with Churchill, the reader comes away awed by his
prodigious energy, his disparate enthusiasms for everything from
painting to animal husbandry to history. While he is spinning out
these myriad letters, notes and telegrams to Clementine, he is also
writing the books that would win him the Nobel Prize in Literature
in 1953 (including a six-volume history of World War II and ``A
History of the English-Speaking Peoples'' in four volumes), and of
course, helping to chart the course of Britain. By the end of World
War II his relief at the Allied victory was tempered by dark (and
in many ways prescient) concerns about the future. ``The misery of
the whole world appalls me,'' he writes Clementine in 1945, ``and I
fear increasingly that new struggles may arise out of those we are
successfully ending.''
</P>
<P>
   During the last decade and a half of his life a series of
strokes undermined Churchill's phenomenal capacity for work. His
last election campaign at the age of 84 drained both him and
Clementine, and a year later, in 1960, he told one of his
daughters, ``My life is over, but it is not yet ended.'' He would
retire from Parliament in 1964, having been a member almost
continuously for more than half a century.
</P>
<P>
   Though the letters between the Churchills slow to a trickle in
the final years, they continue to send each other little notes and
love messages that are touching in their frail brevity, testaments,
in Churchill's words, to their ``happiness in a world of accident &AMP;
storm.''

<P>
   Willy Loman is the world's most famous failed salesman, but what
did he sell? During the 50-year existence of ``Death of a
Salesman,'' Arthur Miller's words have entranced audiences with
Willy's inflated dreams for his sons, his muttering to himself, his
bad driving, his affair, his malfunctioning refrigerator, his
mortgage, his insurance payments and his suicide, all the while
refusing to disclose what Willy lugged in his valises.
</P>
<P>
   Willy's real wares may appear to be inconsequential because what
he sold was himself, and ultimately, there was no demand for his
product.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's safer not to say what he sells,'' said Gerald
Weales, emeritus professor of English at the University of
Pennsylvania and the editor of a widely used study text about the
play. ``The assumption is that Miller was specifically unspecific.
But whatever he sold, it's heavy.''
</P>
<P>
   The first time we see Willy (played by Brian Dennehy in the
current Broadway revival), he is carrying what seem to be the
world's heaviest valises. Shouldn't we care what's in them? Perhaps
knowing the products would help us understand his spiral into
emotional destruction. Let us hypothesize that they were jammed
with obsolete goods, suited to old tastes, making his failure more
understandable. You can be liked, you can be very well liked, but
how many orders can you write if you're selling goods nobody wants?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the Wagner Co., Willy's employer for 34 years, was a
dinosaur, sending him on nearly useless jaunts to New England.
Maybe his company's incompetence turned Willy inept, and maybe he's
not the only one being downsized by Howard, old man Wagner's son.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps then, it would have been useful for Miller to tell us
what Willy was schlepping when he abruptly came back from Yonkers,
at the beginning of the play, cutting short his trip to New
England. O'Neill didn't hide the fact that Hickey in ``The Iceman
Cometh'' sold hardware. (Dennehy has played Loman and Hickey; how
much more motivation did he generate knowing that Hickey made his
living on monkey wrenches?) Yet Miller keeps us guessing.
</P>
<P>
   You have to wonder how keenly disappointed Ben Loman, Willy's
adventuresome brother and a diamond mogul, must have felt when they
exchanged these words:
</P>
<P>
   BEN: And good luck with your _ what do you do?
</P>
<P>
   WILLY: Selling.
</P>
<P>
   BEN: Yes. Well ...
</P>
<P>
   Ben was unimpressed. A world traveler, Ben knew his little
brother had no idea how to get out of Brooklyn. But imagine if
Miller had extended their conversation, just a little bit, maybe
three lines that would have helped Ben understand Willy's vocation:
</P>
<P>
   BEN: Just what is it you sell, William?
</P>
<P>
   WILLY: Catnip mice, Ben.
</P>
<P>
   BEN: Fine. Very manly, William, great for building your boys'
muscles.
</P>
<P>
   Miller is inconsistent about his characters' professional lives.
Willy's son Biff is a farmhand with a penchant for thievery. Happy,
Biff's younger brother, is two assistants below the assistant buyer
of unknown merchandise. Willy's next-door neighbor, Charley, runs a
business and lends Willy $50 a week, but whatever he does is a
secret. Charley's son, Bernard, a rehabilitated nerd, is a lawyer
about to argue a case before the U.S. Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   And Dave Singleman, the legendary salesman so admired by Willy
for being able to rack up prodigious orders from hotel rooms, sold
... who knows? But Miller does offer a few clues about what Willy's
wares were.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Willy's blind obsession about Biff's job interview with
Biff's old sporting goods boss, and his vivid memory of his older
son's triumphant high school football game at Ebbets Field, is a
vague hint that he was in that game. He loved sports, but Miller
provides no further evidence.
</P>
<P>
   What about the stockings Willy gives his Boston lover? Maybe he
sold a full line of lingerie. But hawking ladies' scanties hither
and yon for three decades is difficult to envision for Willy. He
seems more of a hardware guy. And if he sold women's undergarments,
it's nearly impossible to reconcile that with the sight of Willy's
wife, Linda, darning her old stockings.
</P>
<P>
   But Miller mentions three of Willy's accounts, two of them
prominent Boston stores. One is Filene's, which primarily sold
men's and women's apparel during the era of ``Death of a
Salesman.'' So was it men's socks or ladies' hosiery?
</P>
<P>
   The other Boston store, Slattery's, may provide the answer. No
longer in business (its inventory was liquidated in 1957 at
Filene's Basement), Slattery's was an apparel chain that catered to
women with high-class, midprice merchandise. Yet Slattery's may be
Miller's red herring, perhaps simply homage to his first wife, Mary
Slattery.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, wouldn't it be a kick for Dennehy to open his valises
to show off the neatly arranged espadrilles, velvet dresses and
brocade handbags, ready for sale? As Linda Loman says, ``Attention
must be paid.''

LONG AFTER `LAMBS,' DR. LECTER IS RETURNING 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By DINITIA SMITH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hannibal the Cannibal is back. Dr. Hannibal Lecter, the
flesh-eating villain of Thomas Harris' 1988 novel, ``The Silence of
the Lambs,'' will continue his adventures in a sequel,
``Hannibal,'' delivered unexpectedly last Tuesday by Harris to his
publisher, Delacorte Press.
</P>
<P>
   The novel is being rushed into print with unusual speed, said
Harris' editor, Carole Baron, who is president and publisher of
Dell Publishing. (Delacorte Press is Dell's hardcover imprint.)
Mrs. Baron said that the book, which took Harris 10 years to write,
would go on sale on June 8.
</P>
<P>
   Those familiar with Lecter know that he is a man of savage
appetites. Once he tore into the nurse who was taking his
electrocardiogram and ate her tongue, all the while keeping a
steady pulse rate of 85.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Baron was reluctant to reveal details of the new book's
plot, except to say that Lecter ``is pursuing his interests.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the manuscript was about 600 pages long and would be
about 480 pages in print. ``Although I had been discussing it with
Tom for the past few years,'' she said, ``I resisted asking when he
was going to finish it.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Baron said Harris had called her abruptly last week and
said, ``Are you busy?'' and then delivered the book.
</P>
<P>
   ``We learn more about Hannibal in this book,'' Mrs. Baron said,
opening the possibility that readers will learn some of the
motivation for his cannibalism.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Baron did say that in the new novel Lecter, who escaped his
captors at the end of ``The Silence of the Lambs,'' would once
again face his old adversary, FBI Agent Clarice Starling. One of
Lecter's victims, who runs a family meat business and is now but
``a shadow of his former self,'' Mrs. Baron said, uses Starling as
bait to draw Lecter out into the open so he can wreak revenge.
</P>
<P>
   This is the third of Harris' books to feature the character of
Lecter, who also appeared in ``Red Dragon,'' published in 1981.
Harris, a former writer and editor for The Associated Press,
declined to be interviewed. ``He's very private and ultimately very
shy,'' Mrs. Baron said of him. His first novel, ``Black Sunday,''
was published in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   The film version of ``The Silence of the Lambs'' won five
Academy Awards: best picture, and best director for Jonathan Demme,
best adaptation for Ted Talley, best actor for Anthony Hopkins as
Lecter and best actress for Jodie Foster as Starling. The film
rights to ``Hannibal'' are expected to attract intense interest as
well, Mrs. Baron said.

`FACING THE TRUTH': SOUTH AFRICANS WRESTLE WITH THEIR PAST 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review. Time, channel are for
New York area. Check local listings.) 
(lh) 
 By WALTER GOODMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If Bill Moyers had contented himself with reporting on the
hearings of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of South
Africa, that would have been a considerable contribution to
American viewers' comprehension of the horrors of apartheid. But
``Facing the Truth'' goes further. In interviews with the black
victims of white repression, Moyers inquires into the limits of
forgiveness and the lure of forgetfulness, while his encounters
with the former tormentors leave in their wake bitter questions of
individual responsibility and punishment.
</P>
<P>
   The testimony of women who lost their husbands and children to
murder squads is presented in near unbearable detail. Their
accounts bring home the meaning of being in the power of a regime
that treated black people as expendable; for some whites, the color
line was a license for barbarity.
</P>
<P>
   Moyers' interviews with the victims are deeply moving, but his
interviews with their torturers reveal what human beings are
capable of when restraints of common humanity are overridden by
orders from above or by ideology or simply by the privileges of
power.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the old South Africa's state security apparatus who
were incriminated in atrocities have been granted amnesty on
condition that they tell the truth about the jailings, kidnappings,
beatings, tortures and murders. Just how complete or truthful they
are is in doubt, and the offer of amnesty _ an effort by the new
South Africa to clear the air _ seems to many of the victims an
easy way out for their persecutors.
</P>
<P>
   The defiant defenses of some whites can still chill. (``I was
doing my duty,'' says a hit-squad commander of his ``preventive
assassinations.'') One man tells of enjoying a barbecue while the
bodies of recently murdered captives were being burned. Former
Prime Minister F.W. de Klerk concedes that the police used some
``unconventional strategies'' and ``firm actions,'' but in the face
of much evidence he denies charges of state terrorism.

   Moyers also talks with blacks and whites who are joining in
trying to rebuild their country with some semblance of justice, but
their good will seems fragile given the existing inequities. A
black businessman provides the blunt statistics: Whites own 90
percent of the country's capital; 90 percent of blacks have
nothing. He calls the daily return trip from the luxurious white
enclaves where many blacks work to the shanty towns where they live
without running water or electricity a journey from ``splendor to
squalor.'' Reflecting on the contrast, a white college student says
the benefits of apartheid to people like himself have come with ``a
moral stain.''
</P>
<P>
   In a few weeks Moyers returns to the subject in a conversation
with Archbishop Desmond Tutu. Tuesday night's two hours leave the
question of what sort of reconciliation is possible with so wide a
gulf between the races unbridged and so many cruel memories
unburied. ``May we have the bones back?'' survivors keep asking.
The hearings continue; the images mount; the past is unresolved and
perhaps unresolvable.

BETWEEN US _ NOT WE _ TWO: EACH OR ONE ANOTHER? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, April 4)  
(Eds: Items in bold should be set in italics. Double parentheses
should be set as brackets. The word AT in parentheses should be
replaced by the ``at'' symbol.) 
(lb) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The two were not only made for each other,'' wrote The
Washington Times about star-crossed lovers, ``they deserve one
another.''
</P>
<P>
   The editorialist, grappling with the rules of correctness, was
undoubtedly torn. Question: When writing about a relationship
between two people, is it proper to use  &UR; each other &LR;  or  &UR; one
another &LR; ? The writer refused to choose, and the editorial went both
ways.
</P>
<P>
   At The New York Times, we have firm guidance to keep us from
such pushmipullyu style. Our Style Manual, now embedded in software
so that century-old judgments can be amended in a flash, is sternly
prescriptive: `` &UR; each other, one another &LR; : two persons look at
 &UR; each other &LR; ; more than two look at  &UR; one another &LR; .''
</P>
<P>
   It's a comfort to have a rule. That's our style. If you write
for The New York Times (or the Associated Press, or The Wall Street
Journal, whose stylebooks present a united front and follow one
another on this), that's the way it is, like it or lump it. If I
were to write, ``Two stylebooks disagree with  &UR; one another &LR; ,'' an
alert copy editor would demand I change it to ``two ...  &UR; each
other &LR; .'' Sometimes a kindly copy editor will call to say, ``Are
you deliberately trying to slip this egregious error into the
paper, thereby generating mail from infuriated grammarians and
giving you a subject for your language column?'' (I don't do that,
as a rule.)
</P>
<P>
   What if I were to respond to the corrector in chief at my
newspaper: Samuel ``Dictionary'' Johnson once wrote about ``six
ministers who meet weekly at  &UR; each other's &LR;  houses,'' breaking the
rule. And Bishop Lowth, the 19th century's high priest of usage,
instructed that ``two negatives in English destroy  &UR; one another &LR; ,''
breaking the rule the other way. In 1926, Fowler _ St. Henry
himself _ wrote that ``the differentiation is neither of present
utility nor based on historical usage,'' and in his recent revision
of Fowler, Bob Burchfield declares that the belief of the rule
makers is ``untenable,'' citing recent breakings by classy writers
like Anita Brookner and Nadine Gordimer. E. Ward Gilman, editor of
Merriam-Webster's indispensable Dictionary of English Usage, often
unfairly dissed by me as ``Dr. Roundheels,'' assembles these
authorities and concludes about the  &UR; each &LR;  rule: ``There is no sin
in its violation,'' adding from his loosey-goosey perch, ``It is,
however, easy and painless to observe if you so wish.''
</P>
<P>
   I so wish. If I did not, and instead chose to break the
stylebook rule, a great contretemps would take place. Citations all
over the floor. (( &UR; No sentence fragments! _ Ed. &LR; )) In the end (at
the denouement of the contretemps but never  &UR; at the end of the
day &LR; ), a Sanhedrin of Copy Editors might permit my dissenting
usage, but only if accompanied by an explanation for my departure
from the Stylebook Team, including their punchy rebuttal and my
stinging surrebuttal. (Sometimes they let me win; that's why New
York Times style is now to spell Rumania  &UR; Romania &LR; .)
</P>
<P>
   In the same way, the three newspaper stylebooks stand foursquare
for the  &UR; between/among &LR;  rule. The AP cites ``the maxim that between
introduces two items and  &UR; among &LR;  more than two.'' Thus, it's
``between you and me'' and ``among the three of us.'' But here
comes Dr. Roundheels again (Gilman is honorably retired but comes
out swinging at my request), trotting out a parade of authorities
who disagree, and denouncing as a waste ``the enormous amount of
ink spilled in the explication of the subtleties of  &UR; between and
among &LR; .'' And no doubt he has common usage on his side.
</P>
<P>
   But not good usage. (( &UR; You really ought to do something about
those sentence fragments. _ Ed. &LR; )) What's wrong with an obeisance
to sharp edges in a world of fuzz? If we adopt as a rule the
practice of using  &UR; each other &LR;  and  &UR; between &LR;  with two, and
rigorously apply  &UR; one another &LR;  and  &UR; among &LR;  to three or more, our
world of words is a little more tightly organized. We're operating
comfortably within agreed guidelines. We have a Style.
</P>
<P>
   A style is a set of conventions, not a fundament of grammar
fixed in our brains like subject-verb agreement. A stylistic rule
is not a law. No cellblock in Reading Gaol is reserved for those
condemned of using  &UR; between the three &LR;  (and indeed a medal is
pinned on writers careful to use  &UR; between &LR;  when expressing a
relationship of several items considered a pair at a time).
</P>
<P>
   But when you play by the rules of grammar _ that is, when you
agree to adopt a style that befits a certain level and tone of
discourse _ and then stick to the rules you've learned, you get a
subtle intellectual kick that the anything-goes crowd never
experiences. And when you break any rule for effect, as when you
use a sentence fragment now and then for emphasis, or begin a
sentence with  &UR; and &LR;  to foster an illusion of spontaneity or
afterthought, you are like an actor playing a drunk and performing
an exquisite stumble.
</P>
<P>
   The respecter of the rules of an adopted style becomes a member
of a club so determinedly inclusive as to be truly snooty. You're
in, and nobody can cancel your membership as long as you consult
the rule book. The secret handshake and the code ring are yours.
With these symbols comes the sense of belonging, of serene
security, of smug noninferiority that suffuses all those who clothe
themselves voluntarily in the golden chains of good usage. (I
learned psychology from ``The Story of O.'')
</P>
<P>
   If you take language as a metaphor for life, your respect for
the gently arbitrary rules of style signifies your willingness to
respect the rules of civility in the way you behave. Breaking a
rule of style or even of civility gains force and meaning only when
you know what code you are violating and why.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine, two centuries ago, the copy editor for the Committee on
Style of the Constitutional Convention going up to Thomas Jefferson
and pointing to the last line of his proposed Unanimous Declaration
of the Thirteen United States of America: ``We mutually pledge to
each other our lives, our fortunes, and our sacred honor.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only is  &UR; mutually &LR;  redundant, Tom, but you're referring to
more than two people, so it should be  &UR; one another &LR; .''
</P>
<P>
   And Jefferson would reply: ``We're the Committee on Style,
right? Leave it the way it is.''

A HOUSE THAT'S FULL YET EMPTY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By E.J. MONTINI  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - There's a half-empty package of Klondike bars in the
freezer, the Neapolitan variety. Andy liked to have one at night,
before he went to bed. Photographs of grandchildren are stuck by
magnets to the walls and door of the refrigerator, along with a
drawing by a 6-year-old showing a ball coming off a bat and soaring
into space.
</P>
<P>
   Near the basement door on a shelf are a hat a gloves Dora used
to wear to shovel snow. On a hanger nearby is her favorite jacket.
Not too heavy. She never wore a heavy jacket, even in the coldest
weather.
</P>
<P>
   Coupons for coffee and laundry detergent and shampoo are stacked
in a small plywood shelf he built for her years ago and nailed near
the front door, next to the spare keys.
</P>
<P>
   In the cabinet above the stove are rows of spices in small jars.
Rosemary and nutmeg and cloves and garlic powder and basil.
</P>
<P>
   The things she touched last he tried to leave alone.
</P>
<P>
   The pad and pencil she kept near the telephone on the kitchen
table. The cough syrup above the sink. The earrings on the upstairs
dresser.
</P>
<P>
   For most of a year, after her death, he lived his life around
the objects she'd left behind, unwilling to move anything. &QL; 
ROSARIES, PICTURES, CARDS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving for a visit to Arizona he'd made the bed they'd
shared for over 50 years in the fashion she'd always had made it,
the top cover tucked under the pillows.
</P>
<P>
   Her rosaries are on the post where she left them.
</P>
<P>
   The picture of her in her wedding gown is on his nightstand,
where he left it.
</P>
<P>
   In a drawer on her side of the bed are the cards he'd given her
on Christmas and their anniversary and her birthday. In a drawer on
his side are the cards she'd given him.
</P>
<P>
   In a box on a shelf in their bedroom are baseball caps he'd
gotten over the years but no longer wore. On the hat rack at the
foot of the stairs are the ones he did.
</P>
<P>
   Home videos sent to them by their children are stacked next to
the VCR, on the television set, in the order he'd last watched
them.
</P>
<P>
   On top is the trip to Arizona in 1992, in which she was full of
laughter and he is strong enough to play with the kids, and nowhere
on the horizon are there hints of doctor visits or hospital beds or
coffins.
</P>
<P>
   The little stereo in the dining room has a Big Band tape in it,
stopped in the middle. His hearing was bad, but she played the
music as a kind of soundtrack to her chores, putting chairs in
order and straightening the tablecloth and organizing bills in a
basket on the china closet. &QL; 
 &QL; 
HOUSE IS FULL BUT EMPTY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the basement near his workbench are stacks of thin wood he
used to cut into shapes and paint and transform into Christmas
ornaments. Lions and tigers and Mickey Mouse and Santa Claus.
</P>
<P>
   Hanging from the ceiling by a string is one of his last
projects, a wooden helicopter.
</P>
<P>
   He'd planned to come back to their house and pick up where he'd
left off, but he never made it.
</P>
<P>
   It's something you don't expect, your parents' house, full but
empty. It's as if the whole thing should have been buried, and them
inside it.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they're gone and what remains is the little desk in the
sun parlor where she kept a calendar with notations about who had
called and when. And the coffee table in the living room, which a
son pulled from the garbage at a local church. And the ``secret
compartment'' at the foot of the stairs where visiting children
would find toy soldiers and dolls. And the 1985 Pontiac in the
garage, its tank half full with gas.
</P>
<P>
   Something must be done about the house and the things they left
behind. But for now, everything was left in its place. The towels
in the hall cabinet. The shoes in rows in the closet.
</P>
<P>
   The phone in the downstairs hallway with the same old number,
which an out-of-town son dials up occasionally, just to hear it
ring and ring and ring. &QL;

   COXNET- PERSONAL-TECHNOLOGY 0326 _ The PalmPilot, a hand-held
computer, has sold nearly 3 million units, and its success has
awakened the giant in Redmond, Wash., known as Microsoft.
Microsoft's entry into the market has spawned scores of new
hand-held computers, powered by a light version of its Windows
operating system. Today, there are plenty of models, and they come
in all sizes, colors and configurations. But don't be fooled.
There's less variety than meets the eye. (Haddad, Atlanta

Microsoft's entry into the market has spawned scores of new

A HOUSE THAT'S FULL YET EMPTY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By E.J. MONTINI  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - There's a half-empty package of Klondike bars in the
freezer, the Neapolitan variety. Andy liked to have one at night,
before he went to bed. Photographs of grandchildren are stuck by
magnets to the walls and door of the refrigerator, along with a
drawing by a 6-year-old showing a ball coming off a bat and soaring
into space.
</P>
<P>
   Near the basement door on a shelf are a hat a gloves Dora used
to wear to shovel snow. On a hanger nearby is her favorite jacket.
Not too heavy. She never wore a heavy jacket, even in the coldest
weather.
</P>
<P>
   Coupons for coffee and laundry detergent and shampoo are stacked
in a small plywood shelf he built for her years ago and nailed near
the front door, next to the spare keys.
</P>
<P>
   In the cabinet above the stove are rows of spices in small jars.
Rosemary and nutmeg and cloves and garlic powder and basil.
</P>
<P>
   The things she touched last he tried to leave alone.
</P>
<P>
   The pad and pencil she kept near the telephone on the kitchen
table. The cough syrup above the sink. The earrings on the upstairs
dresser.
</P>
<P>
   For most of a year, after her death, he lived his life around
the objects she'd left behind, unwilling to move anything. &QL; 
ROSARIES, PICTURES, CARDS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving for a visit to Arizona he'd made the bed they'd
shared for over 50 years in the fashion she'd always had made it,
the top cover tucked under the pillows.
</P>
<P>
   Her rosaries are on the post where she left them.
</P>
<P>
   The picture of her in her wedding gown is on his nightstand,
where he left it.
</P>
<P>
   In a drawer on her side of the bed are the cards he'd given her
on Christmas and their anniversary and her birthday. In a drawer on
his side are the cards she'd given him.
</P>
<P>
   In a box on a shelf in their bedroom are baseball caps he'd
gotten over the years but no longer wore. On the hat rack at the
foot of the stairs are the ones he did.
</P>
<P>
   Home videos sent to them by their children are stacked next to
the VCR, on the television set, in the order he'd last watched
them.
</P>
<P>
   On top is the trip to Arizona in 1992, in which she was full of
laughter and he is strong enough to play with the kids, and nowhere
on the horizon are there hints of doctor visits or hospital beds or
coffins.
</P>
<P>
   The little stereo in the dining room has a Big Band tape in it,
stopped in the middle. His hearing was bad, but she played the
music as a kind of soundtrack to her chores, putting chairs in
order and straightening the tablecloth and organizing bills in a
basket on the china closet. &QL; 
 &QL; 
HOUSE IS FULL BUT EMPTY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the basement near his workbench are stacks of thin wood he
used to cut into shapes and paint and transform into Christmas
ornaments. Lions and tigers and Mickey Mouse and Santa Claus.
</P>
<P>
   Hanging from the ceiling by a string is one of his last
projects, a wooden helicopter.
</P>
<P>
   He'd planned to come back to their house and pick up where he'd
left off, but he never made it.
</P>
<P>
   It's something you don't expect, your parents' house, full but
empty. It's as if the whole thing should have been buried, and them
inside it.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they're gone and what remains is the little desk in the
sun parlor where she kept a calendar with notations about who had
called and when. And the coffee table in the living room, which a
son pulled from the garbage at a local church. And the ``secret
compartment'' at the foot of the stairs where visiting children
would find toy soldiers and dolls. And the 1985 Pontiac in the
garage, its tank half full with gas.
</P>
<P>
   Something must be done about the house and the things they left
behind. But for now, everything was left in its place. The towels
in the hall cabinet. The shoes in rows in the closet.
</P>
<P>
   The phone in the downstairs hallway with the same old number,
which an out-of-town son dials up occasionally, just to hear it
ring and ring and ring. &QL;

   YUGOSLAVIA-KOSOVO CRISIS
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-STRIKES _ WASHINGTON _ Another round of U.S.-led NATO air
strikes against Yugoslavia is under way Monday as a humanitarian
crisis continues to build in Serbia's southern province of Kosovo.
Yevgeny Primakov, Russia's prime minister, is expected to arrive in
Belgrade on Tuesday to talk with Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic. Developing. (Deans, Cox News Service).

   KOSOVO-REFUGEES _ BRODEC, Macedonia _ The river of human misery
continues to spill across the border here, evidence that the
humanitarian crisis builds in Serbia's southern province of Kosovo.
Serbian telelvision was showing devastation from the NATO air
strikes on civilian sites in Kosovo. Also, reports that Dr. Ibrahim
Rugova, a key Kosovar Albanian negotiator, was killed over the
weekend while in hiding. Developing. (Roughton, Cox News Service).
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-TROOPS _ WASHINGTON _ As NATO steps up its pounding of
Yugolsavia, the focus is turning more to the Serb troops and
paramilitary gangs terrorizing ethnic Albanians in the southern
province of Kosovo. More and more, it appears that this campaign
cannot be successful without sending in ground troops. An already
dicey question, fraught with political risk for the Clinton
administration, continues to rear its ugly head. Developing.

student from Kosovo currently living near Elizabeth City, N.C.,
said Friday he supports NATO's bombing of his homeland and other
military action despite the fact his parents are still living in
the war-torn Yugoslavian province. The student, a 17-year-old
ethnic Albanian, said he hopes the bombing will destroy Yugoslavian
President Slobodan Milosevic's ability to kill Albanians.

   STEALTH _ DAYTON _ For decades, technology sleuths at
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base have torn apart and studied
Russian-built warplanes to learn how they work -- and how to defeat
them. Now it may be Russia's turn. Russian counterparts to American
foreign technology analysts are undoubtedly eager for a chance to
examine pieces of the U.S. Air Force F-117 Stealth fighter that
crashed in Yugoslavia Saturday. It isn't clear what they can learn
from the flaming debris, but even badly damaged equipment can be a
prize to foreign technology analysts. During the Korean war,
American teams deliberately blew up wreckage of Russian-built
MiG-15 fighters just to get pieces small enough to throw into
helicopters and bring them back to Wright-Pat for study, according
to the National Air Intelligence Center at Wright-Pat. Right now,
the center has three Russian-built MiG-29 fighters in its
``exploitation center'' on the base. (Gaffney, Dayton Daily News).

visionaries. It was not a bad move.(Dart, Cox News Service). WITH

<P>
   HOUSTON _ It always takes courage to make a sea change in
midlife _ especially if that means giving up a regular paycheck.
</P>
<P>
   That's something Saadat Syal discovered when he decided to chuck
his 16-year career of wooing companies to town as vice president of
economic development for the Greater Houston Partnership.
</P>
<P>
   Syal, 53, gave it up for the real estate development business.
</P>
<P>
   He and his family have been buying property in inner Houston
over the past several years and they want to build houses and town
houses on the vacant turf. He also has family business in Pakistan
that needs tending.
</P>
<P>
   And he's looking forward to doing volunteer work that he never
had time for. For instance, he spent the past week handling several
mediation cases for neighboring Fort Bend County.
</P>
<P>
   It was time to give up the daily grind, he said about his years
with the Partnership. He wanted a career that gave him more
flexibility and an opportunity to use the skills he has picked up
over the years.
</P>
<P>
   More and more baby boomers in their early to mid-50s are opting
to leave their steady jobs and move on to new ventures _ whether
that means joining the Peace Corps, volunteering full time or
launching their own business.
</P>
<P>
   There just seems to be a general mood of restlessness, Syal
said, speaking of his contemporaries. People have worked hard,
acquired lots of accouterments and now want something more out of
life.
</P>
<P>
   And it was really now or never, Syal said, since the economy is
so good right now.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't an overnight decision but more of an evolutionary
process, Syal said. He said he carefully planned his new real
estate venture for several years before setting out.
</P>
<P>
   Many baby boomers are feeling that same itch because the whole
concept of work has changed. People are healthier and live longer
and many can't fathom the idea of putting up their feet when they
hit 65, said Cheryl Matherly, director of the Career Services
Center at Rice University.
</P>
<P>
   People who are reaching the age of 40, 45, 50 are thinking about
all the productive years they've got left and wondering if they
want to keep doing what they've been doing, said Matherly, who
recalled a 60-year-old alum who came in and took some career tests
because he was looking for a change in direction.
</P>
<P>
   Many boomers can afford to sing the tune Johnny Paycheck made
famous, ``Take This Job and Shove It,'' because they've done well
in the stock market. They can afford to take a chance.
</P>
<P>
   Syal said he and his wife always lived below their means. They
bought less house than they could have, they didn't take elaborate
vacations and didn't accumulate any credit card debt.
</P>
<P>
   But while some boomers may have the assets to go out on a limb,
it's not always an easy decision.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Boynton said he sees a lot of senior executives who
develop a sense of wanderlust, but many don't have the nerve to
leave their organization and go out on their own.
</P>
<P>
   It's not because they lack courage. Rather, it's a reluctance to
move out of the comfort zone of the authority and infrastructure
that they've developed in their organization, said Boynton,
president of the Morganstern Co., an executive outplacement company
in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   When you're out on your own you have to make your own coffee and
answer your own phone, Boynton said.
</P>
<P>
   Irwin Miller also sees nervousness among midcareer folks who
might be thinking about jumping into a new career.
</P>
<P>
   They may be tired of their jobs but they're comfortable and it
provides a steady income, said Miller, chairman of the Houston
chapter of the Service Corps of Retired Executives. High-tech
employees seem to be an exception, he said.
</P>
<P>
   They seem a little more adventurous and sure of themselves, he
said. And many have seen their friends' start-ups strike it big.
</P>
<P>
   Downsizing also appears to spawn entrepreneurship.
</P>
<P>
   Twice a month, SCORE conducts seminars on how to start a
business. When the economy is suffering, attendance at the seminars
soar, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Syal said he is already enjoying his new life. The volunteering
has been enjoyable and he is looking forward to lining up his first
real estate development.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day should be an adventure,'' he said.

   Here are the Kosovo-related stories that The New York Times is
planning for Tuesday, March 30, 1999. The N.Y. Times News Service
day supervisor is Gary E. McCardell; phone: (888) 346-9867.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-RDP (Washington) _ Ledeall: Fresh NATO air attacks
shifted more toward Serbian positions in embattled Kosovo today as
the Clinton administration claimed the evidence of genocide by Serb
forces was growing to ``abhorrent and criminal action on a maxium
scale.'' By Francis X. Clines.
</P>
<P>
   With map and photo.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-NATO (Brussels) _ NATO officials said Monday that
Slobodan Milosevic's military campaign against the ethnic Albanian
population of Kosovo was aimed at establishing a Serb-only enclave
inside the province to hold on to after the fighting ends. ``We
have the impression that there is a campaign under way to
ethnically re-engineer the inside of Kosovo, to achieve a solution
more acceptable to him,'' said Jamie P. Shea, Nato's chief
spokesman. By Craig R. Whitney.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-MILOSEVIC (Undated) _ News analysis: As Yugoslav forces
kill and evict the ethnic Albanians of Kosovo, a critical question
has emerged for the West: at what point does the brutality used by
Slobodan Milosevic, the Yugoslav president, and the increasingly
personal attacks on him by the West, make it impossible to ever
negotiate with him again? By Roger Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-REFUGEES (Somewhere near the Kosovo border) _ Listening
to refugee voices: They tell of methodical, organized, systematic
expulsions by police and paramilitaries. By John Kifner.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-MONITORS (Skopje, Macedonia) _ The international monitors
who pulled out of Kosovo dejectedly reflect on what they might have
done differently, and desperately try to keep in touch with Kosovo.
By Carlotta Gall.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-VOICES (White Plains, N.Y.) _ As the death toll mounts
along with the bombs, refugees and protests, so has public
uncertainty over the NATO bombing campaign in Yugoslavia. People
who accepted the Clinton administration's portrayal of the military
strikes as a clear-cut moral obligation _ the protection of a
vulnerable ethnic minority from the brutality of one stubborn man,
Yugoslavia's president, Slobodan Milosevic _ have now begun to
question just who is the enemy and what motivates him. In a series
of interviews over the past five days with ordinary people living
and working in White Plains, those doubts have grown more apparent
as they have absorbed more and more of the flood of information,
pictures and commentary about Yugoslavia from television, radio and
newspapers. By Susan Sachs.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-BELGRADE (Belgrade) _ Along Belgrade's loveliest shopping
street, Knez Mihajlova, groups of young men filled with chauvinism,
anger and beer on Monday completed the trashing of the American
Center, the British Council, the Goethe Institute and the French
Cultural Center, as scattered policemen watched and chatted among
themselves. Belgrade is a city where people say ``ciao'' and drink
espresso, judge the latest Hollywood movies with asperity and surf
the net. But the war is dragging it farther from Europe, into
isolation, uniting the Serbs behind their soldiers, their Kosovo
and even President Slobodan Milosevic. American movies have been
withdrawn from the theaters, though the Original Levi's Store
across from the American Center was left untrashed by the mobs. By
Steven Erlanger.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-PROTECT (Washington) _ One point of the NATO attack was
to protect ethnic Albanians in Kosovo; now they are worse off than
ever. Did the U.S. anticipate this? By Jane Perlez.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-DRONES (Washington) _ The drone, an unmanned aircraft, is
one of the best tools NATO has to learn what is going on in Kosovo.
But drones have not yet been used. By Elizabeth Becker.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-TROOPS (Washington) _ Which allied units are where and
which would be needed if NATO changed its mind and decided on a
land attack. By Eric Schmitt.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-RUSSIA (Moscow) _ Primakov, the Russian prime minister,
is going to Belgrade on Tuesday. By Celestine Bohlen.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-PILOTS (Aviano, Italy) _ What allied pilots are saying
about their missions over Yugoslavia. By John Tagliabue.
</P>
<P>
   With photo.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to these, we are considering stories on diplomatic
maneuvering among the allies and Russia and a story on the possible
relevance of the international convention on genocide.

   MOSCOW _ Alarmed by the prospects of a widening war in the
Balkans, President Boris Yeltsin Monday dispatched Prime Minister
Yevgeny Primakov on a high-risk mission to Belgrade, Yugoslavia,
Tuesday to coax President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia back to
the negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
   Russia will insist first on a halt to the NATO bombing, which
top officials here again described as an barbaric act of
aggression.
</P>
<P>
   But for all the tough talk, Primakov's mission is seen as a sign
that after five days of bombing, Moscow is ready to commit its own
diplomatic muscle and test the influence it has on Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   The delegation, which will include Defense Minister Igor
Sergeyev, Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov and top intelligence
officials, may move on from Belgrade to the capital of a NATO
country _ perhaps Bonn, Germany _ if it sees any hope for a
negotiated settlement, news reports here said.
</P>
<P>
   Primakov, who abruptly called off a crucial visit to Washington
last week as the first wave of NATO missiles were being launched,
said Monday after meetings with Michel Camdessus, managing director
of the International Monetary Fund, that an agreement on relief for
Russia's crushing foreign debt was near.
</P>
<P>
   But the Kosovo crisis, which has given rise to new anti-Western
feelings across the Russian political spectrum, has put real
strains on relations with Western partners, raising fears that
Moscow is heading into a another period of isolation.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Monday, Ivanov showed little flexibility in
Russia's position as he lambasted NATO for hitting targets he
described as civilian and causing what he called a humanitarian
catastrophe.
</P>
<P>
   ``NATO bears full responsibility for this and nobody will
succeed in covering this up,'' he said, accusing Washington in
particular of concocting ``threadbare schemes'' to blame the flight
of refugees on Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Ivanov also accused NATO of covertly planning to send ground
forces into the region and of coordinating its aerial attacks with
the Kosovo Liberation Army. In particular, he said, representatives
of the United States and the West in the Organization of Security
and Cooperation in Europe mission, now based in Macedonia, had left
behind liaison officers within the Kosovo Liberation Army who have
been guiding NATO aircraft to Serbian targets.
</P>
<P>
   ``At present, armed Albanian terrorists have launched a
large-scale offensive against the Serbs virtually throughout the
region,'' he said, repeatedly dismissing reports that Kosovo
Albanians were being pushed out of the province by Serbs as
propaganda spread by NATO.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``Rumors are assiduously being spread that genocide has started
at this precise moment in time,'' Ivanov said. ``Genocide is being
perpetrated, but only as a result of NATO action.'' As for the
refugees now massing on Kosovo's borders, he said, their numbers
have increased ``because nobody wants bombs falling on his head.''
</P>
<P>
   Ivanov dismissed a previous peace mission by Russian liberal
democratic politicians, led by the former Prime Minister Yegor
Gaidar, with thinly veiled scorn. Although the Gaidar delegation
informed the government of its trip to Belgrade, he said ``they
represented only themselves,'' and he questioned the
``coincidence'' of their meeting with the special American envoy,
Richard Holbrooke, at an airport in Budapest.
</P>
<P>
   Sergeyev, the defense minister, said he had information that as
many as 1,000 civilians and 100 military personnel had been killed
so far by the NATO bombing. This was the latest in a series of
casualty figures issued by the Russians; they have yet to be
confirmed by Yugoslavs or others.
</P>
<P>
   Running through a list of NATO targets, Gen. Yuri Baluyevsky, of
the Russian General Staff, said more than 20 civilian sites had
been hit, including educational establishments, resorts, the
Gracanica monastery and historical monuments at Citinje, in
Montenegro, the other republic in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Russian reports last week of the downing of two NATO
planes, these reports could not be confirmed. The military attache
at the Yugoslav Embassy in Moscow refused to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Leonid Ivashov, head of the Defense Ministry's
international military cooperation department, said Russia had
taken further steps to cut its links with NATO by recalling
officers now in NATO countries on special training programs and
canceling all scheduled meetings with NATO colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the vehement language, Ivanov insisted Monday that
Russia rejected any return to a Cold-War stance. ``We do not want
to see our relations worsen,'' he said. ``We do not want to go back
to the relations that we had in the period of the Cold War, or to
be plunged into confrontation. This is not our choice.''

   MARINA, Albania _ Lindalita Kryeziv and her husband, Alban,
walked, tired, scared _ and suddenly homeless, broke and stateless
_ over this scraggly border crossing early Monday, a tiny part of
the ragged band of some 60,000 ethnic Albanians here hounded out of
Kosovo by Serbian forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we have nothing,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But there was something even worse: She had been separated from
her 18-month-old daughter and her sickly mother-in-law.
</P>
<P>
   Less than an hour earlier, her daughter, Elita, lying in the
arms of her mother-in-law, Hanife Kryeziv, had crossed the border
ahead of them in a cart dragged by a farm tractor. But now they
were nowhere in sight.
</P>
<P>
   As she desperately searched from the backseat of a stranger's
car along the 15 miles of twisting road southwest of the town of
Kukes, where the refugees gathered, Mrs. Kryeziv recounted her
ordeal.
</P>
<P>
   At the Kryezivs' apartment in the town of Suva Rekka early
Monday morning a half-dozen Serbian paramilitary agents pounded on
the door.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were scared,'' Mrs. Kryeziv said. ``They said `You have
half an hour to get out of here and say hello to President Clinton.
You don't belong here. It's not your land, Kosovo.'''
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs had already written the name of a Serbian family on
their apartment door. All around her neighborhood, she said, other
ethnic Albanian families were being ousted and Albanian-owned
stores looted and smashed. The minaret of a local mosque was blown
up, recalling the destruction of Islamic buildings in Bosnia by
Serbs during their ``ethnic cleansing'' campaign there.
</P>
<P>
   ``All over the countryside you will only see cows and animals,''
she said. ``You won't see people.''
</P>
<P>
   Her story is almost identical to those told by virtually every
refugee interviewed in different parts of Kukes in the last three
days by journalists and Western aid workers: a tale of whole towns
ordered to flee by Serbian policemen in paramilitary units, the
people robbed along the way and stripped of identity documents down
to their cars' license plates.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the striking similarities of the accounts appeared to
indicate that the Serbian campaign was methodic, well-organized and
systematic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The consistency of the reports is alarming,'' said Eugene
O'Sullivan, the head of the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe's observer team here.
</P>
<P>
   And there were other, sinister reports, more difficult to
confirm, of killings by the Serbian forces and bodies left by the
side of the road, as well as whole villages set afire. A hundred
people were said to have been executed in the village of Celine,
among other such reports reaching Western aid workers.
</P>
<P>
   Back and forth along the road the Kryezivs searched, following a
white scratch running along the battered pavement, perhaps the
trail of the steel rim of a broken rear wheel of the cart the
daughter and mother-in-law were in. But a youth by the side of the
road told them he had seen the cart pass by _ empty. ``This is like
a nightmare for me,'' Mrs. Kryeziv said softly as the couple got
out to search among the clumps of tired refugees.
</P>
<P>
   By their traditional garb _ bright, baggy pantaloons on the
women and girls, the white conical felt hats worn by Muslims among
the Albanians of the northern mountains on older men _ many of the
refugees appeared to be from the rural areas in the mountains and
valleys west of the Kosovo city of Prizrin.
</P>
<P>
   The sudden influx swamped Kukes, a town of about 20,000 people
about six hours north of Tirana, the capital, on dizzyingly steep
and crumbling roads across spectacular mountains. But desperate
efforts by the Albanian government and the office of the U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees, the main agency running the relief
effort, in mobilizing hundreds of buses, army trucks and other
vehicles managed to move about 16,700 people southward toward
Tirana by nightfall.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands more made their way south crammed on carts pulled by
farm tractors and in cars distinguished by their lack of license
plates. ``It's almost orderly,'' O'Sullivan, said Monday as night
fell, ``as opposed to this morning, which was absolute chaos.''
</P>
<P>
   Local officials were distributing plastic sheeting for
protection in case of rain and had begun to organize food
distribution and medical care. In the main square, refugees
clutching whatever they escaped with, crowded around the buses as
they pulled up. But just before 8 p.m., a new wave of refugees _
about 20 cars and 1,000 people on foot _ began crossing the border.
</P>
<P>
   During the day, the refugees clustered, looking stunned, along
the sidewalks in Kukes and at gathering places like the main square
or a truck park. And when asked, they told of burned villages,
looted homes, stolen jewelry and foreign currency _ German marks
preferred _ and reports of killings and other atrocities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Serbs came and told us we have to leave for Albania,''
said Dervish Dervishaj, 66, from the village of Dillush.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people leaving in tractors they didn't search so much,''
he said. ``The people with good cars they searched very well. They
took the foreign currency, and then they took the cars.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They took all our identity documents and burned them, and they
took the plates off the cars,'' he said as dozens of people
clustered around a battered tractor and cart with half a dozen
women and belongings including a painted baby cradle piled on top.
``Without identity we won't have the right to be back in our own
country.''
</P>
<P>
   Another refugee, Sejadin Krasniqi, said: ``They took the foreign
currency from the people. For the Serbian currency, they said
nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Liman Fazliu, 58, from Dinaj, said: ``They were playing with us.
They said to make this sign or they would kill us.'' He made the
three-fingered sign of the cross of the Orthodox Church used by
Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   As they talked, Alban Kryeziv moved silently through the crowd,
his young face grim, as he continued his search for his mother and
baby daughter.

SPRING TRAINING TAKES A HIT
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Wednesday, March 31)  
(mk) 
 By DAVID GRIMES   
 Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If there's one thing I hate, it's when somebody from a Big Paper
Up North insults Sarasota.
</P>
<P>
   If anyone's going to do a number on Sarasota, it should be me.
That is my job, I've been doing it for years and I haven't gotten
where I am today (a small desk downwind from the newsroom
refrigerator) by letting the Big Boys move in on my turf, or
stained beige carpet as the case may be.
</P>
<P>
   I am referring, of course, to the article in the Feb. 26 issue
of The Wall Street Journal where writers Sam Walker and Jonathan B.
Weinbach (never trust a Big Paper writer who uses a middle initial)
``evaluate'' the spring training baseball parks in Florida and
Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Smith Stadium, the spring training home of the Cincinnati
Reds, is described as a ``nice but unremarkable distraction in an
otherwise shuffleboard-crazy resort town.'' The nicest thing the
writers could say about the team was that the Reds, this year,
finally lifted their long-standing ban on players' facial hair.
</P>
<P>
   Although the underachieving Reds may have looked like they were
playing shuffleboard the past few seasons, that is not something
you can blame on the citizens of Sarasota, most of whom spend their
free time coughing at Gordon Lightfoot concerts or honking at
tourists on U.S. 41. (Or perhaps it's the other way around.)
</P>
<P>
   In my opinion, Sarasota might be a better place to live if it
were more crazy about shuffleboard and less crazy about a lot of
other things, like real estate development, new bridges and making
it illegal to be a teen-ager in downtown after 6 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Shuffleboarders have tempers, just like everyone else I suppose,
but you seldom hear of gunfights erupting over a rules dispute or
an opponent running over someone simply because he did not play
quickly enough. This sort of thing happens on Sarasota's (and New
York's) highways far too often. (If cell phones were replaced by
cordless shuffleboard discs, I think America's highways would be a
lot safer.)
</P>
<P>
   Calling Ed Smith Stadium a ``nice but unremarkable distraction''
is so vague that I can't tell if it's a compliment or a complaint.
Some uncharitable sorts might say the same thing about The Wall
Street Journal or even New York itself, though the ``nice'' part
seems a bit of a stretch.
</P>
<P>
   I ran into Marge Schott and her St. Bernard, Schottzie 2, the
other day at Ed Smith Stadium, which is something that's never
happened to me in the offices of The Wall Street Journal or on the
streets of New York. I'm not sure if that will make you feel better
or worse about Ed Smith Stadium, but I just thought you'd like to
know.
</P>
<P>
   The description of McKechnie Field, where the Pittsburgh Pirates
play in Bradenton, was more perplexing than unflattering.
</P>
<P>
   ``McKechnie Field has an urban flavor (foul balls pelt cars on
city streets) and an unadorned, slightly dilapidated feel that some
say make it the Wrigley Field of the Grapefruit League.'' The
writers went on to describe the parking around McKechnie as
``horrible.''
</P>
<P>
   The writers were apparently unaware that the unadorned, slightly
dilapidated McKechnie Field underwent a major renovation six years
ago and is now, arguably, the most eye-catching public edifice in
all of Bradenton, which admittedly is not saying all that much.
Still, no less an authority than USA Today called McKechnie ``the
Fenway Park of spring parks. Green fence, green seats, the
definition of baseball intimacy.''
</P>
<P>
   True, this ``baseball intimacy'' may be hard to appreciate if
you are one of the unlucky drivers on Ninth Street West to have a
foul ball crash through your windshield, but that seems a small
price to pay for green fences and green seats. (Not to mention
green money, something you should bring plenty of if you go to any
spring training games, even those in shuffleboard-crazy Sarasota.)
</P>
<P>
   The Wall Street Journal writers were kindest, in their own way,
to Charlotte County Stadium, home of the Texas Rangers. (They
thought it was cool that the place is crawling with alligators,
which should tell you all you need to know about New York.)
</P>
<P>
   They also described Charlotte County Stadium as a great place to
snag batting-practice home runs, something that was apparently
written before the well-publicized fight between a fan and a
Rangers coach over a batting-practice home run ball.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to say I disagree with everything the Big City Paper
wrote about our spring training parks.
</P>
<P>
   It's true, as written, that Charlotte County Stadium can get
cold at night, but if you get too chilly, you can go out in the
parking lot and wrestle an alligator or scuffle with someone over a
home run ball to help warm you up.

<P>
   The worlds collide at lot No. 92, where a sleek new 36-foot RV
gleams in the afternoon sun amid aging but tidy trailers. It's the
home away from home for state Sen. Dan Robinson and his wife of 37
years, Jean.
</P>
<P>
   Shunning the usual pick of Raleigh hotels and apartment
complexes where state lawmakers typically stay Mondays through
Thursdays, the Robinsons opted to bring their second home with them
to this capital city suburb.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had more or less decided even before the election that if I
was successful that we were going to use the mobile home,''
Robinson said as highway interchanges and suburban sprawl faded in
the rear-view mirror of his Mazda Millennium.
</P>
<P>
   Jean Robinson, who serves as her husband's legislative clerk,
first suggested the unusual living arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to talk her out of it during the winter months,'' said
Dan Robinson, a Democrat from Cullowhee in his first term. ``That
just didn't go over at all.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he was going to give up on me,'' Jean Robinson
sighed as they sat in the RV's living area, outfitted with a couch
and three lounge chairs.
</P>
<P>
   With the election won, the Robinsons immediately began scouting
for campgrounds and eventually found Buffaloe's Mobile Acres.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen a neater mobile home park,'' said Dan
Robinson, a retired football coach from Western Carolina University
in Cullowhee. His wife is also retired from the university, where
she spent a career as a secretary and where the couple met.
Cullowhee is in Jackson County, across the state line from South
Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   ``I needed some extra secretarial work and they sent her over,''
Robinson said. Thirty-seven years, three children and three
grandchildren later, the couple still enjoy each other's company.
Wanderlust and their RV have taken them as far as Alaska and the
Canadian Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The worst part,'' Jean Robinson said of living long-term in a
motor home, ``is we both have to share a bathroom.'' It's smaller
than some walk-in closets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like a go-go dancer in the shower,'' she quipped.
``It's got a skylight and you're up on a ledge.''
</P>
<P>
   The RV is outfitted with two color televisions _ one in the
living area and a smaller one in the bedroom; a
convection-microwave oven; and a small washer-dryer combo that will
clean two or three shirts at a time.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to water and propane, the park provides phone
hook-up. They pay $325 a month for the site, utilities included.
Legislators are paid $1,160 a month salary, plus $728 a week for
meals and lodging and $559 a month for expenses like postage and
phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what they most missed from home, they quickly agreed that
they often think about sitting on their glassed-in porch watching
birds.
</P>
<P>
   The Robinsons had visions of cooking dinner on a charcoal grill
and taking strolls in the evenings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We like the lifestyle,'' Jean Robinson said. ``It's what we
want to do.''
</P>
<P>
   But so far, that life has eluded them with legislative work and
lobbyist receptions keeping them in Raleigh past sundown most
nights.

COMMITTEE SHOULD TRY TO SILENCE LOOSE CANNON

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ There are eight of us on a safety committee, and
we are supposed to make recommendations to make the work site
safer. One member of the committee, not the chairman, has taken it
upon himself to send recommendations to management under the name
of the committee, even though the committee never agreed to them.
We have all spoken to him about this, but you never know what he is
going to do next. What can we do? M.C.
</P>
<P>
   It is ironic that a safety committee would have a loose cannon.
Before he launches any more messages under the committee's name, it
is time to do more than talk to him about this. All of you have
done this already, and yet the messages fly.
</P>
<P>
   The next step needs to be taken by the chairman. In a word, he
needs to sit down with the self-appointed messenger and explain the
facts of committee life. In a word, if this employee is planning on
remaining on the committee, he cannot be unilaterally drafting
recommendations under the committee's name and sending them to
management.
</P>
<P>
   He can certainly write recommendations and submit them to the
committee itself, but that is where they must stop until the group
has made its decisions. He should clearly understand that his
current behavior is disruptive, distracting and interfering with
the mission, performance and objectives of the committee.
</P>
<P>
   He also needs to understand that if he sends any more of these
recommendations to management, the committee will send a
recommendation to management that he be removed.
</P>
<P>
   Q. I recently registered with several employment agencies to
assist me in my job search. I am a qualified
receptionist-administrative assistant with good references. The job
interviews that I am sent on are ``less than professional'' places
to work. I wish I could find an agency that would truly be
interested in helping me find a decent place to work. Any
suggestions? C.P.
</P>
<P>
   A. An agency that is sending you to ``less than professional''
places sounds like a less-than-professional agency. Fortunately,
there are very professional agencies that you can use. You need to
screen an agency before allowing it to screen you. There are
several ways to do this, such as by networking with friends and
associates, contacting companies that interest you and asking which
agencies they use, and looking up agencies in magazines and on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   When you deal with an employment agency, you need to be clear
and assertive. Let the agent know what you are looking for, along
with the fact that if you are sent to an inappropriate potential
employer, you will change agencies.
</P>
<P>
   In searching for a job, it is also helpful to use more than just
agencies. Friends, associates, schools, newspapers, magazines and
the Internet all can play a role here as well.
</P>
<P>
   The labor market is very good right now for people with your
skills, and you can be very choosy, both in terms of selecting an
agency and selecting a job. &QL; 
Q. I quit my job without giving notice because of some grievances
and unfair treatment from my boss. How can this affect my last
paycheck and work history? R.D.
</P>
<P>
   A. When people storm out of a company, they can cast a cloud
over themselves at the same time. After making such a rapid
departure, there are some points to keep in mind.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of the impact of your departure on your final paycheck,
if you are still owed money for the time that you were on the job,
the company is obligated to pay you.
</P>
<P>
   As for the impact on your work history, this depends primarily
on how much history has been repeating itself. If instant
departures are a common occurrence in your career, that could
create a problem, the solution to which is in your hands. If you
find yourself in another distressful work situation, you should
make a commitment to yourself to deal with it in a businesslike
way. And, from the preventive standpoint, step back during the
employment process and make sure that you have carefully checked
out your next employer.
</P>
<P>
   It is also important to let a job interviewer know that you left
your previous employer without giving notice, and be prepared to
present the specifics of what happened. If this is the first time
you left a job in a huff, be sure to let the interviewer know that
as well.
</P>
<P>
   If you fail to inform the employer about the rapid ending to
your previous job, the employer may learn about this in a reference
check, and that may bring a rapid ending to this job opportunity.

   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ Along Belgrade's loveliest shopping
street, Knez Mihajlova, groups of young men filled with chauvinism,
anger and beer Monday completed the trashing of the American
Center, the British Council, the Goethe Institute and the French
Cultural Center, as scattered policemen watched and chatted among
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The impact of the stones shattering the windows seemed in rhythm
with the sounds of another patriotic concert in the city center,
starring Ceca Raznjatovic, wife of the notorious Serbian
paramilitary leader Zeljko Raznjatovic, known as Arkan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ceca,'' a Serbian version of Cher, was famous before she
married Arkan, a proud pioneer of ethnic cleansing in Bosnia. But
she has taken to doing music videos with a live tiger cub, a
reference to the name of Arkan's brigades, the Tigers.
</P>
<P>
   As ordinary Belgrade residents walked by, or stood to watch the
destruction, the young stone throwers also spray-painted obscene
graffiti on the walls, comparing NATO to the Nazis and making snide
references to President Clinton's sexual life.
</P>
<P>
   Like many of the passers-by, they wore a ``target'' logo that
has swept Belgrade _ a gesture of contempt toward NATO's bombs that
is made more palatable by the fact that no NATO bombs have struck
the populated center of the Yugoslav capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm ashamed to see this,'' said a medical doctor dressed in a
fashionable pale-beige suit who identified herself only as Zaklina.
``But you know the bombs have made people crazy. They crack the
veneer of civilization, as if war excuses anything.''
</P>
<P>
   She laughed then, saying, ``Anyway, they are bored with being
down in the shelters, with the grannies.''
</P>
<P>
   Belgrade is a city where people say ``ciao'' and drink espresso,
judge the latest Hollywood movies with asperity and surf the Net.
But the war is dragging it farther from Europe, into isolation,
uniting the Serbs behind their soldiers, their Kosovo and even
President Slobodan Milosevic. American movies have been withdrawn
from the theaters, though the Original Levi's Store across from the
American Center was left untrashed by the mobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``People used to say that only God could unify the Serbs,'' said
Aleksa Djilas, an historian and son of the late Milovan Djilas, the
most famous dissident of the Tito period. ``But now they've been
unified from heaven _ but by the bombs, not by God.''
</P>
<P>
   No one really feels they deserve to be bombed, Djilas said,
``even if they know that Milosevic's policies have played a big
role.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the government has urged citizens to run to
the air raid shelters for 12 or 15 hours a day, understanding that
collective panic provides a sense of solidarity with the nation and
its military.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if you refuse to go down, or say that there is no point in
it, people get very angry,'' said Ilija, a former journalist in his
50s. ``People think you're belittling their plight or somehow
saying that it's all right that they're sitting in a shelter.''
</P>
<P>
   There is much more suspicion around, with rumors of Western
spies and local dissidents planting radar guidance devices to
insure that NATO's bombs find their targets. Some Serbs insist,
conversely, that some devices have been planted in the hotels where
journalists are staying, intended not to guide the bombs, but to
deflect them.
</P>
<P>
   And the city authorities, while deciding that it is now safer to
keep Belgrade's street lights on, still insist that curtains be
drawn after 6 p.m., as if NATO's modern weapons still depended on
illuminated living rooms to find their targets.
</P>
<P>
   Still, as Yugoslavia faces its sixth day of bombing without
major civilian casualties, people are becoming inured to the sharp
wail of the sirens. Fewer spend all night in the shelters, but
there is little else to do, with nearly all the restaurants, clubs,
cafes and movie theaters shutting down at dusk.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a deepening sense of boredom _ the war is really very
boring, especially with this monotonous war propaganda on the
news,'' said a cosmopolitan Serb, who spoke on condition of
anonymity. ``My son is bored; he can't go out, except to visit
friends in their shelters, where it's boring. My little one is
bored, because all her favorite cartoons like Power Rangers have
been replaced by these interminable news programs.''
</P>
<P>
   So people are renting armfuls of videos, especially comedies,
like ``You've Got Mail.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Serbs remain resourceful and ironic. A basement cafe
downtown has renamed itself ``The Shelter Cafe,'' offering
satellite television along with coffee and drinks. A placard put up
in a window along Knez Mihajlova read: ``F-117A. Crashed. Low
mileage. Foreign license plates. Cheap. Call after 4 p.m.''
</P>
<P>
   And with cigarettes so scarce, people joke, the war is a superb
opportunity to quit smoking.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Milosevic government, through its censorship of the news
media, has isolated Belgrade and the rest of Serbia proper from the
real war going on to the south, in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   While state television shows careful film of NATO damage, there
is little effort to discuss the activities of the military and
security forces in Kosovo. While Western politicians and
human-rights officials are making harsh accusations of atrocities,
killings and ``ethnic cleansing'' of the ethnic Albanian
population, Serbs are informed that their forces are simply
responding to the widespread terrorism of the rebel Kosovo
Liberation Army and its sympathizers.
</P>
<P>
   Djilas, the historian, said he considered that the coming visit
by Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov to be a way for Russian
President Boris Yeltsin to deal with fierce domestic criticism of
NATO and doubted that it would produce anything substantive.
</P>
<P>
   But it would also add to what Zoran Djindjic, the leader of the
Democratic Party here _ and an organizer of pro-democracy
demonstrations against Milosevic two years ago _ called the
``mental filters of censorship and self-censorship'' that protect
ordinary people from the reality of atrocity.
</P>
<P>
   ``The essence of Milosevic's system is that no one knows
anything,'' Djindjic said. ``We don't know how the economy is doing
or what the Zastava factory is producing or how many are
unemployed, let alone what is happening in Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   It is the same process that allowed the Germans under Nazism to
discount evidence of the Holocaust, Djindjic said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People first need to hear information,'' he said. ``Then, if
they hear it, will they believe it? And if they believe it, how can
they explain it?'' As they try to explain it to themselves, he
said, people will think ``Maybe they victims are guilty, somehow,
and deserve what they get.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Djindjic, Belgrade's reform mayor for a few months in 1997, said
it was important to understand how much Milosevic depends on a
rural constituency that has always hated Belgrade, the
sophisticated metropolis. Yugoslavia's civil wars, over the last
decade, have brought more and more angry and impoverished Serbs
here from Bosnia and Croatia.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's more of a rural fatalism now,'' he said. ``There is
more xenophobia, myth and superstition. All of this is only
accelerated by the war.''

 &HT;    TINY, POOR ALABANIA BUCKLING UNDER FLOOD OF KOSOVO REFUGEES
 &HT;    With KOSOVO-STRIKES-0330.
 &HT;    By BERT ROUGHTON JR.
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TIRANA, Albania _ Already Europe's poorest country, Albania was
being pushed to its limits Monday by a seemingly endless flood of
refugees from neighboring Kosovo in southernmost Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   As many as 75,000 of Kosovo's ethnic Albanians have crossed the
rugged mountains that rise between the countries since NATO air
strikes began last week aimed at forcing Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic to accept a peace agreement, aid agency and
government officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Exhausted and frightened, the refugees are being distributed by
the Albanian government to settlement centers throughout Albania, a
country where average residents have little more than the refugees
they now must host.
</P>
<P>
   Albanian Prime Minister Pandeli Majko on Monday said his
government expects nearly 100,000 more refugees -- reportedly
ordered out of their homes by Serb military forces -- to cross the
border Tuesday and pleaded for Western assistance.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees in Albania (UNHCR)
confirmed Majko's forecast, and called on international relief
organizations to help assist 150,000 refugees in Albania.
</P>
<P>
   ``Problems are being dealt with in absolute priority,'' the
agency said in a statement here in Albania's capital. ``The
sheltering of the refugees, the provision of food and non-food
items is being coordinated with all relevant bodies.''
</P>
<P>
   The UNHCR estimates that 7,000 refugees have entered Macedonia,
20,000 have entered Montenegro and 75,000-80,000 had entered
Albania.
</P>
<P>
   NATO estimates than as many as 550,000 people have been
displaced during the air campaign, which coincided with a major
Serb offensive against ethnic Albanian rebels.
</P>
<P>
   For days, officials have reported that large groups of refugees
were making their way toward the border with Kosovo. Before the
NATO air strikes began, the border had been nearly closed by
Serbian officials eager to staunch the flow of guns from Albania to
separatist guerillas in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Western aid workers said Monday they had lost count of the
number of refugees pouring in at a rate of maybe 4,000 an hour. The
isolated Albanian mountain village of Kukes was turning into a way
station where refugees were placed on buses destined for processing
centers elsewhere in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the refugees are arriving in automobiles and in farm
wagons drawn by tractors.
</P>
<P>
   Relief workers said the refugees were being stripped of their
documents by the Serbs. Ethnic Albanians arriving by car said the
Serbs took their license plates and car documents.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Prime Minister Ilir Meta told the BBC most of the
refugees were women, children and the elderly, many of them
exhausted and in a state of shock.
</P>
<P>
   Very few men of military age were seen among the refugees,
perhaps because the men have either gone into hiding or have joined
in the fight against the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are saying incredible things,'' Meta said. ``They have
been forced from their homes and their homes have been burned. The
Serbian army and police told them the only hope of saving their
lives was to enter Albania.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the refugees were crossing at Morina, on the Serbian
side, near Kukes.
</P>
<P>
   More than 1,000 ethnic Albanian refugees from Kosovo crossed the
border to Macedonia on Monday, aid officials said. A group of men
walking down the road near the town of Jegunovce near the
Kosovo-Macedonian border told of being forced from their homes by
masked Serb thugs.
</P>
<P>
   Many of their houses were looted and burned, the men said.
</P>
<P>
   The men and women were separated and sent on foot toward the
Macedonian border. One man who only would give his first name,
Fatmir, said he and the other men had walked more than 20 miles
over rugged mountains to escape from Kosovo. ``They said get out or
we will shoot you,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm afraid for him,'' he said, pointing to his 16-year-old son
Zafer. He said another 200 men were still in the woods on the
Kosovo side of the border, afraid to cross.
</P>
<P>
   He said he had not seen his wife, who was driving their tractor
out, since he took to the road. She is with his 13-year-old
daughter and 8-year-old son.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their personal catastrophes, none of the men said he
opposed the NATO campaign. Sulewmani, 53, expressed gratitude for
the attacks. ``NATO is good,'' he said. ``There was no other
method. They must keep going until all is finished.''
</P>
<P>
   The refugee wave was so dense that it swamped the border
crossing at Morina because Yugoslav guards could not handle the
masses on their side of the border. Yugoslavia closed the border
crossing for nearly three hours Monday because the exodus.
</P>
<P>
   The Albanian Parliament convened for a crisis session Monday,
and the government ordered all private companies to make minivans,
buses or other transport vehicles available immediately and send
them up to Kukes to help distribute refugees around the country.
The government already had sent 300 buses to pick up the refugees
but determined that this was inadequate.

Atkinson's patrol car banged to a stop, someone left a small Bible.
It is taped open to the Book of John, with the following passage
highlighted in yellow:
</P>
<P>
   ``The greatest love a person can have for his friends is to give
his life for them.''
</P>
<P>
   The tiny book is attached to a piece of paper, on which is
printed in big green letters, ``Having not met most of us living
here, you have shown you are our friend.''
</P>
<P>
   The Good Book must have been left here by one of the early
visitors to this maze-like industrial park west of the freeway and
north of Thomas Road. By Monday morning, the Bible had almost been
completely covered over with roses and carnations and daisies and
irises and lilies.
</P>
<P>
   Attached to one bouquet is a note reading, ``To the family and
friends of Officer Atkinson. So sorry to hear of your loss. My
thoughts and prayers will be with your always. Here is a small gift
from a Marine mom whose son came home from Desert Storm.''
</P>
<P>
   Atkinson's reserve unit served in the war with Iraq, where
battle lines were more clearly defined.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to see why the punks with the guns pulled into this
place when they noticed Atkinson tailing them Friday afternoon.
Narrow ribbons of asphalt criss-cross between low, stark buildings.
A car can disappear quickly around a corner, which is what
happened, police believe, to Officer Atkinson.
</P>
<P>
   They say 17-year-old Felipe Petrona-Cabanas turned up 30th
Avenue off of Catalina, stopped, and waited for the 27-year-old
officer, a husband and father of a 6-month-old, to turn the corner.
</P>
<P>
   He was shot in the head and died, striking the power pole just
north of Barry Metals, next to a pair of feathery cassia bushes. On
Monday, men loading industrial-sized barrels onto trucks watched
their street fill with strangers.
</P>
<P>
   KTAR's mobile radio studio was parked across the street. The
voice of host Pat McMahon mixed with the noise of cars and trucks
and forklifts.
</P>
<P>
   Holly Kirkham drove down from Glendale with her two children,
2-year-old Deanna and 9-month-old Scott.
</P>
<P>
   Deanna walked through the ring of orange traffic cones
surrounding the makeshift memorial. There were so many pretty
flowers for a girl to see, and she spotted a stuffed bunny, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just wanted to pay our respects,'' Holly said, looking down
at her daughter and saying, ``Put the bear down.''
</P>
<P>
   Deanna carried a small stuffed Panda that her mom wanted to
leave for Atkinson's infant son. It was hard for Deanna to let it
go, however. She cried. She couldn't understand what was going on
here. No one could explain it.
</P>
<P>
   Just as no one can explain those who (begin ital) haven't (end
ital ) staged high-profile visits to 30th Avenue and Catalina. That
group identified in the media as ``political, religious and civic
leaders,'' which includes the Rev. Oscar Tillman, Councilwoman Mary
Rose Wilcox, Rudy Buchanan Sr. They loudly seem to join every
protest against the police.
</P>
<P>
   Was Atkinson any less a victim?
</P>
<P>
   One card left among the flowers read, ``From an x-con many times
over who finally learned his lesson 15 years ago. May you be with
the Lord forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Another read, ``We'll miss you brother &AMP; friend _ 82B Squad.''
</P>
<P>
   There's a large homemade cross in the ground with Atkinson's
name on it. And several smaller crosses, one made of palm fronds
and pierced through with a Drug Enforcement Agency pin.
</P>
<P>
   And homemade condolence cards taped to the pole, with pens
attached by string so visitors can sign them.
</P>
<P>
   It'll be this way for awhile.
</P>
<P>
   Then, slowly, everything will disappear again among the ribbon
of blacktop within the small maze north of Thomas Road, which is
inside the larger maze of metropolitan Phoenix, which already has
too many places where homemade crosses once marked the final
resting place of a cop. &QL;

   AVIANO, Italy _ The American pilots flying the attacks on
Yugoslavia exchange few words, but probably no one reads their
moods and fears more closely than a 32-year-old Air Force staff
sergeant from Thorntown, Ind.
</P>
<P>
   For the last five nights, the sergeant, who will identify
himself only as Dave, has hunched in what he calls ``The Black
Hole,'' the windowless bay of a Lockheed EC-130E
command-and-control aircraft crammed with electronic equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Circling in the dark skies over Yugoslavia, he helps to herd,
like a hen with her chicks, the NATO warplanes flying their sorties
and links them by radio with NATO's ground command in Vicenza, an
hour's drive south of here. When trouble comes, the sergeant says,
it rings first in the pace of the pilots' words and the timbre of
their voices.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know if the tempo has been speeded up by the voice tone,''
he said. ``It's a very real environment, and you can hear it.''
</P>
<P>
   Meeting reporters on the tarmac, he and fellow crew members
talked of Serbian efforts to jam their equipment, of the adrenaline
charge they experienced when Serbian weapons brought down an Air
Force F-117A stealth fighter on Saturday, and of the boost to
morale when a joint rescue effort retrieved the pilot unharmed
hours later.
</P>
<P>
   NATO is fiercely shielding the identity of crews flying over
Yugoslavia, to protect them in case of capture, so no family names
were disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that they shot a 117 down shows they are not
quitting,'' a major named Tim, 43, said of the Serbian defenders.
The major, from Pomfret, Conn., commands the 16 crew members in the
EC-130E's black hole.
</P>
<P>
   The fighter pilots, the major went on, talk about going ``in
country'' or ``downtown'' when they swoop into heavily defended
areas, and then usually they fall silent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Believe it or not,'' he said, ``they don't talk very much.
They could drive in, and all the way out, without saying a thing.''
He paused, for emphasis, and added, ``And that's the preferred
way.''
</P>
<P>
   The plane is older than most crew members, who are mainly in
their 20s and 30s. It was built in Marietta, Ga., in 1962, and a
plaque in the cockpit notes that it was one of two that flew into
Iran in 1980 in a failed attempt to bring out the American hostages
in Teheran.
</P>
<P>
   It is one of three from the 42nd Airborne Command and Control
Squadron that have been deployed, with 100 fliers and ground crew
members, to Aviano since 1995 from Davis Monthan Air Force Base in
Tucson, Ariz., to patrol the skies over Bosnia, and now for the
attacks on Yugoslavia. Nicknamed ``Mad Dawg'' by the crew, it also
served in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   A staff sergeant from Heavener, Okla., Connie, 27, one of two
radio operators aboard the plane, was aloft on Saturday when the
stealth fighter went down.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we heard him do a Mayday and he was going down,'' she
recalled, tension tightening her voice, ``we were all worried about
him, and then we went into our job mode.''
</P>
<P>
   Crews fly 12-hour shifts, and she was still flying hours later
when news came that the pilot had been snatched from Serbian
territory, thanks in part to the EC-130E's communication links.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our whole plane erupted,'' she said, now smiling broadly.
``The excitement inside was deafening.''
</P>
<P>
   American military forces have seen little such combat since the
1991 Persian Gulf War, and for most crew members it is their first
experience of real danger.
</P>
<P>
   But a captain from Pennsylvania, Dave, who is the EC-130E's
pilot, emphasized that there was ``absolutely no complacency.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Every threat is a danger,'' said the captain, a pilot for five
years, ``and there is a high level of danger every night. Like they
say, we're paid to go out; we're not paid to come back in.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, in a slow, deliberate voice, ``Of course, everyone
wants to come back.''
</P>
<P>
   While the stealth pilot was on the ground, the captain, who was
not in the air that night, remained ``glued to the TV set.'' The
quick rescue, he said, was a ``big morale booster.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes it all the more easy to get up the next day and
perform the mission you're in,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He and his crew talked of their pride in being here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a real honor,'' he said. He paused, reflected and
added: ``It's unfortunate that things like this happen. But we're
happy to be able to do something about it. And we're happy to be on
this side.''

MILOSEVIC TRYING FOR SERB-ONLY ENCLAVE, NATO SAYS

   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ NATO officials said Monday that Slobodan
Milosevic's military campaign against the ethnic Albanians in
Kosovo was aimed at establishing a Serb-only enclave in the
province to keep after the fighting ends.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the impression that there is a campaign under way to
ethnically re-engineer the inside of Kosovo, to achieve a solution
more acceptable to him,'' said the chief spokesman for NATO, Jamie
Shea.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to suggestions that the allied bombing had set off
the offensive and caused additional civilian casualties instead of
preventing them, military and civilian officials here said the
Serbs had carefully built up the forces to launch the offensive
over six months.
</P>
<P>
   Serbian military and police units began driving Albanian
civilians out of towns and villages the day that the peace talks in
France were suspended in late February, the officials said, and
began attacking over large areas of the province in force two weeks
ago, when the talks were called off in failure.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a spontaneous outbreak following NATO's actions,''
Shea said.
</P>
<P>
   A European diplomat said the geographical pattern of the attacks
in Kosovo suggested that Milosevic's police officers and troops
were trying to drive out the ethnic Albanians from lands once
inhabited by Serbs in the north and center of the province.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are ancient Serb monasteries in the center of the
province and industrial development in the north that the Serbs
apparently want to stake permanent claim to,'' the diplomat said.
He speculated that if Milosevic ever did bow to allied demands,
stop the fighting and agree to resume peace talks on a plan for
autonomy for the Albanians, he could claim that the ``ethnically
cleansed'' territory should stay Serbian, no matter what.
</P>
<P>
   The tactic is similar to the one that the allies used in Bosnia
in the war that ended in 1995. Soldiers of one ethnic group drove
people descended from other ethnic origins out of their houses and
then burned the houses to make sure that the refugees would not try
to return. In the Serbian part of Bosnia where that occurred, only
ethnic Serbs stayed or were later resettled in such places to lay
claim to them as Serbian territory.
</P>
<P>
   The allies said Monday that nine villages had been reported set
afire west of Pristina, north and south of the road to Klina, in
the last 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, a spokesman for the allied military commander, Gen.
Wesley Clark, said that ``reliable sources'' had reported that
Fehmi Agami, an adviser to the ethnic Albanian leader, Ibrahim
Rugova, was executed on Sunday. Four other prominent Albanian
leaders, including Baton Haxhiv, were also reportedly executed,
said the military spokesman, Air Commodore David Wilby.
</P>
<P>
   Two regions where allied officials said ``ethnic cleansing'' had
been most intense for two weeks were west and south of Kosovo
Field, where the Serbs were defeated by a Turkish force in 1389 and
gave rise to a powerful and defining historical myth of Serb
martyrdom.
</P>
<P>
   Western officials said Monday that the Serbs had driven 280,000
people from their houses in Kosovo. Large regions to the west and
southwest of the provincial capital, Pristina, in an area roughly
bounded by Djakovica, Malisevo, Urosevac and Prizren, almost to the
Albanian border, and smaller areas between the cities of Klina and
Pec, around Srbica and Glogovac, and between Kosovska Mitrovica and
Podujevo to the north of Pristina, were ``areas of ethnic
cleansing,'' the alliance said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   On Sunday night, officials said, allied warplanes went after a
headquarters that was directing the largest operations and blasted
the internal police headquarters in Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking for the allied military command, which said Monday that
it was intensifying the bombing of the Serbian military and police
headquarters that ordered the attacks, and going after tank and
artillery units in Kosovo around the clock, Wilby said Milosevic
was showing a ``siege mentality.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He believes he can realign his ethnic problems in one week and
that NATO unity will crack in that same period,'' Wilby said.
``Helicopters are being used against the civilian population.
Paramilitaries are entering towns and terrorizing the people,
followed by military and police, who cynically give people leaflets
saying it's safe to leave their homes.''
</P>
<P>
   Refugees were being systematically driven toward Albania, Shea
said, with 60,000 seeking shelter in that impoverished country.
Many refugees, he said, had been forced to surrender identification
papers and passports.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost as if they were being declared nonpersons, making
re-entry into Kosovo that much more difficult,'' he said. ``Whole
towns and cities, including the old center of Pec, have been
totally destroyed.''
</P>
<P>
   A European Union official who deals with refugee problems, Emma
Bonino, conferred with the secretary-general of NATO, Javier
Solana, on Monday and said afterward that it looked as if 80,000 to
100,000 people might be pushed into Albania.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a human tragedy that I would like to underline has
been going on for many years, and in the last year in particular,''
Ms. Bonino said. ``Now we are faced with a new phase of the same
ongoing tragedy and a new phase in the same long-term strategy of
repression.''

KOSOVO GROUND ATTACK WOULD REQUIRE THOUSANDS OF TROOPS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ If NATO ground forces are ordered to fight Yugoslav
leader Slobodan Milosevic's drive to kill or expel ethnic Albanians
in Kosovo, experts said Monday that 100,000 to 200,000 troops, many
of them American, would be needed for the mission.
</P>
<P>
   Retired Army Maj. Gen. Edward Atkeson said NATO military
planners likely would need a ground combat force with at least a
3-to-1 numerical advantage over the Yugolsavs, or about 120,000 to
150,000 troops.
</P>
<P>
   Such a force would require tanks and fast-moving light infantry,
said Atkeson, a senior fellow at the Institute of Land Warfare in
Arlington, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the soldiers likely would come from the United States,
Britain and France, because they have the best-trained ground
forces with the most advanced weaponry, Atkeson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would take a long time to build up a force like that, a
month at least,'' Atkeson said, adding that much of the force would
have to be shipped in.
</P>
<P>
   The force would require a nearby staging area, probably in
Macedonia, he added. But using Macedonia as a launch pad for a
ground attack could exacerbate simmering tensions between ethic
Serbs and Albanians in the southeast European nation, Atkeson said.
</P>
<P>
   Macedonia was a former republic of Yugoslavia that gained
independence in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Soldiers from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization would face
a formidable force in Kosovo _ about 40,000 Yugoslav troops, 16,500
police, 300 Soviet-built tanks, 700 artillery pieces and 700
armored vehicles. In addition, there are about 80,000 soldiers,
1,200 tanks and 1,400 artillery pieces scattered throughout
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Serbia is the dominant republic in Yugoslavia. Kosovo is a
province of Serbia that is dominated by ethnic Albanians who are
under siege. Six days of punishing NATO air raids have failed to
bring Milosevic to the peace table to sign a treaty with the
Albanian population in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, pressure is building for mounting a NATO ground
attack.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Army Gen. Henry Shelton, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs
of Staff, said over the weekend that while NATO currently has no
plans to fight a ground war in Kosovo, military officials last year
determined that up to ``hundreds of thousands'' of troops might be
required in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., urged the Clinton administration and
NATO not to rule out sending soldiers to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have intervened and we must now decide what actions are
necessary to succeed,'' McCain said. ``We are in it. Now we must
win it.''
</P>
<P>
   Retired Army Lt. Col. Ralph Peters, one of the Army's leading
strategic thinkers until his retirement last year, told CNN Monday
that a ground attack would require a minimum of 40,000 to 50,000
NATO troops plus another 50,000 reinforcements.
</P>
<P>
   Retired Navy Adm. Leighton Smith, the commander of a NATO air
attack against the Serbian nationalists in neighboring Bosnia in
1995, said the number of ground forces would depend on the breadth
of the mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are trying to establish a safe area for refugees,
that's one thing,'' Smith said. ``If you are trying to expel the
Serbs from Kosovo, you will need an enormously larger force.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But we better be prepared to take all of Kosovo if the
situation turns south on us. We can never lose sight of the worst
case,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Haas, a senior member of the National Security Council
during the Bush administration, said Monday that 100,000 troops
would be required to occupy a portion of Kosovo to create a ``large
humanitarian zone'' for refugees free of the Yugoslav military.
</P>
<P>
   Haas said that any NATO force forcibly entering Kosovo would
need to be armed with some of the U.S. Army's most sophisticated
weapons, such as M1A1 tanks that saw service in the 1991 Persian
Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the troops could be pulled from a force of 30,000 NATO
soldiers currently enforcing a peace treaty in Bosnia. But
transferring the soldiers could have a downside effect by
destabilizing Bosnia, where a fragile peace is taking hold, Haas
said.

<P>
   Other NATO troops currently in the region include about 12,000
soldiers _ 400 Americans _ in Macedonia. They currently are
training for entry into Kosovo as part of a peace settlement, but
not as a battle force.

CLINTON FACES PRESSURE TO EXPAND MISSION IN YUGOSLAVIA  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 News Analysis  
 By STEWART M. POWELL  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton, stung by combat losses when he
expanded the mission of U.S. troops in Somalia in 1993, appears to
be resisting mounting pressure to insert U.S.-led ground forces
into Kosovo to halt Yugoslav reprisals against ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Aides insisted Monday that the president will not permit
so-called ``mission creep,'' that is, changes and additions to
military goals, to occur in the current allied effort in the
Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   Such changes will not be needed, they contended, because
prolonged air attacks will destroy enough Serbian armed forces to
persuade Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to halt the
murderous ``ethnic cleansing'' of Kosovo that has sent tens of
thousands of frightened refugees streaming into neighboring
nations.
</P>
<P>
   White House Press Secretary Joe Lockhart reiterated Monday that
the Clinton administration has ``no intention'' of dispatching
ground forces into Kosovo in a hostile environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president, the military leadership of this country, NATO,
the political leaders of NATO, believe we can accomplish our
military objectives through the air campaign that's ongoing,''
Lockhart explained, adding: ``We have no intention of deploying
ground troops.''
</P>
<P>
   But Key Republican senators _ Armed Services Committee Chairman
John Warner of Virginia and John McCain of Arizona, a GOP
presidential candidate _ have urged Clinton to consider deploying
troops. McCain said Sunday that the threat of ground forces may
help persuade Milosevic to yield.
</P>
<P>
   The difficulty of defeating the marauding Yugoslav assassination
squads in Kosovo with air power alone has also prompted some
administration officials to tinker with their descriptions of U.S.
policies.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, last Thursday National Security Adviser Samuel
``Sandy'' Berger said, ``We do not have, as the president
indicated, an intention to put ground forces in Kosovo in a combat
situation. If some have suggested that we go further than (bombing)
and put an American or NATO ground military force into the region
to invade the region, that is something we do not intend to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet in a Sunday TV interview Gen. Henry Shelton, chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff, seemed to soften that formulation by saying,
``At this point in time, there are no plans per se to introduce
ground troops.''
</P>
<P>
   Such comments suggested to some experts that the administration
is giving itself some room to shift gears.
</P>
<P>
   William J. Taylor Jr., director of political military studies at
the Center for Strategic and International Studies here, predicted
Monday that ``the mission is changing. We are going in with ground
troops. It's only a question of when.''
</P>
<P>
   Retired Air Force Lt. Gen. George Harrison said the introduction
of ground troops is only a matter of time if the operation is to be
``satisfactorily completed.''
</P>
<P>
   Ivo Daalder, a former Clinton administration adviser in the
National Security Council, says he thinks the president will opt
for ground troops but added that their rescue operation may come
``too late'' to help the imperiled Kosovar Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Contingency plans prepared last fall by the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization (NATO) estimated that the allies would need
150,000 to 200,000 ground troops to subdue defiant Serbian forces
if a peace settlement could not be reached.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs have long had a reputation as tough guerrilla
warriors. During World War II Adolf Hitler deployed 10 divisions
with 250,000 crack Nazi soldiers to Yugoslavia in a fruitless
effort to subdue the anti-German Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has already agreed in principle to dispatch 4,000
American troops to Kosovo. But they would enter only as part of a
28,000-member allied force that would implement the first phase of
a negotiated peace agreement between the Yugoslav Serbs, who are
Eastern Orthodox Christians, and the rebellious ethnic Albanian
Kosovars, who are Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic's refusal to negotiate a peace agreement triggered the
allied bombing campaign that began last Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials vowed then that the goal was to bomb
Milosevic to the bargaining table and to limit his ability to kill
or expel the Kosovars. They were vague about any subsequent phase
in the mission.
</P>
<P>
   But over the weekend they acknowledged that the allied bombing
campaign had expanded from hitting strategic air-defense targets to
a second phase of attacks on Yugoslav ground troops, 300 tanks in
or near Kosovo and 40,000 Yugoslav troops that had massed on
Kosovo's borders last week.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the officials avoided offering any public rationale that
might justify ``mission creep''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart, for example, refused Monday to publicly label the
Yugoslav reprisals against the ethnic Albanians as ``genocide.'' He
also rejected critics' claims that the allied bombing had provoked
the escalated Yugoslav attacks on Kosovo's Albanian civilians.
</P>
<P>
   And he rejected suggestions by some senators that the United
States should change its objectives by arming the ethnic Albanian
guerrilla organization, the Kosovo Liberation Army, which seeks
independence for Kosovo.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE -- OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   At the start of his presidency Clinton had a disastrous
experience in Somalia with ``mission creep'' when he redefined the
reason U.S. troops were there.
</P>
<P>
   In December 1992 outgoing President George Bush had launched a
U.S.-led United Nations humanitarian relief effort in war-torn
Somalia to stem starvation. Two months after gunmen for a defiant
Somali warlord, Mohammed Farah Aidid, ambushed some U.N. troops in
June, 1993, killing 24 Pakistani soldiers and wounding another 54
Pakistani troops, Clinton dispatched 400 elite Army Rangers to the
east African nation, saying their goal was to capture Aidid and
subdue his warriors.
</P>
<P>
   That October, in a raid gone wrong, 18 elite Army Rangers were
killed and more than 70 wounded following a 16-hour fire-fight with
the Somalis in the back alleys of Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
   After Clinton's mission failed to capture Aidid, the president
ordered 15,000 additional U.S. reinforcements to Somalia to aid in
the withdrawal of all U.S. forces there.

TROOPS GROWS

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Despite the humanitarian crisis deepening in Kosovo
after nearly a week of NATO bombing, American and NATO officials
continued Monday to reject the option of sending ground troops to
fight in the Balkans, even as a growing number of military experts
questioned the effectiveness of an air war against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no magic military bullet here,'' Defense Department
spokesman Kenneth Bacon said Monday when questions arose at the
Pentagon about whether ground forces were needed to stop allied
officials what say is ``genocide'' being waged by Serbian troops
against ethnic Albanians who are fleeing Kosovo by the thousands.
</P>
<P>
   Even if NATO countries decided immediately to send in ground
forces to prevent further atrocities in Kosovo, ``they would not be
there tomorrow,'' Bacon added. ``It would take a long while . . . a
matter of weeks or more than a month before these troops were on
the ground doing a job.''
</P>
<P>
   According to NATO estimates, Yugoslavian President Slobodan
Milosevic has more than 40,000 Serbian troops in Kosovo, along with
400 tanks, 300 armored personnel carriers and 400 artillery pieces.
In addition, there are only 14 roads into Kosovo, many of them
mined.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one would mount a light attack against this,'' Bacon said.
``It would have to be an extremely heavy and determined attack. It
would take time to organize such an attack.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, in the Persian Gulf War, the attack by NATO ground
troops was preceded by a 40-day air campaign. But Iraqi troops
suffered only 25 percent autorotation during that 40-day bombing
mission, according to Air Force reports following the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   NATO planners have estimated that between 200,000 and 300,000
soldiers would be needed in a ground war against Serbian forces in
Kosovo, Yugoslavia's southernmost province.
</P>
<P>
   Although Congress has endorsed the NATO air strikes that began
last Wednesday, there is little support for sending U.S. soldiers
into battle in Kosovo. Consequently, President Clinton has asserted
from the beginning of the air strikes on Yugoslavia that he has no
intentions of sending American soldiers to fight a ground war in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   And as thousands of ethnic Albanians streamed out of Kosovo on
Monday with tales of horror, White House spokesman Joe Lockhart
insisted that the new phase of low-altitude NATO bombing of Serbian
positions in Kosovo would succeed in forcing Milosevic back to
peace talks to end the strife between Serbs and ethnic Albanians in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president, the military leadership of this country, NATO,
the political leaders of NATO believe we can accomplish our
military objectives through the air campaign that's ongoing,''
Lockhart said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   But Richard Haas, a former national security adviser in the Bush
administration and now director of foreign policy studies at the
Brookings Institution, suggested NATO must now consider putting
ground troops in Kosovo. ``At this point, I think the costs of not
escalating are greater than the risks of escalating,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Ivo Daalder (CQ both), a former Clinton administration
national security staff member, said that without the intervention
of NATO ground troops in Kosovo, ``there will be nothing left by
the time we have won the war'' with a long bombing campaign against
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Michael O'Hanlon, a lecturer at Georgetown University and
Columbia University and an expert on the impact of technology on
warfare, noted that the kind of bombing NATO is currently
conducting is ineffective against mortars, rifles and anti-tank
guns -- ``the weapons that are extremely effective in ethnic
cleansing.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Hanlon also questioned whether the NATO air strikes could
destroy enough Serbian armor to equalize the battlefield to allow
the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) to resume their opposition to the
Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could take a month to do that,'' he said. ``In the
meantime, there may not be a Kosovo to save.''

 &HT;    Reaching new heights: Dow Jones finally closes above 10,000
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average finally closed above 10,000 on
Monday after trading above that historic benchmark three times
recently, only to fall back.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow's 1.9 percent gain to a new high was part of a
broad-based increase in market prices that lifted all major stock
indexes at least 1.5 percent (the Russell 2000 small stock index)
to as much as 3 percent (the technology loaded NASDAQ composite).
</P>
<P>
   The 103-year-old index first topped the 10,000 mark on March 16
and again on the 18th and 19th before dropping back
</P>
<P>
   each time. Such buying resistance at psychologically important
levels is not unusual, and analysts never doubted that the Dow
would eventually close above 10,000.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts attributed the final push to ``window dressing,'' a
stock buying phenomenon that occurs at the end of each quarter.
Mutual fund and other money managers typically load up on
high-performance blue chip stocks so their portfolios will look
good to clients and investors.
</P>
<P>
   Big gainers included General Electric, whose shares rose $4.18
3/4 to $112; IBM, $5.18 3/4 to $177.56 1/4; Wal-Mart Stores, $3.43
3/4 to $95, and J.P. Morgan, $2.93 3/4 to $125.81 1/4.
</P>
<P>
   ``Monday's move was worth about three trade days of normal
volatility, so it wouldn't be a surprise to see prices move much
less rapidly over the next few sessions,'' said Standard &AMP; Poor's
market analyst Paul Cherney.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow's 10,000 achievement didn't quell the concern of some
analysts that the market's strength is still limited to too few
stocks, leaving too many others behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``While euphoria over Dow 10,000 could send the market higher
short term, the performance disparity between the largest companies
and the rest of the market argues for limited upside potential,''
said Bruce Bittles, market strategist for J.C. Bradford &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the military action in Yugoslavia has added a new element
of uncertainty to the market. While the bombing has not restrained
buying so far, Robinson-Humphrey strategist Robert S. Robbins said
the bombing has its risks, including a possible broadening of the
conflict to other Balkan states.
</P>
<P>
   Bond selling pushed the 30-year Treasury yield to its fourth
straight gain ahead of today's meeting of the Federal Reserve
policy making committee. Analysts said bond traders are still
worried the Fed will raise interest rates because of the economy's
strength.

 &HT;    Rambling virus spurs paranoia about Net
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ As Melissa continued her relatively harmless but
irritating ramble across the globe Monday, the forces of Internet
order mobilized against her.
</P>
<P>
   The computer virus dubbed Melissa hit hundreds of thousands of
computers that use Microsoft Word software, threatening to clog
e-mail servers as it cloned itself and sent copies to 50 names
pulled off the address books of unwitting recipients.
</P>
<P>
   Melissa did not destroy computer hard drives or freeze PCs, so
damage seemed limited to a handful of places where the surge of
copied e-mail overwhelmed servers temporarily.
</P>
<P>
   But Melissa did trigger paranoia about the vulnerabilities of
the world's increasingly networked economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Melissa is written so that it's easy for people to create
derivatives that are malicious,'' said Chris Rouland, of
Atlanta-based Internet Security Systems. ``The bar has been
lowered.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, what might have been a knock-off of Melissa appeared
Monday, aiming at users of Excel software.
</P>
<P>
   Melissa should not be dismissed as harmless, not in an age when
business depends on quick communication, said Rouland, who directs
an ISS team that hunts for security risks. ``In many companies,
e-mail is mission-critical.''
</P>
<P>
   ISS makes software to protect companies from hackers who want
access to confidential information or to tamper with company data.
ISS also has software that will help a company assess its
vulnerability to attack, including by virus.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of other software companies used the opportunity offered
by Melissa to issue press releases Monday touting their products to
defend against viruses.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the sudden spotlight on Melissa, viruses and virus
scares have become routine on the Net. A new virus rises into the
news only when it is widely circulated or especially destructive.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Smets, president of BellSouth's Internet unit, said the
company sees troublesome viruses every couple of months. ``Some are
just pains in the neck. Others could be catastrophic. It's
certainly an issue to be contended with.''
</P>
<P>
   The danger in Melissa was its ability to clone itself 50 times
over each time a recipient clicked on the attachment that came with
it. With that kind of exponential growth, a few generations could
produce massive numbers of e-mails and overload a mail server.
</P>
<P>
   So when Melissa arrived Friday, BellSouth engineers started
tinkering with the company's software for stopping junk e-mail _
also known as ``spam'' _ and devised a screen that would catch
Melissa. The new software went onto BellSouth servers at 3 a.m.
Saturday, Smets said. ``If we had not introduced this plan of
attack, we'd be dealing with a much larger problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Viruses have been around for decades, although the proliferation
of the Net gives them ever-greater reach. Viruses with names like
Concept, Wazzu, Form and Jerusalem have raised concerns, spurred
anti-virus efforts and disappeared. But Melissa deserved special
attention, because it was the first to efficiently use e-mail in
spreading itself, said Steve White, senior manager of anti-virus
research at IBM.
</P>
<P>
   White said it is hard to say exactly what Melissa's creator had
in mind. Perhaps the goal was to annoy a particular target or
perhaps to gain the satisfaction of causing a worldwide nuisance.
It might even have been an accident caused by an overconfident
engineer playing with code.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, virus writers are not the same people as those trying
to tap into Pentagon computers or rewrite the messages on the
Coca-Cola Web site. And there are only a few hundred people in the
world writing virus code _ ``No more than are writing graffitti in
a major city,'' White said.
</P>
<P>
   Like many viruses, Melissa was named by the people who are
trying to smother it. But in conferring the moniker, anti-virus
forces took a cue from Melissa's creator, who wrote what seems to
be the name Melissa into the virus's code.
</P>
<P>
   White has been at the forefront of anti-virus efforts since a
1987 virus, coined Christma Exec, took control of his computer,
tapped out characters in the shape of a pine tree and then wrote
``Merry Christmas.'' That virus clogged IBM's e-mail system.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, computer infections have continued to waft through
cyberspace, and anti-virus software has ballooned into a $1
billion-a-year business. The Internet has also expanded into a
multibillion-dollar medium carrying business transactions, as well
as personal messages.
</P>
<P>
   IBM is now involved with Norton, which makes anti-virus
software, in an effort to write an ``immune system'' that can be
delivered to computers via the Internet at the moment that a virus
strikes.
</P>
<P>
   And while Melissa proved an annoyance, White said the infection
only proves that the system is basically healthy. Business went on,
even as Internet companies tried to stomp out the virus and
educated consumers deleted the message that carried the virus.
</P>
<P>
   MindSpring Enterprises, the region's largest Internet service
provider, reported no significant change in the number of e-mails
it carried Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always an interesting balance, to balance the functions
that are terribly useful with the risks,'' White said. ``So far,
the world has found a pretty good balance.''

 &HT;    Taurus toned down for 2000
 &HT;    Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Four years ago, Ford took its best-selling Taurus to
the cutting edge of design.
</P>
<P>
   After losing the sales crown and suffering criticism for the
Taurus' looks, size and price, Ford is stepping back from the edge.
</P>
<P>
   The 2000 Taurus, unveiled today at the New York auto show,
stresses safety and comfort in a more-conservative-looking package.
The Taurus and its Mercury Sable twin, which will be unveiled
Thursday in California, are built in Hapeville, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   Ford officials said they were reacting to customers in the
latest redesign. What the customers said they wanted was more room,
a larger and more accessible trunk, new safety features _ and no
more ovals.
</P>
<P>
   The controversial oval shapes in the rear window and
audio/climate control pod are gone, replaced by rectilinear shapes.
And there are more cup holders, including ones that accept coffee
cups with handles or expand to hold large soft drinks. Also
available are power-adjustable pedals to enable short drivers to
sit father from the steering wheel and still reach the accelerator
and brake.
</P>
<P>
   ``They fixed the biggest problems,'' said Jim Hall, vice
president of industry analysis with AutoPacific in Detroit. The
1996-99 model, while actually bigger than the version it replaced,
looked smaller. ``In the upper-midsize car segment, people are
looking for size.''
</P>
<P>
   That model had less headroom; a smaller, hard-to-get-to trunk;
and a higher price than earlier models. The appearance also was
controversial.
</P>
<P>
   In the 2000 model, Hall said, Ford addressed those problems. The
new car has more rear-seat headroom despite being the same size.
The trunk is larger, easier to load and has hooks for grocery bags.
The price hasn't been set yet.
</P>
<P>
   And the looks, Hall said, are subjective. Some people liked the
distinctive ovals, while others did not.
</P>
<P>
   Ford has added a number of new safety features _ both standard
and optional _ to a vehicle that already has achieved top scores in
crash-test ratings, said David T. Marinaro, Ford's chief engineer
for Taurus and Sable.
</P>
<P>
   Among them are a restraint system that includes seat belt
sensors and pre-tensioners, two-stage air bags, a crash-severity
sensor and side air bags that protect both the head and chest.
</P>
<P>
   A child-friendly interior trunk release will be standard on all
new Ford vehicles, the company's engineers said, to decrease the
danger of a child getting trapped in a trunk. The T-shaped handle
glows in the dark so it can be seen in a closed trunk.
</P>
<P>
   The two 3.0-liter engines get horsepower boosts.
</P>
<P>
   The Mercury Sable will have ``brand differentiation, but it is
essentially the same car,'' said Ford spokesman John Jelinek.
</P>
<P>
   Early versions of the new vehicles already are being inserted on
the assembly lines at the Hapeville and Chicago plants. The new
cars likely will arrive in showrooms in October, later than most
2000 models.
</P>
<P>
   Ford plans to begin production in August with a gradual
switchover from the current models during the summer. No shutdowns,
other than the customary one in July, are planned. The two
Taurus/Sable plants had been closed for a week in February to help
trim inventory of the '99s.
</P>
<P>
   Ford officials insist they are not going to rejoin the race to
make the best-selling car in America, a title the Taurus lost two
years ago to the Toyota Camry.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Taurus is Ford's bread-and-butter car, analyst Hall
said, and ``the timing couldn't be better'' for a redesigned model.
</P>
<P>
   The only new competition in the segment is the Chevrolet Impala,
but Chevrolet doesn't have the plant capacity to build enough
vehicles to challenge the top sellers, Hall said. The Camry and
Honda Accord, which both had more sales than Taurus last year,
don't have any significant changes planned until 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Becoming No. 1 ``depends on how bad Ford wants it,'' Hall said.
``It's doable, but at a price.''
</P>
<P>
   Winning the sales race usually involves increased sales to
rental fleets and profit-cutting price incentives, Hall said. Both
tend to cheapen the brand name.
</P>
<P>
   What Ford appears to be doing instead is making the brand
stronger and better aligned with its market segment than it did
with the last redesign.

GERMAN'S NOVEL OF POST-WAR GUILT BECOMES A U.S. BEST SELLER 
</HEADLINE>
  (kd) 
 By DINITIA SMITH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``When I was 15, I got hepatitis.'' So begins Bernhard Schlink's
novel ``The Reader,'' about a German student, Michael, who
collapses on a sidewalk and is rescued by a woman more than twice
his age. The two begin an affair. The woman, Hanna, calls Michael
``jungchen'' (``kid'') and continually asks him to read to her.
Then suddenly she disappears.
</P>
<P>
   Years later, as a law student, Michael discovers that Hanna has
been charged with war crimes committed while she was a guard in a
slave-labor camp. And he realizes Hanna has another astonishing
secret. She is illiterate and so ashamed of it that she pleads
guilty to writing a damaging report that she could not have
written. Hanna is imprisoned, and Michael, a detached figure closed
off from his emotions, helps her from a distance, sending her tapes
of himself reading Homer and Chekhov.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Reader'' is a small, quiet, intellectual book that asks
big moral questions. It has a distinctly Mitteleuropean feel, an
air of allegory and moral meditation. Hardly a prescription for a
best seller.
</P>
<P>
   Yet ``The Reader,'' published in hardcover by Pantheon and in
paper by Vintage, was No. 1 on the New York Times paperback
best-seller list on Sunday for the second consecutive week. At
Amazon.com it is outselling even the Monica Lewinsky biography.
``The Reader'' has been translated into English by Carol Brown
Janeway from the original German and sold to Miramax for a film. To
top it all, ``The Reader'' has been chosen as the selection for
Oprah's Book Club.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Schlink flew to Chicago to meet Oprah Winfrey and
tape her show. ``I liked her very much,'' he said in a soft voice,
with a shy smile. ``She is so smart.''
</P>
<P>
   Schlink is a professor of constitutional law and the philosophy
of law at Humboldt University in Berlin. He is also a justice of
the Constitutional Law Court in Munster and has written treatises
on moral issues, including collective guilt. He is 54, a bearer of
what Germans call ``the second guilt'' of those who grew up in the
shadow of the complicity of their parents' generation in the
Holocaust. ``The theme of collective guilt, of what the first
generation did means for the second generation, has been on my mind
for a long, long time,'' Schlink said.
</P>
<P>
   Schlink's father, Edmund, was a professor of theology and a
member of the Confessing Church, an anti-Nazi group. His mother was
Swiss. In 1930 the government shut down his father's school, and he
became a minister in Bielefeld, in northern Germany, where Bernhard
was born. During the war the police harassed his father because of
his sermons, Schlink said, ``but he was not in danger of his
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Growing up in postwar Germany was ``a weird experience.'' It
was, Schlink said, as if the past's poisonous secrets were locked
away, hidden from children, ``and only the mother has the key.''
Occasionally there were glimpses of truth. ``One of my teachers,
whom I admired and to whom I owe my love of the English language,
was in the SS. We saw his tattoo. There were rumors he had done
something awful.''
</P>
<P>
   Schlink attended Freiburg University and received his legal
training at Heidelberg. A professor ``who I owe a lot to, who made
me aware of how fascinating law was,'' had written an anti-Semitic
book in the '30s: ``He jumped on the wagon.'' That professor's
explanation made little sense, Schlink said. ``He wanted to
strengthen the state against the party.''
</P>
<P>
   He gave a small smile and shrugged. ``Well, I mean, they all
built legends,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   During semester breaks in his student days, Schlink worked in a
factory with a Romanian of German descent who came from a family of
migrant workers. The man had joined the SS, but ``he just knew that
he had taken part in unforgivable things,'' Schlink said.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Despite the Nuremberg trials after the war, the truth of the
Holocaust did not really seem to seep into German public
consciousness until the late 1950s and early '60s, especially
during the Frankfurt trials of Auschwitz guards, Schlink said.
``Then interest turned to the political, military and industrial''
figures, he said. Students learned that ``many of our professors as
young men entered positions from which Jews had been thrown out or
driven to suicide.'' In some cases, they also discovered what their
parents had done.
</P>
<P>
   Schlink, who has been divorced ``for many years'' and has a son,
Jan, 27, has written three mystery novels with political and moral
themes. In 1987 he published a paper, ``Questions of Law, Guilt and
Future After the Third Reich.'' He searched first-century Germany
tribal law for precedents on collective guilt. When a person
committed murder, his tribe could expel him, Schlink said. ``Then,
they didn't have to deal with it. But if they kept him within their
solidarity, then the guilt fell on the whole tribe.''
</P>
<P>
   Germans, he said, ``by not expelling the perpetrators, by
keeping in, by accepting them as judges, administrators, professors
and politicians,'' share the guilt for their crimes. But the
problem for the second generation is that ``you can't expel your
parents,'' he said; therefore ``you are within that collective
guilt, too.''
</P>
<P>
   While he was a visiting professor in East Germany in 1990,
Schlink was flooded with childhood memories. East Germany reminded
him of the West in the '50s, he said, with ``the grayness,'' the
sense of impoverishment, and he began to write ``The Reader.'' It
was published in Germany in 1995. Reviews have for the most part
been highly favorable. In The New York Times, Richard Bernstein
called it ``arresting, philosophically elegant, morally complex.''
</P>
<P>
   But Cynthia Ozick had harsh words for the book in the March
issue of Commentary. She particularly took issue with the
illiteracy of Hanna, the war criminal. ``Germany before World War
II was known to have the most educated population in Europe, with
the highest standards of literacy,'' she wrote. In making Hanna
illiterate, Ms. Ozick said, ``the grotesquely atypical turns out to
be, in this work by a member of the shamed and remorseful second
generation, a means of exculpation.''
</P>
<P>
   Is Hanna's illiteracy a metaphor implying that Germans
perpetrated the Holocaust simply out of ignorance?
</P>
<P>
   ``I know education doesn't protect against committing crimes,''
Schlink said. Many Germans in units sent to kill Jews in occupied
territory were educated, he noted. ``It's much easier for an
intellectual to come up with a legend'' to delude others, or
themselves, he said. Hanna in her illiteracy stands naked in her
wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Hanna does a kind of penance. ``The book said she
was in prison, as in a convent,'' said Schlink. She learns to read.
But on the brink of release she kills herself, leaving her small
estate to the daughter of one of her Jewish victims. Does Schlink
believe Hanna paid the full price for her crimes? No, he said; her
suicide marks ``a last and final step in her withdrawal from the
outer world.''
</P>
<P>
   Forgiveness, said Schlink, can only come from those you have
wronged. ``You can't get forgiveness from someone you have
killed.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the hero, Michael, he is frozen inside, ``because he
never confronts her or his guilt, his entanglement'' in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``He kept himself from fully maturing, Schlink said. ``In a way
he really stayed jungchen,'' the boy Hanna had seduced.

 &HT;    Atlanta job machine to hum, report says
 &HT;    By Tammy Joyner
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The road to Atlanta's future is paved with jobs _ and
job seekers.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta will lead the country in job creation over the next 25
years with an estimated 1.8 million new positions, according to a
report released Monday by Newsweek magazine and Kaplan, a New
York-based careers and education firm.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix and Houston tied for second with 1.5 million jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The Careers 2000 guide identified health law, geriatric law,
physical therapy, venture capitalism, computer security, network
specialists and secondary schoolteachers as some of the hottest
careers.
</P>
<P>
   Being the No. 1 job center over the next quarter century carries
a price, and labor and economic experts wonder if Atlanta can
handle it.
</P>
<P>
   With transportation, water and school systems already stretched
to the breaking point, observers wonder how Atlanta will be able to
accommodate 2 million more workers, not to mention their families.
And with severe worker shortages expected to continue, where will
the workers come from?
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta has had low unemployment most of this decade, and
increasing home sales and construction and a steady influx of
residents have helped put the city at the top of the Careers 2000
list.
</P>
<P>
   University of Georgia economist Jeff Humphreys isn't convinced
Atlanta will reach that distinction because of the severe limits on
its transportation, water delivery and sewer treatment systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real challenge is transportation and infrastructure,''
Humphreys said. ``We can invest more in public infrastructure. If
we do that, then the estimates (of being No. 1) can be obtained.''
But being No. 1 might not be anything to brag about, Humphreys
said.
</P>
<P>
   Renters, retirees and people looking for a simpler, more rural
way of life see only higher taxes and more congestion ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this forecast is correct, Atlanta will stem from Bremen to
the west, Athens to the east, Macon to the south and approach
Chattanooga to the north,'' said Humphreys, who has been tracking
Atlanta's growth since 1989.
</P>
<P>
   The sprawl will force employers into the suburbs to be closer to
workers and ``there will be greater use of alternative
transportation,'' Humphreys said.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, such bragging rights will be a boon for
homeowners, worker-hungry small businesses and ambitious
careerists.
</P>
<P>
   State Labor Commissioner Michael Thurmond was pleased with
Atlanta's ranking but warned job growth isn't likely unless the
state has enough skilled workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Employers throughout Georgia, especially in the Atlanta area,
already face a shortage of skilled workers to fill their current
job openings,'' Thurmond said. ``And the situation will only worsen
unless we develop a long-range strategy to develop a skilled and
well-trained work force.''
</P>
<P>
   The state Labor Department projects the number of jobs in
Georgia will grow by 1 million by 2006. Roughly 700,000 of those
jobs will be in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   More than half of the new jobs will be in service industries and
about one in four will be in wholesale and retail trade. The
fastest-growing jobs include computer engineers, systems analysts,
electronic pagination system workers, physical therapists and
medical assistants.

STEVENS REPLACES McCARRON 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARCADIA, Calif. _ Santa Anita Derby week began Monday with a
switch of Hall of Fame jockeys as trainer Bob Baffert said Gary
Stevens will replace Chris McCarron aboard General Challenge in
Saturday's $750,000 race.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens was scheduled to be in Arkansas on Saturday to ride 1998
Kentucky Derby winner Real Quiet in the Oaklawn Handicap. But
Baffert withdrew Real Quiet from that race, citing dissatisfaction
with the colt's 122-pound assignment, three pounds more than Puerto
Madero.
</P>
<P>
   That decision freed Stevens, who is Baffert's No.1 jockey, to
ride in the Santa Anita Derby, which he has won six times.
</P>
<P>
   That move left McCarron, who has won the West's top Kentucky
Derby prep twice, without a mount. It seemed likely he would get
the long-vacant riding assignment on Baffert-trained Finder's Gold.
</P>
<P>
   Baffert's three Santa Anita Derby horses had 6-furlong workouts
Monday morning. General Challenge was clocked in 1:10, Prime Timber
in 1:11 3/5, Finder's Gold in 1:13.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Timber, the leading contender for the May 1 Kentucky
Derby, will be ridden again by David Flores. Also expected for the
1[-mile Santa Anita race: Desert Hero (Corey Nakatani), Capsized
(Alex Solis) and Honest Lady (Kent Desormeaux).

PEOPLE'S POET, DENYING CRIME, IS CONVICTED IN SOUTH AFRICA
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG _ Mzwakhe Mbuli, a musician and writer known as the
People's Poet of South Africa, was convicted of bank robbery
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The magistrate and his two assessors, who help him evaluate the
evidence, unanimously rejected Mbuli's claim that he had been
framed and concluded that he and two other men had used pistols and
a Russian hand grenade to rob a bank of $2,600 in a Pretoria suburb
on Oct. 28, 1997. Mbuli's lawyer said he expected a long prison
term.
</P>
<P>
   Mbuli, 39, became famous in the 1980s by declaiming his protest
poetry at the funerals of anti-apartheid activists killed by the
police. With his deep voice booming his grim lyrics over cheerful
township-jive Zulu guitar plucking, he became one of South Africa's
top recording artists, a regular at televised ceremonies and the
chief praise-singer at Nelson Mandela's 1994 inauguration.
</P>
<P>
   Since his arrest in October 1997, Mbuli has been held without
bail, mostly in Pretoria's maximum security prison. He sat
stone-faced Monday during the 4 1/2-hour reading of the
magistrate's decision. His wife broke down crying, as did many of
his supporters, but there were no outbursts of threats against the
magistrate, as there were in the trial's early days.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward Mbuli said to a radio reporter: ``I am still very much
innocent. In the environment of lies, the truth becomes a
stranger.''
</P>
<P>
   He is to be sentenced April 22. Mbuli said he would appeal.
</P>
<P>
   During his trial, Mbuli argued that he had been set up by
someone who called him offering information about a 1996 shooting
in which two men riddled his car with bullets as he cowered beneath
the dashboard. Told to go to a mall in the Johannesburg suburb of
Waverly, he took his licensed gun and two friends along. When he
arrived, he said, a man threw an envelope in the car and told him
to drive off. The police quickly stopped him, found that the
envelope was full of money and, he argued, planted other guns and a
hand grenade in the car.
</P>
<P>
   He said it might have been done because he had information about
drug smuggling and gunrunning by important figures in the African
National Congress and had tried to turn it over to civilian
officials who oversee the police. The magistrate issued no finding
on that.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials have kept their distance from Mbuli since
his arrest, but Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, Helen Suzman and many
musicians went to the court to show support.
</P>
<P>
   Mbuli's lawyers did demonstrate that the police had ignored
correct procedures for lineups. In addition, Mbuli, who is 6 feet 4
inches tall and a well-known figure to black South Africans, said
again Monday that it was hard to believe that no one in the bank
recognized him if, as the police contended, he robbed it unmasked.
</P>
<P>
   At his trial, Mbuli vacillated between days of animated denials
and days of tired, vague answers to prosecutors' questions,
especially about his claim that he was set up by someone protecting
important political officials. After the 1996 shooting, Mbuli
publicly accused drug dealers, KwaZulu/Natal warlords and rival
musicians of trying to kill him. Some musicians publicly fought
back, saying his wife's family might have done it.
</P>
<P>
   The two other men in Mbuli's car, Ben Masiso and Happy
Shikwambane, were convicted on the same charges Monday.

 &HT;    New York Times, Amazon.com make key strategic moves
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was a busy day for two of the Web's most popular sites, The
New York Times on America Online and Amazon.com. While the Times
was busy consolidating, Amazon was busy expanding its empire.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon.com, soldiering on in its never-ending quest to become
the Wal-Mart of the Web, announced plans to open an auction area
that will compete with eBay, the Web's most popular auction site.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon also announced plans to obtain a 50 percent stake in
Pets.com, the largest pet supply company on the Internet. ``This is
a marriage made in heaven and clearly positions us as the online
category leader,'' gushed Pets.com CEO Julie Wainwright in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   Pets.com sells everything from cat toys to ferret hammocks. For
the moment, Pets.com will remain a stand-alone site, although it
could very easily be incorporated into the main Amazon.com site,
which sells books, music, videos and gifts, along with toothpaste
and acne medicine from a previous acquisition, Drugstore.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are trying to become to commerce what Yahoo! is to
content,'' said Jupiter Communications digital commerce analyst Ken
Cassar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Amazon hasn't officially gone over to general merchant status
yet. They've got kind of a confusing business model. At the core
it's a retail business model _ they're still making most of their
money from selling products _ but they are looking for other
revenue streams as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Published reports say Amazon will aggressively market its
auction area within its retail space. For example, Beatles
memorabilia up for auction will be featured on Amazon's music
pages.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, Amazon has no plans to integrate Drugstore.com or
Pets.com into its ``one-click ordering'' system, which permits
repeat shoppers to order without having to fill out forms.
</P>
<P>
   Drugstore.com is currently linked off the Amazon.com start page,
which certainly drives traffic, but Cassar says access to the
``one-click'' database is vital for long-term success and will
happen eventually. A recent Jupiter consumer survey revealed more
than one-quarter of potential online shoppers abandon the online
ordering process because they don't like repeatedly filling out
order forms.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, The New York Times, a strong daily news presence on
America Online since June 9, 1994, told AOL readers the site will
be ``moving mostly to a World Wide Web format,'' according to a
March 26 online letter to readers from Editor Rich Meislin.
</P>
<P>
   Sometime in mid-April, the Times on AOL will mirror The New York
Times Web site (www.nytimes.com) rather than use AOL's proprietary
software to develop an entirely different product, according to
spokeswoman Lisa Carparelli.
</P>
<P>
   Carparelli says the Times' new format would allow advertisers to
use the same methods of targeting customers on AOL they currently
use on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will also provide advertisers with graphic capabilities
that were previously unavailable,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the industry has evolved, so has our relationship with
AOL,'' Carparelli said.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to offer only the Web-based version to AOL users
was probably inevitable. Currently, the Times maintains two
separate online departments, one for the Web and one for AOL. It
appears to be simple good business sense to cease what appears to
be a duplication of efforts.
</P>
<P>
   However, the new Web-based format probably spells the end of
many of the Times' unique AOL features such as its message boards,
weekly news and arts chats, and the entertainment and news
archives.
</P>
<P>
   The paper's Sunday magazine, previously an AOL exclusive, will
eventually move to the Web site. An internal memo went out this
week to Times free-lancers who monitor the message boards and chat
rooms describing the dismantling of the AOL services. The memo said
the Times would try to find new assignments for some of the
free-lancers. There was no word if any full-time jobs will be
eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   In his online message, Meislin told readers that AOL members
will still be able to access the Times for free after a one-time
registration. Web users have always been required to register,
while AOL members were not. One-year archives of news stories from
The Times with full articles and the paper's famous crossword
puzzle will be available to users for a nominal fee.

AVOID COMPUTER-TRANSMITTED VIRUSES BY PRACTICING SAFE E-MAILING 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  NOTE: ANALYSIS; ital indicators in copy 
 
By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c. 1999 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ The frenzied spread of the W97 Melissa virus that
began Friday and continued through Monday is the direct result of a
widely accepted _ yet very unsafe and very unwise _ business
computing habit: sending Microsoft Word documents as e-mail
attachments.
</P>
<P>
   It's a practice that has become more prevalent as Microsoft's
Office suite of productivity software becomes more ubiquitous.
Everyone has Word, right? So it must be okay to send information as
a Word document over the Internet, right?
</P>
<P>
   But computer users everywhere discovered, starting Friday
afternoon, that it's ITAL not END ITAL right. The fact that Word
documents can transmit computer viruses is just one reason why
those who use PCs should stop the practice immediately, and instead
send e-mail as text-only messages.
</P>
<P>
   The Melissa virus _ which technically is a form of destructive
programming known as a worm _ takes the form of a macro built into
a Word 97 or Word 2000 document. A macro is a series of commands
that causes the popular word processing software to perform
specific actions.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, the Melissa macro commands activate the address
book in either Microsoft's Outlook or Outlook Express e-mail
programs. It grabs the first 50 names in the address book and mails
a copy of a list of pornographic Web sites to those people.
</P>
<P>
   Even those computer users who practice safe computing were
fooled on Friday when the virus first appeared. That's because
Melissa appears to come from someone known to the recipient. The
macro inserts the name of the sender _ the person whose address
book was invaded _ into the subject field as part of the subject
line that begins ``Important message from ... '' That makes the
recipient more apt to trust the document and open it in Word.
</P>
<P>
   Macro viruses have been around for several years, ever since a
computer science professor created a benign one to prove it could
be done, and serve as a warning to PC users.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, macro viruses are now the most prevalent form of virus
in the wild, according to Symantec, which makes the popular Norton
AntiVirus software. And that's largely because of the practice of
sending Word documents via e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   There are other reasons not to send Word documents as
attachments.
</P>
<P>
   -- They can be quite large, particularly complex documents that
contain illustrations. For those who are receive e-mail via modem
connections, waiting for one of these to download can be
excruciating.
</P>
<P>
   -- Not everyone uses Word. Although Word has a grip on about 85
percent of the word-processing market, Corel's WordPerfect and
Lotus' WordPro also are popular. Those programs may not be able to
look at Word documents, depending on the version.
</P>
<P>
   -- Not everyone uses Microsoft Windows, the platform on which
Word 97 and Word 2000 run. At the Houston Chronicle, for example,
most of the editorial department runs on a Unix-based system.
</P>
<P>
   Unless you are sending a document to someone with whom you are
collaborating, there are very few good reasons for sending a Word
document simply to deliver information.
</P>
<P>
   Some people may want to preserve the fancy formatting they've
put into a document, but unless it contains tables or
illustrations, visual tricks usually don't add much to the content,
which is what's really important.
</P>
<P>
   Those who insist upon a glitzy look can always use HTML, or
HyperText Markup Language, which is the coding used to build Web
pages. Most modern e-mail programs can read HTML-based messages.
</P>
<P>
   But plain, simple text really is the best format for e-mail. It
doesn't take a long time to download, it can be read by all types
of computer users, and it can't hurt your computer upon being
opened.
</P>
<P>
   (Despite the chain-mail warnings that nearly every PC user has
gotten about not opening certain e-mails _ with subjects such as
``Good Times'' or ``Join the Crew!'' _ there is no way that a
text-only e-mail can harm your computer _ only those with attached
documents or programs.)
</P>
<P>
   Some people will send whole programs to each other _ executable
files that end in .exe. Such programs as Happy99, a virus that
changes crucial system files and then attaches a copy of itself to
every e-mail you send, would not be a problem if people did the
smart thing _ delete any executable file, unless you know who it's
from and were told it was coming in advance.
</P>
<P>
   If you receive a Word document, politely ask the sender to
resubmit the message in text-only format, and point out that such
attachments can transmit computer viruses.
</P>
<P>
   It will take a concerted effort to get computer users to stop
sending Word documents, but the Melissa virus should provide some
inspiration for doing so.
</P>
<P>
   If you receive a Word document you feel you must look at, try
using QuickView instead. This is a small program built into Windows
95 and 98 that lets you view many documents without using the
software that generated them.
</P>
<P>
   Right-click on the document, then choose QuickView. The top part
of the document may appear to be garbled in some cases; scroll down
to see the text.

 &HT;    Chen demoted as Perez becomes No. 5 starter
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. _ Much to the chagrin of Kerry Ligtenberg
and Bruce Chen, the Braves' pitching situation became much clearer
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Ligtenberg will miss the entire season after deciding to undergo
``Tommy John'' surgery to repair ligament damage in his elbow. The
surgery will be peformed by Dr. James Andrews next Tuesday in
Birmingham.
</P>
<P>
   Chen, projected as the Braves' fifth starter, was optioned to
AAA Richmond because of a poor spring and is being replaced in the
rotation by friend and fellow rookie left-hander Odalis Perez. The
rotation is now set, with Tom Glavine facing the Phillies on
Opening Day, followed by Greg Maddux, John Smoltz, Kevin Millwood
and Perez.
</P>
<P>
   And Mark Wohlers apparently reclaimed the closer's role with
another strong outing Monday. He'll be joined in the bullpen by
John Rocker, Rudy Seanez, Mike Remlinger, Mike Cather and Kevin
McGlinchy.
</P>
<P>
   Ligtenberg, examined Monday by Braves team orthopedic surgeon
Joe Chandler, was given the option of waiting a few more weeks to
test the arm again, but after almost three weeks of waiting, he was
ready to go ahead with surgery. He may be able to return as soon as
this time next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's better that I do it now than the middle of the
season,'' Ligtenberg said. ``That would be missing the rest of this
season and next season.''
</P>
<P>
   Ligtenberg will return to Atlanta for several weeks after the
surgery so the Braves can monitor his recovery, then he'll go home
to Minnesota to continue his rehabilitation. He could return to
Atlanta in early July to begin throwing.
</P>
<P>
   ``That might be the only saving thing about this; I'll get to
see my family and friends,'' Ligtenberg said. ``At the same time
I'd like to get back to playing as soon as I can. . . . .
(Chandler) wants me to take it slow. That'll be tough for me. I
have a tendency to go crazy and do too much. . . . . There are guys
who aren't able to come back from this. I look at it as a challenge
to come back.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Braves reliever Pedro Borbon needed two full years to
recover from the same surgery in August 1996, and minor-leaguer
Damian Moss is still working his way back from surgery last June.
</P>
<P>
   Ligtenberg expects to need only 12 months, maybe less. If the
ligament is only partially torn, the surgery will be less
complicated and the recovery time quicker.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is the best case,'' Ligtenberg said, ``to just go
get it done.''
</P>
<P>
   Chen's main problem this spring was control, which is supposed
to be his strength. After five appearances this spring, Chen had a
6.00 ERA with 23 hits allowed and 12 walks.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hate to put too much stock in spring training,'' Cox said.
``But in this case, he's not exactly where we want him to be. If he
goes with us he's only going to get a spot start here and there in
the first month and it makes sense to get him on a regular program
in AAA where he starts every fifth day guaranteed.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Chen, the Braves can use Perez as a starter or out of the
bullpen, where he spent last postseason with Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes a lot of sense to go this way,'' Cox said. ``This has
happened to Glavine, Smoltz, Maddux at his age. This is no
different than what they went through. . . . . Bruce is a great
kid. It's harder on me than him because I love the kid. I know he's
going to be an outstanding pitcher, he's going to be a big winner.
He's just not quite there yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Chen was caught a little off guard by the move.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I didn't have a good spring,'' Chen said. ``I tried to
do my best. I can't be mad at myself because I really worked hard
in the offseason. I prepared myself real well for this opportunity.
The thing is, once you get a taste of this you don't want to go
back. . . . . I feel I can pitch here, but I didn't show that in
spring training.''
</P>
<P>
   The hardest thing might have been telling Perez.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel bad because we got to be friends,'' Perez said. ``We've
been together for the last four years. He told me he's not going to
get mad with me because it's a baseball game and something can
happen. He told me, `You've got the opportunity now, go for the
opportunity.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Perez was a starter in AA Greenville last year before the Braves
moved him to the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy because I thought they were going to give me an
opportunity in relief and now I'm a fifth starter,'' Perez said.
``That's the opportunity I wanted. I just got it.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   As reports of Yugoslav forces killing and evicting the ethnic
Albanians emerge from Kosovo, a critical question has arisen for
the West: At what point do brutal acts by Slobodan Milosevic, the
Yugoslav president, and the increasingly personal attacks on him by
the West, make it impossible ever to negotiate with him again?
</P>
<P>
   For now, the political process that NATO's bombing of Serbia is
supposed to bolster is still built around the involvement of
Milosevic. The bombing is meant to persuade him to sign a peace
agreement offering the Albanians autonomy, and to accept the
presence of a NATO-led force in Kosovo to police that accord.
</P>
<P>
   But with reports emerging daily about the execution of prominent
Albanians _ including Fehmi Agani, a signatory of the proposed
peace deal _ and about the eviction of tens of thousands of
Albanians from their homes, it is becoming unclear how the Clinton
administration and its allies can justify any accord with the man
behind these acts.
</P>
<P>
   ``If even half of what seems to be going on in Kosovo is in fact
going on,'' said one State Department official, ``how could we
still do a deal with him, even if he comes around? Our quandary is
that the demonization of Milosevic is necessary to maintain the air
attacks, but each time we denounce him, it's harder to shake hands
with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, this is not the first time since Yugoslavia began to
disintegrate in 1991 that Serbian forces, regular and paramilitary,
have gone on a rampage under Milosevic's rule. Between April and
September 1992, close to 1 million Muslims were driven from their
homes in Bosnia by Serbian militia armed and backed by Milosevic,
and many thousands were killed.
</P>
<P>
   That did not stop the West from doing business with Milosevic.
This time, however, the link between the murder and the man appears
more immediate, for Kosovo lies within Serbia, and the link has
been spelled out with unusual directness by Western leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Robin Cook, the British foreign secretary, all but called for
Milosevic to be indicted as a war criminal in his briefing Monday,
saying: ``Anyone who carries out atrocities against the civilian
population, anyone who gives orders for them to carry it out, or is
complicit in those orders' being given, and anyone who fails to
prevent such orders or to prevent those orders' being carried out,
anyone in any of those categories, is liable to face indictment
before the International War Crimes Tribunal.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States has been a little more reticent but has still
made clear that it holds Milosevic responsible for what is
happening in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``My sense is that there is not the slightest chance of doing
business with Milosevic anymore,'' said a senior U.S. diplomat in
Europe, ``but we are desperately hoping that there is some other
answer. Because if we can't talk to him, we have to defeat him and
remove him.''
</P>
<P>
   That has always been the appeal of Milosevic to Washington and
the West in general: however distasteful, he offered a potential
way out of a military confrontation for which no Western government
had any taste.
</P>
<P>
   When the Clinton administration first began to deal with him in
earnest in early 1995, it did so precisely because it had
determined that he offered potentially the most painless, if not
the most edifying, way out of the Bosnian War.
</P>
<P>
   The policy bore fruit in Dayton, Ohio, where Milosevic signed a
peace accord for Bosnia in late 1995, and engagement with him has
been at the heart of America's Balkan policy ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in the light of a Serbian brutality in Kosovo that has been
unexpected in its intensity, that policy looks shaky. But the
alternatives, officials said, are also generally unappealing.
</P>
<P>
   One would be the deployment of ground troops to secure Kosovo,
stop the killing there and eventually unseat Milosevic. But as yet,
there appears to be no readiness in the administration or among the
American public for such a risky step, one that would appear to run
counter to the cautious instincts President Clinton has shown ever
since the debacle in Somalia that took 18 American lives in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Lockhart, the White House spokesman, said Monday that the
administration had no intention of introducing ground forces unless
there was a peace settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Another alternative lies in the possibility that the NATO
bombing, if sustained, will have an increasingly destabilizing
effect on Serbia, leading disaffected elements in the army and
elsewhere to move against Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   But some powerful opposition figures, notably Vojislav Seselj, a
lawyer and former paramilitary leader in Bosnia, are more extreme
in their views than Milosevic. The United States has looked in
recent years for credible and moderate opposition figures in
Serbia, without unearthing many.
</P>
<P>
   As one official put it, ``The fact is Milosevic seems to have
either destroyed or driven out anyone who could form a credible
opposition over the past decade.''
</P>
<P>
   Some opposition figures like Vuk Draskovic have been co-opted
and are now in the government; others, particularly in the
independent media, have been intimidated and silenced. But there
have been moments, as with large-scale demonstrations in winter
1996 and earlier in spring 1992, suggesting that a more open,
democratic Serbia could exist after Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   For now the United States and its allies seem ready to persist
in the policy of trying to construct a Balkan peace around
Milosevic. Lockhart said Monday that a planned Russian delegation
to Belgrade this week would be welcome if it could influence
Milosevic to embrace peace.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But what peace, at this stage, would that be? Russia,
presumably, would have to find a face-saver for Milosevic _ perhaps
the suggestion that U.N. troops, rather than NATO troops, would
police any accord in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But last month in Rambouillet, France, the Albanians signed on
to an accord that called for several precise things _ among them
autonomy and a NATO presence to guarantee it. After what has
happened in recent days, it appears inconceivable that the
Albanians would accept anything short of the letter of that accord.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, many political analysts believe that after the wholesale
killing and ``ethnic cleansing'' of the past six days, even the
Rambouillet accord may look unacceptable to the outraged Albanians
who backed it. ``It is going to be very, very hard to resurrect the
deal,'' said Jonathan Eyal, a British foreign policy analyst.
</P>
<P>
   But Eyal argued that it was ``still just about tenable'' to talk
to Milosevic and insist on building an agreement around him.
</P>
<P>
   That, of course, has been Western policy for some time. It has
sought to overlook several basic factors _ among them the question
of how any ``autonomy'' can exist under what amounts to Milosevic's
repressive political system in Serbia. It has also repeatedly won
time for Western governments, without appearing to bring real
Balkan stability any closer.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a long time, in the Balkans,'' the State Department
official said, ``we have been driven by the search for the
lowest-cost way of buying ourselves another week. But we are now in
deeper than ever before, and may have to do some fundamental
rethinking.''

   NEW YORK _ Wrapping themselves in the flags of their homeland
and of the country where they make their home, more than 3,000
Albanian-Americans marched from the United Nations to the Serbian
mission here Monday, praising NATO's bombing campaign over the
situation in the Serbian province of Kosovo and calling for ground
troops to support the air war.
</P>
<P>
   As they waved the Stars and Stripes and wore Albania's
doubled-headed black eagle on a red background on their backs,
several protesters burned or tore apart the blue, white and red
flag of Yugoslavia, of which Serbia is the major entity. When
police officers stopped them from setting another flag aflame on
Fifth Avenue, the protesters stomped and spat on it instead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like I was ripping Serbs,'' said 12-year-old
Christopher Broui.
</P>
<P>
   Shirley Lloyes DioGuardi of the Albanian-American Civic League
spoke to the demonstrators, who filled the sidewalk for more than
two city blocks on the edge of Central Park. ``It is a just war and
it is a war we hope all Americans will begin to understand has an
effect on them,'' Mrs. DioGuardi said.
</P>
<P>
   With their signs and slogans, the demonstrators compared
President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia, who sent in troops
against ethnic Albanian rebels in Kosovo, to Hitler. They chanted,
``Stop the Genocide,'' and ``Arm the Kosovo Liberation Army,'' the
separatist rebel group in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The emotional crowd was dotted with small children wearing
camouflage outfits, and teen-agers carrying representations of
coffins, many of them infant-sized, as they marched up Third Avenue
from 42nd Street to 72nd Street, then back down Fifth Avenue to the
Serbian mission at 67th Street. Old men wore the off-white
skullcaps that symbolized Albanian pride, while younger men wore
berets with the insignia of the rebel group, or Yankee caps showing
their adopted culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only hope we have is from the American people,'' said
Xhedat Mekuli, 36, a maintenance worker who was born in Yugoslavia
but now lives in the Bronx. ``They have feelings for human rights.
I think they're the only people who can help our country, Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   The protesters expressed strong support for President Clinton
and NATO, but said that without ground troops, the air campaign
would simply hasten Milosevic's apparent efforts to cause ethnic
Albanians to flee Kosovo. Some said they want NATO to provide arms
to the ethnic Albanians; dozens of teen-agers even signed papers at
the rally volunteering themselves for service in the rebel group
</P>
<P>
   ``To have freedom, some people must die,'' said Rep. James
Traficant Jr., D-Ohio, who has introduced a resolution in Congress
calling for an independent Kosovo, at the U.N. portion of the
41/2-hour rally. ``But there is no going back. We must have a free
Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   Many in the crowd had personal connections to people in the zone
where fighting is taking place. The headquarters for a World Wide
Web site (www.kosova.com) that many Albanian expatriates relied
upon for news has been burned and now has only old information,
several protesters said.
</P>
<P>
   Milot Krashiqi, a construction worker living in Yonkers with his
wife and four children, said his father told him by telephone three
days ago that the streets of Klina, his village, were littered with
bodies. Monday morning, on CNN, Krashiqi said, he saw his father's
name on a list of the dead.
</P>
<P>
   Bruno Selimaj, 47, who was born in Montenegro and came to the
United States 28 years ago, said he and his parents had not slept
well in days.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no phone lines in and out, no power, no nothing, no
postal service _ it's a mess,'' said Hartim Kaba, 22, of Wayne,
N.J. He said he worried about his parents, who returned to Kosovo
for a visit a month ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully we're doing something to stop the massacring going
on in Europe right now,'' Kaba said. ``If this stops the killing
even 1 percent, saves one or two lives, it's worth it.''

   OHRID, Macedonia _ For the 1,400 members of the Kosovo
Verification Mission, whose job until recently was to try to keep a
lid on the simmering hatreds of Kosovo, these are days of
frustration and guilt.
</P>
<P>
   Evacuated from Kosovo on March 20, just before NATO launched its
bombers against Yugoslavia and President Slobodan Milosevic
unleashed a full-blown terror campaign against ethnic Albanians in
Kosovo, the verifiers can do no more now than sit on the lovely
lakeshore here, watching the horrors unfold on television.
</P>
<P>
   Many military men in the mission expressed anger and frustration
at their inactivity and powerlessness. Some said it was a mistake
to pull the entire mission out of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``They should have kept a small core,'' said one senior officer.
He pointed out that the United Nations kept a small contingent of
peacekeepers in Lebanon and other dangerous places.
</P>
<P>
   ``However bad it gets, our job was inside Kosovo,'' he said.
Like many of his colleagues, he said NATO ground forces should now
go in to halt the Serbian onslaught described by refugees and
Western officials.
</P>
<P>
   For many, the frustration was heightened by a sense of guilt
over the fates of 1,500 local staff left behind, some of whom may
have been killed for having associated with the verification
mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew it was going to be bad, and I warned our local staff
that things would get worse, but I did not think it would be this
bad,'' said William Walker, the American diplomat who heads the
mission.
</P>
<P>
   Although it was Walker who argued at the time of the evacuation
that the monitoring mission had been rendered ineffective by
Serbian violations, an aide said he had pushed to delay the
withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   The verifiers were dispatched to Kosovo by the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) to monitor a cease-fire,
part of the agreement reached last October between American envoy
Richard Holbrooke and Milosevic. The mission was evacuated when the
agreement collapsed and NATO prepared to start bombing.
</P>
<P>
   But for now, there was nothing for the verifiers, most of them
military men seconded by the United States, Europe, Russia and
other countries in the 54-member OSCE, to do but admire the
lakeside view and its backdrop of snow-dusted mountains. Their
bright orange cars stood parked outside the two best hotels on the
lakeshore.
</P>
<P>
   The verifiers agreed that the cease-fire they were sent to
monitor never really took hold. As one British army officer
described it, ``There never was a cease-fire. We were fighting to
keep the lid on, to stop the pot boiling over, while the
politicians fiddled around.''
</P>
<P>
   But those four months may have been the calmest months Kosovo
has enjoyed in more than a year, despite constant violations of the
cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
   The OSCE's evacuation from Kosovo on March 20 freed Serbian army
and police forces to unleash a terrifying attack on the ethnic
Albanian guerrilla forces, the Kosovo Liberation Army and the
civilian population.
</P>
<P>
   Walker looks weary these days. Two of his personal guards in the
capital of Kosovo, Pristina, have been reported killed, and their
deaths may have resulted from their connection with Walker and the
verification mission.
</P>
<P>
   Some 20 former employees of the OSCE are missing, according to
one of the foreign verifiers who is tracking the situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are concerned about them. There are worrying reports,'' he
said. ``One guard we know has been killed.'' That was the son of
the human rights lawyer, Bajram Kelmendi, who was abducted and
killed along with his father and brother on the first night of the
NATO bombing.
</P>
<P>
   His death is not thought to be connected to his work with the
OSCE but rather his father's prominence. Yet there are ominous
signs that anyone who was connected with the OSCE or other
foreigners have been targeted by Serbian paramilitaries.
</P>
<P>
   One of the former OSCE security guards reported that a contact
in the Serbian police told him, ``If you have any association with
the OSCE, you are shot on the spot.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Shops and restaurants frequented by foreigners in Pristina have
been looted and burned and the owner of one popular restaurant, the
Monaco, has been killed.
</P>
<P>
   Some former OSCE workers have made it safely out of the country.
Several interpreters who had worked for international aid
organizations in Kosovo crossed into Macedonia Monday. Serbian
police had given them a beating at a check point, and tore the
passport of one, but allowed them to pass, they said. Although
safely out of Kosovo, they still asked to remain anonymous.
</P>
<P>
   Many in the OSCE mission expressed feelings of shame at
abandoning the local staff on evacuation. ``Everyone is feeling
guilty,'' said one senior officer.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was like abandoning patients in a hospital,'' said the
former spokeswoman for the mission, Beatrice Lacoste. Local workers
in the press office had told her that they knew they would be
targeted by Serbs if the OSCE left Kosovo, she said.
</P>
<P>
   At the time the decision was taken to evacuate the mission,
Walker said the departure was necessary because the monitors were
becoming less and less effective. Serbian forces were violating the
October agreements ever more brazenly and were preventing the
monitors from doing their work.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew we were in trouble when freedom of movement stopped,''
said an aide. ``Our people were threatened with weapons by the
MUP'' _ Serbian police _ ``and the VJ'' _ the Yugoslav army. ``The
real threat was the armed civilians. Someone was going to get
killed and we were sitting handcuffed. We felt we were being
defeated, we were becoming completely ineffectual.''
</P>
<P>
   When the decision was taken to evacuate, Walker said in an
interview that his monitors were not prepared to sit in Kosovo and
watch Milosevic slowly wipe out the villages. ``With what is
happening he could take all summer, but he will wipe out the
villages,'' Walker said at the time. ``And all we could say was
that at least we stayed to the end. No, we are not going to do
that.''
</P>
<P>
   But one aide said Walker tried to keep the monitors in place for
as long as he could.
</P>
<P>
   Now, outside the two hotels on the lakeshore, the fleet of
bright orange OSCE cars stood idle. At the Bellevue Hotel, a dozen
white cars carrying the emblem of the U.N. High Commission for
Refugees were parked alongside.
</P>
<P>
   The evacuation from Kosovo last week was the deathknell for the
Kosovo Verification Mission. People were boarding buses Monday to
return to their home countries. The staff of 1,400 was being
reduced to a core of 250 people, Walker said. In theory the mission
is on standby to return to Kosovo and help with reconstruction and
democratization once a peace settlement is in place.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, senior officers admit that the mission will not be
going back for weeks, if at all. ``It is up to NATO now,'' one
said.

 &HT;    Duval remains the players' choice
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Maybe it's just coincidence. Maybe it's just that time
of year. A week away from the Masters and an occasion for game
faces to be put firmly in place.
</P>
<P>
   Or, then again, it could be The Duval Effect.
</P>
<P>
   Now that David Duval has shot a 59, won more than $2 million
before April 1, won 10 events in 33 tries, won a Players
Championship, and officially taken over No. 1 in the world
rankings, what's left for the mere mortals of the PGA Tour to do?
</P>
<P>
   Practice, practice, practice.
</P>
<P>
   For a Monday at a PGA Tour practice range, this one at the TPC
at Sugarloaf in Duluth, Ga. for this week's BellSouth Classic had a
lot of talent on it. Players such as Billy Mayfair and Paul
Stankowski. Jose Maria Olazabal, the 1994 Masters champion. Heck,
even Japan's Jumbo Ozaki, who passed up the Players Championship.
</P>
<P>
   Duval won't be here until Wednesday for the Pro-Am, possibly
late today. Until then, all the rest of them can do is hit more
balls and marvel at what Duval has accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to win Augusta next week,'' Stankowski decided,
firing a ball into the breeze. ``He's our only shot at winning the
Grand Slam. . . . It's hard to beat a guy who's got all the skills
and the mentality to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayfair, who won twice last year and is making his first
appearance at the BellSouth, could not agree more. Dethroning Tiger
Woods _ ironically, an absentee this week as defending champion _
in the rankings just made official what everyone already knew.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't had this kind of stuff since the Nicklaus and
Palmer days,'' Mayfair said. ``It's amazing. And he's won from
Hawaii to Florida on all kinds of golf courses. Even if Tiger had
finished sixth Sunday, David still should have been No. 1.''
</P>
<P>
   Eyeing Augusta, Mayfair figured Woods had been dethroned from
his position there, too, the 1997 win withstanding.
</P>
<P>
   ``If David isn't favored,'' said Mayfair, ``who else could you
pick?''
</P>
<P>
   Playing Atlanta on a foreign exemption, Ozaki said of Duval
through his interpreter, ``Oh, yes, he is the strongest player. ...
How to beat him? I don't know. You should ask the younger U.S.
players.''
</P>
<P>
   How do you beat Duval?
</P>
<P>
   ``Take him out at the knees,'' Stankowski grinned.

 &HT;    Maruyama's game has 'no weaknesses'
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Shigeki Maruyama just might have been teasing an
American reporter who required a translator last week at The
Players Championship. The best player in Japan is perfectly capable
of such a put-on.
</P>
<P>
   Maruyama was asked: Why did you want to play in Atlanta? To face
some conditions that will better prepare you for Augusta National?
</P>
<P>
   Hal Tsunezumi, Maruyama's manager and translator, asked the
question in a lengthy manner. Maruyama, grinning some and frowning
some, gave a lengthy answer.
</P>
<P>
   Tsunezumi then turned and pronounced, ``He said, `I don't know.'
''
</P>
<P>
   There was chuckling, and Maruyama's 29-year-old face brightened.
It was the same look that has been painful to U.S. players on the
PGA Tour. One minute they are smiling and bowing with Maruyama at
the first tee. The next minute they are three down.
</P>
<P>
   The MVP of December's Presidents Cup, Maruyama tore through the
U.S. team, going 5-0. Even those who know Maruyama and his game
well were stunned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a little surprised he was 5-0, but the guy can really
play,'' said Brian Watts, who has played with Maruyama on the
Japanese Tour. ``In Japan we have a match play tournament, and he's
won it and finished second or third the other time, so the guy does
really well head-to-head. ... He's got a game with no weaknesses.''
</P>
<P>
   He's also hard to miss on the golf course and easily discernible
from the other Japanese players. Puffing on a cigarette and often
walking too briskly for his caddie, Maruyama is more intense than
his perpetual off-course grin would suggest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am really good at the golf conversation,'' Maruyama said.
``Otherwise, I just smile a lot. ... I can't be a poker face all
the time. I make birdie, I'm happy. That's why I'm smiling all the
time.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Andersen Consulting Match Play, Maruyama defeated Steve
Stricker, Justin Leonard and Loren Roberts before losing to
eventual runner-up Andrew Magee.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody should be surprised at Maruyama's achievements outside of
Japan. He tied for 14th at the 1996 British Open, then 10th in
1997. Playing in his first PGA Championship at Winged Foot in 1997,
he was 23rd. Maruyama played six PGA Tour events in 1997, earning
$111,781 and finishing 161st on the money list. He won 37 college
titles.
</P>
<P>
   Bad outings like the 74-84 performance in The Players
Championship last week will not keep Maruyama from targeting his
fantasies. He still wants to finish in the top 10 in all the
majors. He wants to meet and play golf with his hero, Michael
Jordan. Maruyama has a ``23'' on his bag.
</P>
<P>
   Americans Jeff Sluman, Davis Love III and Fred Couples, who have
befriended Maruyama, are trying to set up a round with Jordan,
perhaps while near Chicago in August before the PGA Championship at
Medinah, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   How many shots to give Jordan? Maruyama holds up five fingers.
</P>
<P>
   Taking up golf at 10 years old, Maruyama found his spark by
watching American television. The freeze footage for the young
Maruyama became Tom Watson walking up the 18th fairway at Augusta
National, savoring an approaching victory.
</P>
<P>

USC'S ZITO DRAFTS NEW PLAN _ WITHOUT FAMILY TIES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS BRANAM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ He entered last year's Major League Baseball draft
with a plan. It backfired.
</P>
<P>
   So Barry Zito has developed a new strategy. Zito, a junior
left-hander at USC who is college baseball's hottest pitcher, is
going it alone into this year's negotiations. He's told his father
Joe to sit this one out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him to chill out,'' Zito said. ``I'm 21. It's going to
be my name on the contract.''
</P>
<P>
   There probably will be a lot of figures on that piece of paper.
Zito has struck out 46 in his past three starts _ all wins _ and is
5-2 with a 3.29 ERA for the Trojans. He struck out 16 against
Oregon State on March 12, then repeated the feat on March 19
against Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Zito, who is scheduled to start against Cal State Northridge on
Friday night at Dedeaux Field, struck out 14 in a complete-game win
over Washington State on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   He said he is pitching well because he has put all the
distractions of 1998 out of his mind.
</P>
<P>
   Zito, who is from El Cajon, pitched at Pierce College last year
after transferring from UC Santa Barbara following his freshman
season. He went 10-2 and then was drafted by the Texas Rangers in
the third round.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Zito represented his son in negotiations and held firm on a
$350,000 request for a signing bonus. Barry Zito, a 6-foot-3,
195-pounder who throws in the mid-90s, said his father's
representation even before the draft may have made him slip to the
third round.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he deterred a lot of teams (from drafting me),'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Pierce home games were a sideshow when Zito pitched. Twenty to
30 scouts would show up on the Woodland Hills campus for his
starts; it was impossible for him not to notice.
</P>
<P>
   ``My head is in the game now,'' he said, ``as opposed to all
that external stuff. Now I can just put (the scouts) out of my
head. I get fired up for every game.''
</P>
<P>
   Being at USC, the defending national champion, hasn't hurt
Zito's development, either. He credited his recent success with
long-tossing between starts. Long-tossing is when pitchers stand
about 330 feet apart and play catch. It's supposed to develop arm
strength.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was at Pierce it was hard to find guys to throw 330 to
340 feet away,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Zito knows that when the season ends, so does his career as a
Trojan. He said he will definitely sign with whatever team drafts
him in June, and he hopes to go higher than the third round.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm certainly out of here after this year,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Out of nowhere: On the opposite end of the prospect spectrum
from Zito is CSUN left-hander Jim DeBiase, but his performance so
far this season has been just as pleasing.
</P>
<P>
   DeBiase, a Chatsworth High graduate who also pitched at Pierce,
beat Sacramento State on Sunday to stop the Matadors' six-game
losing streak. He improved to 7-2 after starting the season in the
bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, DeBiase talked about his surprising success.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm mainly concentrating on hitting my spots,'' he said, ``and
basically trying to get a lot of ground balls.''
</P>
<P>
   DeBiase appeared in 20 games last year for CSUN, but only six
were starts. He struggled with his control, walking 42 in 541/3
innings. Before Sunday, DeBiase had only 27 walks in 602/3 innings
this season.
</P>
<P>
   Win one for Gillespie: Head coach Mike Gillespie could win his
500th game at USC tonight if the Trojans can beat San Diego State
at Dedeaux Field. His record at USC is 499-283-2. Today also marks
the 25th anniversary of Dedeaux Field.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA head coach Gary Adams won his 1,000th game earlier this
season.

 &HT;    Down on the (hog) farm not such a pretty picture
 &HT;    By Bo Emerson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In North Carolina the hogs outnumber the people. Raised on
factory farms in sheds as long as football fields, the Tarheel
porkers live on slatted floors that allow their waste to drop into
huge cesspools. Hog sewage is then pumped into outdoor ``lagoons''
the size of Olympic swimming pools, producing clouds of stink that
rise up and cover whole counties. Health risks accompany this
assembly-line approach to swine farming, in particular when lagoons
collapse and pour tons of sewage into the state's waterways,
triggering massive fish kills. George ($2.95) investigates the
price we pay for the other white meat.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  More prim than glam: Now that the Academy Awards show has
devolved into a fashion event, we can dispense with movies and talk
about clothes. People ($2.99) does just that, calling the gowns of
the Oscars ``Sexy, Sexier, Sexiest'' and devoting 40 pages to an
unending parade of what appear to be prom dresses.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Life of the camera: No longer king of the dramatic image, Life
($4.99) nonetheless still recognizes wonderful photography. The
current issue announces the winners of a Life-sponsored photography
contest named for famed Life contributor Alfred Eisenstaedt, who
helped create the modern picture magazine. In Zed Nelson's
prize-winning essay on gun owners, printed in Time last July, we
see Mike, a shopper at a Dallas gun store, posed with his infant in
one hand and his pistol in the other. Max Aguilera-Hellweg is
another winner for his starkly lit tableaux depicting experimental
gallbladder surgery conducted by robotic devices. Also memorable is
Adam Brown's image of a massacre in a dappled forest in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Killer bugs: In Atlanta ($3.50) Vincent Coppola profiles C.J.
Peters, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's intrepid
hunter of killer viruses. Peters waded into Ebola-stricken villages
in Africa and watched a colleague die after nicking himself with a
scalpel during an autopsy.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Any relation to Francis Ford? The peripatetic Coppola also
contributes to Men's Journal ($3.95) this month, with a report on
the rapidly crumbling nightmare called Hanoi. Here Coppola is
served snake and hard-luck tales by American expatriates, and the
bar of choice is the Apocalypse Now.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Where's Kevin Bacon? An amusing foldout chart in Dossier
($3.95) demonstrates the web of associations between the members of
Atlanta's power elite and shows that no two movers and shakers down
here are separated by more than a few handshakes. Some of the lines
in this flow chart are a bit iffy, however. (Evander Holyfield and
Sean ``Puff Daddy'' Combs' connection is based on the fact that
they own property on the same street.)
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Getting there: Atlanta-based Holiday Inn has its own
handsomely produced corporate magazine, available in every room,
called Navigator (free to guests) with the motto: ``Leave the
towel. Take this magazine.'' In the April-May issue is an account
of that pre-Columbian Irish explorer St. Brendan the Navigator and
a tribute to that perennial American icon, the cowgirl, and her
evolution from Dale Evans to the Dixie Chicks.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Despite all the talk of joint ventures _ the revelation last
week that Helmut Lang and Patrizio Bertelli of Prada were quietly
putting their heads together, while everyone else in fashion was
swayed by the drama of who would control Gucci _ the fall
collections that recently ended in Europe and New York will go down
as the most individualistic in many years.
</P>
<P>
   That's good news for the intrepid fashion seeker _ and bad news
for anyone still asking, crankily, ``But what about hemlines next
season?''
</P>
<P>
   Very few women can be coerced into spending $4,000 for green
leather trousers embroidered with silver petals (which is what a
pair from Gucci will cost) simply because some fashion hierophant
declares it a trend. So designers must be practical idealists,
proposing sensational, one-of-a-kind styles. No woman in this era
of anonymous-looking clothes actually needs a pair of leather
trousers done up like a Mexican saddle. But she might be enticed to
 &UR; want &LR;  one.
</P>
<P>
   As Tom Ford said several nights before his Gucci show earlier
this month, over a dinner of pasta and fish in Milan: ``Two or
three years ago, `the look' is what you were going after. Now it's
about a piece, and each person can put that piece with a T-shirt
from the Gap or with her Prada pants.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the lady is no sucker.
</P>
<P>
   In Paris, where fashion can magnetize vastly different groups of
people, whether Dutch, German or Japanese, and where arty boutiques
like Colette and L'Epicerie and Zampa sell everything from clothes
to ashtrays, there is, naturally, a tendency to push the frontiers
of style. ``In Paris, none of the collections looked alike,'' said
Jeffrey Kalinsky, an Atlanta-based retailer who plans to open a
store in Manhattan in August. ``Nothing is interesting if you can't
make it individual.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, this does not mean you can't deduce from some 250
collections in New York, London, Milan and Paris at least five or
six themes that, come fall, won't look as if a bunch of hysterical
tailors got together under the bright lights of high fashion.
</P>
<P>
   Y2K, OR WHY GO THERE?
</P>
<P>
   No matter what you think of the millennium buildup, it
represents a marvelously tempting opportunity _ Las Vegas rolled
into Hollywood with a dash of NASA thrown in. Well, it is
irresistible. But don't think that just because a few designers
toyed fantastically with lunar white and silver leather that anyone
really plans to go there. Nobody is going to the moon, as Karl
Lagerfeld said.
</P>
<P>
   Those who interpreted the millennial fever best did so with
color and ingenious decoration. How else to explain the imperial
scarlet at Yohji Yamamoto and Gucci, the faded autumnal hues at
Cerruti and Prada, the deliciously arcane ruffles at Tuleh, and the
impression that even the most chronically sober designers, like Rei
Kawakubo of Comme des Garcons, had run their clothes through a car
wash of glitter? It's party time _ that's the millennial message.
Martine Sitbon adorned her minimalism with streamers of popperlike
ribbon. Christian Lacroix came up with terse skirts appliqued with
something resembling ecstatic bar graphs, though it was his
black-bonneted models who made one laugh. They were straight out of
Balzac.
</P>
<P>
   Very intriguing. But don't be surprised if a year from now, when
the fun is over, designers abandon all the decoration.
</P>
<P>
   THE JACKET REVISITED
</P>
<P>
   Just when you thought the suit was passe _ upstaged by knits and
utility anoraks _ along come Calvin Klein, Josephus Thimister and
Lagerfeld to give the jacket a fresh verve. Both Klein and
Lagerfeld, in his collection at Chanel, cut them close to the body,
using felted wool or shearling to convey a sense of texture,
especially over glossy tops. Thimister revised the safari jacket,
using waxed cotton and tighter sleeves for an almost shrunken look.
The idea is to get beyond the basic jacket.
</P>
<P>
   EVENING BECOMES ...
</P>
<P>
   Well, not quite electric. American designers like Oscar de la
Renta and Michael Kors gave evening clothes the most realistic spin
_ as cozily elegant sportswear. That means cashmere and cable knits
worn with ball skirts and, from de la Renta, who rarely gets his
social clientele wrong, slim silk trousers and good old American
parkas. European designers showed variations _ Ford with cobweb
knits over trousers, and Gilles Dufour at Balmain with full skirts
and sleeveless shearling tops. But the message was the same: don't
look too dressed up.
</P>
<P>
   ARTS AND CRAFTS A LA MODE
</P>
<P>
   Miuccia Prada started the trend for clothes with a handmade arty
look, and this season there was that lovey-dovey feeling all over
Milan, as designers fell for ruffles, peasant blouses, wallflower
prints and bed jackets _ admittedly a frumpy notion, but well done
by Lagerfeld at Fendi, where they were made out of sheared fur dyed
in sweet-pea tints. The trend has charm and, retailers say, staying
power.
</P>
<P>
   DENIM DELUXE
</P>
<P>
   ``All of a sudden jeans looked fine,'' said Linda Dresner, the
Park Avenue retailer, who also has a store in Birmingham, Mich.
``We saw them at Helmut Lang. We saw them at Chloe.'' Indeed, one
saw them everywhere _ from Dolce &AMP; Gabbana's two-tone versions with
tartan, to Jean Paul Gaultier's hilarious super-wide jeans with a
trompe l'oeil effect, to Stella McCartney's glossy silk jeans at
Chloe. Designers may be acknowledging the global trend toward
casual dressing, but there's a catch. This is denim with a couture
attitude.
</P>
<P>
   FUR AND LEATHER UNBOUND
</P>
<P>
   To say that fur and leather were themes of the fall collections
tells only part of the story. Not only were they everywhere; their
high-hatted appeal was constantly played down, the luxury skins
used like common cloth. No style offers more imaginative
possibilities for the independent fashion seeker, whether it's a
sleek cocoon of shearling by Veronique Branquinho for Ruffo, a
light-as-air sheared mink shift from Fendi, or Alexander McQueen's
sensational fur poncho, a look that more or less sums up the
season.
</P>
<P>
   Designers and fashion editors used to sound incredibly fatuous
when talking about the new woman _ who couldn't be dictated to, who
had her own style. But today the woman has actually caught up with
the cliche, to the amazement of fashion pros. ``She surprised us,''
said Nicole Fischelis, fashion director of Saks Fifth Avenue. ``She
gets it.''

MAHARISHI FIGHTS BACK AGAINST COPYCATS 
AFTER KENAR, A COMEBACK   
 PRADA AND LANG WILL COOPERATE
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Hardy Blechman, the owner of Maharishi in London, one of
fashion's newly hot labels, said he had hired lawyers to
investigate and possibly bring charges that designers are copying
his work. Blechman's designs, inspired by his interest in yoga and
named for the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, a spiritual teacher, have
influenced men's wear for two years, said Vincent Ehly, the senior
buyer of designer men's wear for Barneys New York. ``More than any
other collection, it sets the tone for our sportswear,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Designed for men and women, Maharishi is sold by Barneys, Nylon
Squid and Saks Fifth Avenue, all in New York, and by Fred Segal in
Los Angeles and Collette in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to approach people in New York,'' Blechman said,
speaking of two companies that he refused to name that he said have
been particularly blatant copiers. While it is difficult for
designers to collect damages in lawsuits involving knockoffs,
courts have sometimes ruled in their favor.
</P>
<P>
   What has made Blechman's designs so appealing to customers _ and
copiers _ is that they tap into two of fashion's strongest trends:
meditation-inpired clothing, and sports and utility wear.
Flamboyant embroidery and beading add decoration and romance to the
clothes in a post-minimalist era.
</P>
<P>
   Companies as small as Nova and as large as Polo Ralph Lauren and
Donna Karan are now making clothes that come from sports, martial
arts and meditation, and many more are drawing upon military
uniforms. But when Blechman began four years ago, fashion was
sleeker and tidier. As the pendulum has swung in his direction,
business has taken off. ``Things are really mad here at the
moment,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   AFTER KENAR, A COMEBACK
</P>
<P>
   Is Kenneth Zimmerman by another name still the same? Zimmerman,
a Seventh Avenue habitue, hopes not. After placing Kenar in Chapter
11 bankruptcy last year, he has quietly resurfaced with the labels
Kenny Z and Emma Black. Last week, he was in his new one-room
office, where he had once leased the entire 25th floor. Like many
high fliers forced to touch down, he was philosophical.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone thinks I'm nuts to be going back into business, but
if you love the business and know it, then what else can you do?''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Zimmerman is now manufacturing in New York instead of Asia,
which allows him to fill orders in about two weeks rather than
several months, he said. The roughly 250 employees of Kenar have
been whittled down to 10 at his new company.
</P>
<P>
   Emma Black is the more expensive of the two lines, with dresses
at around $100. Kenny Z has inexpensive sportswear like black
stretch trousers or wool tank tops trimmed with velvet ribbon,
trendy additions to be cast off after a season. The collections
will be in stores for fall.
</P>
<P>
   The business is worlds removed from Zimmerman's defunct Kenar
label, which, though it sold midpriced clothing, was positioned as
a designer brand. There was a boutique on Madison Avenue, and
advertisements with supermodels like Linda Evangelista.
</P>
<P>
   PRADA-LANG JOINT VENTURE
</P>
<P>
   Prada and Helmut Lang have entered into a joint-venture
agreement to promote the Helmut Lang label globally, it was
announced on Friday. Details of the arrangement were not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   Patrizio Bertelli, the chairman of Prada and the husband of
Miuccia Prada, was in Hong Kong on Monday and could not be reached
for comment. Lang, who is Austrian but is based in New York, said
through a spokeswoman that he was happy and called Bertelli ``a
brilliant businessman.''
</P>
<P>
   The venture puts two high-fashion, luxury competitors in the
same camp, a strategy Bertelli championed when he surprised the
fashion world last year by announcing he had purchased a 9.5
percent interest in Gucci. Gucci gave Bertelli a cool welcome, and
earlier this year he sold his stake to LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis
Vuitton, pocketing close to $140 million.

   Last spring's shoe was the mule or slide; as flat as a bedroom

THE WAGNER STORY ISN'T MUSIC TO THIS WAGNER'S EARS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By ALESSANDRA STANLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILAN, Italy _ In the basement office of Gottfried Wagner, there
is only one portrait of a composer. It is a concert poster of Franz
Lizst, who among other things was Richard Wagner's father-in-law.
The only likeness of Gottfried Wagner's most illustrious ancestor
is a tiny framed black-and-white sketch of a 19th-century couple in
a Venetian gondola; the male silhouette figure in the picture is,
according to Gottfried Wagner, Richard Wagner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no pictures of Wagner or of Bayreuth,'' Gottfried
Wagner explained as he gave a tour. ``This is where I live and
work. I couldn't bear to have such images around me.''
</P>
<P>
   It is an odd flare of sensibility, given that Wagner, who turns
53 in April, has dedicated his adult life to proclaiming the
unbearable heaviness of being a Wagner.
</P>
<P>
   Persona non grata at the family home in Bayreuth, Gottfried
Wagner for years has haunted the lecture circuits of the United
States, Europe, and, beginning in 1990, Israel, talking about his
feelings of guilt and anger as a German and, most particularly, as
the direct descendant of the great composer, whose music became the
anthem of the Third Reich, and whose anti-Semitic writings helped
legitimize those of Hitler.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because his music is so entwined with the totalitarian ideas,
it cannot be innocently enjoyed,'' Wagner said with an intensity
that is his last remaining birthright. ``I cannot listen to
Wagner's music for fun.''
</P>
<P>
   And fun is something that has eluded Wagner. He now lives in a
modest house in a small suburb outside Milan with his Italian wife,
Teresina, and their 14-year-old son, Eugenio, a Romanian orphan
they adopted in 1991. These days, Gottfried is mostly found on the
road, promoting the American edition of his autobiography,
``Twilight of the Wagners'' (Picador USA), which is due to arrive
in bookstores in May.
</P>
<P>
   Published two years ago in Germany, the book is ostensibly a
look at how Wagner's heirs _ mainly Gottfried's father, Wolfgang,
and his pro-Nazi grandmother, Winifred _ cloaked their close
relationship to Hitler to maintain their control of the Bayreuth
Festival after World War II. For historians, or even for Germans
who have been amply exposed to the bitter power struggle between
Wagner family generations for control of the festival, there is
little news in his book.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twilight of the Wagners'' is a very personal cry of rage, but
not so much at Wagner, who died six years before Hitler was born
and 64 years before the author, who is the composer's
great-grandson. Mostly, the autobiography is a son's attempt to get
even with the father who neglected, belittled and then disowned
him, a ``Papa Dearest'' set against the rich backdrop of
Goetterdaemmerung and the Third Reich.
</P>
<P>
   Gottfried, who is banned from the Bayreuth Festival, has no hope
of ever succeeding his father, who at 80 still firmly rules the
Festspielhaus. Gottfried said he long ago lost any ambition to do
so. Now he just wants all other Wagners to be removed from future
Bayreuth management. ``Only by a real radical change can there be a
real redemption,'' he said. ``Even in my generation, the cousins
have learned nothing from the Wagner family history.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the basement office ostentatiously stripped of Wagner
family mementos, the book is an act of defiance and retaliation, a
poignant one in that the one person it was written for, his father,
Wolfgang, will probably never read it.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most chilling account of their relationship can be
found not in Gottfried's autobiography, where his father is
featured on almost every page, but in his father's coolly proud
1994 memoir telling how he revived Bayreuth from the ashes of
Germany's defeat.
</P>
<P>
   There are just two mentions of his only son, Gottfried. He makes
an impersonal, one-sentence note of his birth. There is no further
mention until page 176, where he sums up the family's epic disputes
and estrangements in a paragraph. Asserting that his two children,
Gottfried and Eva, never accepted his second marriage or his
unwillingness to give them a role in managing the Bayreuth
Festival, he concludes, ``So it was inevitable that we should drift
apart.'' Hitler receives many more mentions.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Father and son have not spoken since Gottfried went to Israel in
1990. Gottfried said that even today his father returns his letters
and pictures of his grandchild. ``Can you imagine sending back
pictures of this lovely child,'' exclaimed Gottfried. ``What does
Eugenio have to do with this disgusting family fight?''
</P>
<P>
   His book begins with his first memory, of being 4 years old and
miserable at the boarding school to which his parents had sent him
in 1951 so they could devote themselves to reopening the Bayreuth
Festival, suspended since the end of the war.
</P>
<P>
   Misery and a rebellion blunted by a desperate eagerness to be
included in the family business are the lietmotifs of Gottfried's
youth. By his mid-20s, unable to convince his father that he had
musical talent of his own, he struck back, writing his university
thesis on Kurt Weill and Bertolt Brecht. The import of his choice
was not lost on the family.
</P>
<P>
   He cites the reaction of his grandmother Winifred, who was an
early and avid supporter of Hitler: ``So you're getting mixed up
with the Jews and even the left wingers!''
</P>
<P>
   From there on, his story is a rather sad one of a young man in
search of acceptance outside the family. A musicologist, he has
with limited success directed operas around the world, but not at
Bayreuth. He said, and his cousin Eva Wagner concurred, that his
father did his best to discredit him with other opera houses.
</P>
<P>
   But even outside the family circle, his is a life hatchmarked by
disputes with friends and falling-outs with business associates. He
finds solace in his wife's Italian relatives, ``as warm as mine
were cold,'' and in the company of Jews who savor the irony of a
Wagner so repentently immersed in commemorating the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   Wagner's music is still banned in Israel. Wolfgang Wagner's
efforts to reconcile Bayreuth and the Jews, notably by inviting a
Jewish conductor, Daniel Barenboim, to perform at Bayreuth, are
scorned by the son as insincere public relations efforts, or
``Redemption Inc.''
</P>
<P>
   Gottfried is appalled by the family's past and the roots of
German totalitarianism that are so entwined in Wagner's life and
music. His book implicitly makes clear as well that Gottfried has
found in the charge of anti-Semitism the most potent weapon to
strike back at his father. The work, emotional in style and
stinting on research, may not convince many readers that Gottfried
is an impartial judge of the Wagner family sins, but it may well
convince them that Wolfgang was a terrible father.
</P>
<P>
   And for Gottfried, maybe finally that will be enough.

 &HT;    Sweating for success in Suwanee
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUWANEE, Ga. _ The Atlanta Falcons began rebuilding Monday, but
not via free agency or the draft. Instead, the offseason
conditioning program began at the team's training facility in
Suwanee as 47 of 59 players lifted weights and ran.
</P>
<P>
   Attendance is strongly encouraged, as coach Dan Reeves believes
it fosters camaraderie, and helps reduce injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, 22 starters only missed a combined 20 of 352
possible starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's mostly to build an endurance base you can maintain for 16
games,'' said recently-signed backup quarterback Danny Kanell.
``It's set up differently for different players so running backs
and quarterbacks aren't doing the same workout as linemen.''
</P>
<P>
   Notable absences included running back Jamal Anderson, who lives
in Salt Lake City, free safety Eugene Robinson, who lives outside
Seattle, and cornerback Ray Buchanan, who works out on his own.
</P>
<P>
   Extra points
</P>
<P>
   Judge Michael Moore Monday denied the request by former Falcons
wide receiver Tony Martin to delay until next year Martin's trial
on five counts of money laundering and one count of conspiracy. The
trial will begin May 3, in Miami. Moore did not rule on whether to
sever Martin's trial from the drug trafficking trial of Martin's
childhood friend, convicted drug dealer Ricky Brownlee. Reeves said
the Falcons might be interested in re-signing Martin depending on
the disposition of Martin's case. Dolphins' coach Jimmy Johnson has
met with Martin....Unrestricted free agent offensive lineman Greg
Bishop signed a two-year contract with the Falcons Monday. The deal
is believed to be worth about $4 million. Atlanta also re-signed
tackle Jose Portilla and tight end Ed Smith to two-year contracts.

 &HT;    International Soccer: Italy braces for 'A' showdown
 &HT;    By Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Italian Serie A race is one of the hottest in years, and
Sunday's showdown in Rome between AC Milan and hosting Lazio could
go a long way toward sorting out what has been a very tight
five-team battle.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio, on top the standings and trying to win the Serie A for
the first time in 25 years, is finally realizing the fruits of a
$40 million offseason spending spree that yielded Italian striker
Christian Vieri and Marcelo Salas of Chile.
</P>
<P>
   And AC Milan, which dominated Italian soccer during most of the
1980s and early '90s, is clearly back in the picture after missing
out on European competition the last two years. AC Milan, in third
place with 48 points, seven behind Lazio, still has a number of
familiar faces on hand, such as defender Paolo Maldini. But German
striker Oliver Bierhoff has given the club a big scoring boost and
injected a badly-needed fresh approach to the country's most
glamorous club.
</P>
<P>
   Fiorentina, which trails Lazio in second place with 50 points,
also has a key road game on Sunday, traveling to Inter Milan, which
has fallen on bad times. After the resignation of interim manager
Mircea Lucescu last week, the club announced that former Juventus
coach Marcelo Lippi would take over next season. That may not help
them now, as Inter is in ninth place and in danger of missing out
on Europe altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavia: Players protest
</P>
<P>
   Around 40 Yugoslav soccer internationals have denounced last
week's NATO air strikes on their country, and some of those in
Spain are planning to boycott matches in protest. All Euro 2000
qualifiers in and around Yugoslavia Saturday and Wednesday have
been postponed, but several players returned home to look for their
families.
</P>
<P>
   Girondins Bordeaux defender Nisa Savaljic left the French club
to return to Montenegro, where his wife and two children fled after
the bombings began. And in London, Sasa Curcic of Crystal Palace
picketed 10 Downing Street, the home of British prime minister Tony
Blair.
</P>
<P>
   But new Atletico Madrid coach Radomir Antic called on his
countrymen based in Spain to call off the boycott and play, saying
their actions would not change matters.
</P>
<P>
   England: Scholes, Keegan heroes
</P>
<P>
   After just one game at the helm of England, new manager Kevin
Keegan may be interested in removing the term ``interim'' from his
description. England, which routed Poland 3-1 Saturday in a Euro
2000 qualifier at Wembley, got a hat trick from Paul Scholes, who
lately has had trouble cracking the Manchester United lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Keegan had said that he would only coach for four games and
return to managing London club Fulham full-time. But Fulham
president Mohamed Al-Fayed said after the Poland win that a
full-time England job for Keegan would be ``my gift to the
nation.'' Keegan said: ``There might be a solution somewhere.'' . .
. Chelsea coach Graham Rix has been sentenced to a year in jail for
sex offenses against a 15-year-old girl. Ray Wilkins has replaced
him as manager Gianluca Vialli's assistant.
</P>
<P>
   France: Lizarazu injures knee
</P>
<P>
   French and Bayern Munich defender Bixente Lizarazu will be out
for at least six months after straining knee ligaments. Without
him, as well as the injured Zinedine Zidane, the French were held
to a 0-0 draw with Ukraine in Paris Saturday in Euro 2000 action.
France, which plays Armenia Wednesday, has called up Monaco striker
David Trezeguet to add some scoring punch. France is tied with
Iceland with eight points in Group 4, two points behind Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
   Germany: Fight, then win
</P>
<P>
   Bayern Munich teammates Carsten Jancker and Markus Babbel got
into a training match fight before Germany's Euro 2000 qualifier
against Northern Ireland, but it didn't have an adverse effect as
Germany won in a 3-0 rout in Belfast to tie Turkey for first place
in Group 3.
</P>
<P>
   Spain: Gonzalez scores four
</P>
<P>
   After a humiliating World Cup and a poor start to Euro 2000
qualifying, Spain dumped on Austria 9-0 Saturday, as Real Madrid
striker Raul Gonzalez had four goals. The loss prompted Austrian
coach Herbert Prohaska to resign.
</P>
<P>
   Italy: Juventus duo strikes
</P>
<P>
   Juventus forwards Filippo Inzaghi and Antonio Conte scored for
Italy, which defeated Denmark 2-1 in Euro 2000 qualifying. Denmark,
the 1992 champions, is mired near the bottom of Group 1 and is all
but eliminated. . . . Lazio manager Sven Goran Eriksson has signed
a three-year contract extension keeping him on board through 2003
for an estimated $6.7 million, a figure that nearly doubles his
current salary.
</P>
<P>
   Around the globe
</P>
<P>
   The Sunday Times of London is reporting that officials from
Japan and South Korea lavished members of the FIFA board of
directors with such gifts as laptop computers and video games to
curry favor for their votes for hosting the 2002 World Cup. Both
countries will co-host, and FIFA member David Will of Scotland said
he was surprised by the nature of the gifts. ``It was small beer
compared to International Olympic Committee,'' he said. . . . Greek
manager Anghel Iordanescu resigned after Norway took a 2-0 win in
Euro 2000 qualifying, with both goals coming from Manchester
United's Ole Gunnar Solsjkaer. The new man in charge is Vassilis
Daniel. . . . Three Hong Kong men have been sentenced to 22 months
in jail each for their role in local match fixing scams. . . .
Former French World Cup organizing committee chairman Michel
Platini, recently named a special adviser to FIFA chairman Sepp
Blatter, not surprisingly backs his mentor's plans for a biennial
World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Women: Mexico tough vs. U.S.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. women beat Mexico 3-0 at the Rose Bowl on Sunday
afternoon, but not as easily as in the past. After a scoreless
first half, Julie Foudy drew first blood for the Americans and
Kristine Lilly scored twice in the last six minutes to kick off a
domestic exhibition tour for the U.S. leading up to the Women's
World Cup this summer.
</P>
<P>
   MLS: Meola tears knee ligament
</P>
<P>
   U.S. goalkeeper Tony Meola, traded to Kansas City in the
offseason, could miss half the season after tearing a knee ligament
earlier this month. Without him, the Wizards have given up seven
goals in two games, including a 3-0 loss to Chicago Saturday, and
have gone an MLS-record 460 minutes without scoring, dating back to
last season. . . . Cobi Jones, Clint Mathis and Greg Vanney scored
shootout goals for Los Angeles in a 1-0 win over Dallas. However,
Galaxy players were booed when they left the Rose Bowl field after
the game. The Galaxy, which led MLS with 85 goals last year, has
scored only one in two games.

</P>
<P>
   MISSION-CREEP (Washington) _ President Clinton, stung by combat
losses when he expanded the mission of U.S. troops in Somalia in

 &HT;    Inside pro tennis: 'Williams show' a tearjerker for dad
 &HT;    By Todd Holcomb
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's hard to blame Richard Williams for reveling in his family's
good fortune. The father of Venus and Serena Williams was flashing
large signs to the crowd and the TV cameras Sunday as his daughters
played it out in the final of the Lipton in Key Biscayne, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   One message said, ``Welcome to the Williams show,'' and another,
``I told you so.'' The latter apparently referred to his prediction
of three years ago that Venus and Serena would be Nos. 1 and 2 in
the world some day.
</P>
<P>
   And in the middle of the match, won by Venus 6-1, 4-6, 6-4,
Williams once walked out of the stadium completely.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I was going to cry,'' he said. ``I felt too ugly to
be out there crying. What was going through my mind was all the
problems we've had in tennis, bringing the girls up. . . . all the
gang members.. . . I was saying, 'Look where you are today.' It was
so difficult for me to believe.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams reared his daughters in the ghettos of Compton, Calif.,
before moving them to Palm Beach Gardens, Fla., and he loves to
tell the story of the sisters hitting tennis balls with the volley
of gunfire sounding in the distance.
</P>
<P>
   The sisters didn't seem as emotional about their historic match,
the first final between sisters in WTA Tour history.
</P>
<P>
   Said Venus, ``In the end, we go home, we live life.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Serena, ``The family comes first, not a game that's going
to last 10 years at the most. Why would I want that to come between
someone who has always been a very special friend to me.''
</P>
<P>
   As part of their beliefs as Jehovah's Witnesses, the Williams
family doesn't display tennis trophies around their home. The
Waterford crystal trophy that Venus won Sunday at the Lipton will
be the first, however. It stands for something different.
</P>
<P>
   Briefly
</P>
<P>
   The United States is seen as the Davis Cup underdog against
Great Britain this weekend, but the Americans have the better
head-to-head records. Todd Martin, up to a career-high No. 8 this
week, is 3-1 against No. 7 Tim Henman, 4-1 against No. 11 Greg
Rusedski. Jan-Michael Gambill is 2-0 versus Henman and has never
played Rusedski. Jim Courier is 1-0 vs. Henman, 3-0 vs. Rusedski.
The Brits, playing in Birmingham, England, have the homecourt edge.
. . . Pete Sampras, though uninvolved with the Davis Cup match, got
on the nerves of British captain John Lloyd last week when he
referred to Great Britain as a ``half-British, half-Canadian
team.'' Rusedski was born in Canada of British parents. ``He's
played for me for four years; he's never let his country down,''
Lloyd retaliated.

 &HT;    Albanian student reflects on life in Kosovo
 &HT;    By Ginger Livingston
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ELIZABETH CITY, N.C. _ A high school exchange student from
Kosovo living in the Albemarle region of North Carolina said he
supports NATO's bombing of his homeland.
</P>
<P>
   The student, a 17-year-old ethnic Albanian, said he hopes the
bombing continues, even though his family has been unable to escape
the war-torn Yugoslavian province. Anything that will destroy
Yugoslavian President Slobodan Milosevic's ability to kill
Albanians can only be a good thing, he says.
</P>
<P>
   The young man, who spoke with The Daily Advance of Elizabeth
City, N.C., on the condition his real name, location and host
family not be disclosed, described the persecution and oppression
his family and other ethnic Albanians have endured during the past
decade from Milosevic's Serbian forces.
</P>
<P>
   It was that persecution that led the United States and other
NATO nations to begin bombing Kosovo, Serbia and other parts of
Yugoslavia last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how to explain (why Serbs repress Albanians),''
said the student, who for purposes of this article, chose to be
called ``Valon.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like trying to explain the color blue to a blind man.
It's just a big hatred between people.''
</P>
<P>
   An uneasy alliance between Serbia and the Albanian majority in
Kosovo existedthrough World War II and the Cold War, until
Yugoslavia began unraveling in the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Tensions rose in Kosovo after its majority _ 90 percent Albanian
population _ began seeking what they had enjoyed to a limited
degree before World War I and during the reign of Yugoslavia's
Communist dictator, Josip Broz Tito: autonomy. Albanians and Serbs
living side by side had never much liked each other, yet they had
learned to be civil to one another. And in some instances, they had
even struck up friendships, Valon said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But then Slobodan Milosevic came into power,'' he said.
``(Albanians) were kicked out of school and most parents lost their
jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic accomplished this attack on Albanians by pandering to
Serbian nationalism, Valon said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a legend (created by Milosevic) that Kosovo is the heart
of Serbia and that without Kosovo, Serbs are nothing,'' Valon said.
</P>
<P>
   Valon was about 9 years old when Milosevic began persecuting
Albanians. Because he was a child, Valon didn't really mind being
prohibited from going to school. Hebecame aware his parents weren't
working and that his family was growing poor. Because his family
and others joined together to start home schools, Valon and other
Albanian children were able to receive an education.
</P>
<P>
   Valon's parents tried to make a living for the family by
starting their own businesses. According to Valon, The Serb
government in Kosovo forces Albanian businesspeople to pay three
times as much in taxes as Serbian businesspeople. Albanians also
have to pay twice as much for telephone and electrical services, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Before Milosevic came to power, Valon's city was a popular
tourist destination, attracting thousands of Germans and other
Europeans. After the Serbian dictator came to power, Albanians
became targets for extortion by Serbian police.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd like to go out and hang out with friends, but you don't
have a chance because of the police,'' he said. ``If they see you
have a nice car or something, they pull you and say `give us
money.' If you don't give it, you get killed or beaten to death.''
</P>
<P>
   Valon says he experienced this treatment firsthand.
</P>
<P>
   When he was 15 or 16, he said, he and his girlfriend were pulled
over by four Serb policemen. The policemen searched the teens and
their car looking for money. When they realized Valon and his
girlfriend had none, they began harassing Valon's girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   Valon said he tried to stop them, but the four men beat him so
badly he was hospitalized for more than three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   That beating was not the first Valon endured at the hands of
police. When he was 13 or 14 years old, Valon participated in a
protest against Serbian oppression. When the police moved in to
break up the demonstration, Valon was among those severely beaten.
A news crew from CNN videotaped the injuries to his back.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just pain. If you want to fight for something with all of
your heart, you endure,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the violence, Valon said he did not want to leave
Kosovo, even to participate in a foreign exchange program.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew what could happen and it's better to share the pain,''
he said. ``But, (my father) said you have to go, you have to see
what is school, what America is like and what freedom is like,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Valon said he now realizes his father knew the violence was
escalating and was sending his son to safety.
</P>
<P>
   Valon managed a quick telephone call to his parents prior to the
bombing.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could hear over the telephone the (warning) sirens. They
were scared and my mother was crying. Their one message (to me) was
'stay where you are,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet despite the current dangerous situation in his homeland,
Valon said if he could, he would immediately return to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's painful not knowing what happened with your parents, with
your friends,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after his arrival in North Carolina, Valon's host mother
(who also asked not to be identified) discovered the young man kept
a lot of money with him. She said when she told Valon to leave his
money at home, he looked at her with apprehension, but complied.
</P>
<P>
   Several days later, during a trip to Norfolk, Va., Valon
questioned her about how many police she saw in a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said depending on where you lived you would see one, maybe
two or three, or none during a day,'' she said. ``He told me he
would see at least 300 to 400 police a day in Kosovo,'' she said.
Valon then explained to his host mother how crucial money is to
survival in Kosovo, and how the police extorted money from the
citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Valon's host mother said despite the violence he has witnessed
and endured, Valon is a remarkably well-adjusted, bright, loving
young man with a good sense of humor.
</P>
<P>
   ``His parents have instilled all the good qualities a young man
should have,'' she said. ``He's a very outgoing person, but you
could tell from the beginning he was apprehensive. He has hard
feelings but his parents have instilled in him the value of the
preciousness of life. . . .''
</P>
<P>
   His host mother began to cry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would love to be able to meet his family and tell them how
much I appreciate (them) sending him. I know it took so much love
for them to send him here,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   When Valon arrived in the Albemarle region, most people had
never heard of Kosovo. Since tensions in Kosovo continue to
escalate, he has had people ask him questions. He has also spoken
to several high school classes about the war.
</P>
<P>
   He said he believes most people are sympathetic to his people's
plight and are more understanding of the need for the United States
and NATO to intervene.
</P>
<P>
   Valon said he was extremely touched by President Clinton's
speech explaining his reasons for ordering the bombing. He said he
feels Clinton truly understands his people's suffering.
</P>
<P>
   He hopes the United States and NATO continue the bombings long
enough to convince the Serbian people they have much to lose by
keeping Milosevic in power.
</P>
<P>
   And Valon hopes Albemarle area residents pray for his family and
the people of Kosovo.

 &HT;    Gingrich wants to move GOP with his priorities
 &HT;    By Clint Williams
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Out of office just a few months, former U.S. House
Speaker Newt Gingrich says he's planning a return to the grass
roots _ stumping to have his ideas become planks in the Republican
Party platform.
</P>
<P>
   In his first local appearance since leaving Congress, Gingrich
said this fall he will begin speaking at county, district and state
GOP meetings. Those talks, and a book due out early next year, will
lay out an agenda Gingrich concedes may take a decade to
accomplish.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich made his remarks Monday at a meeting of the Cobb
County, Ga. Chamber of Commerce Chairman's Club, whose members pay
a minimum of $5,000 to join.
</P>
<P>
   The top priority, Gingrich said, is reforming the Social
Security system. Gingrich again outlined a proposal he first
floated a year ago: Allow workers to put 2 percent of their pay
into a self-directed investment account. The so-called Social
Security Plus program would preserve Social Security without a tax
increase and without a cut in benefits, Gingrich said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even more importantly, it means that the poorest person in
Atlanta, when they go to work and pay a FICA tax, will end up as a
saver and investor,'' Gingrich said.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich said he also will push for lowering the cost of
government so that a person's total tax bill, including local,
state and federal taxes, is no more than 25 percent of his income.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is the most government should take in peace time,''
Gingrich said.
</P>
<P>
   Cutting the cost of government means privatization and
modernization, he said. ``You can't just take a meat ax to
things,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Thirdly, he said, ``The U.S. has to learn to lead the world.''
The former speaker criticized President Clinton's handling of the
Kosovo crisis, saying Clinton hasn't yet told the American people
what U.S. goals are for involvement in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, we're sitting in Bosnia and nobody is killing each other.
Does anybody really think that is healing? These are people who
have been killing each other for 600 years. What do you think is
going to happen three weeks after we leave?'' Clinton ``clearly''
intends to put troops in Kosovo, Gingrich said.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich, who recently became a senior fellow at the American
Enterprise Institute, resigned from Congress in January following
the Republican Party's poor showing in the November elections. He
was an Atlanta-area congressman for 20 years, including the last
four when he was speaker.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich also is forming a consulting firm and has created a
political action committee, Friends of Newt Gingrich, to supply
funding to fellow Republicans. He and his wife, Marianne, still
live in Marietta, Ga.

PARAGUAYANS USE PROTESTS TO EXERCISE POWER OVER POLITICS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN OTIS 
c. 1999 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   ASUNCION, Paraguay _ Struggling to describe this historically
tranquil, landlocked South American nation, humorist P.J. O'Rourke
once wrote that ``Paraguay is nowhere and famous for nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   But Paraguay's reputation for passiveness may be coming to an
end. Last week, violent protests, which broke out after the
assassination of Paraguay's vice president, helped to topple the
government.
</P>
<P>
   Shocked by the bloodshed, President Raul Cubas abruptly resigned
Sunday night, after just seven months in office. The angry
demonstrations turned into joyous celebrations.
</P>
<P>
   ``People got fed up and took to the streets,'' said Soledad
Villagra, a human-rights activist in Asuncion, the Paraguayan
capital. ``These were young people fighting for democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Luis Gonzalez Macchi, the new president and former Senate leader
who took the oath of office Sunday night, began negotiations Monday
with legislators to form a government of national unity.
</P>
<P>
   But legislators already are at odds over how long the new
president should remain in power. Members of the ruling Colorado
Party said Gonzalez Macchi should finish Cubas' five-year term,
which expires in 2003, while the opposition leaders insisted on new
elections within six months.
</P>
<P>
   Cubas and the army general whose release from prison last year
sparked Paraguay's political crisis were granted political asylum.
Brazil allowed Cubas entry, and Argentina gave political asylum to
former Gen. Lino Oviedo, a close friend of Cubas.
</P>
<P>
   Oviedo had received a 10-year jail sentence for leading an
aborted coup attempt in 1996. However, he was freed just days after
Cubas was elected last year. In response, legislators began
impeachment proceedings against Cubas.
</P>
<P>
   The effort was led by Vice President Luis Argana, leading many
observers to blame Cubas and Oviedo for his murder. But police have
turned up no evidence linking them to the crime.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, a fifth person died of gunshot wounds received during
a melee that erupted Friday night when police and army troops tried
to disperse thousands of anti-government protesters. More than 100
people were injured.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suspect that the violence was the key'' to Cubas'
resignation, said a western diplomat. ``When the blood started
flowing, he was getting blamed for all of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, many Paraguayans consider the demonstrations a civic
triumph _ a shining moment of people power, following years of
defeat and dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1860s, for example, Paraguay went to war against
Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay and lost huge chunks of territory and
nearly half of its population. To protect itself, the nation turned
inward.
</P>
<P>
   ``This country has been isolated from the rest of the world for
140 years,'' said a European diplomat. ``The people who ruled were
not democratic. They were authoritarians.''
</P>
<P>
   The longest-lasting strongman was Gen. Alfredo Stroessner, whose
34-year regime earned him the nickname Tyrannosaurus. By the time
he was ousted in a military coup in 1989, most opposition leaders
were either in jail or exile.
</P>
<P>
   Even when democracy was established with free elections in 1993,
the Colorado Party, which has ruled for half a century, won the
presidency, and many Stroessner holdovers remained in the
government.
</P>
<P>
   There was an outbreak of protests in 1996 to Oviedo's coup
attempt. But the murder of Argana last week touched off clashes
that were far more intense and cathartic.
</P>
<P>
   Villagra, the human-rights activist, saw the clashes as proof of
a new society.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paraguay is not a boring and timid country. It is a repressed
country _ which is different'' he said. ``But this was a wake-up
call that shows people can exercise much more power.''

 &HT;    Ohio group investigates possibility of making bid for 2012

   DAYTON, Ohio _ Imagine the Greater Dayton area as part of a
regional Olympic village, with judo at the University of Dayton
Arena, wrestling at the Nutter Center and tennis at the ATP Tennis
Center in Mason, near Kings Island.
</P>
<P>
   That's part of the vision of Cincinnati 2012, a group that wants
to bring the 2012 summer Olympic games to the Cincinnati region,
including Dayton and Columbus, Ohio, Indianapolis, Ind., Louisville
and Lexington, Ky.
</P>
<P>
   A study commissioned by the group and released Friday concluded
that the idea is feasible, although some new sports facilities
would have to be built. The group plans to submit a detailed bid to
the U.S. Olympic Committee by March 31, 2000; the committee is to
choose a U.S. candidate city in fall 2002. International Olympic
officials will then select the site for the 2012 summer games
sometime in 2005.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have a realistic chance of winning,'' said
Cincinnati 2012 President Nick Vehr, who resigned from Cincinnati
City Council to spearhead the effort. He called the region ``the
ideal location'' for the games.
</P>
<P>
   NBBJ Architects of Columbus and Anderson Consulting of Atlanta,
which worked on the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, came up with a
preliminary plan which would use the new Bengals stadium for
opening and closing ceremonies as well as soccer, the new Reds
stadium for baseball, Ohio Stadium in Columbus for athletics and
RCA Dome in Indianapolis for basketball. The plan also suggests
using the Nutter Center for wrestling and the UD Arena for judo.
</P>
<P>
   Vehr said he's had preliminary conversations with officials at
the proposed sites, but there have been no firm plans for using the
venues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, it would be very positive,'' said Maureen Pero,
director of the Downtown Dayton Partnership. ``I'm assuming they
would use our venues, and they'd be able to take advantage of our
hotel and hospitality industries.''
</P>
<P>
   Although they weren't mentioned in the study, Dayton's planned
minor league baseball stadium, riverfront area and bikeway system
could be used by Olympians, too, Pero said.
</P>
<P>
   The study said a new 32,000-seat arena, a new aquatics facility
and a 100,000-seat track and field stadium would be needed in the
region to accommodate the summer games.
</P>
<P>
   Vehr said the group has privately raised more than $2 million of
the estimated $7 million it would take to get the project to the
stage of being in the running as the U.S. candidate city.
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati has stiff competition: Dallas, Houston, Los Angeles,
New York City, San Francisco, Tampa and Washington/Baltimore also
are vying to be the U.S. candidate site.
</P>
<P>
   Vehr said Cincinnati's cause is helped by the recent revelations
of lavish gifts being given to international Olympics authorities
by officials in Salt Lake City during the site-selection process.
``Cities are going to be selected on a level playing field'' and
the process will be more carefully scrutinized in the scandal's
wake, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Vehr said the area would benefit from an Olympics by getting
``the greatest influx of tourism and convention dollars that'll
ever occur in the history of the region.

 &HT;    Ohio group investigates possibility of making bid for 2012
Olympics

   DAYTON, Ohio _ Imagine the Greater Dayton area as part of a
regional Olympic village, with judo at the University of Dayton
Arena, wrestling at the Nutter Center and tennis at the ATP Tennis
Center in Mason, near Kings Island.
</P>
<P>
   That's part of the vision of Cincinnati 2012, a group that wants
to bring the 2012 summer Olympic games to the Cincinnati region,
including Dayton and Columbus, Ohio, Indianapolis, Ind., Louisville
and Lexington, Ky.
</P>
<P>
   A study commissioned by the group and released Friday concluded
that the idea is feasible, although some new sports facilities
would have to be built. The group plans to submit a detailed bid to
the U.S. Olympic Committee by March 31, 2000; the committee is to
choose a U.S. candidate city in fall 2002. International Olympic
officials will then select the site for the 2012 summer games
sometime in 2005.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have a realistic chance of winning,'' said
Cincinnati 2012 President Nick Vehr, who resigned from Cincinnati
City Council to spearhead the effort. He called the region ``the
ideal location'' for the games.
</P>
<P>
   NBBJ Architects of Columbus and Anderson Consulting of Atlanta,
which worked on the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, came up with a
preliminary plan which would use the new Bengals stadium for
opening and closing ceremonies as well as soccer, the new Reds
stadium for baseball, Ohio Stadium in Columbus for athletics and
RCA Dome in Indianapolis for basketball. The plan also suggests
using the Nutter Center for wrestling and the UD Arena for judo.
</P>
<P>
   Vehr said he's had preliminary conversations with officials at
the proposed sites, but there have been no firm plans for using the
venues.

 &HT;    Downing of plane might give Russian intelligence something to
study
 &HT;    By Timothy R. Gaffney
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ For decades, technology sleuths at
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base have torn apart and studied
Russian-built warplanes to learn how they work _ and how to defeat
them.
</P>
<P>
   Now it might be Russia's turn.
</P>
<P>
   Russian counterparts to American foreign technology analysts are
undoubtedly eager to get their hands on pieces of the U.S. Air
Force F-117 Stealth fighter that crashed in Yugoslavia Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   If Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic turns over the wreckage
to Russian intelligence experts, they will comb it for clues to the
attack jet's vaunted radar-evading capability.
</P>
<P>
   An Air Force spokesman Monday downplayed the service's concern
about Russia's access to the wreckage but admitted ``there's always
a concern'' when military technology falls into potentially hostile
hands.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. no longer views Russia as an enemy, but Russia is
aligned with Serbia in opposing NATO's military actions. It also
exports many weapons, including anti-aircraft systems.
</P>
<P>
   The twisted, burned wreckage of the F-117 might yield little
useful information, or it might give up secrets that could make
Russian weapons more effective against Stealth _ an essential
feature in every new combat plane the U.S. has built or planned.
</P>
<P>
   For example, videos aired by Yugoslav television over the
weekend showed some large pieces of the aircraft exterior still
intact. The black jet's exterior skin and coatings are made of
special materials that absorb or scatter radar. Those pieces could
now be analyzed for their composition and tested against Russian
radars.
</P>
<P>
   The F-117 was the first aircraft lost by NATO forces since the
beginning of their air campaign against Yugoslav forces last week.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. and NATO officials still weren't saying Monday whether the
F-117 was downed by anti-aircraft fire. Citing unnamed U.S.
officials, some news reports said a surface to air missle made a
``really lucky'' hit, while others said a Yugoslav air defense
radar was able to track the jet.
</P>
<P>
   If so, it could mean Russia has already learned how to penetrate
the veil of stealth to at least some degree: Serbia's air defense
systems are Russian-made.
</P>
<P>
   The Aeronautical Systems Center at Wright-Patterson managed the
development and production of the F-117 in the 1970s and `80s, but
a spokeswoman referred questions about the downed jet to the Air
Combat Command.
</P>
<P>
   A command spokesman could not say Wednesday how concerned the
Air Force is about Russia's ability to learn much from the
wreckage.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always a concern about your highest technology falling
into enemy hands, but it's not our primary concern right now,''
said Air Force Lt. John Hutchinson, a spokesman for the Air Combat
Command at Langley Air Force Base in Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchinson said stopping Serbian aggression is the command's top
concern right now.
</P>
<P>
   He sought to downplay the likelihood that Russia will glean any
secrets from the wreckage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Based on the video footage we've seen, there really doesn't
seem to be much of the aircraft left,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the chance to study actual pieces of a Stealth aircraft can
only help Russian engineers improve whatever anti-Stealth
technology they may already have developed.
</P>
<P>
   At Wright-Patterson, the National Air Intelligence Center has
made a science of exploiting foreign aerospace technology since
World War II.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even in the Korean war, our guys went in and grabbed pieces of
crashed MiG-15s,'' NAIC spokesman Rob Young said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In one case, he said, a team from the then-named Air Technical
Intelligence Center used hand grenades to blast the wreckage of a
downed jet into pieces small enough to carry away in helicopters.
The pieces were spirited back to Wright-Patterson, where analysts
studied them and drew conclusions about the Russian-designed
fighter's capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of work still goes on.
</P>
<P>
   Young said NAIC's ``exploitation center'' at Wright-Patt has
three Russian-built MiG-29 fighters, similar to the five Yugoslav
MiG-29s shot down by NATO warplanes over the last week.
</P>
<P>
   The NAIC planes were part of a fleet of 21 MiG-29s the U.S.
government bought in 1997 from the cash-poor former Soviet republic
of Muldova.
</P>
<P>
   Young said NAIC would not comment on what it might know about
Russia's foreign-technology efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, there are things that are universal,'' he said, but
he declined to speculate on how Russia might try to exploit the
wreck of the F-117.

   She told him that she finds herself speechless when people come

U.S. SYSTEM BUILT TO WARD OFF MISSILE ATTACK FAILS A TEST

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ An experimental missile defense system on Monday
failed its most basic test for the sixth time, failing to hit a
missile launched at a New Mexico test site.
</P>
<P>
   While Monday's failure illustrates the daunting technical
challenges that have yet to be overcome, it also raises questions
about administration efforts to convince its Asian allies to
consider deploying a system that to date has never worked.
</P>
<P>
   Already, China has protested American plans to set up theater
missile defense systems with Japan, Korea and possibly Taiwan to
protect allied and American troops based in northeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question about the political sensitivity of
China,'' said Gerrit Gong, of the Center for Strategic and
International Studies. ``Analysts in Beijing and elsewhere who
follow this should be somewhat relieved that this is a very
complicated set of issues and technologies being developed that
have to be worked out over time.''
</P>
<P>
   The test failure on Monday will cost the prime contractor,
Lockheed Martin Corp., $15 million in penalties. And if the system
fails two more attempts to intercept missiles before June 30, the
company will be penalized another $20 million.
</P>
<P>
   The $3.89-billion program begun in the early 1990s has had a
nearly unending series of setbacks. But on Monday, both the
Pentagon and Lockheed Martin were upbeat about the tests.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came very close to hitting this target _ within 30 meters
or less _ and we're very encouraged by that,'' said Thomas A.
Corcoran, president and chief operating officer of the Lockheed
Martin Space Sector. ``Much of the operation was as it should be.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Pentagon, spokesmen emphasized that 16 of the 17
objectives of the tests were met.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very close miss, however, we do know it was a miss,''
said Jennifer Canaff, Pentagon spokesman. ``But we're positive
about Lockheed Martin and the system.''
</P>
<P>
   The next test of the system will be in May, followed by two more
tests before June 30.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the theater missile defense system say they
understand the difficulty of creating this complicated technology
but doubt that it will ever work well enough to be of any use.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they'll eventually hit something but the odds are
pretty slim that they are going to be able to consistently and
reliably hit every missile and that's what is required when you're
defending against a nuclear armed missile,'' said John Pike, a
defense analyst at the Federation of American Scientists.
</P>
<P>
   The theater missile defense system is meant to be used overseas
to knock out incoming missiles in battle zones and to protect U.S.
troops stationed at bases. The experimental system being developed
to protect the United States itself is at a much earlier stage of
development.
</P>
<P>
   The theater missile defense system has a shorter range and a
higher altitude and any success, or failure, in its development
will have little effect on a national missile defense system,
according to the Pentagon and defense analysts.
</P>
<P>
   The five earlier test failures were deeply disappointing to the
Pentagon and prompted Lockheed to overhaul its design team to head
off any suggestion of canceling the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, we replaced the team and put in new leadership,''
said Corcoran of Lockheed. ``We believed we needed greater control
of changes plus we needed design changes.``
</P>
<P>
   If Lockheed succeeds in its next tests and actually intercepts a
missile for the first time, the firm will move into the next phase
of engineering and manufacturing. The actual development of the
system is still years away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of what's going on here is simply bad luck,'' Pike said.
``But with six consecutive failures another problem has to be that
there is no margin for error so that if even the smallest thing
goes wrong it fails.''
</P>
<P>
   A continued series of failures of the Lockheed Martin system to
hit the target could eventually cost the company up to $75 million
in penalties.

DISPUTE OVER STUDENT ACTIVITY FEES REACHES SUPREME COURT 
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Fla., Wis., Texas., Va.)  (fb) 
 By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A nationwide dispute over student activity fees at
public universities reached the Supreme Court on Monday, as the
justices agreed to decide whether students have a constitutional
right to keep their money from going to groups whose political
messages they find objectionable.
</P>
<P>
   This case, from the University of Wisconsin, represents one
skirmish in a war that is being fought on campuses and in
courtrooms around the country by politically conservative students
who object to a portion of their mandatory activity fees going to
environmental, feminist, social action or gay rights groups.
</P>
<P>
   Five law students at Wisconsin, who described themselves as
conservatives and Christians, objected to 18 of more than 100
organizations that received cash grants from the student
government. The students won their suit both in the U.S. District
Court in Madison and in the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   These courts said the objecting students were in the same
position as union members who are entitled under Supreme Court
precedent to withhold the portion of their dues that goes to
support the union's political agenda. The First Amendment protects
the students against compelled speech, the lower courts said. Other
courts, including the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in a 1992
case from the State University of New York, have ruled that
students could be required to support activities that contributed
to a ``marketplace of ideas,'' including ideas they did not like.
</P>
<P>
   In its Supreme Court appeal, the University of Wisconsin said
the 7th Circuit decision misconstrued the issue and ``undermines
the traditional role of universities as centers of free speech.''
</P>
<P>
   Many universities share Wisconsin's system of imposing a
mandatory student fee and using a portion of it for various student
activities. The Supreme Court, in a 1995 case from the University
of Virginia, held that it was unconstitutional to exclude a
Christian student newspaper from eligibility for a share of the
activity fund there.
</P>
<P>
   That decision, Rosenberger vs. Rector and Visitors of the
University of Virginia, raised but did not resolve the question of
what rights individual students had to refuse to help subsidize an
undesired message.
</P>
<P>
   The issues have arisen at both private and public universities,
but since the Constitution applies only to government behavior, the
court cases have dealt only with public institutions.
</P>
<P>
   In the Wisconsin case, Board of Regents vs. Southworth, No.
98-1189, the university is arguing that the lower courts failed to
apply the logic of the Supreme Court's decision in the University
of Virginia case. The court in that case said that by its
distribution of student activity fees, the university had created a
type of public forum, in which discrimination on the basis of
message was constitutionally forbidden.
</P>
<P>
   The lesson for the new case, Wisconsin is arguing, is that
students whose fees go to support a panoply of viewpoints within a
public forum are not being compelled to support any one message.
Rather, their fees support the forum itself, in which they and
anyone else may speak. ``Learning to sort through, and at times
turn off, the multiplicity of ideas that find expression on a
university campus'' is a valuable part of the educational process,
the university's brief said.
</P>
<P>
   The amount of money at stake per student is small, under $10 a
semester, according to the university. Most of the fee of several
hundred dollars a semester goes for student health services, a
shuttle bus system, and other activities to which no one has raised
objections.
</P>
<P>
   The Wisconsin law students, represented by a conservative legal
organization, the Northstar Legal Center in Fairfax, Va., say they
object to the ``blatant political and ideological activism'' of the
Campus Women's Center, which lobbied against an anti-abortion
measure in the Wisconsin Legislature; the UW Greens, which
distributed literature for Ralph Nader's presidential campaign in
1996; and several organizations supporting gay rights.
</P>
<P>
   There were also these developments at the Court on Monday:
</P>
<P>
   _ AFFIRMATIVE ACTION: Over two dissenting votes, the court let
stand a ruling that invalidated an affirmative action plan to
increase the number of blacks and women in the higher ranks of the
Dallas Fire Department.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan, adopted in 1988 after an earlier consent decree
had failed to improve substantially the racial and gender balance
at the top levels, black and female firefighters who received
passing scores on promotional exams could be promoted to some
positions over white men with higher scores. In striking down the
plan, the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in New Orleans, said
there was insufficient evidence of past discrimination to justify
it.
</P>
<P>
   Justices Stephen G. Breyer and Ruth Bader Ginsburg objected that
there was ample evidence of past discrimination, including a
finding by the Justice Department in 1976 and failure to hire any
black firefighters until 1969.
</P>
<P>
   They said it was important for the court to provide guidance on
what kind of historical and statistical evidence could justify
affirmative action in a context such as this. The case was Dallas
vs. Dallas Fire Fighters Assoc., No. 98-966.
</P>
<P>
   _ SENTENCING RULES: Without comment, the court turned down an
appeal by a Florida inmate whose 11-year federal prison sentence
was based on a quantity of cocaine that police found in her home
after an illegal search. The evidence had been excluded from the
woman's trial, but was added for purposes of sentencing to the
smaller quantity that police found during a lawful search of her
car.
</P>
<P>
   Upholding the sentence, the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals,
in Atlanta, said that the exclusionary rule, which bars illegally
seized evidence at trial, does not apply to sentencing. The case
was Pryor vs. U.S., No. 98-7046.

IMF AGREES ON FRAMEWORK TO RESUME AID TO RUSSIA 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The International Monetary Fund said on Monday that
it agreed on ``a broad framework'' to resume financial aid to
Russia, but American officials immediately warned that they would
permit only enough support to keep Moscow from defaulting on
international loans.
</P>
<P>
   The vague accord, the first since Russia's economic meltdown
last summer, followed a hastily arranged meeting in Moscow between
Michel Camdessus, the managing director of the fund, and Prime
Minister Yevgeny Primakov of Russia. But only hours after
Primakov's aides suggested that the IMF would lend Russia more than
$8 billion this year, the fund denied that Camdessus had discussed
specific amounts.
</P>
<P>
   Other officials suggested that Russia would receive only a few
billion dollars this year. That would barely cover what Russia owes
the IMF this year, meaning that the aid may amount to a paper
transfer that allows Moscow a grace period on repaying its loans.
</P>
<P>
   American opposition to new loans to Russia is a reflection of
how deeply both diplomatic and economic relations between Moscow
and Washington have deteriorated in the past nine months.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, who helped engineer an IMF-led
$17-billion emergency bailout for Russia last year, is now
reluctant to provide more than token aid to the country. The July
bailout failed in August, when Russia devalued its currency and
then fired the team of economic reformers that the United States
was betting on to remake the Russian economy.
</P>
<P>
   Since then the IMF and Primakov have been involved in an
elaborate political and economic dance. Russia has refused many
politically painful economic reforms, but still insisted on a
resumption of aid. An accord was expected last week, when Primakov
was scheduled to arrive in Washington. But he turned his plane
around and returned home when he learned that NATO was planning to
begin its bombing campaign against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Now Russia's opposition to the NATO bombing and suggestions that
Moscow might quietly resume military aid to President Slobodan
Milosevic have greatly complicated the IMF negotiations with
Russia. That became clearer than ever on Monday when, only hours
after Primakov declared an IMF deal was imminent, the Russian
defense minister claimed that a Russian-made air defense system
sold to the Yugoslav military was responsible for shooting down a
U.S. F-117A Stealth fighter on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials said on Monday that they would open
themselves to congressional attack if they approved a resumption of
help to Moscow at a moment when Russia was resuming aid to
Milosevic. While the United States holds only an 18 percent vote on
the board of the fund, as a practical matter it could veto an aid
package. On Monday, officials went out of their way to make sure
that Primakov understood that the two issues were closely linked.
</P>
<P>
   ``A U.S. judgment about an IMF program,'' a senior
administration official said, ``would depend on Russian economic
policy actions and could also be influenced by broader political
developments,'' a clear reference to tangible Russian support for
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Kosovo was not straining relations with Moscow, the
United States was already trying to limit the IMF's re-engagement
with Moscow. American officials have already told the fund that
they would oppose offering what the Treasury refers to as ``new
resources'' to Russia, meaning that any loans could be used only
for repaying the fund or the World Bank. Under one possible scheme
under discussion, Russia would repay the fund, only to receive a
check for roughly the same amount the next day _ a move that, in
other contexts, is often referred to as check kiting.
</P>
<P>
   American officials have gone further, saying that by the end of
the year they want to make sure Russia pays more to the IMF in 1999
than the IMF pays Russia. But officials inside the World Bank and
the fund say they oppose that approach.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Camdessus was clearly seeking to mend fences in Moscow over the
weekend. He made a whirlwind tour of the Russian political elite,
meeting with parliamentary leaders, with directors of Gazprom, the
giant Russian natural gas company, and even dining with the
patriarch of Moscow and All Russia, Alexei II. He also talked on
the telephone with President Boris Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   Russia agreed to raise 60 billion rubles __ about $2.4 billion
at current exchange rates _ in new revenues, partly by postponing a
cut in Russia's value-added tax. The fund had protested the Russian
Duma's passage of the tax cut, noting that the VAT was one of the
few taxes that Russia successfully collects.
</P>
<P>
   The fund said it also reached an agreement with Russia that its
budget would run what is called a ``primary surplus'' of two
percent of the country's gross domestic product, or roughly $3
billion. The term refers to a surplus before payments for foreign
debts. But how the Russians would achieve that surplus, one senior
IMF official said, ``is still a considerable mystery.''

 &HT;    Article brings big response to VA benefit
 &HT;    By Mark Fisher
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ About 600 people _ just a fraction of those
eligible _ have applied for a newly restored federal benefit for
widows of military veterans who died in action or of a
service-related disability, Veterans Affairs officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   That tepid response shows how ineffective the VA has been in
publicizing the availability of the benefit, veterans' and
survivors' advocates said.
</P>
<P>
   A story in the Dayton Daily News Sunday highlighting the VA's
Dependency and Indemnity Compensation benefit triggered more than
125 calls to the Montgomery County Veteran's Service Center alone
Monday, Director Denver Combs said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the 18 years I've been doing this, this is the greatest
response I've seen'' from a story on veterans benefits, Combs said.
The response overloaded the center's staff; most of the callers
were asked to leave their names and phone numbers and will be
contacted by staff members for further information, hopefully
sometime today, Combs said.
</P>
<P>
   The DIC benefit _ a tax-free, $861-a-month minimum payment to
those who qualify _ was reinstated in September 1998 for those
whose spouses died in World War II, the Korean War or the Vietnam
War, and who are currently unmarried. Spouses also may qualify if
the veteran's death was the result of a service-related disability,
or if the veteran was disabled for 10 years prior to death. For
more information, call the veteran's service office in your county.
</P>
<P>
   Combs said he has seen very little publicity from the VA about
the restored benefit, which he has discussed during televised
question-and-answer sessions on local cable-access channels.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think (the VA) has done a very good job,'' Combs said.
``I've seen something on their web page, but how many widows surf
the 'net?''
</P>
<P>
   Margaret Murphy Peterson, national legislative director of the
Gold Star Wives of America , said the number of applications the VA
has received since the benefit's reinstatement represents the tip
of the iceberg. Federal officials last year estimated 6,000 people
may qualify nationwide; Gold Star, which represents veterans'
survivors, projected that number to reach 10,000. The federal
agency has no way of tracking subsequent marriages and divorces of
veterans' spouses and cannot pinpoint a number of those who meet
the criteria, a VA spokesman said last week.
</P>
<P>
   The spokesman said the agency sent out a news release about the
reinstated benefits last fall and worked with veterans' groups and
other organizations to try to get the word out, but he acknowledged
it was difficult to reach widows of veterans.
</P>
<P>
   Department spokeswoman Laurie Tranter said Monday the VA is
``working closely'' with the Gold Star Wives to spread the word of
the restored DIC benefits. The effort may receive a boost soon from
``syndicated columns'' on the subject, Tranter said.

COMMENTARY: BOMB, TALK, DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Now that NATO has made its point that it's serious about
degrading the Yugoslav army _ and President Slobodan Milosevic of
Yugoslavia has made his point that you can pound, kill and curse
the Serbs, but there's just one thing you can't do and that's make
peace in the Balkans without them _ it's time to get back to the
negotiating table before this situation spins out of control.
</P>
<P>
   I believe there is still a basis for a deal, but the Clinton
team has to be much clearer about U.S. interests in Kosovo. This
administration has given a dozen explanations for involvement. I
applaud its basic instinct to do something to prevent the slaughter
of civilians there. As a European power, the U.S. could not and
should not be indifferent to events in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But this administration committed America to a bad peace plan at
Rambouillet. The sooner we adjust it, the better. The
take-it-or-leave-it deal the United States offered the Serbs calls
for autonomy for the Kosovar Albanians for three years, protected
by NATO forces, and then final status negotiations, between Serbs
and Kosovo Albanians, on the ultimate fate of Kosovo. The Serbs
rejected both the deal's NATO peacekeepers and its implicit
commitment to Kosovo independence.
</P>
<P>
   The only reason the Kosovo Albanians accepted was because they
viewed Rambouillet as independence on a three-year installment
plan, protected by NATO and guaranteed by America with a wink.
</P>
<P>
   We have neither a moral nor a strategic interest in the
independence of Kosovo. Our moral interest in Kosovo is to prevent
the murder of innocent civilians, which can be done in the context
of protected autonomy for Kosovo's majority Albanian population.
And our strategic interest is that Kosovo not be independent. We do
not want to be formally or implicitly obligated to Kosovo
independence, because it would be an endless commitment, because it
would send an unrealistic message to Basques, Kurds and other
aggrieved ethnic groups that we will support their independence,
and because Albania is already a failed state. It doesn't need a
twin in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright never should have
supported a peace plan that committed the United States to anything
other than protected autonomy for Kosovo _ period, full stop, no
further negotiations, unless the parties themselves agree on
partition. And if the Kosovars would not have accepted such a plan,
then they should have been told they're on their own.
</P>
<P>
   So now what do we do? The Clinton team is going to have to eat
some crow _ and eventually they will. They need to put the United
States behind a new peace plan that is consistent with our own
moral and strategic interests, and which a decent Serb leader _ and
maybe even the war criminal Slobodan Milosevic _ will be tempted to
accept.
</P>
<P>
   Such a plan would: 1) Make clear that the only final status we
will ever support for Kosovo is autonomy. 2) The actual autonomy
framework should be based on the generous cultural and political
autonomy accorded the Kosovars in the 1974 Yugoslav Constitution _
not some foreign-imposed plan. 3) But to guarantee that autonomy
for Kosovars, the Serbs will have to permit the return of all the
refugees, and the entry of a foreign observer force, plus
peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   If the Serbs will not accept NATO peacekeepers then we should
think about using troops from the Partnership for Peace. The PFP is
a junior NATO made up of all the Eastern European countries that
aspire to be NATO members, as well as Russia. Having NATO-directed
and supported PFP forces on the ground can protect the Kosovars,
and having Russians among them can reassure the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   I'm all for U.S. activism. But there are big, important places
and there are small, less important ones. And the trick is
understanding the difference between the two and finding ways to
advance America's moral and strategic interests on the small
issues, such as Kosovo, without committing America in an
all-consuming way as though it were a big issue.
</P>
<P>
   I'm glad we're punishing the Serbs now for their ethnic
cleansing. It's barbaric. But punishment is not a policy. Wars are
fought for political ends. The Clintonites should rethink their
objectives in Kosovo now, and put on the table a plan that is good
for the average Kosovar, is acceptable for any decent Serb, and
makes sense for America. Otherwise, we will be bombing the Serbs
into accepting a plan that they will never keep and we shouldn't
want.

SUPREME COURT TO DECIDE IF STUDENT-ACTIVITY FEES VIOLATE FREE
SPEECH 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c. 1999 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court agreed Monday to decide whether a
state school violates the free-speech rights of its students by
requiring them to pay fees that are used to support groups which
they may oppose.
</P>
<P>
   The case pits the effort of public universities to ensure a
diversity of viewpoints on campus against students who do not want
to support groups with opinions and goals they find repugnant.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, the University of Wisconsin is urging the justices
to overturn a federal appeals court decision that struck down the
school's use of mandatory student-activity fees to pay for a gamut
of campus organizations, even when individual students object to
certain groups.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative Christian law students at the university have
successfully challenged the school so far, arguing that the use of
their money to support abortion-rights and gay-rights groups
violates their First Amendment right of free speech.
</P>
<P>
   The 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, upholding a lower court
decision, agreed with the students.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the university cannot discriminate in the disbursement of
funds, it is imperative that students not be compelled to fund
organizations that engage in political and ideological activities _
that is the only way to protect the individual's rights,'' the 7th
Circuit said.
</P>
<P>
   In its successful request that the court hear its appeal,
Wisconsin argued that a school's ability to be a forum for diverse
views would be undermined if it could not use student fees as a
general source of revenue to support various organizations with
different viewpoints. The state added that it distributes funds to
campus groups without any regard for the viewpoints they espouse.
</P>
<P>
   Countering the state, the law students argued that if the
justices eventually rule for the school, ``a state university could
force Jewish students to fund a Christian evangelical newspaper
(and) state universities could force African-American students to
fund neo-Nazi or Ku Klux Klan organizations.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund, a gay-rights group,
submitted a legal brief to the justices urging them to hear
Wisconsin's appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The few religious extremists who started this case should not
be allowed to dismantle an important avenue for fostering student
dialogue and debate because they don't like what some students
say,'' said Patricia Logue, a Lambda attorney who helped write the
group's brief. ``Campus groups have a long history of sparking
campus debate and engaging students in weighing new and contentious
ideas. We look to the Supreme Court to stop this narrow-minded
assault on a neutral system for supporting campus dialogue.''
</P>
<P>
   The high court is expected to render its decision in the case,
Board of Regents of the University of Wisconsin System vs.
Southworth, by July 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court also took the following actions Monday:
</P>
<P>
   Let the federal government continue giving extra help in winning
contracts on federal highway projects to companies owned by poorer

<P>
   Dilia Theodosakia can pinpoint the moment her apprehension about
the American-led bombing of Serbia, an operation she initially
considered the undertaking of a president she thoroughly distrusts,
lifted.
</P>
<P>
   It came last Wednesday, the first day of the attack, as she was
listening in her home near White Plains, N.Y., to her favorite
radio talk show, whose host, Bob Grant, she considers a
conservative soulmate. A guest on the show cast the conflict in
terms of the Holocaust, likening Serbian attacks on ethnic
Albanians in Kosovo to Hitler's destruction of Jews.
</P>
<P>
   ``What he said touched my heart,'' Mrs. Theodosakia said. ``He
mentioned that those people there are without protection and if we
don't help, who will help? It will be like the Jewish massacre in
World War II.''
</P>
<P>
   But over the past few days, as she continued to hear and watch
the news in between her everyday activities of church choir
practice, family meals and shopping, doubts began to gather once
more.
</P>
<P>
   She saw anguished Serbian-Americans on television expressing
fear for their relatives in Yugoslavia. She saw interviews with
frightened Kosovo Albanian refugees fleeing their homes. And her
misgivings about President Clinton returned in the form of
questions about the effectiveness of bombs in forcing two peoples
to live in peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the beginning it seemed very simple,'' Mrs. Theodosakia,
57, a retired secretary, said Monday. ``Now, you don't know who's
right and who's wrong. Both sides are human beings and both are
suffering.''
</P>
<P>
   As reports mount of casualties, bombs, refugees and protests, so
has public uncertainty over the NATO bombing campaign in
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   People who accepted the Clinton administration's portrayal of
the military strikes as a clear-cut moral obligation _ the
protection of a vulnerable ethnic minority from the brutality of
one stubborn man, Yugoslavia's president, Slobodan Milosevic _ have
begun to question just who this man is and what motivates him.
</P>
<P>
   In a series of interviews over the past five days with ordinary
people living and working in White Plains, which is in Westchester
County just outside New York City, those doubts have grown more
apparent as these people have absorbed more and more information,
pictures and commentary about Yugoslavia from television, radio and
newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   For most, the initial vision of the United States as a righteous
champion of good against evil remains instinctive and appealing. By
evoking World War II, and the image of a world that hesitated too
long in the face of Hitler's genocide, Clinton seemed to have
touched a chord in his address to the nation last week.
</P>
<P>
   Still, despite their lack of cynicism at the notion of the
United States as the international enforcer of justice, many people
tempered their idealism with skepticism about specific points _
about the president, the impartiality of the news media, the depth
of support from other NATO members, and official promises that
ground troops would not be deployed.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after the downing of an American warplane and the sight of
Serbs appearing to rally around their own president, the skepticism
is becoming more pronounced. Many of those interviewed _ retirees,
office workers, a shop owner, a maintenance man, a stockbroker _
said that the more they saw and heard over the past weekend, the
less they felt they understood the roots and possible outcomes of
this faraway conflict.
</P>
<P>
   And with that confusion has come the suspicion that the public
is not getting the full story of what has been and what will be in
Yugoslavia, either from journalists or from politicians.
</P>
<P>
   KURT OLSON
</P>
<P>
   ``At the beginning I really had very little information,'' said
Kurt Olson, the owner of Photo-Finish, a small film-processing
store in downtown White Plains. ``Now I understand, in a very
simple sense, that it's Serbians trying to cleanse ethnic
Albanians. But what I don't understand is: What is the conflict
between the Serbians and ethnic Albanians and why has it gone on so
long?
</P>
<P>
   ``If I knew that,'' he added, in an interview Monday, ``maybe I
could make a better judgment of how to put an end to this
conflict.''
</P>
<P>
   From the first, Olson said, he could support the military
assault on Yugoslavia as long as it was a NATO operation and not
just a unilateral crusade by the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel much more apprehension when NATO is not behind the
operations,'' he explained last week, as he helped customers in his
small shop on Mamaroneck Avenue in the morning after the first
allied bombers attacked Yugoslav military targets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since it is,'' he added then, ``it reinforces that this part
of it is justified. It's not just Great Britain and the United
States.''
</P>
<P>
   But after a weekend's worth of watching television images of
attacks on U.S. embassies in Europe and Serbian demonstrations in
support of Milosevic, Olson has started to wonder if the seamless
alliance he counted on really exists.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we just had some personal agenda for whatever reason, I
would assume NATO would not back us,'' he said Monday. ``But I'd
like to know if there's a third opinion out there, maybe from the
other members of NATO. What is their justification and their reason
for wanting to stop the Serbs?''
</P>
<P>
   He is growing increasingly wary of relying exclusively on
American sources of information, particularly the mainstream
television, radio and newspaper reports.
</P>
<P>
   ``The media reports we get in the United States say the Serbians
are trying to put an end to this whole race of people and that's
obviously wrong,'' Olson said. ``I would like to get some other
countries' points of view.''
</P>
<P>
   His plan, he added, is to conduct his own research on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll type in `Kosovo' and I'm sure there will be 100,000
sites. Then I'll just pick some from another country,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   BILL CLARK
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clark, a Vietnam veteran who works at the Westchester
County Board of Elections, also has little faith in the accuracy of
mainstream news outlets. He said he came by his caution the hard
way.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Vietnam, they would say at night on the news that there
were 50 casualties that day, when I knew there were thousands,'' he
recalled last week, as he sat in the sun on a bus bench during his
lunch break. ``I listen to the talk shows on the radio. You get a
more honest view. I sit up at night and listen to the shows. You
listen to the topic. You get a lot of views.''
</P>
<P>
   On that Thursday, the second day in the bombing campaign, Clark,
a former marine who was born in Panama, was ambivalent about the
correctness of the NATO operation. He said he was firmly against
the use of ground troops ``unless it is necessary.'' It would only
be necessary, he added, if the United States itself were
threatened.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he added, the United States was justified in using force
during the 1991 Gulf war against Iraq and the Iraqi president,
Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   ``That guy Saddam was harassing some other country. Was it
Iran?'' Clark said as he tried to recall the historical
particulars. ``And action had to be taken. But we didn't accomplish
much.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're going to bomb, bomb where it hurts the right
target,'' he added. ``I spent two years in Vietnam and I saw kids
dying like flies out there. I was just 19 myself when I was out
there. They kept saying it was going to be over and it was going to
be over.''
</P>
<P>
   As the NATO campaign dragged on, Clark said he began to see more
parallels with the war he personally experienced and never fully
understood. And that makes him even more ambivalent about taking
sides and fully accepting the official view that military action is
justified to rein in the Serbs of Yugoslavia and Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm like this,'' he said. ``Until I walk in another man's
shoes, I can't judge him. I'm not going to condemn the Serbs
because I don't know what their situation is.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel very, very strongly about that,'' added Clark Monday,
after a weekend spent with family, during which the war in
Yugoslavia took a distant second place to sports as a topic of
discussion. ``We are going to start getting casualties from this.
And I don't want another Vietnam.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   MARTHA MCCAULEY
</P>
<P>
   Like many people, Martha McCauley sifts the information she gets
about the conflict and killing in Yugoslavia through the filter of
her own experiences.
</P>
<P>
   A 69-year-old retired IBM worker who volunteers four days a week
as a teacher's aide at the same White Plains parochial school she
attended as a child, Mrs. McCauley has been paying close attention
to news about the bombing of Yugoslavia and reports of Serbian
atrocities against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're a reader, how can you miss it?'' she said last week,
standing watch over the playground of the St. John's the Evangelist
Church the day after the NATO airstrikes began.
</P>
<P>
   A faithful viewer of network television news and CNBC, and a
regular reader of the White Plains daily newspaper, the Journal
News, as well as Newsweek magazine and The Sunday New York Times,
Mrs. McCauley said she felt from the start that she understood the
stakes and the story.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have to do this,'' she said. ``This Mihikovic, this
Mikilovic _ I can never remember his name _ doesn't seem to want
peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing she saw on television or read over the next few days
shook her resolve that the United States is correct and even
obligated to protect Kosovo Albanians from Milosevic. Indeed, over
the weekend, seeing bedraggled Kosovo refugees being interviewed
after seeking safe haven in neighboring Macedonia and Albania, Mrs.
McCauley said she became even more determined in her condemnation
of the Yugoslav president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard two people talking on CNBC and once said that this man
has always wanted to be in power and that's his main thing,'' she
recalled. ``And the other one, was this older Jewish fellow, and he
said there were reports way, way back of men being put on trains
and shot. He said it was like Hitler.
</P>
<P>
   ``And really, to me, I think this man has the mentality of
someone like Hitler,'' Mrs. McCauley added. ``I just don't think
he's going change and it is going to get worse and worse.''
</P>
<P>
   A note of buoyant pride slipped into her conversation the longer
the NATO campaign continued. She spoke, again and again, of her
father, who was drafted in World War II and left three children and
a wife to fight on the European front.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very hard for us all,'' she recalled. ``But, you know,
in later years I thought about father over there in Germany and
with the field artillery in France and I was kind of proud he was
one of those stopping those horrible things happening over there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's wonderful,'' Mrs. McCauley added, ``that our
country helps people.''
</P>
<P>
   DILIA THEODOSAKIA
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Theodosakia, the retired secretary, said she felt much the
sense of pride and satisfaction over the American role in what has
been explained as a mission to save ethnic Albanians from Serb
brutality.
</P>
<P>
   But with the relentless bombing over the past days, reports of
Serb civilian casualties and even the prospect that the celebration
of Easter could be marred by continued war, she has started to
waver in her convictions. She said she dreads the thought that
Clinton might send ground troops into battle.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he does that, we'll have casualties,'' she said. ``I know
he promised he wouldn't, but the thing about the president is he
goes back and forth. One day it's yes. One day it's no.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We all thought that the bombs would last, maybe, a week, and
it would all be over,'' she added. ``But now people are starting to
attack our embassies. Did you hear? Even in Greece there were
people protesting against us.''
</P>
<P>
   The protest made a particular impression because Mrs.
Theodosakia's husband is of Greek origin. She herself was born in
Puerto Rico and, ever since the company where she worked closed
down two years ago, has been busy studying for her state exam to
become a registered nutritionist.
</P>
<P>
   But she makes time to stay informed about the world, and several
times a week she visits her local library to read The Washington
Post and The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it comes to things that concern the world, I'm
interested,'' said Mrs. Theodosakia. ``I'm interested because I
pray and I direct my prayers.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that her certainty about the war in Yugoslavia is slipping
away, she is praying for everyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was listening to reports about the demonstrations in New
York City, by both Albanians and by Serbs,'' Mrs. Theodosakia said
Monday. ``I said to myself, what would I do if I wanted to join in
with one of those? And I realized that one day I would have to go
with the Albanians and one day, go with the Serbs. Because it's
very hard to take sides.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing is,'' she added, ``it's something between them,
isn't it? They have to learn to live in peace with one another.''

BRITISH AND IRISH PREMIERS URGE COMPROMISE IN BELFAST 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By JAMES F. CLARITY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST, Northern Ireland _ As an Easter deadline approached,
Prime Ministers Tony Blair of Britain and Bertie Ahern of Ireland
sought Monday night to persuade Northern Ireland's Protestant and
Roman Catholic leaders to compromise on the dispute that is
threatening to collapse the peace effort here.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute is over the disarmament of the overwhelmingly
Catholic Irish Republican Army, which refuses to surrender a single
weapon, or an ounce of explosives. Protestant leaders say that if
the IRA does not disarm, its political wing, Sinn Fein, will be
excluded later this week from a cabinet of the new Northern Ireland
Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   The Assembly is supposed to carry out the peace agreement
approved in Belfast last April 10, designed to end 30 years of
sectarian warfare in this British province.
</P>
<P>
   Blair, arriving here after spending the day in London dealing
with the situation in Kosovo, looked grim, saying before he met the
politicians that if they failed, this would be ``the greatest
betrayal of the people I can think of.''
</P>
<P>
   Ahern arrived from Dublin, where he had been under pressure to
state neutral Ireland's position on the NATO attacks in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is small buns compared to Kosovo,'' one British official
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not to those involved in it,'' replied a colleague.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night's talks came after a day of apparently fruitless
discussions between the two principal political adversaries, Gerry
Adams, leader of Sinn Fein, and David Trimble, leader of the
Protestant Ulster Unionist Party, who is also first minister of the
Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   Trimble has the power to deprive Sinn Fein of ministerial posts
in the new cabinet and said he would do so unless he was convinced
that the IRA had made a ``credible beginning'' to disarmament.
</P>
<P>
   If Sinn Fein were excluded, officials and experts say, the peace
effort would be crippled, if not destroyed, possibly leading to a
new round of sectarian violence between paramilitaries of the
Protestant majority and the Catholic minority.
</P>
<P>
   The peace agreement approved a year ago would give more
political power to this province's Catholic minority, and give more
influence in northern affairs to the overwhelmingly Catholic
Republic of Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   Adams points out that the peace agreement does not require
disarmament before May, 2000, and that the IRA's 21-month
cease-fire is evidence of its support for peace.
</P>
<P>
   An Easter deadline for agreement had been set after Mo Mowlam,
Britain's Northern Ireland secretary, said she would start the
process of naming a cabinet this Wednesday or Thursday. The new
cabinet must be formed in order to pave the way for the transfer of
home rule powers to the Assembly. The province has been governed
directly by Britain since 1972.
</P>
<P>
   While she could extend the deadline, as she has in the past, Ms.
Mowlam invited the two prime ministers to her official residence
outside Belfast Monday night to meet Northern Ireland political
leaders with a view to achieving a compromise in the next two days.
</P>
<P>
   While the IRA has repeatedly said unequivocally that it will not
disarm, politicians were looking anxiously to the guerrilla
organization's annual Easter proclamation, expected this week, for
a change of tone, possibly softening its stand on disarmament.
</P>
<P>
   Officials and experts note that any compromise would have to be
one that both Adams and Trimble could defend as honorable to their
hard-line supporters.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ If NATO nations ordered ground troops to Kosovo, a
force of 30,000 to 40,000 troops could be assembled in days and
would be sufficient to protect many refugees from further attack,
according to several current and former American commanders.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials have emphasized they are not planning to send
ground troops into Kosovo, but American generals had estimated that
any ground action would require as many as 200,000 soldiers to
quell the fighting, a force that would not be ready for months.
Thus far, allied political leaders have balked at committing even a
single soldier to combat in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   The commanders said the smaller number of troops, backed by air
power, could sweep into the besieged province and create safe
havens for the tens of thousands of ethnic Albanian refugees who
are fleeing the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Retired Gen. George Joulwan, who was NATO's military commander,
said that elements of a 12,000-member European force in Macedonia
poised to enforce any peace agreement in Kosovo could be assigned
the mission of protecting refugees from further attack.
</P>
<P>
   An expeditionary unit of 2,200 Marines is afloat in the
Adriatic. A 1,200-member American reinforced infantry unit is based
in Italy. In Bosnia, 8,200 troops from the elite 1st Cavalry
Division in the international peacekeeping force could be tapped.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have to go all the way to Belgrade,'' Joulwan said
in a telephone interview from Madrid. ``You'd give that force
limited objectives, create a corridor, focus on the refugees and
save some lives.''
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of the military urgency, the Joint Chiefs of Staff on
Monday called on short notice a meeting in their secure situation
room to discuss developments in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   While confronting the approximately 40,000 Yugoslav troops in
and around Kosovo would pose enormous risks, a NATO force of equal
size would have several advantages, the commanders said.
</P>
<P>
   Belgrade's infantry and armored forces are untested against
well-trained NATO troops and would be targeted by a withering air
attack. Yugoslavia's heavy weapons would come under fierce attack
from allied artillery and tanks, which are trained to engage the
enemy from miles away.
</P>
<P>
   And with NATO warplanes controlling Serbian skies and bombing
supply, fuel and communication lines, Yugoslav forces would be cut
off and isolated from reinforcements, military experts say. NATO's
edge in intelligence and reconnaissance would also give the allied
forces important advantages.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're credible, but we shouldn't be overawed by their
army,'' said Lt. Gen. William Carter III, a retired chief of staff
of Southern NATO forces who helped direct the allied operation in
Bosnia. ``In many cases, our respect has been translated into
making them taller than they are. I'm not convinced we need the
size forces that people are talking about.''
</P>
<P>
   Adm. Leighton Smith, a former commander of southern NATO forces,
agreed: ``It's entirely possible you might be willing to take a
geographic area and make it a demilitarized zone. That might
require a much smaller force than one to eject the Serb army from
Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   Virtually all of these former commanders, as well as several
current ranking officers, said at the very least, NATO and
administration officials should not be so adamant about ruling out
a ground campaign, if nothing else than to give President Slobodan
Milosevic pause.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've telegraphed that we're not prepared to come in on the
ground, and that's coloring his reaction to the air campaign,''
said one senior Army general. ``Milosevic figures he can string
this out, and see if the NATO alliance cracks.''
</P>
<P>
   While political leaders continue to rule out ground forces
publicly, there are signs that allied officials are leaving the
door ever so slightly ajar for a ground option. Asked Monday if any
contingency planning was under way for land forces, NATO spokesman
Jamie Shea said, ``Not for the time being.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Army logisticians on their own conducted a detailed
assessment of what American forces in a Kosovo operation might
need, patterning such a contingency on the four-year-old
peacekeeping mission in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking at how you link things in Bosnia like supply
lines and electronic lines, into the theater in Kosovo,'' said one
senior officer. ``We haven't received any official directive to do
this. It's just prudent planning.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, without a peace agreement, NATO ground forces would
face a daunting set of perils. Between 17,000 and 20,000 Yugoslav
troops now occupy Kosovo, an area the size of Connecticut, with
another 20,000 soldiers outside the region.
</P>
<P>
   These forces are equipped with more than 400 tanks, 300 armored
personnel carriers and more than 400 artillery pieces in the field,
or in garrison, Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   There are only 14 roads into Kosovo, Bacon said, two from
Macedonia, and these roadways and bridges are pocked with land
mines. In addition to regular army forces, there are roving
paramilitary groups that could threaten NATO forces with guerrilla
or terrorist attacks.
</P>
<P>
   A NATO operation forcibly entering Kosovo would have to
anticipate all these threats. Last fall, NATO determined in a
confidential assessment it would take 200,000 troops to invade and
occupy Kosovo, and several weeks to muster those troops.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, President Clinton remains opposed to using
ground troops to supplement the air strikes, despite growing calls
for him to do so.
</P>
<P>
   But some administration officials say the real hurdle to sending
ground forces is political, not military. The administration has
not prepared the American public, Congress or its NATO allies for a
protracted, even if limited, ground operation.
</P>
<P>
   Few, if any, American officials predicted Milosevic's defiantly
brutal response. As a result, administration officials acknowledge
there has been little formal planning for a ground option.
</P>
<P>
   ``We miscalculated,'' conceded one administration official who
is deeply involved in the crisis. ``We thought when the bombing
started Milosevic would play the victim, not turn into Adolph
Hitler Jr.''
</P>
<P>
   With reports of atrocities mounting and hundreds of thousands of
refugees on the move, pressure to launch a ground operation may be
inexorable if the air campaign fails to stop the Yugoslav
offensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the killings continue, how can you have 12,000 NATO troops
5 to 10 miles from where the atrocities are being committed, and do
nothing?'' Joulwan asked.

AFTER 3 BRUTAL YOSEMITE KILLINGS, A FAMILY ENDURES A PAINFUL
SILENCE

<P>
   EUREKA, Calif. _ A grief-stricken but defiant Jens Sund says the
killer of his wife, Carole, his teen-age daughter Julie and a
family friend, Silvina Pelosso, should expect no mercy from his
family.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll personally pull the switch,'' Sund vowed. ``I believe in
capital punishment. And I believe whoever is responsible for this
deserves to die.''
</P>
<P>
   Sund said the discovery of Julie's body last Thursday on a vista
overlooking a reservoir in the foothills _ six days after the
bodies of her mother, 42, and Silvina, 16, were found stuffed in
the trunk of a burned rental car _ allows him and his three other
children to seek closure to a family tragedy that began to unfold
last month.
</P>
<P>
   Although the fate of the missing trio from Eureka is now known,
six weeks after they mysteriously disappeared on Feb. 15 while on a
trek to Yosemite National Park, many questions remain unanswered.
Still unknown is when and where they were abducted, when they were
separated and who killed them.
</P>
<P>
   For Jens Sund and his surviving children, it has been a tortuous
time. ``It's very difficult. Sometimes it's almost unbearable, but
we have to go on,'' he said on Sunday in an interview that broke
his public silence.
</P>
<P>
   He said he has no plans to visit the sites where the bodies were
found.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will mourn them here. This is our home,'' Sund said.
</P>
<P>
   Sund sat at his kitchen table and talked quietly about his
family's loss and his determination to continue his wife's work
with abused children. Sund said he finds it incomprehensible that
Carole, a woman who tried to help troubled children avoid a life of
crime, was herself a murder victim.
</P>
<P>
   When the FBI called to tell him that her body had been found in
the trunk of the rental car, Sund said it was devastating. ``Even
though I had had weeks to expect the worse, it hit me very hard,''
he said. He bundled up his children and retreated to a cabin at a
ranch along the Mad River owned by Carole's parents, Carole and
Francis Carrington.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no telephone or television. We heat with a wood stove.
It's always been a very special place for all of us,'' Sund said.
``There's cooking to do. Household chores to be done. I go to my
office now and then. But sometimes I feel like I'm just going
through the motions.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after they married, Carole and Jens Sund moved to Eureka
where he joined her father's development business. Carole, while
maintaining her own real-estate loan business, for the past 15
years was the family organizer, he said. She became involved in
local schools and in programs to help troubled children.
</P>
<P>
   Julie, 15, was the eldest sister to three adopted siblings.
``That girl loved life from the very beginning,'' her father said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Juliana's Giant Scrapbook'' brims with photos of family
outings, a letter from the grammar school and ticket stubs to the
film ``Titanic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Julie was going to get somewhere,'' he said. ``She wanted to
be an architect. She was a very determined young woman.''
</P>
<P>
   In the living room, Sund pointed to the old oak piano that Julie
played regularly. ``It is the silence now that can be the most
difficult,'' Sund said.
</P>
<P>
   By appearing on ABC-TV's ``Good Morning America'' and NBC's
``Today'' show on Monday, Sund said he hoped to further the youth
programs his wife worked for. ``People keep asking us what they can
do. I know Carole would want to help the children,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As Easter approached, Sund said he prepared for sharply
conflicting emotions. Carole Sund had already bought Easter
presents for her children and their cousins.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always been a happy time. But I don't look forward to
Easter without Carole and Julie,'' he said. Sund said he most
misses his wife's companionship. ``There are times when I want to
call her and ask her how she thinks this is all going. I know she'd
have it better organized.''

   Bypassing Louvre Lines With On-Line Tickets &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Visitors to Paris can now avoid long lines for entrance to the
Louvre. Advance tickets are available on the Internet through
Ticket Web, an Oakland-based online ticketing company. The tickets,
good for admission any time until Jan. 31, 2000, to the Louvre's
permanent collection, can be purchased at www.ticketweb.com or
through the Louvre's Web site, www.louvre.fr. Tickets are also
available at (510) 594-1400; fax (510) 594-1401. Ticket Web accepts
Mastercard and Visa. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ticket holders enter through the Richelieu Passage, a separate
entrance between the Place du Palais Royal and the Cour Napoleon.
Prices for March _ the price is updated the 1st of each month,
based on the exchange rate _ were $7.50 for entrance before 3 p.m.
and $4.50 after 3 p.m. and on Sunday (the first Sunday of each
month is free). There is a service fee of $1 an order and $1.60 a
ticket. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Louvre is open daily except Tuesday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.,
and until 9:45 p.m. on Monday and Wednesday. &QL;

<P>
   Where the Big Ones Are Always Reeled In &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fishing enthusiasts visiting Fort Lauderdale, Fla., don't have
to be on a boat to enjoy their sport. This winter the World Fishing
Center, a museum and recreational complex, opened with exhibits and
hands-on displays about freshwater and saltwater fishing. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The center has 10 themed areas, including a World Fishing Hall
of Fame with records and documents recounting great fishing feats,
and a Catch Gallery with video simulation where visitors can engage
in virtual fishing with the help of experts.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a Fish Gallery, with a display of aquatic life; a
Tackle Gallery that features antique and contemporary rods, reels
and lures, and a Places Gallery, where visitors can use electronic
maps and touch-screen technology to research the best places to
fish the world over.
</P>
<P>
   For children under 8, there is a Discovery Room, where they can
assemble imaginary fish, or dress in full fishing gear, ride in a
boat and negotiate imaginary waters in search of magnetic fish. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Outside, a boardwalk surrounded by three and a half acres of
swamp, marshland and mangroves leads through some of Florida's
natural habitats. A marina display includes six fishing boats,
among them the Wheeler, sister ship of Ernest Hemingway's Pilar. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The center is on a 51-acre tract near Fort Lauderdale's airport.
The circular entrance road surrounds a 5,000-pound stainless-steel
sculpture by Kent Ullberg depicting a swordfish. In the main lobby,
the floor resembles the bottom of the sea, while wooden boats and
aluminum fish hover overhead.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Admission is $9, $7 for 65 and older, $5 for ages 3 to 12 and
free for children under 3. The center is open every day except
Christmas. Information: (954) 922-4212. &QL;

   Several Red Sea Reefs Open Again to Divers &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   n response to requests from tour operators and scuba divers, the
Egyptian government has decided to allow diving once again off
about 15 islands in the Red Sea where it had been prohibited
because of ecological concerns. It is now permitted at Zabargad,
Rocky, Brothers and Abul Kizan islands, with limits on the number
of divers. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Two trips are allowed each week: a one-week excursion to the
Brothers islands and a 12-day tour of the other islands. Each tour
group may have no more than six boats, with a maximum of 15 divers
a boat. The diving fee is $5 a person. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   These islands are well known for their coral reefs and diverse
fish populations. More than 10 islands in the Red Sea are still off
limits to divers for conservation reasons. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   More information about scuba diving in Egypt is available from
the Egyptian Tourist Authority, 630 Fifth Avenue, Suite 1706, New
York, N.Y. 10111, (212) 332-2570, or www.touregypt.net. &QL;

   Meiji Treasures Displayed in Delaware &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen years after Commodore Matthew Perry led an American
fleet into Tokyo Bay in 1853 and began to open Japan to the West,
the Shogun warlords there put down their swords and the emperor was
restored to power. The years that followed, until 1912, are known
as the Meiji era. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Splendors of Meiji: Treasures of Imperial Japan,'' which opens
at the First USA Riverfront Arts Center in Wilmington, Del., on
Saturday, will showcase the art of that period. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 450 works of art in metal, lacquer, bronze, ceramic,
enamel and porcelain, made as Japan was emerging from centuries of
isolation, will be on view. Among the highlights are a bejeweled
silver koro, or incense burner, shaped like an elephant; a gold
lacquer cabinet; a lacquered elephant-tusk vase, and a highly
enameled and gilded ceramic bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these objects were made by the ``artists to the Imperial
household,'' about a dozen men singled out by the emperor for their
craftsmanship. Before entering the seven Japanese-style display
galleries, visitors may stop for an eight-minute film that presents
a historical overview of Japan at the time. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The works are now part of the Khalili Collection, assembled by
Nasser D. Khalili, an Iranian-born collector who lives in London
and also owns troves of Islamic art, Middle Eastern antiquities,
and Indian and Swedish textiles. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition, which closes on Sept. 6, will be open daily
(last entry is 6 p.m.). Admission is $13, with discounts for
seniors, students and children. Dated and timed tickets are
available at (302) 777-1600 or (888) 395-0005 or at the box office.
</P>
<P>
   More than 20 hotels in the Wilmington area are offering
overnight packages, including tickets. Prices for double-occupancy
rooms start at $118 and go up to $325 or higher. Information: (302)
652 4088. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The First USA Riverfront Center is at 800 South Madison Street
in Wilmington. &QL;

   For Las Vegas Gamblers, Now It's Debt in Venice &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Another Las Vegas milestone will be reached on April 22 when
gondolas appear in the desert, courtesy of the Venetian Resort
Hotel Casino, across the Strip from the Mirage. Besides the Grand
Canal, other Venetian landmarks reproduced at the hotel are the
Campanile, St. Mark's Square, the Ca' d'Oro and (for unlucky
bettors) the Bridge of Sighs. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Standard rooms (there are 2,718, plus 318 suites) measure about
700 square feet, with two beds equipped with draped canopies, a
sunken living-room area and two 27-inch TV sets. Baths, 130 square
feet, will be well paved with Italian marble. Each room will be
equipped with a fax-copier-printer with separate telephone line and
three dual-line phones.
</P>
<P>
   If all that sounds businesslike, it's no accident: the hotel is
connected to the Sands Expo and Convention Center, one of the
largest in the country. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The culinary doges overseeing restaurants at the Venetian will
include Joachim Splichal, Emeril Lagasse and Wolfgang Puck.
Gondoliers get a break at the Venetian: they work indoors, out of
the heat, on a waterway through the Grand Canal Shoppes, an
air-conditioned mall that will be fully operational by May 14, with
traditional glassblowers and mask makers in addition to upscale
merchants. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   During daylight hours, when the clock in the Campanile chimes
the hour, 400 to 500 white homing pigeons will be released outside
and circle the landmarks in the square before returning to their
roost in the hotel's parking garage. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But Rome wasn't built in a day, and ditto for Venice: the hotel
spa, a branch of the Canyon Ranch, and the pool area won't be ready
until June. Room rates will range from $119 to $399, with an
average of $167; to reserve, it's (888) 283-6423 or on the Web at
www.venetian.com. &QL;

REPUBLICANS, DEMOCRATS SWAP POSITIONS ON MILITARY INTERVENTION 
 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
c. 1999 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When Ronald Reagan dispatched U.S. troops to the
tiny Caribbean Island of Grenada in 1983, Republicans in Congress
cheered his courage for confronting the Marxist regime. Many
Democrats questioned his use of military firepower to stamp out
world conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   And when George Bush sought congressional approval to move
against Iraq in 1991, Republicans backed him, arguing that the
region was of strategic importance to the U.S. Many Democrats,
meanwhile, fretted that the president would be plunging the nation
into another Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   However, when Democrat Bill Clinton won the White House, the
positions on Capitol Hill were reversed. Congressional Democrats
who once questioned bombing campaigns abroad have largely stood
behind the president as he sent troops to Haiti and launched
airstrikes in Bosnia and now Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, who just a decade ago argued for a strong U.S.
military presence around the world, have been critical of Clinton's
military forays, arguing that he is meddling in too many foreign
disputes.
</P>
<P>
   On the Senate vote endorsing the Kosovo strikes, only 16
Republicans joined all but three Democrats in approving the
administration's action. By contrast, on the resolution endorsing
the Persian Gulf War, only 10 Democrats joined Republicans in
approving that action.
</P>
<P>
   Experts cite a range of reasons for the flip in party stands,
from increasing isolationism in the Republican Party to a confusion
of what U.S. foreign policy should be in the aftermath of the Cold
War.
</P>
<P>
   Some longtime political observers say the switch is hardly
surprising, given the pressure on members of Congress to back a
president of the same party.
</P>
<P>
   ``If George W. Bush were president, I suspect that some of the
Republicans would become interventionists and Democrats would be
less interventionist,'' said former Texas House Democrat Charles
Wilson, who often backed his party and the GOP in supporting
military action.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that Republicans appear to harbor a great degree of
antipathy toward Clinton. ``They just don't believe him,'' Wilson
said.
</P>
<P>
   The president's decision to commence airstrikes against
Yugoslavia occurred soon after Clinton's impeachment trial, which
strained party relations on Capitol Hill and may have caused an
irreparable rift between Congressional Republicans and the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the byproducts of the kind of partisanship we have seen
on Capitol Hill is the knee-jerk reactions on both sides. You have
Republicans who oppose the president simply on the basis of
partisanship, and Democrats who are backing him, who in other
circumstances would be savaging him,'' said Charles Cook, a
political analyst.
</P>
<P>
   Others said that many of the lawmakers tend to take their cue
from party leaders on international matters, particularly with the
demise of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cold War mentality was so much easier to deal with. There
were clear enemies. We knew the good guys and the bad guys. There
was a consensus on many of the fundamentals. The consensus today is
gone, and like so much else in Washington, it is all about politics
and who wins and who loses,'' said Mark Rozell, professor of
political science at the University of Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, neither party has developed a coherent policy to
deal with international relations. Some experts believe Clinton has
been operating on an ad hoc basis in deciding where to intervene,
while Republicans have not been able to coalesce behind a single
philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neither party has a coherent vision of foreign policy. No one
has figured out the post-Cold War matrix,'' said Marshall Wittman,
an analyst at the conservative Heritage Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Political experts have noted the increasing isolationism within
the Republican Party, articulated by such leading figures as
presidential candidate Pat Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   The politicians also cannot rely on the public for direction,
since polls show that many voters are confused and ambivalent about
military actions.
</P>

 SPORTS COLUMN: FINAL FOUR _ THE SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST 
</HEADLINE>

 By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ Just by being here, they were superior
beings, the Dukies and the Huskies.
</P>
<P>
   They had outlived the other 308 Division I teams in the land,
had lived through conference tournaments, subregionals, regionals
and the Saturday semifinals, just to entertain the nation Monday
night.
</P>
<P>
   In the national college basketball final, Duke was taking on
Connecticut in just about the ugliest domed stadium ever slapped
down on the face of this earth.
</P>
<P>
   The two schools had trekked through the killer month of March,
through changes of weather, changes of climate and jet lag in the
case of Connecticut. (Duke has so much prestige that it was never
even forced to reset its clocks, both internal and external.)
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, the two schools had endured every vicious germ the
airlines so generously recycle in their air systems: every flu,
every bug, every virus, every microbe, every streptococcus, every
ache, every pain, every vague malaise that air travelers pass back
and forth to each other through the alleged ventilation.
</P>
<P>
   Flying around the continent for the last four months, being
sneezed upon by thousands of strangers, these two teams had
probably been within a degree or two of separation from every
illness known to humankind. While most frequent travelers come down
with a new sore throat, a new headache, for every frequent-flier
segment, these kids were still running up and down the court.
Amazing.
</P>
<P>
   Duke's only loss may indeed have been traced to the flu, during
its longest trek of the season, out to Alaska at the end of
November. With Shane Battier just staggering back from the flu,
Duke lost, 77-75, to Cincinnati, which Coach Mike Krzyzewski
mentioned the other day _ not that Coach K was making excuses, mind
you.
</P>
<P>
   After two trips to wintry Chicago and one to New York in
January, Duke then romped over three rivals in the Atlantic Coast
Conference tournament in Charlotte, N.C. Gone are the bizarre old
days when the second-best team in the country could be left out of
the national tournament for the sin of losing the ACC final, but
Duke took no chances.
</P>
<P>
   Things worked out so well for Duke in Charlotte that the
National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament committee let
the Blue Devils stay right there for the East subregional, and they
then romped up the interstate to their home away from home in the
Meadowlands for the regional.
</P>
<P>
   Then down here in Florida, they beat Michigan State in the
semifinal in the most lopsided 68-62 game anybody will ever see,
after which Coach K lectured us that these were two great teams
that had just played a great basketball game.
</P>
<P>
   Duke's 37-1 record going into Monday night indicates character,
talent and strength _ and good immunity, too.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut, with its 32-2 record, had actually overcome greater
demons, both bacteriological and psychological. The Huskies romped
through the season with the gloomy history of never having
qualified for the Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   Their longest trip was in August, for a series of exhibitions,
where they visited the Changing of the Guard in London and rode
camels in Israel, after which they came home and trudged through
the sinus-challenging schedule of the Big East _ one game in Miami,
and a lot of places in the land of the wind chill factor.
</P>
<P>
   March was the real test. The Huskies came down to the big city
and were nearly beaten by Seton Hall before winning, 57-56, in
their first game of the Big East tournament, after which they won
two by wide margins.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the sojourn. There was a nasty snow squall in Denver,
and when the snow stopped, Denver was dun brown in early March, its
mile-high oxygen supply challenging their lungs and their muscles.
Coach Jim Calhoun kept running in fresh bodies, and the Huskies won
two easily.
</P>
<P>
   Having adjusted to Mountain time, the Huskies stayed out West.
There was an inexplicable rainstorm in Phoenix on the day before
the regional, but then the sun came out in the arid landscape.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut was battered around by an intense band of Iowa
players, and then was tested by a wild-eyed bunch from Gonzaga. Now
Connecticut was in its fourth distinctively different climate in
four weeks _ sparkling bays and graceful bridges, palm trees and
herons, quite enough incentive to avoid thawing-out Connecticut for
a few more hours.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night's game would be played with 40,000 people in
attendance. The fans were situated so far away that they couldn't
see the players, much less sneeze on them.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams had the credentials of a national champion. Both
teams had a chance to get home without an epidemic of sore throats
and runny noses, truly the sign of champions.

MEET YOUR CLUBS ON THE LINKS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, APRIL 4)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Skiing and golf are two of the most popular sports for
vacationers. And they share another trait: the equipment essential
to each is bulky and inconvenient to take on a trip. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Instead of lugging skis or golf clubs through airports and
entrusting the equipment to airline baggage handlers, you can rent
them at the vacation destination. But that can add up (club rentals
are about $35 a round at Hilton Head Island, S.C.), and a course
like Pebble Beach requires all the help you can get _ including
familiar clubs.
</P>
<P>
   Rental skis vary widely in quality, and skiers may feel more
comfortable with their own skis and bindings, which can translate
to safer skiing. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There is another solution: package-shipping companies like
Federal Express and United Parcel Service can carry your skis and
clubs for you. Even for travel within the United States, however,
this falls into the Aspen class of vacation amenities.
</P>
<P>
   A round-trip ticket for your golf clubs on UPS, with second-day
delivery, will be about $120, and $90 for your skis and poles. But
if you'll be on the links or the slopes for a week or so, it's
competitive with daily rentals.
</P>
<P>
   It also relieves the strain on baggage limits. Passengers on
domestic flights get two free checked-in bags, for which the
airlines assume $1,250 in liability (the price of a good set of
golf clubs). And there is less concern about loss or theft: with
the serial number on a shipping receipt, you can trace a parcel on
the Internet. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Companies like Fedex do not keep statistics on how many golf
bags and skis they ship, but unscientific observations indicate
that the package-service strategy is slowly catching on among
American sports enthusiasts. Paul Witt, a spokesman for the Vail
family of ski resorts, said that about 20 percent of guests at
Pines Lodge in Beaver Creek shipped their skis in via air freight.
</P>
<P>
   Deer Valley, a pricey resort in Utah, has expanded a program
with Fedex this season after a successful trial last winter. And
Golf Bag Express, which started offering golfers door-to-resort UPS
delivery of their clubs a year ago, is now up to 100 bags a day.
</P>
<P>
   Krista Thompson, a spokeswoman for Deer Valley, (800) 558-3337,
said that its program began in the 1997-98 season, when it was
available only to guests staying in a Deer Valley hotel. The skis
go directly to a free ski-storage area next to the lift-ticket
office.
</P>
<P>
   It proved so popular, she said, that now anyone _ including
skiers at nearby Park City _ can have skis shipped to the resort.
Guests call the resort, which notifies Fedex to charge a special
flat rate. Second-day air shipment of a set of poles and skis
(boots are extra) is $45 one way from Fedex offices in the United
States. Each shipment is insured for up to $500, Ms. Thompson said.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to try ski-shipping in these waning days of the
season, don't expect to find a Deer Valley-type program at most ski
resorts. Aspen abandoned a similar program after a trial period.
You'll have to take your skis to a local parcel-service office and
determine the rate based on distance, weight and speed of delivery.
A recent sampling of rates in Norwalk, Conn., showed that a pair of
skis and poles could be sent second-day air to Vail for $34.75 on
UPS, (800) 742-5877; $29 on Fedex, (800) 463-3339, and $21 on
Airborne Express, (800) 247-2676. When shipping skis and poles,
taping them together prevents damage from jostling within the
shipping container.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Felton, a spokesman for the Breckenridge resort, said that
shipping skis ahead hadn't caught on there. One reason is its
proximity to Denver's airport. ``It was designed with skiers in
mind, so it's easier to bring your own skis,'' he said. ``And we
see a lot of people who feel very comfortable using rented skis.''
</P>
<P>
   Golfers, on the other hand, are more attuned to the feel of
their own clubs. But a loaded golf bag (14 clubs plus balls, tees,
umbrella, ball retriever and a sweater) is much harder to caddy
through airports.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Rick Binger, director of operations for Golf Bag Express, (800)
237-6200, says that it took two years of work with UPS to develop a
compact shipping container tough enough for a golf bag. ``Folded
up, it's about the size of a dozen golf balls,'' Binger said. This
bag, made of thick plastic, is sent to the customer from the
company's El Segundo, Calif., office with a shipping label that
alerts the resort or pro shop to expect the golfer soon after it
arrives. A second bag is required for the return trip.
</P>
<P>
   Before loading the golf bag into the shipping container, Binger
recommends placing the golf bag in a soft travel bag. If the
second-day air service is chosen ($59 one way within the United
States, including home pickup), the bag should reach the resort in
two days. For golfers who can stand to be separated from their
clubs for longer periods, there's a less costly ground service,
which should take five business days and costs $59 round trip or
$32 one way.
</P>
<P>
   For most trips there appears to be no saving in shipping clubs
yourself. A recent stop at the Fedex office in Norwalk, Conn.,
yielded the following one-way rates to ship my bag, which was in a
hard shipping case and had a few dozen balls along with the clubs:
$74.75 for second-day air and $44.25 for ground-only to Hilton
Head; $79.50 second-day air and $63.50 ground-only to Pebble Beach,
Calif. Luckily, I drive to Hilton Head and Pebble Beach greens fees
are out of my price range. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Golf Bag Express does not yet ship overseas, Binger said, so
you'll have to trust your clubs to the airlines or rent a set if
you go to Scotland, for example. For what it would cost to ship
them to St. Andrews _ about $500 round trip, according to the
Norwalk Fedex office _ you could buy a top-of-the-line driver.
</P>
<P>
   Golf Bag Express insures a shipment for up to $1,000. If that is
not enough to re-equip your bag, extra coverage is sold at $5 for
each $1,000. Binger offered another tip: ``Cut a broom handle about
an inch or so longer than your driver, then put it in your bag,''
he said. If your bag slams head-first into an airplane bulkhead,
you're a lot less likely to have a broken or bent club. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Both Binger and Ms. Thompson of Deer Valley said that guests
should call 14 days ahead to allow time for packing materials to
arrive, pickup by the shipper and delivery _ longer for
ground-only. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By now, most big ski and golf resorts are accustomed to having
sports equipment show up before its owners. Nonetheless, it helps
to call ahead to advise that you'll be shipping your equipment
separately and to ask the resort for the proper address and
delivery instructions so you'll get it as quickly as possible once
you arrive. My experience has been that most ``shipping delays''
are due to mishandling after a package arrives.
</P>
<P>
   If this sounds like such a great idea that you are also
considering shipping all your luggage _ clothes, shoes, etc. _ you
aren't the first to think so. Witt, the Vail spokesman, said that a
growing number of guests were doing just that, paying the extra
cost to avoid the annoyance of trying to sneak an oversize bag into
the passenger cabin or waiting at a baggage carousel _ or worse
yet, filling out a lost-bag claim.

NEXT TRICK FOR AMAZON.COM: AUCTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By SAUL HANSELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Furthering its audacious ambition to be involved virtually any
time anyone sells anything on the Internet, Amazon.com plans to let
individuals and small businesses conduct auctions on its popular
World Wide Web site.
</P>
<P>
   The company plans to begin offering the auction capability
Tuesday from its existing Web site. Shares of Amazon.com rose
nearly 8 percent Monday, closing at $149.625, up $10.5625 in Nasdaq
trading, following the company's announcement of the plan late
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon has been expanding quickly from its bookselling base into
a wide range of other offerings. It now sells music, videos and
gifts directly and offers a ``shop the Web'' search engine to help
consumers find products at other online stores.
</P>
<P>
   It has also invested in other online sites, like Drugstore.com.
Indeed, Amazon also disclosed Monday that it owns a controlling
interest in Pets.com, which sells dog biscuits, cat toys and other
pet supplies.
</P>
<P>
   But the stakes are especially high in the auction field;
Amazon's main rival will be Ebay, an online auction house with a
market value of nearly $20 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Investors have been infatuated with Ebay because the company,
which is based in San Jose, Calif., has the potential to take a
small percentage of millions of transactions at a very low cost. In
essence, Ebay lets individuals auction the contents of their attics
in an electronic garage sale. Its site, www.ebay.com, has also
given international exposure to proprietors of flea-market booths
and specialty shops.
</P>
<P>
   Investors have also regarded Ebay as a natural monopoly, because
sellers want to display their wares where there are the most
potential customers, while buyers tend to choose the site with the
most goods for sale. This self-reinforcing effect is why Ebay has
continued to grow, even though Yahoo, one of the most visited of
the so-called Internet portals, offers auctions with no fees.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon hopes to break through this chicken-and-egg problem on
the strength of its established customer base. It already has 8
million customers who have made at least one purchase online.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will use our existing customers to provide a ready audience
for sellers,'' said Jeffrey Bezos, the chairman of Amazon.com,
which is based in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts praised Amazon's move.
</P>
<P>
   ``Auctions could ultimately be very important for Amazon because
they are a much higher-margin business than selling books,'' said
Henry Blodget, an analyst for Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. ``And it allows
them to diversify their offerings very quickly. Suddenly, they are
a place to go when you're looking for all sorts of things.''
</P>
<P>
   Amazon promises a number of improvements over Ebay's approach.
For any purchase less than $250, the company says, it will
reimburse the buyer if the seller does not deliver the goods as
advertised.
</P>
<P>
   Second, Amazon will promote auctions on the other parts of its
retailing site. Thus, an Amazon user looking up golf books will
also see a listing for golf clubs for sale in its auctions area.
</P>
<P>
   And the company intends to make it very easy for its customers
to bid in these auctions, extending its ``one click''
instant-buying service to a similarly instant bidding capability,
with no additional sign-in needed.
</P>
<P>
   The $250 anti-fraud guarantee could end up being a largely
symbolic gesture. Ebay, for example, claims that only three of
every 10,000 transactions on its site turn out to be fraudulent.
Ebay has already introduced an insurance program to cover the first
$200 of fraud losses, with a $25 deductible.
</P>
<P>
   ``Amazon.com is a savvy Internet competitor and has done a very
good job in the area of business-to-consumer Internet commerce,''
said Kevin Purgslove, a spokesman for Ebay. But, he continued,
``over the past three and a half years Ebay has focused on
person-to-person trading, and has developed significant competitive
advantages.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Purgslove said he could not comment further, because Ebay has
registered to sell nearly $1 billion in stock and is in the
so-called quiet period mandated by the Security and Exchange
Commission, when a company is about to issue new shares.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, investors seemed to give the early edge to Amazon
Monday. As Amazon's stock rose, Ebay's shares fell by $6.71875, to
$147.78125.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Amazon brings to the table is 8 million loyal
customers,'' said Alan Braverman, an analyst at Nationsbanc
Montgomery Securities. ``But I don't think this is a zero-sum game.
Amazon will be successful and EBay will be successful.''
</P>
<P>
   Amazon.com will promote its new service Tuesday by holding an
auction to benefit the World Wildlife Fund. Objects for sale
include an Andy Warhol print of James Dean and one of the first
four desks Bezos built from door panels _ a trademark of Amazon.com
when it was starting up.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It is a staple of the nightly news, of daily
conversations at dry cleaners and doughnut shops, overheard in
cell-phone conversations and in cocktail party chatter.
</P>
<P>
   When Americans talk about the stock market, they talk about the
Dow Jones industrial average. For roughly a century, ``How'd the
market do today?'' has inevitably been answered with a reference to
the Dow.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for all its longevity and accuracy as a barometer of the
progress of the stock market, the 30 stocks of the Dow industrial
average have, in recent years, failed to keep up with the gains of
smaller, more sought after companies that are part of other indexes
that track the overall market. Since the beginning of 1995, the Dow
has lagged behind by a few percentage points each year the returns
of the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index, the broader index that
most professional investors on Wall Street use as a benchmark for
their own portfolios.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow has fallen even further behind the Nasdaq composite
index, rich with the technology stocks that lately have been the
market's biggest gainers. Even the unwieldy Wilshire 5000, the
universe of stocks which, despite its name, encompasses more than
7,000 companies based in the United States, has climbed at a rate
more than 1 percent a year faster than the Dow.
</P>
<P>
   All of which raises the question: Does the Dow matter anymore?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is still yes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Dow has come in for a lot of criticism for a long time,''
said Steven Leuthold, a market analyst whose research firm, the
Leuthold Group, is based in Minneapolis. ``People complain that it
has a limited number of stocks, they complain about the way the
index is calculated,'' based on the numerical price of stocks
rather than the total market value of the companies it tracks.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I think the rather amazing thing is how accurately, over
time, it has tracked a broader index like the S&AMP;P 500,'' Leuthold
added. ``There are times when the two get out of sync. But we use
it because it is still the first thing people refer to when they
talk about how the market did today.''
</P>
<P>
   So far this year, the Dow, with a gain of nearly 9 percent, is
more than 1 percentage point ahead of the S&AMP;P 500. But those gains
mask a growing disparity in the overall market. While the major
stock indexes are trading at or near record highs, three-quarters
of the stocks in the S&AMP;P index, and 88 percent of the stocks traded
on the New York Stock Exchange, are more than 10 percent below
their all-time highs.
</P>
<P>
   The differences between the gauges can be traced to how they are
calculated. The Dow industrial average is price-weighted, meaning
that high priced-stocks, like IBM at over $177 a share, have more
of an effect on the Dow than do low-priced stocks like Disney, at
about $33. That is true even though a company with a low share
price but substantially more shares in circulation could be worth
more.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, the S&AMP;P indexes are weighted by market
capitalization, meaning that the indexes are most influenced by
companies whose total stock market value _ derived by multiplying
their share price by the number of shares in circulation _ is
greatest.
</P>
<P>
   A system such as the Dow's price-based system was necessary in
the late 19th century, when the Dow was first compiled and the
calculations had to be done with pencil and paper. The first
calculations, in 1896 with a group of 12 stocks, were very simple:
add the stocks' prices and divide by 12.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the average is calculated by dividing the sum of the
prices by a fractional divisor, currently about 0.225. That means
that each $1 change in the price of a Dow stock moves the average
by about 4.44 points.
</P>
<P>
   With the advent of superfast computers and instant reporting of
changes in stock prices, any index can be calculated in a
microsecond, adjusted for stock splits and dividends. More
importantly for the companies that devise and market indexes for
use with options, futures and other derivatives contracts, an index
can be frequently tinkered with through the removal and replacement
of companies without difficulty.
</P>
<P>
   That has caused new indexes to sprout like mushrooms, with each
seeming to slice the stock market into ever-smaller pieces.
Bloomberg lists 417 indexes tracking U.S. equity markets alone.
</P>
<P>
   From a statistical perspective, however, the Dow is among the
most efficient gauges around. It uses only 30 stocks, which
together account for close to a quarter of the stock market's total
value. The S&AMP;P 500's components, which together account for about
four-fifths of the market's total value, are, by comparison, much
closer to a full census than a sampling.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Recently, critics of the Dow have argued that the older gauge,
having missed the upswing caused by the Internet investment mania,
lags behind too far. From the beginning of 1995, when the latest
leg of the stock market's upward march began, through the end of
1998, the Dow climbed 24.3 percent annually, compared with 27.8
percent for the S&AMP;P 500.
</P>
<P>
   The difference stems primarily from the absence of the
technology giants Intel and Microsoft from the Dow industrials.
While the Dow has contained IBM since 1981 and Hewlett-Packard
since 1997, those stocks have not performed as well as Intel and
Microsoft, the stars of the new economy built around personal
computers and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Over longer periods, however, the gauges track quite closely.
Since the beginning of 1980 through the end of last year, the Dow
gained 13.4 percent a year, compared with 13.6 percent for the S&AMP;P
500. Including reinvested dividends, a measure known as total
return, an investment in the Dow and the S&AMP;P 500 would have come
even closer _ an average annual gain of 17.72 percent for the Dow
industrials versus 17.65 percent for the S&AMP;P
</P>
<P>
   Even when measured since the beginning of 1990, the two
benchmarks differ by an average of less than a half of 1 percent a
year: 17.8 percent for the S&AMP;P 500 versus 17.4 percent for the Dow.
</P>
<P>
   The proliferation of indexes in part comes from the desire to
more closely track certain sectors of the market.
</P>
<P>
   ``It depends what you want a benchmark to be,'' said Leah
Modigliani, an equity strategist at Morgan Stanley. ``It serves to
represent a universe of investments, to act as a benchmark'' for
investment managers to measure their own performance.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, however, stock market gauges have also provided an
alternative investment, one that frequently can be had at a lower
cost than charged by traditional portfolio managers. Today, index
mutual funds and unit investment trusts track virtually every stock
market gauge imaginable, from subsets of Internet stocks to the
entire universe of publicly traded companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without a doubt, the Dow has a lot of problems that are well
known,'' said Theodore R. Aronson, a money manager and market
analyst at Aronson + Partners in Philadelphia. ``I nonetheless
marvel at how experts in the field allude to it. And it's still
hands-down the most popular shorthand for how the market's done. I
wake up each morning as National Public Radio is reporting the Dow,
which they still do to two decimal places. Think about how
meaningless that is.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, said Leuthold, people seem to be increasingly frightened
by the Dow's amplitude. Hundred-point swings in the Dow often
result in bigger headlines in the next day's paper, even though 100
points recently represented little more than a move of 1 percent in
the average.
</P>
<P>
   With the Dow crossing 10,000, perhaps the excitement that has
come with each 1,000-point mark will die down. But the 10,000 level
might also represent a level that has greater historic resonance to
investors. For once it reaches the Promised Land, will the Dow be
able to move on?
</P>
<P>
   Consider that for six periods from 1963 to 1982, the Dow Jones
industrial average approached or crossed the 1,000 level, only to
retreat back into triple digits. The first of those concluded a
fantastic run of three and a half years, during which the Dow
gained more than 20 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow first finished a full day of trading above 1,000 in
November 1972. But it was not until a full decade later, at the
beginning of the bull market in late 1982, that the Dow average
firmly climbed above the 1,000 mountain. Today, of course, it looks
more like a molehill. &QL;

 &HT;    Can anything destroy the old-fashioned pleasure of COMIC BOOKS?!
 &HT;    By Jeff Houck
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Christian Holmes is a nice, normal
fellow. Has a good job designing home video games, makes decent
money, lives in a comfortable home outside Orlando. At 30 years
old, the future looks bright.
</P>
<P>
   And he really enjoys dressing up like a superhero.
</P>
<P>
   Not Superman or Batman. He's got a thing for a comic-book hero
known as The Thing.
</P>
<P>
   For special occasions, Holmes dons an orange ski mask, orange
socks and a pair of orange longjohns covered with orange sponges
and made modest by the addition of a skimpy blue Speedo. The Thing,
you see, was damaged by gamma rays in a horrific accident years ago
that made his skin look like a portable rock slide. Holmes couldn't
glue rocks to his longjohns. Sponges had to suffice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I drove here like this in my convertible,'' he says, his voice
tinged with pride. ``Got a few honks.''
</P>
<P>
   It isn't often he gets to show off this getup. But he did break
it out for one of his favorite events, the MegaCon comic book and
science fiction convention in Orlando this month.
</P>
<P>
   Standing straight, a bemused smirk on his face, he strolled
through the aisles of booths, drawing the oohs and ahhs of
Spider-Man worshipers and Star Trek fanatics who respected his
commitment to the character. A few booths away, a 6-foot alien even
turned his head for a look.
</P>
<P>
   Why would an otherwise normal guy pull such a stunt?
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the one place where it's acceptable to do this,'' he
said. ``You can get into character and lose yourself for a little
bit and have a little vacation from who you are.''
</P>
<P>
   Just then, a woman with a toddler taps him on an arm sponge.
</P>
<P>
   ``My son wonders why you have a lumpy tushy.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, the indignities of the modern crime fighter.
</P>
<P>
   Unique environment is right. During the three-day event, the
MegaCon (that's comics lingo for mega-convention _ ``The Con'' for
short, if you're really into it) attracts thousands of avid fans
who come to buy and sell their mountains of comic books, meet the
artists and writers of their favorite titles and buy collectible
artwork.
</P>
<P>
   Some go as far as Holmes and don the apparel of their favorite
characters. Some go further.
</P>
<P>
   One Con-goer, dressed head to toe in blue suit, tie and fedora,
insisted his birth name was The Shadow.
</P>
<P>
   The name on his driver license? ``The Shadow.''
</P>
<P>
   Where does he live? ``Only The Shadow knows.''
</P>
<P>
   Sigh.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people at the Cons can sometimes be a little strange, but
they're really nice and polite, and they have a great time.'' said
Karl Story, an Atlanta-based artist who helps draw the Nightwing
series based on Batman's sidekick, Robin.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a lot of these people, it's their one chance out of the
year other than Halloween to dress up and be the people they want
to be. I've seen people wearing barbarian chain mail and bikinis.''
</P>
<P>
   Conventions like the one in Orlando _ which is among more than a
dozen huge gatherings around the country each year _ draw people
from hundreds of miles away. Distance is not a factor when you're
crazy about Captain America.
</P>
<P>
   But all of this is changing. The Internet is quickly becoming
the new home for traders, with thousands of titles being bought and
sold each day. The comics business is coming out of a 5-year
recession, the demographics are shifting away from kids to an
older, more affluent customer who can afford comics that are $3
each off the shelf, and the Internet has pumped new life into the
collectibles segment.
</P>
<P>
   Which leaves comics fans who enjoy the mingling as much as the
haggling wondering whether these kinds of shows will be around in a
few years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love the energy here,'' said Kim Floyd, a 52-year-old
salesman from Thomasville, Ga., who collects ``golden age comics''
from the '40s and '50s. ``Everyone is extremely focused on their
books and charged up. That doesn't happen on line. The Internet is
clinical and cold and commercial.
</P>
<P>
   ``It might be overstating it, but this kind of convention is
like a living, breathing beast with its own momentum. I'd hate to
see that lost because of the almighty dollar.''
</P>
<P>
   If the money is getting in the way of comic collectors'
enjoyment, you couldn't tell by looking on line. At eBay, the
largest on-line auctioneer, thousands of comic books _ including
over 27,000 rare titles _ are for sale.
</P>
<P>
   The site built its business on the collectibles market: Beanie
Babies, Barbies, coins, sports memorabilia, antiques and comics.
</P>
<P>
   The company brought a huge contingent to the MegaCon, opening a
flashy booth complete with laptops and sales reps who offered
convention-goers immediate access to their site.
</P>
<P>
   If anyone should be worried by Internet encroachment, you'd
think it would be James Breitbeil, MegaCon's organizer and
publisher of Frank Frazetta Fantasy Illustrated. He's seen
attendance increase about 20 percent each year, reaching 14,000
during the three days this year. The convention has diversified to
include science fiction, fantasy game tournaments and animation
exhibits, along with the occasional Playboy Playmate and one-time
TV stars from such shows as The Munsters and Lost in Space.
</P>
<P>
   He realizes that by signing eBay as the Con's major sponsor this
year, he's inviting the enemy into his camp. But Breitbeil said he
isn't concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``It definitely crosses the line a little bit, but the Internet
is here to stay. And regardless, we're likely to keep growing. A
convention is an interactive thing, and you can't really replace
being with your peers. EBay can do some of what we do, but they
can't really capitalize on the atmosphere.''
</P>
<P>
   Patience has a human face. His name is Trent Swift.
</P>
<P>
   The 14-year-old from Palm Beach is sitting on the floor, back
against the Orlando Expo Centre's walls, waiting in line to see his
favorite comic-book artist, J. Scott Campbell.
</P>
<P>
   Swift _ normal teenage boy that he is _ is crazy about
Campbell's Danger Girl. Along with a flashy drawing style and a
shiny cover, the book's main draw is the weapon-wielding title
character, who makes Pamela Lee look downright sylph-like.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been waiting here about an hour,'' he says. His mom,
Lisa, who drove Trent to Orlando to see Campbell, is sitting on the
floor with him. He's 20th in line at the moment. Another 100 people
are behind them.
</P>
<P>
   But this trip was about more than Danger Girl or meeting
Campbell or getting a good price for the 1942 Human Torch comic he
owns that probably is worth $400. Trent's father, Joe, died in
September.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was Trent's desire to come here,'' Lisa said. ``Going to
shows was something he and his father used to do together. I wanted
to carry that tradition on. My kids are my life right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of people file past the line on their way to other
booths. The topic drifts to the guy in the orange sponge suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone who would dress up in 6 feet of sponge has got to have
something wrong with him,'' Trent jokes. His mother laughs with
him.
</P>
<P>
   It's the kind of laugh you get when you've been sitting for an
hour on a hard floor. It's the kind of moment you just can't buy on
a Web site.

   WASHINGTON _ The United States has sent at least three unmanned
drone airplanes, known as Predators, to the Balkans to detect and
photograph Serbian troops and air defense systems and to document
Serbian attacks against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo, Pentagon
officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The cargo planes carrying the Predators and the equipment needed
to operate them began arriving in Bosnia on Wednesday, said Mike
Estrada, spokesman for Nellis Air Force base, which is the
Predators' home base in Las Vegas. It will take at least two more
days to finish setting up the necessary equipment to navigate the
aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   These remotely piloted reconnaissance airplanes can be sent over
the most heavily defended targets. Moreover, they can take video
film and relay images of events on the ground as they are
happening.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon officials refused to say why these aircraft had not
been sent earlier so that they would have been ready when the air
war began.
</P>
<P>
   While they are not stealth airplanes and can be picked up on
radar, they are so small they are difficult to see and hard to hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``A large van acts as its control stations with lots of
antennas,'' Estrada said. ``The airplanes themselves were broken
down and put into large boxes we call coffins and now have to be
reassembled.''
</P>
<P>
   The Predator's equipment includes a daylight camera, an infrared
system for use at night and radar that can see through clouds.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Predator can stay up in the air for more than 24 hours and
photograph whatever you want,'' Estrada said.

   WASHINGTON _ NATO air attacks shifted toward Serbian troop
staging areas in embattled Kosovo on Monday as the Clinton
administration claimed that evidence of ``genocide'' by Serb forces
was growing to include ``abhorrent and criminal action'' on a
massive scale.
</P>
<P>
   The language was the State Department's strongest yet in
denouncing Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic as reports
increased of Serb assassinations of ethnic Albanian leaders and of
the scorched-earth torching of Kosovar villages.
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands of refugees continued to flee in terror from
Serb forces, pouring into neighboring Albania, Macedonia and
Montenegro and compounding the Balkan region's massive refugee
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``President Milosevic has adopted what can only be described as
a siege mentality,'' said British Air Commodore David Wilby at NATO
headquarters in Brussels. ``He believes he can realign his ethnic
problems in one week and that NATO unity will crack in that same
period,'' he said of the nonstop refugee flow that officials fear
could further destabilize the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials said their air assault was directed increasingly
at Milosevic's field forces in Kosovo as the suffering there
worsened among ethnic Albanians. ``Major attacks'' were delivered
Sunday night on the 243rd Serb combat group at Donja Somanja in
Kosovo, according to NATO military officials who said the Serb unit
has been directing attacks on Kosovar Albanian villagers.
</P>
<P>
   Belgrade claimed its forces had shot down a second NATO plane,
but this was not immediately confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are indicators that genocide is unfolding in Kosovo,''
said State Department spokesman James Rubin, invoking a word heady
with implications of proof and punishment in international law.
There is no reason to await confirmation before using the word, he
argued, ``because we can clearly say crimes against humanity are
being committed'' that carry penalties of life imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``Let me say that the abhorrent and criminal actions,
I mean on a massive scale, are occurring in Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon officials said the new air assaults in Kosovo were thus
far directed at troop staging areas, rather than at tanks,
artillery pieces, and the small mobile military units that the
Serbs have been using in their attacks on Kosovo villages. The A-10
``Warthog'' plane designed to make low-run, low-speed attacks on
tanks and field artillery was reported taking to the air for the
first time in the six-day-old NATO assault, but there were no
immediate reports of any dramatic success in stopping Serb attacks
on Kosovar civilians.
</P>
<P>
   More U.S. warplanes were committed to the NATO operation Monday,
including B-1B bombers equipped with a variety of bombs, such as
cluster ``bomblets.'' More EA-6B Prowler aircraft designed to
confuse enemy radar systems were also dispatched.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no magic military bullet here,'' said Pentagon
spokesman Ken Bacon, facing increasingly sharp questions about the
efficacy of the air attacks in the face of the heightened Serbian
onslaught against ethnic Albanians. ``There is not a quick
solution.''
</P>
<P>
   In London, British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said he was
alarmed by reports of ``some of these refugees being herded into
concentration areas'' by Serb forces. He cited one report,
unconfirmed as yet by eyewitnesses, of 20,000 refugees concentrated
around Srbica. ``We remember the way in which many refugees were
herded together and executed by the Serb forces during the civil
war in Bosnia,'' he added ominously.
</P>
<P>
   As doubts and criticism of the NATO assault increased, one
immediate question was whether the political leaders of NATO might
ease restrictions on the missile and bombing attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that's a question that I would like to address
today,'' Wilby responded when asked at a briefing whether the NATO
command had prevented the allied bombers from attacking Serbia's
Interior Ministry in Belgrade, where the operations in Kosovo are
planned.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic was denounced by NATO officials for waging a
``scorched earth'' siege in routing the ethnic Albanians, whose
autonomy within Serbia was stripped away by the Serbian dictator 10
years ago. Kosovo, the southern province of the Serbian republic in
which ethnic Albanians account for nine-tenths of the population,
is hallowed ground to the Serbs, and a touchstone in Milosevic's
ultranationalist campaign to maintain power.
</P>
<P>
   Seven Kosovo villages were reported under assault and burning
between Pec and Klina on Monday, with Albanian residents fleeing
the Serbs, NATO said. Three villages west of Pristina, the Kosovo
capital, were also reported aflame by NATO officials, who have
tended to offer the public more specific details on the Kosovo
scene than their American counterparts here.
</P>
<P>
   As calls mounted for more immediate results by NATO, President
Clinton interrupted a Virginia golf outing to telephone British
Prime Minister Tony Blair and German Chancellor Gerhardt Schroeder.
At the Pentagon, the Joint Chiefs of Staff met in private, with
Kosovo heading their agenda.
</P>
<P>
   On the diplomatic front, administration officials expressed
little optimism that Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov's trip
to Belgrade Tuesday would bear much fruit in the way of ending the
NATO assault unless he somehow reverses Milosevic's adamancy in
refusing to retreat from his year-long Kosovo campaign. Some
officials voiced concerns that Primakov might push the Serbs into a
deal short of what NATO is demanding _ autonomy for Kosovo under
the protection of NATO troops.
</P>
<P>
   It was still not clear Monday what brought down an F-117 stealth
fighter over Yugoslavia on Saturday. Bacon said American military
officials still do not know the cause of the crash, in which the
pilot survived and was rescued. Bacon declined to comment on
reports that some Pentagon officials were convinced the aircraft
was hit by a surface-to-air missile, or that there appeared to be
bullet holes in one wing.
</P>
<P>
   About half a million ethnic Albanians _ a fifth of the province
_ were already reported to have fled their homes over the past
year. Tens of thousands more have taken to the roads since the NATO
bombings began, with some even being stripped of their
identification papers and being forced to pay bribes at the Serb
borders, according to NATO complaints. The refugees are being
prodded by Milosevic's troops and paramilitary police as well as by
what NATO officials described as murderous gangs in mufti bearing
such names as the Vucak Wolves, already infamous from earlier
ethnic wars.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty thousand Kosovo refugees have descended upon hard-pressed
neighboring Albania since last weekend, according to State
Department officials who estimated the flow was continuing at 2,000
per hour. In Macedonia, there were an estimated 22,000 refugees as
U.N. relief officials held emergency meetings to deal with the
crisis. In Montenegro, at least 28,000 refugees have flowed in from
Pec, the Kosovo border city that remained under siege and burning,
according to the State Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``On Saturday night Serbian forces rounded up Albanian men
throughout Pec and marched them off in an unknown direction,''
Wilby reported as NATO and Clinton administration officials
heightened warnings that war-crime investigations will be pressed
all the way down the Serb military command to line officers in the
field.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is your responsibility,'' declared Cook, angrily
addressing the Serbian officers corps. ``We know the chain of
command back to the political leadership in Belgrade.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Wilby said the Kosovar villages were despairing. ``Helicopters
are being used against the civil population,'' he said.
``Paramilitaries enter towns and villages and terrify the people.''
</P>
<P>
   As the war misery of the Kosovars deepened, the White House
denied the NATO raids had only encouraged Milosevic to hasten the
routing of ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were faced with a choice here, which was do we act or do we
not act?'' said Joe Lockhart, the president's spokesman. ``And we
think by acting we will make him pay a price,'' he said. ``The
reason they, as a group, are better off is that this was done in
the past with impunity,'' he said of the Serb assaults.
</P>
<P>
   Britain's Cook, facing similar questioning, declared, ``If we
had not acted, all of you would now be asking why we stood by while
this ethnic cleansing took place.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House declared once more that there was ``absolutely
no change'' in the president's insistence that American ground
troops would not be used against the Serbs. Pentagon officials
emphasized that an adequate troop operation could take weeks to
mount, if it ever were decided upon, because the Serbs already have
40,000 troops in Kosovo backed by hundreds of tanks and artillery
pieces.
</P>
<P>
   The reported atrocities cited by the State Department and NATO
officials, who stressed on-site confirmation was not yet possible,
included 20 village school teachers who were said to have been
gunned down by Serbs in front of their students in the village of
Goden, according to Cook. NATO reported Serb gunmen had tracked
down and executed at least five prominent ethnic Albanians,
including Batan Haxhiu, editor of the main ethnic Albanian
newspaper, and Fehmi Agani, a member of the Kosovar Albanian peace
negotiating team that met in February at Rambouillet, France.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials strenuously denied that the air assaults had
prompted the heightened Milosevic onslaught against the Kosovars,
noting that Serb forces have been massing in Kosovo for months and
were aggressively on the move when NATO felt obliged to step in.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a campaign under way to ethnically re-engineer the
makeup of Kosovo,'' said Jamie Shea, the NATO spokesman in
Brussels. ``To reshape the political map of Kosovo so that
Milosevic later on would hope to achieve a negotiated solution more
favorable to Belgrade.''

KEVORKIAN TRIAL SENDS A MESSAGE, BUT WHICH ONE? 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By PAM BELLUCK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Dr. Jack Kevorkian may be the nation's most visible
and vocal advocate of assisted suicide. But many proponents of
assisted suicide believe his second-degree murder conviction last
week, in the death of a seriously ill man, could help them.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when the debate over assisted suicide is reaching into
state legislatures and ballot initiatives, many experts and
advocates say Kevorkian, who claims to have helped more than 130
people die, has made things harder for the assisted-suicide cause.
They say his provocative style may have attracted supporters and
raised awareness of the issue, but it has also alienated some
people who might have been sympathetic.
</P>
<P>
   And advocates say that by videotaping himself giving a man a
lethal injection, bringing the tape to the CBS News program ``60
Minutes,'' and daring prosecutors to charge him with murder, he was
trying to move the legal system farther and faster than most
Americans were ready to accept.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was kind of a sideshow or a distraction,'' said Dr. Timothy
E. Quill, a Rochester, N.Y., doctor who became one of the
standard-bearers for the assisted-suicide movement after he wrote
an article in 1991 describing how he had helped a patient kill
herself.
</P>
<P>
   Quill added, ``I think there was a growing desire on everybody's
part to sort of slow him down or stop him, because he was pushing
it farther and farther.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a desire that these advocates found difficult to express
publicly until now, for fear of losing Kevorkian's loyal followers,
who consider him courageous.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always been a fear that if they publicly indicated
Kevorkian was a loser and they wished he would go away, it would
create too much Sturm und Drang in the movement,'' said David J.
Garrow, a historian at Emory University Law School.
</P>
<P>
   Kevorkian declined to be interviewed.
</P>
<P>
   Some opponents of assisted suicide say the advocates of it are
merely engaging in spin control, and the verdict will actually have
the effect of making assisted suicide less acceptable.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is no win for them,'' said Dr. Gregory Hamilton, the
president of an Oregon-based group called Physicians for
Compassionate Care. ``This gives a message to people in America
that killing sick people is not the answer to life's problems, that
it is appropriate to have laws against it and to punish the
perpetrators of these crimes.''
</P>
<P>
   But George Eighmey, the executive director of a group in Oregon
called Compassion in Dying, which fought successfully for the
nation's only law permitting assisted suicide, said the conviction
helps the mainstream wing of the movement because it came in a case
of euthanasia, in which a third party administered the patient's
fatal dose of chemicals, instead of the patient taking them on his
own.
</P>
<P>
   Though many Americans do not generally make the distinction
between euthanasia and assisted suicide, Eighmey and other
assisted-suicide advocates say they do not support euthanasia
because it takes the final control of the decision to die out of
the patient's hands. They also say polls show that people are more
comfortable supporting laws like Oregon's, which took effect in
1997. That law not only requires the patient to take the lethal
drugs without help, but stipulates that a patient committing
assisted suicide must be terminally ill and that two doctors must
determine the patient has less than six months to live.
</P>
<P>
   The people Kevorkian assisted were not always terminally ill,
and he supports either method of helping someone die. His
conviction came in a case in which he injected Thomas Youk with
lethal chemicals. Youk, 52, had amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or
Lou Gehrig's disease.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, prosecutors tried and failed four times to convict
Kevorkian in non-euthanasia cases in which the patient administered
the drugs or carbon monoxide by pulling a string or using a switch.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, advocates like Eighmey say the verdict will
convince more people that laws are necessary to make some types of
assisted suicide legal, while outlawing more extreme measures.
</P>
<P>
   ``We now know the unacceptable limits and we now, as a society,
can move in the direction of those acceptable limits,'' Eighmey
said. ``I think Dr. Kevorkian's trial messages, let's move in the
direction of the more moderate Oregon model, instead of the
Kevorkian model.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of assisted suicide say that it is disingenuous to
attempt to make a distinction between euthanasia and assisted
suicide because once it is legal for doctors to give lethal doses
of drugs to terminally ill people, they will find reasons to argue
that people who are too disabled to take the drugs themselves
should be allowed to ask someone to help them die.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is indeed a slippery slope,'' said Dr. Rex Greene, the
president of the Los Angeles County Medical Association.
``Sanctioning this will eventually lead to the kind of activities
that Kevorkian has typified.'' Not every assisted-suicide advocate
believes the verdict will advance their cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could force more doctors to go underground, and patients to
figure out ways to do this without the help of doctors,'' said Dr.
Faye Girsh, the executive director of the Hemlock Society, which
supports assisted suicide and euthanasia and sees little
distinction between the two. ``This will certainly not embolden
other doctors to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Kevorkian's lawyer, David Gorosh, who plans to appeal the
conviction, said his client will ultimately be ``lauded as a hero
in history.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear if Kevorkian, who has said he will starve
himself in prison, will be nudged completely out of the limelight
of the debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm afraid we haven't heard the last of him,'' Quill said.
</P>
<P>
   To date, some 20 state legislatures have either rejected or
blocked laws legalizing assisted suicide and voters have rejected
ballot initiatives in California, Washington and Michigan. A
handful of states have explicitly outlawed it. But the issue
remains a contentious one and proposals to legalize assisted
suicide are pending in Maine and Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   Many people are watching the effects of the Oregon law. In its
first year, 15 people took their lives under the law, a result that
advocates say proves that assisted suicide can be legalized
responsibly. But critics say those results prove little. They say
that a recent case of a man whose brother-in-law said he helped him
commit assisted suicide shows that the line between assisted
suicide and euthanasia is easily blurred.
</P>
<P>
   Some people who oppose assisted suicide say they expect more
public support for assisted suicide laws, since many people say
they want the right to die.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be more pressure on legislatures to legalize,''
said Dr. Steven Miles, a geriatrician at the University of
Minnesota, although he said that because of the verdict, fewer
doctors will risk performing assisted suicides while the practice
remains illegal.
</P>
<P>
   Quill thinks the movement is more likely to have success
persuading the public to accept more moderate steps, such as
counseling patients about stopping eating and drinking to hasten
their death, which is legal.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, many involved in caring for the terminally ill,
including some who support assisted suicide, hope for another
result too, one that could affect many more people. They hope there
will be increased momentum in the growing movement to improve the
care of chronically ill and dying patients so that fewer people
will believe that assisted suicide is their best option.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a long way to go before we can be optimistic about
end of life care _ pain control, Medicare entitlement, hospice
care, home care,'' Miles said. ``Now, the argument for palliative
care gets much stronger.''

   A. Among the possibilities you may want to pursue are these,
which turned up on the Web:
</P>
<P>

   Q. (italics)Could you please tell me when is the best time to
visit Monet's house in Giverny to see the gardens in full bloom? _
Leah R. Herzfeld, New York, N.Y.(end italics)
</P>
<P>
   A. Claude Monet, a founder of Impressionism, moved to Giverny in
1883 and lived there until his death in 1926. In the last decade of
his life, with his eyesight failing, he painted his series of
water-lily murals. And tourists now flock there to see the gardens
that inspired the paintings.
</P>
<P>
   The house, called the Fondation Claude Monet, and its vast
gardens opened for the season on Thursday, and will remain open
until Oct. 31. You may visit daily except Monday, from 10 a.m. to 6
p.m. Call (33-2) 32.51.28.21; $5.80 for the house and garden, $4
for the garden only.
</P>
<P>
   Some fruit trees are already in bloom, but the period when the
most color can be seen is from mid-May until the end of June. This,
of course, is also the most crowded period. If you avoid weekends,
when crowds are nearly unbearable, you will have some elbow room.
Weekdays can be busy, too, with schoolchildren arriving by the
busload on field trips. Wednesday is the day with the lightest
school traffic, the staff says.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what month you visit, there should be some plants in
bloom, according to the staff. If you go by train, you will leave
from Gare St.-Lazare. Take the train toward Rouen, and get off at
the Vernon station. There, you should find tour buses or cabs for
the 10-minute trip to Giverny. The round-trip train fare should be
about $30 second class, $45 first class.
</P>
<P>
   By car, Giverny is about an hour to 90 minutes from Paris, along
the Paris-Rouen A13. Exit after the first toll from Paris and
follow the signs to Vernon, then signs to Giverny, across the
bridge over the Seine. &QL;

   Q. (italics)A friend and I will be going to Hawaii for a few
days after a two-week trip to China. Can you recommend any
bed-and-breakfasts in or near Honolulu that are quiet, near the
water and accessible by public transportation? We would like to
spend about $100 a night. _ Salvina L. Scerri, New York, N.Y.(end

   A. Your choices will be much greater if you consider the entire
island of Oahu. There are not many B&AMP;Bs near Waikiki, but Joanne
Trotter operates an inn at a beautiful old traditional-style home
in a residential area about a 20-minute walk from the beach. It is
surrounded by large old trees, and if you are bird watchers, you'll
enjoy the fairy terns. Call (808) 923-3905.
</P>
<P>
   If you're willing to shop for your breakfast, consider these:
</P>
<P>
   Ke Iki Hale in Haleiwa, on the North Shore, is a long ride by
bus, but it is accessible by public transit and sits on a
spectacular beach. It is not fancy, and there's no breakfast. But
there is a market nearby. Ask for one of the oceanside units, which
start at $138. Call or fax (808) 638-8229.
</P>
<P>
   On windward Oahu, Pat O'Malley operates Pat's Kailua Beach
Properties, (808) 261-1653, with a wide range of rentals, most on
or near beautiful Kailua Beach, starting at $65 a night, with a
three-night minimum. It's on the bus line. No meals, but food and
restaurants are nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Also on windward Oahu, Lanikai Bed &AMP; Breakfast is across the
street from Lanikai Beach, right on the bus line. From $65 a night,
without breakfast (although it still calls itself a bed and
breakfast); there's usually a three-night minimum. Call (800)
258-7895 or (808) 261-1059.

 &HT;    PUNISHING NATO AIR CAMPAIGN NOT STOPPING 'SCORCHED EARTH'
CAMPAIGN IN KOSOVO
 &HT;    With KOSOVO-TROOPS-0330; KOSOVO-REFUGEES-0330.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Attacking civilians with helicopters, leveling
villages with heavy artillery and executing victims at will, Serb
troops stepped up what NATO called a ''scorched earth'' campaign
across Kosovo on Monday, putting to flight an estimated 300,000
ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   NATO reported that Serb paramilitary thugs executed a prominent
Kosovo diplomat, a newspaper editor and two other people in the
Kosovo capital of Pristina, in what human rights officials said
confirmed their worst fears about the terror unleashed inside the
tiny province.
</P>
<P>
   In a chilling echo of Serb tactics in Bosnia earlier this
decade, an estimated 20,000 ethnic Albanians have been herded
together by Serb forces near the town of Srbica, west of Pristina,
NATO officials said, with others rounded up near Prizren further
south, where a half dozen neighboring villages were ablaze.
</P>
<P>
   Further west, the city of Pec, important commercially and
culturally, was ``substantially destroyed,'' after men were
ominously rounded up and women and children ordered to flee or face
slaughter, NATO spokesman Jamie Shea told reporters at alliance
headquarters in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
   Locked in a desperate race against the savage ground tactics,
U.S. and allied forces turned a punishing air campaign directly
onto Serb military positions throughout Kosovo. American pilots
flew battlefield-grazing A-10 tank killers for the first time and
struck with other warplanes from higher altitudes at troops,
barracks and supplies.
</P>
<P>
   The White House continued to rule out the use of ground troops,
insisting that air power alone could exact a painful toll on Serb
forces and, eventually, strip them of their ability to wage terror.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president, the military leadership of this country, NATO,
the political leaders of NATO, believe we can accomplish our
military objectives through the air campaign that is ongoing,''
White House spokesman Joe Lockhart told reporters. ``We are in what
could be the early part of this.''
</P>
<P>
   In the sixth day of air strikes, American pilots flew A-10
Thunderbolt warplanes, built during the Cold War as a defense
against a Soviet tank invasion in Europe. The planes fly low and
slow over combat zones with the aim of destroying tanks, armored
personnel carriers and heavy artillery.
</P>
<P>
   Serb forces now have roughly 400 tanks, 300 armored personnel
carriers and 400 heavy artillery pieces in and around Kosovo,
supporting some 40,000 troops and hundreds of paramilitary thugs
rampaging across the province.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon also ordered five heavy B-1 bombers -- which can
carry up to 84 500-pound bombs, or 30 cluster bombs, each of which
unleashes 200 armor-piercing bomblets -- to the region, in a sign
that the United States plans to pound Serb troop positions and
vehicle columns with massive firepower.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said the B-1 bombers would
arrive in the area before the end of the week.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon also dispatched five additional EA-6Bs, jets used
to jam radar and other electronic systems critical to air defense
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The United Kingdom also beefed up its air arsenal, ordering four
additional Harrier jets -- also capable of attacking ground combat
forces at relatively close range -- and eight additional Tornado
warplanes.
</P>
<P>
   Bacon said the NATO attacks are being repackaged daily to bring
to bear the most potent and swiftest possible firepower directly
onto the forces carrying out the terror in Kosovo on the orders of
of Serb leader Slobodan Milosevic, president of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know whether I'd call it a race against time,'' said
Bacon. ``From the beginning it's been a race against Milosevic . .
. It is a race against Milosevic's murderous ways.''
</P>
<P>
   As refugees staggered across Kosovo's border into Albania at the
rate of 4,000 per hour, the State Department, for the first time,
suggested that Serb forces might be carrying out genocide, a legal
term with specific ramifications for the prosecution of war crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Abhorrent and criminal actions, I mean on a massive scale, are
occurring in Kosovo,'' State Department spokesman James Rubin told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``These include ethnic cleansing, war crimes and crimes against
humanity,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday in Pristina, Serbs executed Fehmi Agani, who was a
member of the Kosovar Albanian delegation to the recent peace
negotiations in France, NATO reported. He was killed shortly after
attending the funeral of a prominent human rights lawyer, who was
executed, along with his two sons, in Pristina on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Also on Sunday, Serbs executed Baton Haxhui, the editor in chief
of a popular Albanian newspaper in Kosovo, NATO reported.
</P>
<P>
   Reports of additional atrocities poured out of Kosovo. While
impossible to verify each report, Lockhart said the overall picture
was as credible as it was shocking.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have increasing reports, as people come across the border,
of atrocities, of men being separated from their families, of
executions, of towns being burned down, people being told to leave
within hours of face execution,'' Lockhart told reporters at the
White House. ``There are clearly an increasing number of these
reports, and we find them credible.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials described in grim vignettes the brutality of the
ongoing repression in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Helicopters are being used against the civil population.
Paramilitaries enter towns and villages and terrify the people,''
British Air Force Air Commodore David Wilby said at NATO
headquarters. ``Seven villages were set on fire between Pec and
Klina. Three villages west of Pristina were also burning, more
examples of the scorched-earth policy to discourage refugee
returns.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials insisted, however, that the Serb actions had been
planned for weeks by Milosevic and would have taken place with or
without NATO air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The current campaign is not a spontaneous outburst following
NATO's operations,'' Shea said. ``It looks much more like a
planned, conceived and executed . . . campaign against the civil
population.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Shea, ``We clearly see who is the victim and who is the
victimizer in this very, very difficult situation.''
</P>
<P>
   As further evidence of Serb designs to permanently rid Kosovo of
as many Albanians as possible, Shea said, troops were demanding
that Kosovars relinquish their passports even as they were being
forced at gunpoint to leave the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Refugees entering Albania are being stripped by the Serb
border forces of their passports, their ID cards, their papers,''
Shea said. ``It's almost as if their identities are being cancelled
out, as if they're being declared nonpersons, and, of course, that
makes any subsequent effort to return them to Yugoslavia much more
difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   British Foreign Minister Robin Cook told reporters in London
that Milosevic is trying to impose ``a new apartheid in Europe,
based on the cleansing, the forcible removal and execution of
people of the wrong ethnic identity in his region.
</P>
<P>
   ``That practice belonged to the Middle Ages. It does not belong
to the modern Europe,'' Cook said. ``We are right to fight it, and
that is why we cannot sop military action until we have stopped
that repression on the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. and NATO officials estimate that more than 3,000 people
have been killed in a year-long crackdown on ethnic Albanians in
Kosovo, a province in the republic of Serbia, one of two states,
along with neighboring Montenegro, making up the rump Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   As of Monday, the State Department estimated that more than a
half million people have been forced from their homes in the
province -- nearly one fourth of the population of 2.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   If anything, that number could be low. The Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe, which has been closely
monitoring the Kosovo situation for months, estimated that there
were more than 280,000 displaced people inside the province as of
Monday, a number likely rising by the hour.
</P>
<P>
   By late Sunday, there were an estimated 65,000 Kosovar Albanians
that had crossed into Albania; perhaps 30,000 in neighboring
Montenegro; and another 20,000 in Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   The 19-nation NATO alliance launched air strikes against
Yugoslavia last week, after the collapse of intensive international
peace efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Rebel Albanians -- who seek independence for the province --
agreed earlier this month to end their attacks on Serb security
forces if Serbs would accept a U.S.-backed peace plan calling for a
NATO peacekeeping force of 28,000 troops -- 4,000 of them American
-- in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic has rejected the peace plan.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials insisted Monday that the diplomatic door remains
open, and that air strikes can end anytime if Milosevic agrees to
the peace framework.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov was scheduled to meet
with Milosevic in Belgrade on Tuesday, pressing a diplomatic end to
the strikes.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials were not optimistic about Primakov's meeting, but
stressed that the White House supports any effort to persuade
Milosevic to accept the peace plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We welcome those who have influence on Belgrade who will take
a message about what it is they need to do in order to end this
allied air campaign,'' said Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has been a partner in the international efforts to broker
peace in Kosovo. Moscow has been an avid critic of NATO airstrikes,
though, against its Slavic brethren, the Serbs.

<P>
   Rebel Albanians -- who seek independence for the province --
agreed earlier this month to end their attacks on Serb security
forces if Serbs would accept a U.S.-backed peace plan calling for a
NATO peacekeeping force of 28,000 troops -- 4,000 of them American
-- in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic has rejected the peace plan.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials insisted Monday that the diplomatic door remains
open, and that air strikes can end anytime if Milosevic agrees to
the peace framework.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov was scheduled to meet
with Milosevic in Belgrade on Tuesday, pressing a diplomatic end to
the strikes.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials were not optimistic about Primakov's meeting, but
stressed that the White House supports any effort to persuade
Milosevic to accept the peace plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We welcome those who have influence on Belgrade who will take
a message about what it is they need to do in order to end this
allied air campaign,'' said Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has been a partner in the international efforts to broker
peace in Kosovo. Moscow has been an avid critic of NATO airstrikes,
though, against its Slavic brethren, the Serbs.

NIGERIAN LEADER VOWS TO END DECADES OF CORRUPTION AND RIGHTS ABUSE

</HEADLINE>

 By ETHAN BRONNER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The president-elect of Nigeria came to New York on
Monday to say that his country, an international pariah for 16
years, is now headed firmly toward democratic rule, privatization
of its huge oil industry and an end to decades of official
corruption and severe human rights abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Olusegun Obasanjo, 61, whose election on Feb. 27 was welcomed by
the West, appeared frank and direct as he spoke about Nigeria's
unsavory reputation. But he declined to offer specifics on what he
vowed would be sweeping reforms.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure you are used to bad news from Nigeria,'' he said,
adding that his country had been ``among the leading corrupt
nations of the world.'' He added: ``There is virtually no sector of
our society that has not been wounded. We have to bind the wounds
and bring conciliation and unity, give people hope and a sense of
belonging and participation.''
</P>
<P>
   Nigeria is Africa's most populous nation, with 108 million
inhabitants. It suffered a ruthless dictatorship under Gen. Sani
Abacha, which ended last June after five years when Abacha died
unexpectedly. His successor, Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar, began a
series of reforms, including elections, which ended in victory for
Obasanjo, a retired general and former president. He is to be
inaugurated on May 29.
</P>
<P>
   Obasanjo exuded charisma and self-confidence at the news
conference on Monday, with his powerful frame cloaked in a majestic
blue robe. He said his trip here, part of a world tour, was aimed
at reassuring political and business leaders of his sincerity,
skill and determination.
</P>
<P>
   He is expected in Washington on Tuesday to meet with top
American officials, including Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
and, tentatively, President Clinton, as well as leaders of the
World Bank and International Monetary Fund. He arrived here from
Europe, where he had offered his message of hope to the leaders and
investors of France, Germany and Britain, among others.
</P>
<P>
   Large advertising spreads in international newsmagazines and on
CNN in recent weeks have also sought to drive home the point that
Nigeria, one of the world's largest exporters of oil, has embarked
on a new course.
</P>
<P>
   Obasanjo was asked Monday if he would follow the South African
model of healing society's wounds with the equivalent of a Truth
and Reconciliation Commission to investigate the misdeeds of his
predecessors and their aides. He declined to commit himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I am on the saddle, then I'll make definitive
pronouncements,'' he said. He added that he did not now have the
information he needed. For example, speaking of his own
imprisonment for three years in 1995, he said he did not know the
story behind it.
</P>
<P>
   He was slightly more forthcoming in an interview with a
syndicated columnist, Jonathan Power, that appeared in The Los
Angeles Times on Sunday. On corruption, he said, ``You must show
that the practices you want to get rid of are punished,'' and
added: ``I will more than crack the whip. I will use the whip.''
</P>
<P>
   Obasanjo, a Yoruba from southern Nigeria, is said to have close
links to northern military leaders and was viewed during the
election campaign as a bridge between the two regions. He is the
only Nigerian ruler ever to have stepped down voluntarily, which he
did in 1979. At the time, he set the stage for a democratic system,
which was overthrown a few years later.

SUPREME COURT REFUSES TO HEAR APPEAL TO REINSTATE
AFFIRMATIVE-ACTION PROGRAM 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c. 1999 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court refused Monday to hear Dallas'
appeal to reinstate the Fire Department's affirmative-action
program, which a federal court had struck down as discriminatory
against white men.
</P>
<P>
   While setting no national precedent, the justices' action left
intact the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals' decision that the
city had failed to justify its preference for promoting women and
minorities as essential to remedy past discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court has ruled that affirmative-action programs are
constitutional only if they are ``narrowly tailored'' to remedy the
lingering effects of past discrimination. But the justices have yet
to define clearly how serious the effects must be to warrant
favoring women and minorities in employment and contracting
decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Justices Stephen G. Breyer and Ruth Bader Ginsburg, citing the
court's failure to define when affirmative-action plans are valid,
objected to their colleagues' refusal to hear Dallas's appeal. The
two justices _ who are President Clinton's only appointees to the
high court _ argued that the constitutionality of
affirmative-action programs nationwide will remain in question
until the high court gives definition.
</P>
<P>
   Under Supreme Court rules, at least four of the nine justices
must vote to hear an appeal before the high court will consider the
case. The court did not disclose whether any of the other seven
justices joined Breyer and Ginsburg in voting to hear Dallas's
appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas had argued that the 5th Circuit failed to give sufficient
weight to the low numbers of women and minorities in senior
positions at the city's fire department.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas also argued that the appeals court did not adequately
consider the history of discrimination in the fire house. The U.S.
Justice Department filed a civil-rights lawsuit against the city in
the 1970s, which Dallas settled in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas adopted its affirmative-action plan in 1988, when three
of the department's 103 lieutenants were black, three were Hispanic
and all were men.
</P>
<P>
   The Fire Department began promoting black, Hispanic and female
firefighters ahead of their white male colleagues who had scored
several points higher on the promotion examination.
</P>
<P>
   As of March 31, 1993, 17 of the department's 158 lieutenants
were black, seven Hispanic and four female, the city said.
</P>
<P>
   White firefighters who were denied promotion _ and successfully
challenged the affirmative-action plan _ countered that, while
discrimination might be a serious problem in the city's fire
department, artificially boosting the test scores of women and
minorities was not a constitutional solution. They argued that the
city should have beefed up its efforts to increase the number of
minorities and women through other methods, such as better
recruitment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that minorities and/or females continue to be
underrepresented in certain jobs does not mean that alternative
remedies have not been effective, but only that they do not operate
as quickly as out-of-rank promotions, based upon race and/or
gender,'' the white male firefighters argued in urging the justices
to reject Dallas's appeal.

<TEXT>
<P>
   HEKOU, China _ Pert and smiley, with slaggy walk and jerky
manner, Du Renming looks as amiable as an overgrown puppy.
</P>
<P>
   Days go by; Renming hangs out by a river that scrapes along the
jagged underbelly of China's long southern girth, with Vietnam on
the other side. Renming, 12, seems aimless, but he is always
looking for an easy victim.
</P>
<P>
   Here it comes. Maybe. A gaggle of red-capped tourists from
northern China approach a clearing by the riverfront, chattering
and snapping pictures. Renming circles in, eyes darting. He drifts
alongside an overweight woman with a fat red purse, but she notices
him getting close and clutches her moneybag, and he backs off.
</P>
<P>
   Renming is a pickpocket. He survives, and thrives, feeding off
the unsuspecting. He is in his element in this seedy border town,
where cunning seems a virtue and lawlessness is rewarded.
</P>
<P>
   Pasty-faced call girls loiter in front of ``beauty parlors''
that line the riverfront, offering a shampoo, a massage, or more.
Gambling takes place openly on card tables inside small
storefronts. Heroin is readily available, and cheap, coming from
nearby Myanmar and Laos.
</P>
<P>
   It is not a healthy environment for a child. Then again, it is
not really a healthy place for anyone. Except maybe for someone
looking for ``black money,'' as the Chinese call income earned by
illicit means.
</P>
<P>
   China's Communist officials often appear to outsiders like
stern, authoritarian keepers of a well-oiled monolith. Outside
Beijing, however, life on the ground often seems so chaotic and
thinly monitored that the government has trouble keeping track,
much less keeping control. That may be especially true in a border
town.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of youngsters here, Renming says, no longer bother with
school.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's boring,'' he said. ``My ma says I can learn more earning
money on the street.''
</P>
<P>
   His mother, Yang Lihua, shucks sugarcane in front of a little
stall where she also sells soft drinks and plastic footwear.
</P>
<P>
   ``He goes to school,'' she protested at first. But in the course
of conversation, she softened: ``Not every day. Sometimes.''
</P>
<P>
   Her banana trade went bad last year, Ms. Yang complained, as
suppliers from Vietnam became too numerous. So with her soft drink
stall barely breaking even, she says she needs the money her son
brings in. How much is that?
</P>
<P>
   ``It depends,'' she demurred.
</P>
<P>
   In part, it depends on how many times Renming gets caught by the
local police, who usually let him go after his mother produces some
``compensation'' in the form of cash. Sometimes, Renming says, his
mother and police squabble over the price. He has often spent the
night in the local police station, waiting for a deal to be cut.
</P>
<P>
   A few blocks away, a pimp named Liu, sporting a fine polo shirt
and a crewcut, spends most afternoons sitting outside a beauty
parlor he runs, joined by his four ``cows,'' as he calls his
prostitutes. Expressionless, they ignore the insults he regularly
tosses their way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Business is bad,'' Liu moaned. ``People aren't spending as
much as they did last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Liu tried his hand in the banana trade, too, but gave up last
year for the same reason as Ms. Yang. Running a beauty parlor is
better, he said, and the authorities do not bother him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The police here are all my friends,'' Liu said cheerfully,
explaining that he is a former policeman himself.
</P>
<P>
   Over at the bridge that leads to Vietnam, small-time trade seems
brisk. Five Vietnamese peasants with cone-shaped straw hats push
their transport, a single bicycle, loaded down with a dozen burlap
sacks bursting with coconuts.
</P>
<P>
   An old truck lumbers across the bridge, arriving at the Chinese
side with hemp piled as high as a haystack, to be used for whisk
brooms. A crowd of Vietnamese women, some dressed in traditional
gowns called ao dai, tote cooking utensils, knitwear and sacks of
rice back home.
</P>
<P>
   It is a lax border. Children playing in the river below the
bridge often swim to the Vietnam side, and back. No one seems to
mind.
</P>
<P>
   A plump border guard in a frayed uniform, ostensibly checking
civilian traders, lets most of them pass unchecked. Courteous and
talkative, he seemed most concerned one recent morning with
explaining the history of the bridge.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was built in the Qing dynasty,'' he said, shifting into
authoritative mode. ``It was built by imperialist French and
patriotic Chinese and it stayed open until 1979, when the war with
Vietnam broke out.''
</P>
<P>
   The war between China and Vietnam, that is.
</P>
<P>
   ``They beat you,'' the guard said to a visiting American. ``But
we completely demolished them.'' A historian might differ. After
China invaded Vietnam to ``teach it a lesson'' for its incursion
into Cambodia, Vietnam's battle-tested army actually defeated the
Chinese. It was years before the bridge reopened, in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   But who wants to challenge a man in uniform?
</P>
<P>
   A young man with oily hair, parted down the middle, walked up
and started talking about vast winnings at gambling, speaking in
non sequiturs. He had the glassy eyes of a heroin addict.
</P>
<P>
   The border guard watched him inquisitively.
</P>
<P>
   ``A friend of yours?'' the guard asked the visitor, smiling in
jest.
</P>
<P>
   Back at Ms. Yang's soda stand, Renming sipped a Sprite while he
eyed passers-by. His mother was shucking sugarcane again, and on
her forearm a faded tattoo spelled the word ``regret.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That was three years ago,'' she said, after her husband ran
off with a younger woman, leaving her with two young children and a
dying business.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll never love again,'' she said simply, as though she had
lost an odd possession. ``The main thing is to make money. I'm not
too good at that, either.''

DOW RISES 184.54 TO FINISH THE DAY OVER 10,000 FOR THE FIRST TIME

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Dow achieved a perfect 10 on Monday. Thousand,
that is.
</P>
<P>
   After nearly two weeks of thrust and parry, U.S. stock traders
pushed the Dow Jones industrial average above 10,000 on Monday and
kept it there until the end of the day's trading. The Dow Jones
industrial average closed at 10,006.78, up 184.54 points, or 1.9
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Although 10,000 on the Dow was little more than a psychological
hurdle for investors, the market's move is significant in what it
reflects: unparalleled strength of the U.S. economy and American
corporations' dominance of the world stage.
</P>
<P>
   American companies are taking for themselves more and more of
the world's profits. ``Back in 1990 the U.S.'s share was 36
percent; last year it was 44 percent,'' said Jeffrey M. Applegate,
chief investment strategist at Lehman Brothers in New York. ``That
goes a long way toward explaining why U.S. equities have had such
exemplary performance.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Dow has doubled in less than four years; it reached
5,000 in November 1995. It is up nearly ten-fold since 1982.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market's ability to sustain itself through all sorts of
climates and economic conditions _ inflation/deflation, growth/lack
of growth _ has been impressive,'' said Laszlo Birinyi, president
of Birinyi &AMP; Associates in Greenwich, Conn., and global trading
consultant for Deutsche Bank. ``The ease and the consistency:
that's what's so surprising about the market.''
</P>
<P>
   A lurking concern, however, is just how narrow the market's
advance has been. A growing portion of Americans' money is devoted
to the 30 well-known companies in the Dow and the stocks in the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index, which is near its peak. But many
portfolios have not matched the performance of the Dow and the S&AMP;P.
That's because a relatively small number of stocks have pulled the
indexes higher. The winners have been the best-known stocks with
household names, stocks like General Electric, American Express and
Wal-Mart.
</P>
<P>
   The number of stocks that are down significantly in the broad
market far outpaces the number that are at their peaks.
</P>
<P>
   Fully 76.4 percent of all stocks traded in the United States are
trailing the S&AMP;P's return by 15 percent or more. On the Nasdaq, 93
percent of stocks now fetch prices 10 percent or more below their
peaks, while 88 percent of the stocks on the New York Stock
Exchange fall into this category. Among the S&AMP;P stocks, three out
of four are at least 10 percent off their highs.
</P>
<P>
   According to statisticians at Salomon Smith Barney, the stocks
in the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index were on average 22.6 percent off
their highs as of Friday, while the New York Stock Exchange issues
were on average 33.4 percent below their peaks. Revealing how
concentrated this rally has been among big stocks with household
names, the Nasdaq stocks are on average 41.8 percent lower than
their peaks. These include many of the hot technology and Internet
stocks so popular among investors.
</P>
<P>
   Neither has the road to Dow 10,000 been pothole free. The
financial crisis that began in Asia with the devaluation of the
Thai baht in July 1997 and migrated to Russia last summer and then
to Brazil late in the year gave stock market investors their first
taste of significant losses in eight years. But three cuts in
interest rates by the Federal Reserve Board turned stocks around
last fall, and they have not looked back.
</P>
<P>
   Economic problems still simmer overseas: fourth-quarter data
from Japan, Germany and much of Latin America show gross domestic
product falling there. Indeed, despite the strength of the U.S.
economy, the group of seven industrialized nations is expected to
show economic growth slowing to a 2.6 percent annualized rate in
the fourth quarter of 1998, well below the 4.3 percent generated by
these nations in the comparable period in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   But difficulties abroad have only served to make the U.S. stock
market more of a haven to investors worldwide. Because the U.S.
economy is almost alone in experiencing a boom right now, stocks of
big American companies are viewed as the best way for investors to
take advantage of the good times. Even escalating hostilities in
Kosovo did not dampen investor enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   Ralph J. Acampora, director of technical research at Prudential
Securities was an early Wall Street believer in Dow 10,000. On
March 16, when the average first topped 10,000 and then retreated,
Acampora exulted: ``It's exciting. It's America. We all should get
up and sing God Bless America. These are our big stocks that are
leading. It's anything but irrational.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The stock market surely is America today. An estimated 45
percent of U.S. households own equities, up from about 14 percent
in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   And Americans who have been in the market during the 1990s have
been riding a superpowered engine of wealth creation. Over the past
decade, according to the Federal Reserve System, the value of
stocks held by U.S. households has risen 381 percent, before
inflation, handily beating real estate assets, which were up 55
percent for the period. The value of stocks held by American
households rose to $10.77 trillion last year and represented 25
percent of total household assets, up from 8 percent 15 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's increasing enthusiasm for stocks has been well
founded. For the last five years, the compounded annual return on
the S&AMP;P 500, including dividends, has averaged 24 percent, more
than double the 10.9 percent median annual increase in the index
since 1926.
</P>
<P>
   Declining interest rates, low inflation, increasing productivity
as a result of advancements in technology _ all have helped propel
American corporations to new levels of efficiency and the major
market averages to levels that are lofty by most measures.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lower rate structure has clearly been the majority of
strength in the market,'' said Ned Riley Jr., chief investment
officer at BankBoston. He argues that lower rates account for 80
percent of the return in the stock market this decade. ``Only 20
percent was the result of expanding earnings,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But interest rates would never have fallen had inflation not
dwindled. On an annualized basis, consumer prices are rising 1.6
percent, well below the average annual rate of 3.2 percent since
1926.
</P>
<P>
   One reason inflation is virtually nonexistent even after years
of economic strength is that labor costs remain in the cellar. So
even as the economy expands, traditionally a precursor to increased
inflation, there is little threat of overall price increases.
</P>
<P>
   Other factors behind the push to Dow 10,000 include an increase
in the nation's money supply, falling commodity prices and a very
recent and large decline in total shares outstanding in the market.
In the fourth quarter of last year, for example, the total shares
outstanding shrank by $178 billion, meaning investors had fewer
stocks from which to choose.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the rising tides of both the Dow and the S&AMP;P indexes have
not been enough to lift all investors' fortunes. With so many
stocks underwater, the market's rally sits on thinner and thinner
pilings.
</P>
<P>
   It is in fact a worry to many strategists that the market has
become even more bifurcated _ a few haves and many have-nots _ than
it was last year. While investors rhapsodize over big, famous-name
stocks like Microsoft and McDonald's, smaller issues are scorned.
The Russell 2000 index of small-capitalization stocks is down 7.7
percent for the year.
</P>
<P>
   But Timothy J. Morris, chief investment officer of Bessemer
Trust in New York, argues that this market split makes sense. ``You
could make a very strong argument that investors have acted
rationally, rewarding companies that have very strong earnings
gains and penalizing ones that haven't,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, until the market's rise broadens to include more
than the top household-name companies, fears remain that the rally
will fizzle.
</P>
<P>
   Acampora of Prudential Securities predicts that the Dow will hit
11,500 this year, a 15 percent gain from Monday's close. And it may
not be a coincidence that the average pressed through 10,000 just
two trading days after Abby Joseph Cohen, the Goldman Sachs
strategist who is also Wall Street's favorite bull, raised her
estimate slightly for stocks this year.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the forces that have helped push the market higher have
been losing steam in recent weeks. That leads some market analysts
to wonder how much more investors can expect from stocks this year.
</P>
<P>
   The growth in the nation's money supply has slowed substantially
this year. That growth in money, as measured in the broadest sense
to include money market funds, currency in circulation, checking
and savings accounts, helped stabilize the stock market during the
financial crises last fall. Much of the additional money found its
way into equities. A decline in that growth could put a lid on
stocks. Early this year, according to Christine Callies, equity
strategist at Credit Suisse First Boston, annualized growth in
money supply fell to 8.4 percent from 16.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Interest rates have also been nudged higher by bond traders,
nervous that strong economic growth in the United States could
ignite inflation. The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond stands at
5.64 percent, well above the 5.1 percent level at year end. The
jump could be temporary, of course, but every increase in rates
makes bonds slightly more attractive when compared with stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Another worry is that violent price swings in stocks are
increasing. According to the Leuthold Group, in the first two
months of the year, the S&AMP;P closed each day with an up or down move
of 1 percent or more 45 percent of the time. Between 1992 and 1998,
such moves took place only 8 percent of the time.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the Dow reached the milestone on Monday, Tom Telegades,
who said he works for an Internet company, shrugged off its
importance on his way through Grand Central Terminal. ``I'm in the
market, but it has no impact on me whatsoever,'' he said. ``It
doesn't make any difference in my investment strategy. I'm not
doing anything extra because of it.
</P>
<P>
   Investors' overall enthusiasm is not surprising, given stocks'
recent bravura performance. According to James Paulsen, chief
investment officer at Wells Capital Management in Minneapolis,
during the past five years, the stock market has declined about one
out of four days. Only during the bull stampede beginning in 1926
and extending to 1929 was there less downward movement in stocks.
</P>
<P>
   This outsized performance has also brought stocks to valuations
never seen before. The stocks in the S.&AMP;P. 500 are trading at 34
times their earnings, more than double the median valuation of
around 15 for the index historically. And the value of the U.S.
stock market now exceeds the nation's gross domestic product by a
sizable amount.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, U.S. stocks are still very much the place to be.
Eight years of rising share prices are a powerful draw.

ARGENTINA GRANTS ASYLUM TO ACCUSED PARAGUAYAN GENERAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By CLIFFORD KRAUSS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina _ The Argentine government Monday denied
a request by the newly installed Paraguayan government to extradite
its former military chief, who is accused of having ordered the
assassination of the Paraguayan vice president.
</P>
<P>
   The Argentine Interior Ministry announced that the former
commander, Gen. Lino Oviedo, would be granted political asylum, an
act that will surely create tensions between two partners in the
Mercosur trade union.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the day, the new Paraguayan interior minister, Walter
Bower, said it would respect Argentina's decision.
</P>
<P>
   Oviedo's flight here on Sunday night to seek asylum and the
request for his extradition put Argentina in the middle of a
political crisis in Paraguay. The situation boiled over on Tuesday
with the assassination of Vice President Luis Maria Argana and
intensified on Sunday with the forced resignation of President Raul
Cubas.
</P>
<P>
   A Paraguayan judge Monday ordered Cubas to be placed under house
arrest on charges of negligent homicide stemming from the deaths of
several protesters last week. Bower later said Cubas had
parliamentary immunity and could not be detained. As a former
president, he is a senator for life.
</P>
<P>
   The protracted crisis dates from what was interpreted as a
failed coup attempt by Oviedo, a populist, in 1996 to oust
President Juan Carlos Wasmosy. Oviedo ran for president last year.
But during the campaign he was imprisoned on charges related to
that episode. That led to Cubas' election.
</P>
<P>
   When Cubas defied the Supreme Court in August and freed Oviedo
as one of his first acts in office, that set off a move to impeach
him by congressional opponents and by Argana. His assassination by
men in military fatigues set off street demonstrations and violence
that finally forced Cubas to resign.
</P>
<P>
   Paraguayan prosecutors have accused Oviedo of having
masterminded Argana's assassination. A Paraguayan judge has also
accused him of involvement in the slayings of six young
demonstrators who marched against Cubas' government last week.
</P>
<P>
   As 60,000 people gathered on the streets of Asuncion on Sunday
night to celebrate the emergence of Sen. Luis Gonzalez Macchi as
Paraguay's new president, Oviedo spirited himself out of the
country.
</P>
<P>
   He was arrested at a military airport outside Buenos Aires on
Sunday after he and his family had arrived in a small plane without
a flight plan, immigration papers or permission to land.
</P>
<P>
   At first, Argentine President Carlos Saul Menem, who was on a
trade mission in Italy, told reporters that ``we are going to take
our time'' before deciding whether to extradite or grant asylum.
Four hours later, the Interior Ministry announced that asylum would
be granted, for reasons that were unclear.
</P>
<P>
   Menem's decision may ultimately help tip the scales of the
struggle between the forces that back Oviedo and those who support
Gonzalez Macchi. There is a long tradition of Latin American
politicians' playing significant roles when under asylum in
neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
   The two competing forces represent opposing factions of the
Colorado Party, which has ruled the landlocked country of 5.7
million people for 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   Argentina and Brazil, the two most important countries in
Mercosur, which includes Paraguay and Uruguay, intervened jointly
to help defend civilian rule in 1996. But Menem has long had good
relations with Oviedo, who has styled himself as a populist in the
tradition of Gen. Juan D. Peron of Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   The extradition request was personally made by Paraguay's top
prosecutor, Jorge Vasconcellos, Monday morning in Buenos Aires.
Congressman Angel Ramon Barchini, who accompanied Vasconcellos from
Asuncion, said Oviedo was ``the man who thought up and is morally
responsible for the assassination of the vice president.''

COMPAQ EXPANDS BUILD-TO-ORDER LINE OF PCs 
 
By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c. 1999 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Compaq Computer Corp. announced a plan Monday to
expand sales of its new build-to-order Prosignia line of PCs,
including selling the machines for the first time in retail stores.
</P>
<P>
   The PC maker also said some of its largest resellers would take
up space on its Houston factory floor, building Prosignia systems
for small and medium businesses as orders come in.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq also introduced a new server for small businesses that
should make it easier to set up and operate a network. The
Prosignia NeoServer will sell for as little as $1,399.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's announcement built on an initiative that Compaq
launched in November to staunch the growth of arch-rival Dell
Computer Corp. and others who sell PCs directly to customers.
</P>
<P>
   During a conference call with reporters and analysts Monday,
Compaq executives said the company's push to reach small and medium
businesses was working.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seventy percent of our (Prosignia) sales are incremental to
Compaq _ they are new business,'' said Chief Executive Eckhard
Pfeiffer. ``Almost half of the new business has been a switch from
purchasing from Dell or Gateway.''
</P>
<P>
   Compaq stock closed at 31-1/2 Monday, up 5/16 in trading on the
New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, the Prosignia line of desktops, servers and portable
computers is sold either via phone, on Compaq's Web site or through
the company's network of resellers.
</P>
<P>
   Pfeiffer said the Prosignia line will be sold through
office-supply stores Office Max, Office Depot and Staples, as well
as through CompUSA, a computer superstore. In all, 600 stores
nationally will carry the line.
</P>
<P>
   Customers will be able to see display models in the stores, then
order them via kiosks that currently are used to sell some Presario
consumer machines.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq's Web site will be redesigned to make it easier to get to
the areas where customers can buy machines direct. The new look
will be unveiled today.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq also will launch a new program called PartnerDirect,
which will make it easier for resellers to order and deliver the
Prosignia line.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the program, Ingram Micro and TechData _ two giant
resellers _ will set up shop on Compaq's factory floor, taking and
fulfilling orders from customers and smaller resellers.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq calls the overall program Customer Choice, and Pfeiffer
said it gives its small and medium business customers a variety of
ways to buy the company's products.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan Brock, an analyst with Access Media International, a New
York City-based market research firm, said Compaq has developed ``a
pretty impressive model.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tough balance to strike between direct, retail and the
resellers,'' Brock said.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq also announced a new Prosignia notebook computer that
uses Advanced Micro Devices' K6-2 chip. The Prosignia 150, which
starts at $1,799, marks the first time Compaq has used the K6-2 in
a business product. The last Compaq business computer that had an
AMD chip used a clone of the 80486 processor in the now-defunct
Prolinea line.

   DOW CLOSES ABOVE 10,000, REFLECTING STRONG ECONOMY
</P>
<P>
   After nearly two weeks of thrust and parry, stock traders pushed
the Dow Jones industrial average above 10,000 and kept it there
until the end of the day's trading. The Dow closed at 10,006.78, up
184.54 points, or 1.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Although 10,000 on the Dow was little more than a psychological
hurdle for investors, the market's move is significant in what it
reflects: unparalleled strength of the economy and American
corporations' dominance of the world stage.
</P>
<P>
   Almost lost in the shuffle of the Dow's record-setting day was a
solid performance by broader gauges. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500-stock index rose 27.37 points, or 2.1 percent, to 1,310.17,
while the Nasdaq composite index jumped 73.67 points, or 3 percent,

CONTROL EQUIPMENT FAILURES DELAY FLIGHTS AT DULLES  (sw) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ First a radar dish at the edge of a runway quit.
Then on the radar screens where the airplanes should have been a
strange line appeared that ``looked like an EKG,'' according to one
controller. Finally the smell of smoke filled the control room. In
all, four separate failures at Dulles Airport led to the delay of
more than 100 planes on Saturday and Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem was errors made repairing the first failure,
but part was just bad luck, said Stanley Rivers, the top Federal
Aviation Administration official in charge of air traffic control
equipment, performing a Monday mrning post-mortem.
</P>
<P>
   Paul M. Rinaldi, president of the Dulles local of the National
Air Traffic Controllers Association, said part of the problem is
``how aging this equipment is, and how badly we need to replace
this equipment.'' Rinaldi said that much of the equipment that
failed is scheduled to be replaced in May 2002, if the FAA can hold
to its current schedule.
</P>
<P>
   The control room at Dulles is a Terminal Radar Approach Control,
or TRACON, which handles traffic en route to airports in the
Washington area, and is one of the 25 busiest such centers in the
country. Dulles itself is a major airport for international and
long-haul domestic flights.
</P>
<P>
   Scattered failures are common, but the events at Dulles included
a very unusual problem, an electrical component that smoked as it
failed. About 18 controllers were ordered out of their control room
on Sunday morning, and when they returned, they did so two at a
time, in 15-minute shifts to avoid overexposure to fumes.
</P>
<P>
   About 114 airliners were delayed in leaving on Saturday and
Sunday, the FAA said; an undetermined number of inbound aircraft
were put in holding patterns or told not to take off.
</P>
<P>
   The problems began before 7 a.m. on Saturday, when the
controllers in the TRACON lost contact with a radar at the edge of
the airfield. A technician concluded that there was a problem with
the power supply for the link between the radar and the
controllers' screens, and replaced some components. The radar went
back into service at 10:35 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   But at 1:45 p.m. it failed again. Technicians decided that a
sensor that decides when to start a cooling fan had failed, and
triggered a power interruption. The system was running again at
8:05 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   During the failure, controllers were patched through to another
radar, which has a blind spot several miles wide where planes
approach Dulles from the west. And the back-up radar provides less
frequent updates, so controllers spaced out planes, five miles from
each other instead of three, creating delays.
</P>
<P>
   At 7:40 a.m. on Sunday, controllers started seeing something on
their screens ``like you would see in Star Wars when they go into
hyper-drive,'' said Rinaldi. While that was being fixed,
controllers were sent to one screen in the tower at Dulles that was
still working. But then one of the screens in the main control
room, one floor under the fishbowl tower, began to smoke, delaying
a return to normal operations until 11:15 a.m. Sunday.

CREDIT RATING AGENCY WARNS N.H. 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RALPH JIMENEZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, N.H. _ Moody's Investors Services fired a shot across
the financial bow of the State of New Hampshire Monday by placing
$1.73 billion in debt owed by the state, its muncipalities, and
school districts on its Watchlist.
</P>
<P>
   The move is a warning that credit ratings are in danger of being
lowered. A lower credit rating means higher interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire has the financial wherewithal to pay the estimated
$1.5 billion cost of public education but still can't figure out
how to divvy up the bill, the rating service said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The state Legislature has considered many proposals for new
revenue sources, including taxes on income, property, capital
gains, businesses, and cigarettes,'' said Moody's vice president
Michael Bartsch in a statement Monday. ``No single source or
combination of sources has achieved political consensus or emerged
as the leading candidate at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday's action came on the eve of a planned vote by the
400-member House on a school financing proposal passed by the
Senate last week. Because that plan relies in part on an income
tax, however, Governor Jeanne Shaheen has pledged to veto it.
</P>
<P>
   Shaheen's own plan, which relies largely on increased business
taxes and revenue from gambling, has yet to pass in either body.
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire is under orders by the state Supreme Court to find
a replacement for its unconstitutional system of funding schools by
April 1.
</P>
<P>
   There is still time left on the clock but perhaps not much,
Moody's warned. ``If future events warrant, however, Moody's may
downgrade the ratings of affected bonds issued by cities, towns,
school districts, and the New Hampshire Municipal Bond Bank, and
possibly the general-obligation bonds of the state, as well,''
Bartsch said.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for another New York bond-rating agency, Standard
and Poor's, said New Hampshire has not been placed on its watch
list nor are there plans to do so.
</P>
<P>
   With an estimated $3 million per day in local school property
taxes slated to become illegal Thursday, Shaheen was quick to
assure lenders that the state will find a way out of its impasse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am confident that we will arrive at a solution before the
timely payment of any debt service is jeopardized,'' the governor
said.

   On Thursday morning, after he announced the ``resignations'' of
the popular police chief and two other city department heads _ his
biggest bombshell as mayor _ reporters and television news people
were calling nonstop, outraged critics were dishing out sound
bites, and Brown, peaceful as a monk, was wowing a small gathering
of citizens celebrating Greek-American Independence Day at City
Hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``You put our city on the map,'' said Steven Angelopoulous,
sounding like actor Roberto Benigni after he won his Oscars.
``Every one in the nation is watching us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm having fun,'' Brown said. And clearly, at that instant, he
was. The famously dour Jerry Brown actually sort of smiled.
</P>
<P>
   But it has not all been fun. In the past several weeks, the
ex-two-term governor and ex-three-time presidential candidate has
begun trying to make good on the promises he made at his
inauguration in January and reawaken this city ``of unfulfilled
potential'' (not to mention his own political career). Brown has
been scrutinizing city departments, lining up his own management
team, doing, as he said in an interview, ``what any new mayor would
do.'' But with almost every move, there have been increasing
rumblings that the 61-year-old novice mayor is charging too hard,
too fast.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters _ and there are more and more of those weighing in on
the letters pages of the local papers _ say they are thrilled by
the pace Brown is setting. But critics accuse him of issuing orders
and declaring what is good and bad for this long-maligned, racially
diverse city of 400,000 without the input of the people who
supported his landslide victory. They say he is acting like the old
Jerry Brown, which is to say, the young Jerry Brown, a Know-it-All.
</P>
<P>
   Rallies and protests _ both at City Hall and in front of the
downtown loft Brown calls home _ greeted his public pronouncements
against Chief Joseph Samuels Jr., who happens to be a deacon in one
of the most politically active churches in the city. Brown has also
faced protests for inviting the Marines to hold urban war games in
Oakland, for endorsing a state senator's proposal to replace the
management of the city's schools with a trustee the mayor would
appoint, even for the manner in which the city manager (who is, in
effect, his deputy) told all city department leaders that their
jobs were in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jerry is acting like the governor of Oakland,'' complained
Shannon Reeves, the 30-year-old president of the local chapter of
the NAACP, who came in third in the list of 10 political contenders
Brown defeated to become mayor. ``Jerry Brown's whole objective is
to get back on the national scene, so he's moving as fast as he can
so he can show the national politicians he's a player. He's not
consulting the people of the community.''
</P>
<P>
   Although a coalition consisting of leaders of the clergy has
circulated two petitions in recent weeks _ one urging respect for
the police chief, the other in support of a local solution to
school changes _ another coalition of religious leaders has been
standing by the mayor at each potentially explosive public
engagement. The parallel reactions to his style are the kind that
have followed Brown throughout his political life. He infuriates
some, exhilarates others.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Brown knows there are worse things for a
politician to be called than hard-charging and brash. In a way, he
seems to be replaying the adrenaline-charged first months of his
last political comeback 10 years ago, when he became state chairman
of the Democratic Party after a six-year hiatus from politics that
followed his losing Senate bid against the then-obscure Pete
Wilson. Greeted as a celebrity, if not a savior, almost everywhere
he goes, Brown can still afford to pooh-pooh his crop of critics as
a small, noisy group of naysayers.
</P>
<P>
   Almost everyone, he said, acknowledges that crime is a problem,
that the school system, which became a national laughingstock for
briefly embracing ebonics a few years ago, needs drastic help and
that downtown, where the Starbucks shutters up at night and on
weekends, needs an infusion of life.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is that Oakland has great potential and I'm tired of
waiting for it,'' Brown said, sitting preternaturally straight in a
hard-backed chair in his office after his remarks to the
Greek-American Independence Day celebration. ``Oakland is poised
for change. I want to reduce the crime, I want people to return to
the city. I want vertical density back in Oakland. That's what
we're trying to accomplish here.''
</P>
<P>
   Under Samuels' six-year tenure as police chief, crime in
Oakland, with a largely poor, minority population, has decreased,
but not as drastically as it could have, given the national trend,
Brown said. He compared Oakland's 81 murders last year with the 63
in San Francisco, a city twice its size, and shook his head. But
when asked if it would be fair to compare Oakland to a city with
more similar demographics, such as Detroit or Washington, he waved
his hand dismissively.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can do a lot better,'' Brown said impatiently. ``We're
bringing in people, we're bringing in artists and business people.
But in order to accomplish our goal, attract people and make this a
better city for the people who've suffered the bad times, we've got
to bring crime way down. That's the priority.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. J. Alfred Smith, senior pastor of Allen Temple Baptist
Church, where the outgoing police chief is a member, said he
worried that Brown was going to bring in a chief who would focus on
statistics rather than community relations.
</P>
<P>
   Under Samuels' six-year tenure, Smith said, crime has gone down
more than at any other time in the city, while relations between
the police and the community have improved.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't really know what Jerry Brown is going to do,'' Smith
said, ``because he hasn't told us. Is the city of Oakland going to
go the way of New York under Giuliani? And does that mean we're
going to face what's going on in New York City right now?''
</P>
<P>
   There are rumors that Brown plans to bring in a former New York
police chief to run the Oakland department _ rumors that he refused
to discuss.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every mayor has the right to bring in the people he or she
thinks will do the best job,'' Brown said. ``That's what I intend
to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Shannon Reeves of the NAACP said there was a rumor spreading
around the city that Brown was hoping to use Oakland as a
springboard to the U.S. Senate. The scenario, he said, is that Al
Gore will pick Senator Dianne Feinstein as his vice presidential
running mate, and Brown will run for her Senate seat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not thinking that far ahead,'' Brown said, his brow
furrowed.
</P>
<P>
   Reminded that that election was just a year away, he shook his
head. ``I'm focusing on Oakland,'' he said. ``Shaking things up.
Turning things around.''
</P>
<P>
   He stopped, caught his political cliches and smiled, for the
second time in less an hour.

ALBANY LEADERS DO LITTLE ON BUDGET BUT TRY TO FIX BLAME
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ With the start of the new fiscal year just three
days away, Gov. George Pataki and legislative leaders did nothing
to resolve their budget differences Monday and instead bickered
over who was to blame for the stalemate.
</P>
<P>
   The day began on an unusually contentious note when Assembly
Speaker Sheldon Silver, a Democrat, called Joseph Bruno, the
Republican majority leader of the state Senate, ``a wimp'' and all
but dared him to defy the Republican governor's recent threat to
veto any legislative budget that did not restrain spending next
year.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview on WROW-AM Monday morning, Silver strongly
suggested that Pataki would back away from his threat if Bruno and
his Senate colleagues ``would show they exist in Albany, that they
are not tools of the governor, which is all they are showing
themselves to be.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``If they showed they could override, then the
governor would think twice about talking in such heroic terms.''
</P>
<P>
   But Pataki and his Republican colleague, Bruno, immediately
fired back, dismissing Silver's attacks as unnecessary and accusing
him of causing the impasse by seeking to spend imprudently.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact of the matter is the Assembly is completely
unrealistic and totally off the charts in what they are proposing
to spend,'' Pataki said at a news conference Monday morning. ``It
would leave the state with huge, multibillion-dollar deficits and
beyond. We're not going to let that happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruno, for his part, laughed off the suggestion that he lacked
the fortitude to exercise independence from the governor. ``I don't
think anyone who knows me considers me a wimp, including the
speaker,'' he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   He also accused Silver of seeking to increase spending in
``irresponsible ways.'' Bruno said he believed that the speaker was
``intent on diverting attention'' and blamed him for having
``slowed the process down'' and having ``really brought it to a
standstill.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I personally feel that we cannot overspend this year,'' Bruno
said. ``So I am more in tune with the governor in terms of spending
this year than I am with the Assembly.''
</P>
<P>
   The exchange underscored just how deeply divided state leaders
remained over the budget for the coming fiscal year, which begins
Thursday. After two years of steep spending increases, Pataki has
vowed to keep a lid on spending in the next fiscal year. He has
proposed increasing state spending by 1.8 percent, to $72.66
billion, despite the state's $2 billion surplus.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Republicans want to raise spending by at least 2.7
percent. The Assembly's Democratic majority has proposed an
increase that it puts at 4.6 percent but that Senate Republicans
put at 5.4 percent and the governor's office says is closer to 8
percent. Pataki has criticized the Senate and Assembly plans,
threatening to veto them if they are not scaled back.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The negotiations over the budget are so deadlocked that the
Senate and the Assembly once again failed to meet in conference
committees Monday to try to work out their differences. Bruno and
Silver blamed each other for the failure to meet.
</P>
<P>
   The conference committee process between the Senate and the
Assembly began last year and represented a major break from the way
budgets have historically been adopted in Albany. Until 1997, the
governor and legislative leaders negotiated the budget in secret
meetings. Last year, the Senate and the Assembly, in a bid to make
the process more public and involve more legislators, met in
conference committees to negotiate a budget publicly with little
direct input from the governor.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki applauded the process but then vetoed more than 1,000
line items worth more than $1 billion in spending, most of it in
Democrats' pet projects. Though the vetoes surprised lawmakers from
both parties, Democrats who control the Assembly are the most wary,
fearing a repeat of last year.

DIGITAL TRACKS YIELD CLUES TO CREATOR OF INTERNET VIRUS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., Pa., Fla.)  (nk) 
 By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ Following the telltale digital fingerprints
of the author of a rapidly spreading computer virus, a lone
software detective has assembled a dossier suggesting that the
virus writer has struck before and that the programmer's activities
are already well known to computer security experts.
</P>
<P>
   The investigator, Richard Smith, 45, is the president of Phar
Lap Software, a small software development company here. Although
Smith usually spends his time designing software tools and
operating systems, over the weekend he used programmers' tools to
peer inside the document that carries the virus known as Melissa,
which has spread wildly through the Internet in recent days.
</P>
<P>
   Smith found indications that the virus is a work of a programmer
_ or possibly a small group _ who wrote and distributed a similar
program two years ago. Moreover, by searching the World Wide Web,
he has found clues to the identity of the programmers and even more
striking evidence that could lead the authorities to the computer
on which the program was written.
</P>
<P>
   Monday Smith turned that information over to the FBI. Paul
Bresson, a spokesman for the agency, would say only, ``We have a
case that's open and we're actively investigating the virus.''
</P>
<P>
   Distributing a computer virus is a federal crime.
</P>
<P>
   Whoever the virus writer is, the work took its toll Monday. The
Computer Emergency Response Team, a Pentagon-financed security
service at Carnegie Mellon University, reported calls from 250
organizations indicating that the virus had affected at least
100,000 workplace computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe the number is probably higher than that,'' said
Jeff Carpenter, a team leader for the group, but because of
precautions taken by companies over the weekend, ``we do think the
problem has not been as bad today as we feared it might be.''
</P>
<P>
   The virus, which began to cause havoc on Friday, is like a chain
letter spread in an e-mail attachment listing several pornographic
Web sites. When recipients open the attachment, it tries to mail
itself to 50 other e-mail addresses stored in the user's computer,
propagating itself each time with the subject line ``Important
Message From'' followed by the name of the previous victim.
</P>
<P>
   The high-tech sleuthing by Smith is remarkable in part because
he was the one who earlier this month raised questions about the
propriety of a little-known Microsoft feature that embeds unique
hardware numbers in every Microsoft Office document file.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft designed the numbering scheme to help track software
objects and documents in a computer network. The company said it
would change the feature after Smith revealed that the company was
compiling the numbers of its users' computers in a database.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, however, Smith found a new use for the numbering
scheme: It meant that the Melissa file carried a unique fingerprint
corresponding to the personal computer on which it was created. And
because the Microsoft Word program is designed to embed information
in each document about each user who has written or revised it, the
file also had what amounted to an author list.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday evening, Smith collected that information and posted
it to an Internet news group that discusses software viruses. Later
that evening he received a response from a Swedish computer science
graduate student who said the virus writer's activities appeared to
be similar to those of a known virus author who had identified
himself as VicodinES in computer network postings.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me the Melissa virus looked very similar,'' Smith
said. ``He had noticed a similar software coding style.''
</P>
<P>
   The graduate student also pointed Smith to a Web site that was
maintained by VicodinES.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started looking for files which contained the same Ethernet
address,'' the number that provides the digital fingerprint, Smith
said. ``Then we could assume the same computer and maybe the same
person was the author of Melissa.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday he succeeded. In addition, he downloaded files from
the Web site that had been revised under the names of multiple
authors, indicating that the work could be a collaboration.
</P>
<P>
   Another avenue of searching the Web yielded more about the
identity of the virus creator. On Saturday Smith discovered that
Solomon, an anti-virus software company, had posted an alert that
the virus had been mailed on Friday to an online discussion, or
news group, from an America Online account.
</P>
<P>
   Exploring with a Web search engine known as Deja News, which
indexes news groups, he discovered that the same account had posted
a virus in December 1997. He found serial numbers that linked
VicodinES to the America Online posting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty clear that VicodinES is somehow related to all
this,'' Smith said. ``Whether he's the author I don't know, but he
has his fingerprints everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he also found what appear to be actual names buried in
several documents.
</P>
<P>
   Frederik Bjorck, a doctoral student at Stockholm University, who
was also contacted Monday by the FBI, said that he and Smith had
shared some information, but they essentially reached the same
conclusion independently: that Melissa can be traced to a virus
writer who uses the moniker VicodinES.
</P>
<P>
   ``VicodenES is definitely a talent,'' Bjorck said. ``He's the
brains behind this.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   He said his investigation led him to believe that the virus
might have been written with help from others.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet host of the VicodinES Web page is SourceofKaos, a
loose organization of Web sites that its creator says is dedicated
to freedom of speech. The creator, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said SourceofKaos was the free host of the Web sites of
people with unpopular views, with most of the sites related to
virus collection, detection and creation.
</P>
<P>
   The creator of SourceofKaos, based in Orlando, Fla., said that
he had never met VicodinES, but that they had corresponded last
year on the Internet. He said he recalled VicodinES as being of
``high school-ish'' age, but added that VicodinES had a reputation
as a talented virus writer.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's capable of doing what this virus does,'' the creator
said.
</P>
<P>
   The VicodinES home page touts the accomplishments of the ``noted
virus researcher VidodinES,'' including the creation of two viruses
intended for Microsoft products. One virus VicodinES claims to have
created infects Excel 97, while a second is designed to infect
Office 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Steve R. White, senior manager of anti-virus research at the IBM
Watson Research Center in Hawthorne, N.Y., said Melissa ``has
spread more widely and rapidly than any PC virus in history,''
noting that it is too soon to tell the extent of damage because
computer security professionals still are in ``the fog of battle.''

ALBANIAN BORDER   FILLS WITH REFUGEES, FRANTIC TALES
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN MILLIGAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KUKES, Albania _ For the villagers of Celin, the shelling,
executions, and forced march out of Kosovo started only hours after
NATO dropped bombs on Yugoslavia, an attack meant to drive away the
Serbs and stop their assaults on ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   But in the early hours Thursday, 43-year-old Masar Rexhepi
recalled, 12 Serbian tanks surrounded the village, sending Rexhepi
and others fleeing into the mountains. One family, told by the
Serbs that they would be safe as long as they stayed indoors,
huddled in their home.
</P>
<P>
   Rexhepi found their bodies that night in the family's courtyard,
13 people dead from bullet wounds and burned so badly that Rexhepi
could only identify five of the corpses.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were crying and screaming,'' said a shaken Rexhepi, one
of the town's survivors and now among the estimated 60,000-plus
terrified refugees who have streamed over the border from Kosovo to
Albania in the last several days.
</P>
<P>
   The small northern town of Kukes looks like a massive refugee
camp, as ethnic Albanians _ reportedly forced at gunpoint or by
intimidation to leave _ flood Albania. Extended families of crying
infants and shivering adults, with only a few bags of belongings
among them, sit helplessly along the grimy streets, waiting to get
shelter.
</P>
<P>
   A noisy line of cars, tractors, and weary, tearful pedestrians
has been weaving its way across the Morino crossing, near Kukes.
Officials for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees estimate that
more than 60,000 have crossed there, and another 1,500 have come
over a neighboring border checkpoint.
</P>
<P>
   The cash-strapped government of Albania sent hordes of buses to
bring Kosovars to the capital Tirana and other towns, but officials
say there is not nearly enough room in refugee camps to accommodate
them.
</P>
<P>
   Cars and buses clogged the narrow, badly paved road that winds
up and down the mountains between Tirana and Kukes _ a road where
vehicles are usually few. Open-topped trucks were packed with
refugees wrapped in blankets against the cold mountain winds.
</P>
<P>
   The massive, apparently enforced departure could be the biggest
episode of ethnic cleansing in this decade's series of Yugoslav
wars. For these Kosovar refugees, the journey has been a
terrifying, grueling trip from perhaps Europe's most dangerous
country to its poorest one.
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult to confirm the refugees' reports of what Serb
forces did. But many refugees told credible-sounding stories, and
there is a strong consistency to the pattern of brutality they
ascribe to the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   The refugees' tales begin with shelling and shooting _ including
executions _ by Serbs in camouflage army uniforms. The military
men, refugees said, then rounded up villagers, brought them to a
central point, such as a school, and separated the men from the
women and children.
</P>
<P>
   Passports, identification cards, driver's licenses, money, and
license plates were confiscated, the refugees reported.
</P>
<P>
   The villagers then were ushered to the border by a combination
of Serb trucks and forced marching. Many said the Serbs, often
pointing the butt of a Kalashnikov at villagers' heads, required
them to yell ``Long Live Serbia!'' while holding up their thumb and
first two fingers of their right hands in a Serb nationalist
salute.
</P>
<P>
   Vefai Rexheni, a deaf man who could not understand the Serb
order, was dragged off and hit with a rifle when he did not perform
the Serb salute, said a math teacher. The Serbs shot him dead, said
his wife, who witnessed his slaying.
</P>
<P>
   The group of about 5,000 rounded up in Celin were loaded onto
trucks and driven to Zhura, about three miles from the border,
Rexhepi said. Then, ordered to keep their hands clasped behind
their heads, they were marched to the border in rows of three.
</P>
<P>
   Those who made it into Albania include a substantial number of
fighting-age men, an indication that the Serbs are not conducting
wholesale killing of men, or even of men they might suspect of
being members of the Kosovo Liberation Army. The KLA has been
fighting for independence from Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Other refugees told of alleged atrocities. Ramodan Shaqiri, 37,
said he and his wife, seeking basement shelter from the Serb
shelling, had viewed the bodies of 37 neighbors who had been shot
and whose faces had been mutilated.
</P>
<P>
   The overwhelming theme of the refugees' stories, however, is
less one of mass murder and more one of a calculated plan to drive
Albanians from Kosovo permanently.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole of Kosovo has moved,'' said Nazishi Bytyci, 23, as
she sat on a lawn in Kukes strewn with garbage, gravel, and the
whitened bones of farm animals.

COMPUTER VIRUS LEAVES MANY USERS REELING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A nasty computer virus with an innocuous name has swept across
the Internet, leaving hundreds of thousands of infected computers
in its wake Monday and flooding electronic mailboxes with millions
of unwanted messages.
</P>
<P>
   The Melissa virus was first detected on Friday and has rapidly
spread. Although the virus apparently causes no permanent damage to
a computer, it is considered dangerous because it spreads by
stealing electronic mail addresses from a user's e-mail address
book. As a result, Melissa is transmitted among users who know each
other.
</P>
<P>
   Viruses are computer programs that act like infections, secretly
spreading themselves from one computer to another.
</P>
<P>
   Because of Melissa's capacity to overwhelm e-mail systems and
because it has spread with such shocking speed, managers of
corporate computer networks toiled all weekend in an effort to
stave off disaster.
</P>
<P>
   The Computer Emergency Response Team, or CERT, a
federally-funded watchdog agency at Carnegie Mellon University,
received reports of major problems caused by Melissa at 250
companies, with a total of 100,000 individual computers. Microsoft
Corp., Intel Corp., Lockheed Martin Corp., and Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co.
either restricted or shut down their e-mail systems to avoid
infection. The FBI said military and government computers were
sabotaged, along with thousands of other institutions' systems.
</P>
<P>
   The virus also had the technical services departments at
Boston-area firms scrambling. Cahners Business Information, a
magazine publisher in Newton, shut down Internet access during the
weekend to avoid spreading the virus. ``We got hit with it along
with the rest of the world, on Friday afternoon,'' said spokesman
Evan Albright. ``Thank heaven we had the weekend to work on it.''
</P>
<P>
   At Cognos Inc. in Burlington, Internet service wasn't restored
until 4 p.m. Monday, as administrators flushed the virus from
e-mail servers at 30 locations around the world. ``It was back to
the fax, back to the phone for a lot of things,'' said spokeswoman
Roberta Carlton.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the world's leading makers of anti-virus software
quickly created upgrades that would block the Melissa virus and
posted them on their Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   The Melissa virus is based on a powerful and controversial
feature of the word processing program Microsoft Word _ the ability
to embed little programs called ``macros'' inside Word documents.
The virulent macro was spread among people who received e-mail and
opened up an attached Word document. The macro inside Melissa
automatically e-mails up to 50 copies of itself to other people,
who in turn can spread the virus even further.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Smith, president of Phar Lap Software in Cambridge and a
frequent critic of Microsoft's software design policies, said that
with a few modifications, the virus could easily have ordered each
infected computer to delete all the files on its hard drive. Were
such a virus to get loose inside a corporation or government
agency, the damages could run to millions of dollars. ``Why should
a word processing document have that kind of power?'' Smith
wondered.
</P>
<P>
   To Microsoft group product manager Andrew Dixon, the answer is
simple: Customers like macros.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a capability our customers have asked for,'' Dixon said.
</P>
<P>
   Smith believes Melissa was originally posted on an Internet
message board devoted to pornography. Either accidentally or on
purpose, someone attached the Melissa document to a piece of e-mail
and sent it to somebody else. And that's when the trouble began.
</P>
<P>
   There's no danger in reading the e-mail containing Melissa. But
if the recipient uses Microsoft Word and opens the attached
document, it may infect his computer. If the computer also contains
Microsoft's popular e-mail program Outlook, Melissa will send
copies of itself to the first 50 names in the Outlook address book.
If any of these 50 people activate Melissa, and also have Word and
Outlook on their computers, the cycle begins again.
</P>
<P>
   Within hours, Melissa messages were streaming across the Web.
Shocked virus-watchers at CERT took the unusual step of issuing a
press release to quickly warn the public of the danger. ``This was
widely covered in the media on Sunday,'' said Jeff Carpenter,
CERT's incident response team leader, ``and we think that has
helped mitigate the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Carpenter says that Melissa illustrates the power of the
Microsoft Word macro system. ``You can do some pretty neat things
with it, but you can also do some things that are malicious as
well.''
</P>
<P>
   CERT recommends that users of Microsoft's Office software switch
off its capacity to run macros embedded in documents. ``The
potential for malicious action is greater than the benefit that
they provide,'' Carpenter said.
</P>
<P>
   To make matters worse, a similar virus, called Papa, was
discovered Monday. Papa is programmed to send out even more
infected e-mails than Melissa, although it has a bug that sometimes
prevents it from working, said Srivats Sampath, general manager of
McAfee software, an antivirus company. E-mails from the Papa virus
include an attached spreadsheet file. When the user opens that
file, the virus sends 60 infected e-mails.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Phar Lap Software's Smith hopes to use another
controversial Microsoft feature to track down the creator of the
Melissa virus. Earlier this month, Smith made headlines with his
discovery that Microsoft Word documents contain embedded serial
numbers that can be used to identify the computer that generated
them. Smith said he has analyzed an original copy of the Melissa
document and found such a serial number. He now plans to scour the
Internet for other documents with the same serial number, which
might reveal the identity of Melissa's creator.
</P>
<P>
   If identified, this person or persons can expect a visit from
the FBI, which has assigned its computer crime unit to investigate
the Melissa affair.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted, Melissa's creator could be fined up to $350,000
and be sentenced to up to 10 years in prison.

 Column: Scholarshare To Begin Soon
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Arthur M. Louis &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Question: &LR;  When will Scholarshare, that new state-sponsored college
savings plan, begin accepting applications? A Chronicle article
last year said it would be up and running by February, but I
haven't heard anything about it since then.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Answer: &LR;  You are correct in assuming that Scholarshare
enrollment has been postponed. The latest estimate from the
California Student Aid Commission, which will administer the
program, is that Scholarshare will accept applications starting
around the middle of this year. The program has been delayed by a
prolonged search for an investment adviser and by an unexpectedly
complicated effort to draft all the necessary rules and
regulations.
</P>
<P>
   This generous program _ made possible by the federal Taxpayer
Relief Act of 1997 _ will be worth the wait. Although the rules are
still being developed, word has it that you may be allowed to
contribute as much as $100,000 per child to an investment pool,
with the earnings on your money compounding free of federal or
state taxes until you make withdrawals to pay for your child's
education. Once the money is withdrawn, it will be taxed at the
child's tax rate, which presumably will be lower than your own.
</P>
<P>
   More details about Scholarshare can be found on the Student Aid
Commission's Internet Web site at  &LR; www.csac.ca.gov &LR; , or by calling
(916) 526-7590, Ext. 6.
</P>
<P>
   IPO Information
</P>
<P>
   Q: How can I learn which initial public offerings of stock are
coming to the market and when?
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  A: The most comprehensive source of IPO information appears
to be IPO Monitor, an online service whose Web site is at
 &LR; www.ipomonitor.com &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   The subscription price is $29 per month, or $290 for a full
year, which works out to a $24.17 monthly rate. The fee is payable
in advance.
</P>
<P>
   A subscription entitles you to e-mail alerts listing all new IPO
filings as they become known and tracking the performance of IPOs
after they go to market. By exploring the Web site, you can get
updates on pending filings when the stock price or other terms of
the offering are changed.
</P>
<P>
   IPO Monitor sets aside a separate Web page for each company
making an IPO, complete with the company's income statements,
balance sheets and other crucial information. There also is
commentary on IPOs in general, and some in particular, from IPO
Monitor's in-house analysts.
</P>
<P>
   Whether you can profit from all that information is another
question. It is hard for an individual investor to get a piece of
an IPO unless you happen to be well-connected _ for example, a
favored customer of one of the underwriters.
</P>
<P>
   Some brokers, such as Charles Schwab, Fidelity Investments and
E-Trade, don't play favorites. They make a limited number of shares
in a limited selection of IPOs available to their customers on a
first-come, first-served basis.
</P>
<P>
   Disability Retirement
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am 54 years old, and have been paying into a tax-sheltered
annuity for many years through my employer, the state government. I
was recently diagnosed with Lou Gehrig's disease, with a prognosis
of perhaps five years of life remaining, and am preparing to take
disability retirement. I may not live to age 591/2, when I would be
allowed to withdraw money from the annuity without paying the 10
percent penalty tax. Is there an exception to the penalty-tax rule
in my case? I'm probably going to need that money as my medical
expenses shoot up.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  A: Appearances to the contrary, the government really does
have a heart. You won't have to worry about the penalty tax,
because you will qualify for an exemption two different ways.
</P>
<P>
   Once a physician officially certifies that you are totally and
permanently disabled, you can withdraw as much money as you wish
from your annuity without penalty. You will, however, be required
to pay taxes on your annuity income at your ordinary rate.
</P>
<P>
   The exemption applies not only to annuities, but also to 401(k)
plans and Individual Retirement Accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Even if you remain employed for a while, you will be permitted
to make penalty-free withdrawals while still on the payroll if you
use the money specifically for medical bills.
</P>
<P>
   That rule applies to anyone with large medical bills, whether
they are retiring or not. It would apply, for example, to people on
medical leave who intend to come back to work.
</P>
<P>
   If your medical expenses in a given year exceed 71/2 percent of
your adjusted gross income, the amount of the excess can be
withdrawn without penalty from your retirement account. &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Again, while there is no 10 percent penalty under this scenario,
you would have to pay ordinary taxes on your withdrawals.
</P>

 Column: Mega-Merger Talk in Oil Industry Helps Push Dow Over
the  Top 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Mark Veverka &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
Wake me up when its over. All of this Dow 10,000 rot is about as
stimulating as washing down two tabs of Excedrin PM with an herbal
tea chaser. In case you haven't heard (and didn't read the rest of
the paper), the Dow Jones industrials closed at 10,007 yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Whoopee. That, and two bucks, will get you an overpriced cup of
charred Italian roast. The Dow rose 1.9 percent yesterday to
finally closed above the dreadfully insignificant 10,000 barrier on
its fourth try.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index kicked some
serious tail yesterday, rising 3.1 percent to close at 2,492.84.
Forget the Dow, it was the high-octane Nasdaq, with its more than
4,000 stocks, that had the banner day. Primed by huge run-ups in
technology stocks, such as a $25.75, or 23 percent, surge in
Internet darling iVillage, the Nasdaq outpaced the Dow on the
Industrials' big day.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; DEAL TIME? &LR; : Yet when it comes to what finally put the dowdy
Dow over the hump, it was big oil _ including San Francisco's
Chevron _ that helped fuel the final push beyond 10K.
</P>
<P>
   Chevron _ one of the 30 big-caps that comprise the Dow _ rose
nearly $3 to $89.63 yesterday. In fact, the entire oil patch caught
fire (with all due respect to those endangered by Chevron's
refinery explosion in Richmond last week) after word spread that
another major merger was in the offing.
</P>
<P>
   BP Amoco, which itself is the byproduct of British Petroleum's
recent buyout of Amoco, confirmed reports that it is negotiating to
buy Atlantic Richfield of Los Angeles. Arco jumped $9 to close
yesterday at $74.63 on the news. The high tide lifted all boats:
The American Stock Exchange oil index soared 4 percent to close
yesterday at 461.2.
</P>
<P>
   If BP Amoco is successful in its bid for Arco, the combined
company would produce more oil and gas than any other oil company
save for the proposed Exxon-Mobil merger, which has yet to close.
</P>
<P>
   So, with all of these international oil titans meeting at the
alter, where does that leave independent-minded Chevron?
</P>
<P>
   Chevron chief executive Ken Derr, who is expected to step down
in the next two to three years, has articulated on numerous
occasions that Chevron isn't for sale. Nor is he interested in
bulking up through the acquisition of smaller oil companies, such
as Conoco, Phillips or Texaco, just for the sake of getting bigger.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will look at (merger) opportunities if it makes sense for
Chevron and our shareholders,'' Derr reiterated at a San Francisco
news conference yesterday about gasoline additives.
</P>
<P>
   Derr is leaving the door cracked open for a possible marriage
but doesn't appear too eager to merge at a time when most other oil
companies are running into each other's embraces.
</P>
<P>
   So how much longer can Chevron afford to remain solo?
</P>
<P>
   Not very long, says Fadel Gheit, a senior financial analyst with
Fahnestock in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Loyal readers of Street Smarts may recall that Gheit predicted
in a December column that either Texaco or Arco would be the next
second-tier oil company to get bought (it looks like Arco is a
goner). He also said Chevron would need to partner up in order to
remain competitive.
</P>
<P>
   Gheit hasn't changed his tune.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the analyst now predicts that ``by the year 2000, you
will no longer see an independent Chevron or Texaco.''
</P>
<P>
   Chevron chief Derr ``has done a marvelous job. Unfortunately, it
is not enough to compete in the current environment,'' Gheit says.
</P>
<P>
   Chevron has ``been building muscle, but its competitors are
taking steroids,'' Gheit says.
</P>
<P>
   Low crude prices are driving major oil companies together in
attempt to reduce exploration and marketing costs. And while major
oil-producing countries in the Middle East agreed to try to reduce
production and increase prices, Gheit says it would be a mistake
for Chevron to think that the pact will make it easier for it to
compete with what he calls the new `'super-majors,'' such as
Exxon-Mobil and BP Amoco (and Arco?).
</P>
<P>
   So what's next for Chevron?
</P>
<P>
   The analyst paints two scenarios. One is that Derr reconsiders
his opposition to merging and agrees to a deal with Exxon-Mobil
after their pending mega-deal is approved by regulators _ which
could occur as early as August, he says.
</P>
<P>
   The other is that Chevron would merge with Texaco.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chevron needs to get significantly bigger, and the only
logical way for it to grow is through (buying) Texaco,'' Gheit
says. ``It's a layup.''
</P>
<P>
   Chevron and Texaco, which is based in suburban New York, have
the oldest and most successful international refining and marketing
alliance in the oil industry, and their companies have ``tremendous
synergy,'' Gheit says. Chevron would not comment on whether it
would consider a deal with Texaco.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble with a Chevron-Texaco deal is that the combination
would still be far smaller than the other super-majors, Gheit says.
But still, it would give them a fighting chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``If these two companies don't start to move. They will be left
behind,'' Gheit says.
</P>
<P>
   That said, without even considering its potential as a merger
candidate, another financial analyst thinks that Chevron's stock is
a good value.
</P>
<P>
   John Hervey of Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette told his firm's
clients yesterday at San Francisco's Mandarin Hotel that Chevron is
underpriced compared with its peers.
</P>
<P>
   Hervey predicted that Chevron's stock price will be trading at
19.6 times the company's projected earnings in 2000. That compares
to a price/earnings ratio of 20.4 for the entire industry in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Chevron is ``one of very few majors to deliver
rising production over the next two to three years'' while still
reducing its costs, said Hervey, who has a price target for Chevron
of $95 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Shucks. If Chevron is a bargain now, what kind of upside would
there be if Derr surprisingly agreed to merge with, say,
Mobil-Exxon?
</P>
<P>
   Then again, we could be talking about Dow 11,000 before any of
that dreamy speculation comes to pass.
</P>
<P>
   Or worse yet, we could be looking at 9,000. Who knows?
</P>

DEATH PENALTY MEASURE REJECTED IN MASSACHUSETTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MACQUARRIE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Following six hours of passionate debate Monday, the
Massachusetts House of Representatives defeated a bid to reinstate
the death penalty in a vote that underscored the erosion of
legislative support for capital punishment.
</P>
<P>
   By an 80-73 tally, the House accepted the Criminal Justice
Committee's vote last week to reject death-penalty legislation that
Governor Paul Cellucci had made a top priority.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Thomas M. Finneran, an opponent of capital
punishment, called the vote a decision of conscience for a chamber
that only 15 months ago blocked reinstatement in a tie vote after
an 11th-hour switch by one representative.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been no strong-arm approach whatsoever,'' said the
Mattapan Democrat. ``This is as straight as it gets.''
</P>
<P>
   But Monday evening, Cellucci assailed the speaker for holding
the vote when the House had six vacant seats, and he questioned
whether Finneran influenced the resignation last week of a
pro-death penalty legislator, Dennis M. Murphy, a Springfield
Democrat, who stepped down to take a private-sector job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that he was determined to defeat it, and he did,''
said the Republican governor. ``And I think it's unfortunate
because I believe that the people of this state are not being
represented by their representatives.''
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci pledged to refile the legislation again next year. And
House Minority Leader Francis L. Marini said the death penalty
could resurface again this year, as an amendment to the Senate
budget.
</P>
<P>
   But Representative A. Stephen Tobin, a death-penalty supporter
who is cochairman of the Criminal Justice Committee, conceded that
such a maneuver would be futile in a House that already has spoken.
</P>
<P>
   The last execution in the state was in 1947. The state Supreme
Judicial Court threw out the most recent capital-punishment law in
1984. Massachusetts is one of 12 states that does not carry the
death penalty on its books.
</P>
<P>
   For six hours, the century-old chamber echoed with rhetoric that
contained counterbalanced pleas: descriptions of the death penalty
as the ultimate justice for victims of horrific murders, and
arguments that capital punishment is nothing more than
state-sanctioned murder.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is one irrefutable fact: Innocent people are wrongly
convicted,'' said Representative Peter J. Koutoujian, a Democrat
from Newton. ``Innocent people have been sent to death row and been
executed. Today, we deal with an issue of life itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Tobin, a Democrat from Quincy, said ``common ground'' could be
found between the two camps because ``no one has argued that these
criminals have a right to go on living.'' The argument has been
that the execution of a murderer is akin to the crime, Tobin said,
and that ``seems to be an exercise in semantics.''
</P>
<P>
   Due-process safeguards in the legislation, Tobin said, ``would
make it virtually impossible to execute an innocent man.''
</P>
<P>
   Harold P. Naughton Jr., a Democrat from Clinton, was the only
legislator to change his vote from 1997. A supporter of the death
penalty that year, Naughton surprised administration officials when
he cast the deciding negative vote for the Criminal Justice
Committee last week.
</P>
<P>
   The 21 new legislators in the House this year were considered a
key factor in the vote, but they broke almost evenly on the issue.
Representative Steven V. Angelo, a Democrat from Saugus who
endorsed capital punishment in 1997, did not vote Monday.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most eloquent speeches made on the floor was
delivered next to last by freshman Representative Brian P. Golden,
a Democrat from Brighton. With a membership listening intently for
nearly the first time since debate began hours before, Golden
declared the country's judicial system to be fraught with the
potential for deadly mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   Golden, a lawyer and son of a career police officer, told the
rapt chamber: ``If the death penalty is resurrected, the capacity
for error in our all-too-human system will beget tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans offered amendment after amendment in unsuccessful
attempts to make the bill palatable to opponents. After a bid to
postpone the vote until September was defeated overwhelmingly,
death-penalty foes also rejected efforts to limit capital
punishment to killers of law enforcement officers, to convicted
murderers who kill again in prison, and in cases where several
layers of proof and witnesses would be required.
</P>
<P>
   Representative John P. Slattery, the Peabody Democrat whose vote
change in December 1997 created an 80-80 tie that doomed the bill,
lashed out at the attempt to reserve capital punishment for ``cop
killers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why is a cop's life more important than my mother's?''
Slattery asked angrily. He also said that the much-debated concept
of capital punishment as a deterrent is ``a lame argument,'' and
that the impact of a death penalty is felt disproportionately by
the poor.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no good murder,'' said Representative Byron Rushing,
a Democrat from the South End. ``We want a place with less murder.
We want a place with less violence.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile outside the State House, a noontime rally was solidly
behind the reinstatement of capital punishment. Flanked by
relatives of murder victims and standing before dozens of police
officers, Cellucci pointed to the State House and said in a rising
voice: ``We have a House of Representatives that is out of touch
with the people they represent.''
</P>
<P>
   For nearly an hour, pro-death penalty speakers squinting in the
sunlight stepped up to the podium. Some gave raw details about how
a loved one was murdered. Voices cracked. Chins quivered with
emotion. Fists banged the microphone stand. Police officers nodded
in agreement with political rhetoric.

<P>
   One speaker was Ann Schiavina, whose son, a police officer, was
murdered on the job in Springfield. Wearing a large gold cross
around her neck and saying she was a Catholic originally from
Northern Ireland, Schiavina recalled her outrage at not being able
to vote in her former homeland because of her religion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, that right was taken from me again,'' she said, adding
that she sent a certified letter to Finneran requesting he delay
the vote until all the House seats are filled. She never got a
response.
</P>
<P>
   ``To the speaker of the House ... you're not a man and I hope to
god you're not Irish,'' Schiavina said.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately following the rally, Cellucci conceded defeat even
though the vote was several hours away. He said that momentum had
waned in the two years since 10-year-old Jeffrey Curley's murder,
that the opposition is better organized, and that the good economy
has taken away some of the issue's urgency.

 Street's Siren Song Lures Millions
<TEXT>

   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Ilana DeBare &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
The big landmark in Michael Medwid's investing life wasn't when the
Dow Jones industrial average hit 10,000.
</P>
<P>
   It was in 1992, when the biotech firm he worked for gave him 900
stock options that &UR;  &LR; he cashed in for $50,000. That hefty sum
transformed Medwid into an avid market watcher, helped him buy a
home, and served as seed money for an investment portfolio that has
grown to about $180,000 _ about 90 percent of which is in stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went into the market with a bang,'' acknowledged Medwid, 37,
a San Mateo resident who now works for Symantec.
</P>
<P>
   Medwid is among millions of Americans who dipped their toes into
the stock market for the first time this decade _ and then plunged
up to their knees, waists or chins.
</P>
<P>
   More than 40 percent of American households now own stock, up
from 32 percent in 1989, according to the Economic Policy
Institute, a Washington D.C., think tank.
</P>
<P>
   And one of every four dollars in assets held by American
households is now invested in stocks _ up from one in 10 dollars in
1989 and more than at any time since World War II, according to the
Federal Reserve Board.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  This unprecedented rush into stocks by average Americans has
helped the market crash through one milestone after another, as it
did yesterday when the Dow Jones industrial average closed 6.78
points above 10,000.
</P>
<P>
   The lure of the market has been particularly strong in Silicon
Valley, where stock options are a common benefit and everyone seems
to knows someone at an Internet startup that's about to go public.
</P>
<P>
   Deborah Bohn, 29, works at ComputerLiteracy.com, an online
retailer of technical books for computer professionals. She had
never invested in individual stocks until she moved to the Valley
five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``My husband and I were consulting for technology companies, and
we saw the (investment) potential there and wanted to get
involved,'' Bohn said. ``In the valley, all your neighbors work at
technology companies. Everyone job hops. You can get information on
a lot of companies to help you make investment decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   The market's siren song has brought new rituals to daily life.
Many white-collar workers now check their stock holdings online
each morning as casually as they fill up their coffee mugs.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Ho, 25, started investing four years ago, when he was still
in college and the market was starting on its steepest four-year
climb in history. Since then, he has nursed $50,000 in family money
into a $175,000 portfolio _ primarily by investing in technology
stocks.
</P>
<P>
   What older investors might see as an unprecedented bubble,
younger investors like Ho see as normal market growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can pretty much double your portfolio in three years,''
said Ho, a University of California at Berkeley engineering
graduate who works at a Palo Alto venture capital firm called
Charter Growth Capital. ``If you focus on Internet stocks, you can
do it in one year.''
</P>
<P>
   Even without investing in the Internet, older and more
conservative investors have also increased their stock holdings.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Greenan, 52, is a Walnut Creek attorney who as a young man
put all his investments into real estate. But during the past five
years, he shifted nearly all of his assets into stocks _ either
individual equities or mutual funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I fastened my seat belt and ended up with a return of 35
percent last year,'' Greenan said.
</P>
<P>
   Fran Confetti, 61, is a former steel company employee whose
family owned stock in only one company when she was growing up _ a
gas well that never paid off.
</P>
<P>
   She had counted on receiving a traditional pension from her
employer when she retired. But in 1994, she was laid off and given
a lump-sum payment instead of a guaranteed pension for life. About
a third of that is now invested in stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd never really played the market, but my financial adviser
said it was a good place to put my money to fight inflation,'' said
Confetti, of Pittsburg. ``Last year, I made about 19 percent
overall. Now I tell my children to put money in their 401(k)
(stock) accounts. Especially with Social Security being so
uncertain, it's the best thing they could ever do.''
</P>
<P>
   How will the novice investors who've jumped into the bull market
in the past few years respond if there's a serious crash? No one
really knows.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be tough for a lot of newcomers like myself if
the bull market ends,'' acknowledged Ho. ``People will have to look
for value rather than momentum. That will take a lot more work. A
lot of people won't be able to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with today's bull market, not everyone is sharing in the
wealth.
</P>
<P>
   The richest 10 percent of American households own 88.4 percent
of all stock, while the remaining 90 percent own just 11.6 percent,
according to the EPI.
</P>
<P>
   And while the richest 1 percent of households have stock
portfolios averaging $2.5 million, the poorest 40 percent have
portfolios averaging just $1,600.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stock ownership is broader than it used to be, but it's far
from thoroughly democratized,'' Mishel said. ``The notion that
everyone holds stock and benefits from the market is quite an
exaggeration.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, sometimes even successful stock investors question
how much they're really benefiting.
</P>
<P>
   That's because the cost of living in the Bay Area, especially
housing, is so high that even a large portfolio can seem
inadequate.
</P>
<P>
   With a wife and young son, Medwid is hoping to move into a
larger home. But he's somewhat daunted by Silicon Valley prices:
The median cost of homes sold in Santa Clara County in February was
$388,000, and the average cost was $500,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I want to get to the level of a $500,000 or $600,000 house
in an area with good schools, the housing market would just eat up
all of my investments,'' Medwid said. ``I'd be wiped out.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look at these investments by themselves, they've done
spectacularly,'' Medwid said. ``But when you look at the cost of
things around you, it's not so great.''

TWO MEXICAN BANKS WILL ENTER GUILTY PLEAS IN MONEY-LAUNDERING CASE
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Calif.)  (fb) 
 By TIM GOLDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Two of Mexico's biggest banks have agreed to plead
guilty to criminal charges of money laundering, officials said on
Monday, bringing a swift end to the most important legal cases
stemming from a major investigation into the movement of illegal
drug profits.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the banks, Grupo Financiero Bancomer SA and Grupo
Financiero Serfin SA, will forfeit millions of dollars already
seized by the government and pay fines of $500,000 each. In return
for their pleas, which are to be entered in U.S. District Court
here on Tuesday, the banks will probably be allowed to continue
doing business in the United States, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome is a triumph for a group of federal prosecutors,
Justice Department officials and U.S. Customs Service officials who
resisted strong pressure from both the Mexican government and the
banks to have the criminal charges dropped.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the Mexican campaign included appeals to Attorney
General Janet Reno and other Justice Department officials by senior
Mexican officials and by James R. Jones, a Washington lawyer for
one of the banks who served as the U.S. ambassador to Mexico during
the undercover customs investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a tremendous victory, particularly for those people
who felt the banks should be held criminally liable,'' said one
official of the U.S. attorney's office here. ``And there was a
great deal of pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   But the guilty pleas also raise questions about what many
officials described as the reluctant handling of the case by some
of the federal prosecutors in Los Angeles, and about the
consideration that was given by some in the Clinton administration
to scaling back charges against the banks to avoid further strain
on relations with Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutors did retreat on one of the three indictments they
brought last year against Mexican banks, agreeing not to pursue
criminal charges against Banca Confia, a smaller Mexican bank that
was subsequently bought by Citigroup.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said that Confia would acknowledge its liability for
violations of less serious money laundering statutes in the civil
code and forfeit about $12.2 million that has been seized from its
accounts. Citigroup, which bought the bank after it had been taken
over by the Mexican government and after the alleged money
laundering by its employees occurred, does not face any liability
in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Although criminal money laundering convictions against Bancomer
and Serfin will prompt hearings by the Federal Reserve Board,
officials said, the U.S. attorney's office has agreed to testify
that the banks cooperated in the case with the expectation that
they will avoid being barred from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Like the ambitious, three-year undercover investigation that
preceded it, the government's legal struggle against the banks was
plagued from the start by internal divisions, officials familiar
with the case said.
</P>
<P>
   Several officials said federal prosecutors who included the
principal assistant U.S. attorney on the case, Duane R. Lyons,
argued that the banks should not be indicted on criminal charges
because it was not clear they had benefited from the actions of the
bankers who were ultimately charged with helping drug traffickers
to launder millions of dollars in illicit earnings.
</P>
<P>
   A first group from among the several dozen bankers, businessmen
and suspected traffickers indicted in the case last May will also
go on trial this week.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the officials added, Lyons was persuaded to seek
criminal indictments by officials from the Justice Department, the
Federal Reserve Board and other prosecutors. Lyons did not return a
telephone call asking for his comment.
</P>
<P>
   But many law-enforcement officials involved in the case said the
prosecutors had initially planned to file criminal money laundering
charges against at least four more banks whose employees were
implicated in the case. Only because the prosecutors were so behind
in preparing their indictments were those banks not charged, the
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   One such bank, Banco Industrial de Venezuela, went so far in its
counterattack as to file suit against the U.S. Customs Service for
$4 million it said it lost during the undercover operation. The
bank was not indicted, but the head of its Miami branch, Esperanza
de Saad, the sister of a former Venezuelan cabinet minister, is
being prosecuted for money laundering.
</P>
<P>
   And though the suit was later dropped, officials said, the
drumbeat of Venezuelan complaints continued. Last Nov. 4, officials
said, the assistant secretary of state for inter-American affairs,
Peter Romero, called in the Venezuelan ambassador to the United
States then, Pedro Luis Echeverria, and delivered a formal protest
in response to the ambassador's sharp public criticism.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 3, Venezuelan officials finally received a letter from
the U.S. attorney's office in Los Angeles saying that Banco
Industrial was not the target of any criminal prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   After first praising the customs operation, Mexican officials
also shifted to bitter criticism, threatening publicly to prosecute
undercover agents who conducted meetings in Mexico with bankers and
drug traffickers, and warning of the impact the prosecutions could
have on the Mexican economy.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before Clinton visited Mexico last month, those
complaints moved a senior aide on the National Security Council,
James Dobyns, to ask officials at the Justice Department how he
might speak with prosecutors on the case to discuss the
foreign-policy concerns it raised.
</P>
<P>
   Although two officials said a telephone conference call was
tentatively scheduled for Feb. 8, it did not take place. One senior
official who spoke on the condition of anonymity insisted that the
White House dropped the idea of its own accord. Dobyns declined to
comment.

LIVE WITH IT: FREE AGENCY IS A GAMBLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ When the Los Angeles Kings forked over a
$4.25-million divorce settlement to defenseman Steve Duchesne last
week, bringing his 1998-99 take to around $8 million, general
manager Dave Taylor made it clear the team would be very careful
before dipping into the free-agent market again.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that bothers me,'' Taylor said, ``is if a player has
a great year, he's looking for top dollar, and when he doesn't have
a great year the risk is still with the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, yes, that indeed is the way it is, and if a team doesn't
like it, one of its options is to opt out of the free-agent market
and try to build a winner through the draft or by making savvy
trades.
</P>
<P>
   Any method of building a team, however, includes no warranty. A
trade that looks brilliant when consummated can look foolish soon
thereafter. A top draft choice can flop. Attempts to sign
restricted free agents usually fail, because the player's original
team invariably matches the offer. And the most expensive players,
unrestricted free agents, can be busts.
</P>
<P>
   When a prime unrestricted free agent (a player who will command
a multiyear deal worth more than $10 million) doesn't pan out, the
financial burden on the team that signed him is enormous. Thus,
before signing such players, teams ought to decide not only whether
the player will help the team win, but whether the player will
attract fans.
</P>
<P>
   If the player cannot do both, the team probably is better served
shopping the bargain rack.
</P>
<P>
   The Mighty Ducks did that late last summer and landed Fredrik
Olausson, who will wind up making eight times less than Duchesne
this year but has had a season roughly eight times better.
</P>
<P>
   Given its local flavor, the Duchesne-Olausson comparison is
especially vivid. It is not unique, however.
</P>
<P>
   Defenseman Uwe Krupp signed with Colorado last summer and will
be paid $4.1 million this season but has been plagued by back
trouble and has appeared in just 22 games. Defenseman Gary Suter
signed with San Jose for $2.8 million this season and played in one
game before an elbow injury ended his year.
</P>
<P>
   In goal, no team made a smarter move last summer than Carolina,
which signed Arturs Irbe (25-18-11, 2.30 goals-against average) for
$550,000, roughly one-tenth what the New York Rangers are paying
Mike Richter (24-27-8) and the Toronto Maple Leafs are paying
Curtis Joseph (31-22-6).
</P>
<P>
   The Dallas Stars may be pleased with right wing Brett Hull (28
goals, 51 points), who is earning $4.5 million. But the Rangers
signed right wing John MacLean for $2.3 million, and he had 50
points entering Monday night's game.
</P>
<P>
   Is Chicago's William Wirtz, whose team is among the NHL's worst,
happy to have paid center Doug Gilmour $6 million this season?
Gilmour had 56 points and a minus-16 defensive rating, and is out
for the year with a back injury.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis paid Geoff Courtnall $3.5 million this year, and he
had 10 points in 21 games before going on the injured list with
post-concussion syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   The Hurricanes are in first place, so they haven't groused much
but has Ron Francis (44 points) been worth $5 million?
</P>
<P>
   It is pointless for teams to complain after the fact about their
misspent dollars. The time to make a wise decision is before
offering a huge contract.
</P>
<P>
   There are no guarantees.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't believe it, consider that at season's end, Wayne
Gretzky _ the best player and box-office attraction ever _ will
miss the playoffs for the fourth time in the past six years. &QL; 
STANDING PAT
</P>
<P>
   Did Detroit buy a third straight Stanley Cup by acquiring
defensemen Chris Chelios and Ulf Samuelsson and forward Wendel
Clark at last week's trading deadline?
</P>
<P>
   The league-leading Dallas Stars, who were comparatively quiet at
the deadline, are hoping they already had enough on their roster to
win their first Cup. Ultimately, though, they may wish general
manager Bob Gainey had added some depth on defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our guys have worked all year on the details they've been
asked to work on to be a good team, with their eyes on playing in
the playoffs against the top competitors,'' Gainey said. ``And
they've proven they were willing and they should be given a chance
to do it. So they will.'' &QL; 
BULKING UP
</P>
<P>
   Kudos to the Red Wings for doing whatever it takes for a chance
to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen anything like it and I've been in this
business 30 years,'' Wings coach Scotty Bowman said after his
team's wild day of trading. ``I think it gives us a better feel in
the room that this team means business. There's only certain
opportunities that teams have, and there's a lot of good teams out
there right now.''
</P>
<P>
   The Wings, however, may be the best of the bunch _ again. &QL; 
MUMBO JUMBO
</P>
<P>
   With a break in the schedule last week, the Philadelphia Flyers
disappeared into the woods for six hours of ``team building,'' a
program run by a Canadian motivational group that usually works
with large corporations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was really fun,'' right wing Mikael Renberg said. ``They
set up ropes on the trees that looked like a spider net, and we had
to find a way through these big holes in it without touching the
ropes. You had to pretend the ropes were electrified, and if you
touched it you had to wear a blindfold and the other guys on your
team had to get you through.''
</P>
<P>
   Back in the Barry Melrose days, when the Kings were in a state
of collapse, motivational guru Tony Robbins was brought in, with
little lasting effect. The Flyers should prepare for similar
long-term results.

 The Way We Were at Dow 1,000
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Sam Zuckerman &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
When the Dow Jones industrial average first closed above 1,000,
President Richard Nixon had just been re-elected by a landslide.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. and North Vietnamese negotiators had agreed to a new round
of peace talks to end the Vietnam War. U.S. astronauts were getting
ready to walk on the moon for the last time. Bill Gates was a nerdy
high school senior in Seattle. A three-bedroom house in San
Francisco cost $35,000.
</P>
<P>
   Nov. 14, 1972, was not so long ago chronologically, but was
light years back in the way the stock market worked and the role it
played in American life.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an entirely different world then,'' said Newton Zinder,
who was the chief market analyst of the now-defunct brokerage E.F.
Hutton when the Dow broke 1,000. ``There was much less public
awareness and focus on the market. There was no &LR;   &LR; CNBC, no day
traders, no online investing.''
</P>
<P>
   In the years since Dow 1,000, stock ownership has become one of
the great badges of middle-class status in America, like owning an
automatic dishwasher in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  The proliferation of mutual funds, discount brokers, and
401(k) retirement plans has put stock ownership within reach of
tens of millions of people.
</P>
<P>
   Some 52 percent of those polled in a survey for NBC News/Wall
Street Journal earlier this month said they owned more than $5,000
in stocks or stock mutual funds. U.S. households now hold more than
$10 trillion in stocks, according to the Federal Reserve.
</P>
<P>
   The stock market has become part of the popular culture. People
talk about their investments at barbecues and baptisms,
construction sites and campsites.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't so in 1972. The stock portfolios of American
households totaled just $813 billion then.
</P>
<P>
   ``Participation in the stock market was pretty limited. It was
the province of the very rich, the top 10 percent of families,''
said Edward Wolff, a New York University economist.
</P>
<P>
   It only took a few tries for the Dow to crash through 10,000,
but the 1,000 mark was a tougher barrier.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow actually poked through 1,000 four times in 1966 during
the day but couldn't muster a close above that mark until six years
later.
</P>
<P>
   In 1972, the Dow registered gains a few points at a time. The
biggest one-day rise ever, 32.93 points, had taken place the year
before.
</P>
<P>
   On the day the Dow first finished above 1,000, 20.2 million
shares changed hands on the New York Stock Exchange. Today, that's
a few minutes worth of trading. Yesterday, NYSE volume was about
750 million shares.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow then was dominated by natural resource companies and
heavy industry, including Westinghouse Electric, farm
equipment-maker International Harvester and Anaconda Copper.
</P>
<P>
   More than half of the Dow 1,000 stocks have dropped off the
index since 1972, either bought out or replaced. Today's Dow
includes Walt Disney, financial companies such as American Express
and computer-makers such as IBM in addition to industrial
companies.
</P>
<P>
   When the Dow broke 1,000, market pros were just as euphoric as
they were yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market was not to be denied,'' the New York Times
reported, describing how a surging economy, booming profits and
lessening fears about inflation and taxes had powered stocks past
1,000.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the bulls were living in a fool's paradise. The Dow
still had a little momentum _ enough to carry it to 1,052 in
January 1973. Then the bottom fell out.
</P>
<P>
   The Watergate crisis, Nixon's resignation, an embargo by oil
producers, surging inflation and an economic slump pushed the Dow
all the way down to 577 by December 1974, one of the century's most
brutal bear markets.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow clawed its way back when economic growth resumed. In
1976 it passed the 1,000 mark. But it didn't stay above that level
for long.
</P>
<P>
   Several years of ``stagflation'' set in _ high inflation and
weak economic growth. It wasn't until 1982 that the index crossed
1,000 again and stayed above it.
</P>
<P>
   While Dow 1,000 ushered in a period of economic turmoil, the
picture now seems much more benign.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were about to go into a very inflationary period then,''
said John Skeen, chief strategist for San Francisco's NationsBanc
Montgomery Securities. ``Now the world economy is quite close to a
deflationary condition.'' Stocks should advance in today's
environment, Skeen predicted.
</P>
<P>
   Newton Zinder isn't convinced. He's 71 and no longer makes a
living predicting the market's course, but he still follows stocks
closely.
</P>
<P>
   Zinder worries that the bull market has lasted too long. Now, as
in 1972, relatively few stocks, most not part of the Dow, led the
advance of the overall market.
</P>
<P>
   Then, they were called the ``Nifty Fifty'' and they included
companies like Xerox and Polaroid. Now, the market leaders are the
likes of Microsoft and Yahoo.
</P>
<P>
   Zinder points out that today's Dow stocks trade at more than 25
times earnings, making them hugely expensive by historical
standards. In late 1972, they were trading at only 15 times
earnings.
</P>
<P>
   In November 1972, stocks were ripe for a fall when the economy
turned sour, although few people saw it coming.
</P>
<P>
   Cautioned Zinder: ``Maybe there are some shocks out there
today.''

SONY PICTURES, IN ACCORD WITH MGM, DROPS PLAN TO PRODUCE JAMES BOND
MOVIES
</HEADLINE>
  (fb) 
 By JAMES STERNGOLD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ If it was a movie, it might have been called ``The
Spy Who Got Knocked Cold.'' But it is reality, and Sony Pictures
Entertainment on Monday suffered a defeat in a longstanding legal
dispute with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc.
</P>
<P>
   MGM, a unit of the P&AMP;F Acquisition Corp., announced a settlement
under which Sony Pictures dropped its plan to produce new James
Bond movies.
</P>
<P>
   The defeat, which seemed all but certain after MGM obtained a
temporary restraining order several months ago, is particularly
difficult for Sony Pictures, and not just in financial terms. It
strikes at the heart of the movie studio's stated strategy of
focusing its efforts on movie franchises that spin off numerous
sequels.
</P>
<P>
   The studio has thus far failed to begin any such profitable
franchises and its president, John Calley, had said earlier that he
was pursuing the James Bond movies as a way of tapping into this
lucrative business.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the agreement, Sony Pictures will pay MGM $5
million to settle the lawsuit, MGM said. In return, MGM said, it
will pay Sony Pictures $10 million for the rights to an early James
Bond spoof, ``Casino Royale,'' which was produced at Columbia
Pictures, a Sony unit, and for all international rights to the
James Bond films.
</P>
<P>
   ``The end of this case reaffirms that James Bond resides at one
address _ that of MGM and Danjaq, his constant home for the last 37
years,'' Frank G. Mancuso, MGM's chairman, said in a statement.
Danjaq LLC. is the company controlled by the family of the late
Albert (Cubby) Broccoli, who had produced the early Bond films and
was part-owner of the rights to make the movies, along with United
Artists, an MGM unit.
</P>
<P>
   The James Bond movies have been box office hits for nearly four
decades _ the first installment was ``Dr. No,'' in 1962 _ making
them one of the most durable and profitable franchises in history,
along with the Star Wars and Star Trek franchises. The last Bond
film, ``Tomorrow Never Dies,'' was released in December 1997, and
had revenue of about $350 million. The next movie, ``The World is
Not Enough,'' starring Pierce Brosnan as 007, is scheduled for
release in November.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all of the films, about the dashing, martini-sipping
British secret agent, have been produced at MGM and they continue
to be among the most profitable films produced at that studio.
</P>
<P>
   The current dispute began 18 months ago when Sony Pictures, a
unit of the Sony Corp. of Japan, announced that it had signed a
deal to produce additional Bond movies with Kevin McClory. McClory
had been a producer of ``Thunderball,'' and the virtual remake of
that film, ``Never Say Never Again.''
</P>
<P>
   He has asserted that he helped develop the James Bond concept
with Ian Fleming, the author of the original books about the sexy,
unstoppable agent, and had the rights to produce additional films.
MGM has said he had the rights to produce only ``Thunderball''
remakes.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute became personal when MGM filed a suit not just
against Sony Pictures but also named Calley. Calley had been the
head of MGM's United Artists studio before moving to Sony Pictures
and there have long been reports of friction between him and
Mancuso. But that portion of the suit was also dropped with the
settlement announced on Monday. A parallel suit against McClory is
scheduled to go to court on April 6.
</P>
<P>
   Sony Pictures issued a statement acknowledging a settlement.

 Local Economy Doing Well Despite Asia
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Carol Emert &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
With Asian economies swooning and technology exports dropping, it
is easy to conclude that the local economy must be on the wane.
</P>
<P>
   Not so, according to a new study by the UCLA Anderson Forecast.
</P>
<P>
   The study, scheduled for release Tuesday, said job growth in
Northern California was 3.2 percent last year compared to 2.6
percent for the United States as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   Even techie Santa Clara County, which is highly vulnerable to
the Asian flu, posted an employment increase of 3.3 percent in
1998, although job growth there slowed significantly in the fourth
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Incomes grew even faster than jobs in California last year.
Driven largely by high-paying, white-collar positions, personal
incomes grew 6.6 percent in California last year over 1997, the
largest increase since 1990 and significantly higher than the U.S.
rate of 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The personal income category includes wages, salaries and
unearned income such as stock dividends. Plumper wallets bode well
for sales of everything from cars to homes to jewelry to towels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Growth last year was very, very good and generally speaking,
we are at least continuing in the first quarter the very rapid pace
we saw in 1998,'' said Ted Gibson, chief economist for the
California Department of Finance. ``Despite Asia, everything seems
to be going well.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the strength in California and the Bay Area, in
particular, is attributable to business services, a diverse sector
that includes management consulting, computer maintenance,
photocopying, advertising and software development.
</P>
<P>
   The number of business service jobs in the state jumped 10.3
percent last year, with technology-related positions increasing at
about double the overall rate. The sector has added some 400,000
jobs in the past five years, according to Tom Lieser, executive
director of the forecast.
</P>
<P>
   ``The second half of 1998 was much stronger than we had
projected as recently as last December,'' said Lieser. ``The Asian
situation is (a factor), but it's not large enough to offset the
domestic strength we've got.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, trade is a concern. Exports, which account for about
one-fifth of the California economy, dropped 4.2 percent last year,
with the fall-off accelerating as the year progressed, according to
the study.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is not confined to Asia, which accounts for as much
as half of California's export market. Shipments to Western Europe,
Mexico and Canada moderated dramatically, and in some cases fell
into negative territory in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Computers and other electronic equipment, which declined by 8.1
percent, were not the only exports to suffer. Agricultural products
such as processed foods fell 4 percent and chemical exports dropped
3.1 percent as the global economy remained listless.
</P>
<P>
   In the San Jose area, job growth remained positive but slowed
sharply to 1 percent in December 1998 compared to December 1997,
and from 3.3 percent in 1998 as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   That compares to December job growth of 2.4 percent in San
Francisco, Marin and San Mateo counties, 2.4 percent in Alameda and
Contra Costa counties and 3.4 percent for the state, which got its
biggest economic boost from the central part of California.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its problems, Santa Clara's 3.5 percent unemployment
rate in February was still well below the national average of 4.3
percent. San Francisco's unemployment rate stood at a minuscule 2.6
percent while Oakland's tallied 3.6 percent, the study said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given what's going on in Asia, Santa Clara County's doing
pretty well,'' said Gibson. ``Who would have thought they could
lose that big of a chunk of their market and still have growth of
even 1 percent?''
</P>
<P>
   California economists are optimistic that the Asian economies
will turn a corner in the next year or so. Gibson believes Santa
Clara will continue to plod along at a modest pace until Asia picks
up steam.
</P>
<P>
   ``My take is that things won't change much over 1999, but we may
see the beginnings of a recovery late this year or in early 2000,''
Gibson said.
</P>
<P>
   Lieser forecasts job growth in California at 3.4 percent this
year and 2.3 percent in 2000 and 2001, compared to smaller U.S.
increases of 1.8 percent in 1999, 1.1 percent in 2000 and 1.5
percent in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   After many years of weakness, construction last year turned
dramatically upward, hitting its highest level since 1990. Another
strong year is expected in 1999, although construction still lags
its peak in the mid-1980s, according to the Anderson study.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer confidence for the Pacific region is near the all-time
high hit in 1989, said Lieser.

 Amazon.com's Next Page _ Online Auctions
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Jamie Beckett &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
Amazon.com, already the Internet's largest retailer, is expanding
into another booming Web business _ online auctions.
</P>
<P>
   The expansion, planned in the next few weeks, pits Amazon
against auction giant eBay and moves the book, music and video
seller into one of the Web's more profitable businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon plans to host person-to-person auctions for more than 800
types of merchandise, including antique scientific instruments,
movie memorabilia, jewelry and, of course, Beanie Babies.
</P>
<P>
   The move into auctions is part of the booksellers's strategy of
turning itself into a giant Internet shopping mall.
</P>
<P>
   The company also announced yesterday an agreement to purchase a
50 percent stake in Pets.com, a San Francisco online pet-products
retailer. Last month, Amazon acquired 46 percent of Seattle startup
Drugstore.com, a seller of pharmaceuticals, over-the-counter
medicines and beauty aids.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to be the place where people can buy anything they
want to buy,'' said Bill Curry, an Amazon spokesman. Anything, that
is, except firearms, live animals and pornography. Like eBay,
Amazon will ban those items from its auction site.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts called the initiative a smart way to squeeze more
revenue out of Amazon's 8 million customers and to find new ones.
The company plans to charge fees for listing products and for
completed sales based on a percentage of the price of the item. A
button on its home page will link users to auctions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The company has a great opportunity to convert (customers)
from one-click buyers to one-click bidders,'' said Kate Delhagen,
director of online retail research at Forrester Research in
Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   But Delhagen and other analysts said the online auction business
poses risks, even for an experienced Web player like Amazon. Unlike
the sale of books or videos, Amazon will not have control of its
auctions because buyers and sellers deal directly with each other.
That's caused problems for eBay, because some sellers have used the
site to auction off illegal items or to defraud buyers. The San
Jose company recently instituted policies to combat fraud, and it
banned firearms and weapons from the site.
</P>
<P>
   ``Amazon has built a phenomenal brand name, partly by being
almost religious about customer satisfaction,'' said Ken Cassar, an
analyst with Jupiter Communications in New York. There's a risk
that auction bidders and sellers won't be as scrupulous, Cassar
said.
</P>
<P>
   To help address that problem, Amazon is offering what it
describes as a ``guarantee'' against fraud. When customers feel
they've been cheated, the company will reimburse them for costs on
purchases up to $250. There is no fee for this guarantee.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said Amazon's move into auctions poses a significant
challenge for eBay. Amazon has 8 million customers, nearly four
times the 2.1 million registered users on eBay. &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``EBay should be worried,'' Cassar said. ``I wouldn't expect
that existing eBay customers are going to free &LR; flee, but I do think
this could put a dent in the company's future customer acquisition
efforts.''
</P>
<P>
   However, officials at eBay didn't appear to be concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Amazon.com is a savvy Internet competitor, and has done a very
good job in the area of business-to-consumer Internet commerce,''
the company said in a statement. ``However, this is a very
different business than the person-to-person space in which eBay is
the leader and ... (has a) significant competitive advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   Amazon's shares jumped $10.56 to $149.63 yesterday, while shares
in eBay fell $6.72 to $147.78.

AIRSTRIKES SHIFT TO FOCUS ON MOBILE SERB UNITS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CRAGG HINES 
c. 1999 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ NATO on Monday promised ``around the clock'' air
attacks in Yugoslavia, as Russian leaders prepared to meet with
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic for consultations the United
States and allies awaited warily.
</P>
<P>
   The sixth day of allied bombardment against Milosevic's military
included U.S. A-10 ``Warthog'' ground-attack planes to target
tanks, indicating a new focus on mobile Serb units in the Yugoslav
province of Kosovo. The Pentagon announced a further buildup of
U.S. planes in Europe for the NATO campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The humanitarian situation in the region appeared to
deteriorate. NATO spokesman Jamie Shea said 4,000 refugees an hour
poured over the Kosovo border into Albania. Five prominent ethnic
Albanians _ including Fehmi Agani, a participant at the recent
cease-fire talks in France _ were reportedly executed in Kosovo as
part of what NATO called a ``scorched-earth policy'' by Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration and NATO insisted that the allied
airstrikes had not led to the increase in ethnic violence, and
White House spokesman Joe Lockhart called testily for pundits and
politicians to stop second-guessing the military mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would encourage everyone to stop trying to write the
conclusion of this story at the end of each day,'' Lockhart said.
``This is a phased military campaign, a systematic assault on
President Milosevic and the Serbian military. This will take time,
and we will continue doing it until our military objectives are
met.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO's military spokesman, Air Commodore David Wilby of
Britain's Royal Air Force, said the airstrikes ``will continue to
go around the clock _ around the full clock _ to make sure that we
get our pressure on'' Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Kremlin spokesman Dmitri Yakushkin said Russian President Boris
Yeltsin ordered Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, Foreign Minister
Igor Ivanov and Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev to travel to
Belgrade, the Yugoslav capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``The aim of the trip is to coordinate steps (with Milosevic),
which could help find a political solution to the conflict which
has emerged because of NATO's military action,'' Ivanov said.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has strenuously criticized the NATO attacks on a fellow
Slavic nation, but has limited its objections to largely symbolic
steps.
</P>
<P>
   State Department spokesman James Rubin said the United States
welcomes ``any diplomatic efforts'' but a U.S. official said
expectations for the mission ranged from ``modest to nonexistent.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me be clear,'' Rubin said, ``NATO will continue air
operations until such time as President Milosevic halts his
offensive and commits to a settlement based on the Rambouillet
accords.''
</P>
<P>
   The accords, written by NATO allies, call for a cease-fire in
Kosovo that would be policed by allied troops. Fighting began when
the largely ethnic Albanian province sought independence from
Serbia, one of two republics that make up Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The ethnic Albanian delegation signed the document, but
representatives of Milosevic refused, calling the plan an
unwarranted attack on Yugoslavia's sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   Russia was part of the so-called Contact Group that sponsored
the sessions in Paris and Rambouillet, France.
</P>
<P>
   At NATO headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, alliance spokesmen
indicated that the Yugoslav air-defense system had been damaged
enough to allow a shift to specific operational targets in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``The major weight of our efforts focused on operations and
installations supplying the paramilitary, military and (special
police) forces in Kosovo,'' Shea said.
</P>
<P>
   As Lockhart did at the White House, Shea expressed disdain for
short-term assessments faulting the military effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's true that President Milosevic is very tenacious, but so
are we,'' Shea said. ``Is the mission working? Yes, we are being
effective. Yes, the mission is working. This is a methodical,
systematic and progressive air campaign to strip the Serb
leadership bare of their military capabilities.''
</P>
<P>
   To help, the United States is sending additional B1B bombers to
the area, along with five EA-6B Prowler anti-radar aircraft and
more tanker planes, the Pentagon said.
</P>
<P>
   Air Commodore Wilby, on NBC's Today, said the new phase of the
air campaign is showing signs of success.
</P>
<P>
   ``From yesterday, we were getting extremely heartening news from
sources which said that there was evidence that our campaign was
beginning to work,'' Wilby said. ``It was beginning to disrupt
them. It was beginning to worry them. And we will continue.''
</P>
<P>
   At a subsequent NATO briefing, Wilby said the Yugoslav
air-defense system showed ``less response'' overnight Sunday than
previously.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt in our minds that it is shaky,'' Wilby said.
``I'm not saying it's down, I'm not saying it's a totally
neutralized threat. There will always be a threat from that air
defense. But we have got very capable aircraft, and we will
prosecute the job that we need to do to get the job done.''
</P>
<P>
   Shea joined Lockhart in disputing the idea that the NATO
airstrikes had led to more violence in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd stress that the current campaign is not a spontaneous
outburst following NATO's operations,'' Shea said. ``It looks much
more like a planned, conceived _ and executed, now _ campaign
against the civil population'' prepared as the Yugoslav delegation
was rejecting the Rambouillet cease-fire proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are trying to stop this catastrophe and stop this
killing,'' NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana said.
</P>
<P>
   Shea said that the number of refugees from Kosovo who have
streamed into already struggling Albania has doubled to 60,000 in a
few days.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see an effort to destabilize neighboring countries by
flooding them with refugees,'' that tax the economic and social
structures, Shea said.
</P>
<P>
   Shea said NATO believes about 280,000 displaced people remain in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   He said it was ``particularly disturbing'' that Yugoslav police
officials are charging at least 1,000 deutsche marks (about $550)
to cross into Albania.
</P>
<P>
   Albanian Prime Minister Pandeli Majko said Serb authorities were
demanding refugees hand over official identity papers before
crossing into his country.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost as if their identities are being canceled out,''
Shea said.

WITH OIL CUTS, WHY INVITE OUTSIDERS? 
</HEADLINE>
 (fb) 
 By YOUSSEF M. IBRAHIM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   VIENNA, Austria _ Greater U.S. access to Saudi Arabian
petroleum, a Clinton administration goal and the dream of oil
companies, has now been put on indefinite hold, senior Saudi
officials said after a new OPEC agreement was reached.
</P>
<P>
   That agreement, aimed at raising prices by reducing production,
was essentially negotiated by Saudi Arabia, which owns the world's
biggest pool of oil. The Persian Gulf country, long suspicious of
foreigners, has no desire to let foreign companies find more oil
when its goal is to reduce the supply, the Saudi officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Inviting foreign companies to come in and look for more oil
does not make sense,'' said a senior Saudi official, speaking on
condition of anonymity. ``Forget it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Saudi position represents a setback for the United States,
the leading consumer of oil, which has long been eager to secure a
permanent foothold in this huge and accessible source of supply.
Until last week, optimism had been rising that the Saudis would at
last allow U.S. oil companies to explore and drill for oil in their
country.
</P>
<P>
   American influence was prominent in the unprecedented meeting
held last October in Washington between Crown Prince Abdullah, who
has been administering Saudi Arabia for the ailing King Fahd, and
chief executives of at least seven major oil companies. At that
meeting, the companies lobbied for the right to invest and own a
share of what they find in new oil.
</P>
<P>
   But that possibility was effectively eliminated, Saudi officials
said privately, when the 11-member Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries, meeting in Vienna, agreed with four important
producers outside the bloc _ Norway, Mexico, Russia and Oman _ to
withhold a total of 2.1 million barrels a day, or 3 percent of
current production, from world markets.
</P>
<P>
   Of the total cuts, Saudi Arabia's share is 585,000 barrels, or
more than 25 percent. This means that the Saudis, who have the
capacity to pump as much as 10.5 million barrels of oil a day, will
pump 7.4 million barrels.
</P>
<P>
   Saudi Arabia's position runs some risk that rival producers in
and out of OPEC will see an opportunity to develop fields using
Western help and enhance their own ability to increase production
at will, diminishing Saudi power to influence the market.
</P>
<P>
   Major producers, including anti-Western nations such as Iran,
Libya and Iraq in addition to others such as Algeria, Venezuela and
Kuwait, are pressing for more foreign capital, and have expressed
willingness to give foreign oil companies an ownership stake in
their resources, the so-called upstream end of the business.
</P>
<P>
   That may partly explain why Ali Naimi, the Saudi oil minister,
has been careful not to shut the door entirely to American
companies. Speaking about the issue during and before the OPEC
meeting, he invited American companies to contribute ideas on how
to develop Saudi natural gas for the generating of electricity and
other uses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those who help Saudi Arabia expand its industrial base today
will probably be the ones that will be involved when _ and if _ the
upstream is available for investment,'' Naimi said in comments to
reporters during the OPEC meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The lure of Saudi oil is that it dwarfs every other country's
offering. With fabled reserves estimated at 260 billion barrels,
Saudi Arabia represents the biggest prize to a multinational
company eager for secure, inexpensive and accessible oil.
</P>
<P>
   On average, it costs $1 to extract a barrel of Saudi oil
compared with costs ranging from $3 to $10 for oil from other
countries, especially those outside the Persian Gulf region.
</P>
<P>
   For the Saudis there is both danger and temptation in courting
the American companies. A greater involvement, particularly in
ownership, could antagonize domestic political and cultural
opponents, who have been outspoken in expressing anti-American
sentiments.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the superior technology of the American companies is a
powerful inducement to invite them in. The Saudis cannot rest on
their vast reserves forever.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aside from the Clinton push for more free commerce, the
momentum to meet with American oil companies in Washington had to
do with the Saudi need to stay involved in the United States market
and with what their neighbors are doing,'' said Amy Myers Jaffe,
senior energy analyst at the Baker Institute at Rice University in
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   As of last week, the Saudis were soliciting proposals from at
least seven major oil companies about investing in what is called
the downstream end of the business _ refining crude oil, using
natural gas to generate electricity and to power desalination
plants. The companies have not responded enthusiastically, but they
see little choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not in the utility business. There is not much profit
in that,'' said a senior executive from one of the companies, who
spoke on condition of anonymity. ``But if the client is Saudi
Arabia, how can anyone say no?''

AUTO CLUB CLOSES PROBE INTO IRWINDALE SPEEDWAY DEATH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 San Gabriel Valley Tribune

<P>
   IRWINDALE, Calif. _ The United States Auto Club on Monday closed
its investigation into the death of a 23-year-old sprint car driver
who died from injuries suffered in an accident during practice at
Irwindale Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   Casey Diemert of Roseburg, Ore., died Saturday afternoon when
his car struck the wall between turns 3 and 4. At the time, he was
traveling about 100 mph. Witnesses said the accident occurred when
Diemert attempted to avoid a car that was stalled on the track.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Maddox, the USAC chief steward charged with investigating
the accident, said the fatal accident occurred when Diemert failed
to see a yellow caution light warning of the stalled car.
</P>
<P>
   ``A car had spun on the track; the caution light had come out,''
said Maddox, who witnessed the accident. ``It was apparent to me
that Casey did not see the caution light. He got over the wheel of
another car and went into the wall.''
</P>
<P>
   There were 15 cars on the track at the time of the accident,
Maddox said. Diemert's death occurred during the first practice
session on opening day at the $10 million Irwindale Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   In his investigation, Maddox concluded that everything was done
properly. All the cars were mechanically inspected before the
practice session, as was all the safety equipment on cars and
drivers, Maddox said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything checked out,'' Maddox said. ``It was an impact that
was unsurvivable.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the Irwindale Police were called to the scene, they did
no formal investigation of the accident, Irwindale Police Lt. Rick
Woodmansee said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a situation like this, we get names of people involved,''
Woodmansee said. ``It would be kind of tough for us to do a fatal
accident investigation. They take four or five hours to do and you
can't hold up the races.''
</P>
<P>
   As for auto racing: ``(Death) is just one of the things that
comes with the territory,'' Woodmansee said.
</P>
<P>
   After conducting an autopsy, a medical examiner for the Los
Angeles County Department of Coroner ruled Diemert's death an
accident. A routine toxicology report will be performed to
determine if Diemert had any drugs or alcohol in his system.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do that in all auto accidents,'' said coroner's spokesman
Scott Carrier. ``It's a very normal procedure.''
</P>
<P>
   Diemert's father and the owner of the car, James Diemert, was
reached Monday at the family home in Roseburg. He recalled his
son's brief racing career and the events leading up to Casey's
death Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   James Diemert remembered his son as an ``exceptional driver, who
raced every minute he was on the track.''
</P>
<P>
   Casey Diemert began racing at age 16. He raced street stocks,
trucks and sprints, James said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there was another car on the track, he'd try to catch it or
pass it. He had to have somebody out there to compete with,'' the
father said. ``He was a racer. He had his foot down and his elbows
out all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he was at the track, James Diemert said he didn't see
the accident that resulted in his son's death. And because he had
turned his back to the track, he never saw the caution light.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it happened, (the yellow light) had just come out. It
couldn't have been out for very long because I had turned away to
go meet him (in the pits),'' Diemert said. ``I had to go around the
back of the track to do that, and when I got there, it had already
happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Funeral arrangements are pending.

<P>
   BP Amoco is close to an agreement to acquire the Atlantic
Richfield Co. in a stock swap worth about $28 billion, executives
close to the talks said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The executives also said that some of the top executive officers
at ARCO including its chief executive, Michael R. Bowlin, were not
likely to remain in their jobs if an agreement was reached.
</P>
<P>
   The boards of both companies are expected to meet on Wednesday
to consider the deal.
</P>
<P>
   BP Amoco, which was formed last December in a merger of British
Petroleum and the Amoco Corp., forming the word's third-largest oil
company, and ARCO confirmed the negotiations in a joint statement
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   They cautioned, however, that an agreement had not been reached
and that the discussions could still be called off.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, shares of ARCO surged Monday, rising $8.6875, or
13.3 percent, to $74.0625, in heavy trading on the New York Stock
Exchange. The American depository shares of BP Amoco, each of which
represents six ordinary shares, were also up sharply, climbing
$4.5625, or 4.5 percent, to $105. In London, BP Amoco shares rose
40 pence, or 3.9 percent, to 1,077.
</P>
<P>
   ARCO, based in Los Angeles, has most of its operations on the
West Coast, where it is a large refiner and seller of gasoline. It
has about 26 percent of the gasoline retail market in California.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said that ARCO would flesh out BP Amoco's national
refining and marketing business, which is strong in the East and
Midwest but not on the West Coast.
</P>
<P>
   It also has major oil and natural gas fields and production in
Alaska, gas fields in Indonesia and is making an effort to get a
foothold in the Caspian Sea region.
</P>
<P>
   ``Buying ARCO would transform BP Amoco from a very powerful
regional company to a truly global oil company,'' said J. Robinson
West, the chairman of Petroleum Finance, an industry consulting
group based in Washington. ``In the past, they have cut costs very
well, but this gives them growth as well.''
</P>
<P>
   The main force in building up BP Amoco has been Sir John Browne,
its chief executive, who took over a slow-moving and troubled
company in 1991 and helped to transform it into an industry
pacesetter by sharply cutting costs and forming alliances with
other oil companies.
</P>
<P>
   His takeover of Amoco last August helped lead to the purchase of
the Mobil Corp. by the Exxon Corp.
</P>
<P>
   In the current talks, ARCO is being advised by Goldman, Sachs &AMP;
Co. and Salomon Smith Barney, a unit of Citigroup. BP Amoco is
being advised by Morgan Stanley Dean Witter &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   If Browne were successful in buying ARCO, analysts said it would
put great pressure on other large oil companies such as Texaco Inc.
and the Chevron Corp. to also find merger partners. The stocks of
most major oil companies rose Monday, with shares of Texaco up
$2.1875, to $57.75, and Chevron up $2.8125, to $89.625.
</P>
<P>
   Executives close to the talks said Monday that BP Amoco would
offer about $28 billion in stock for ARCO.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a good deal for ARCO shareholders,'' said Adam
Sieminski, an analyst with BT Alex. Brown, because they would gain
shares in a growing company.
</P>
<P>
   ARCO has been severely hurt by the big fall in crude oil prices
last year, which sharply lowered its earnings and led to loss in
the fourth quarter. Analysts began to wonder whether it could keep
paying its substantial yearly dividend of $2.85 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said that one of the main reasons BP Amoco was
interested in ARCO was that both companies have big holdings and
production in Prudhoe Bay, Alaska, where they made major finds in
the late 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   ARCO has largely lived off its production there, generating
money to build its refining and chemical business.
</P>
<P>
   For a time the company was an industry leader, being one of the
first oil companies to add convenience stores to its gas stations.
It has 1,700 in seven Western states, with 900 in California. It
also built two large refineries, one in Cherry Point, Wash., and
the other in Carson, Calif. Both can process more than 200,000
barrels of crude oil a day.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than concentrating on exploration to find another Prudhoe
Bay, however, the company went into the petrochemical business and
bought tankers to transport crude oil.
</P>
<P>
   As the production began to run down in Alaska, the company began
an aggressive program to find more oil but had disappointing
results. In the 1990s, it sold its chemical business to finance
more exploration and bought an independent oil company, Union Texas
Holdings Inc. of Houston, last year to strengthen its overseas
exploration operations.
</P>
<P>
   Its refining and gas station business has also been under
pressure as new low-cost independent refiners have entered its
markets, and other refiners have merged their operations and cut
costs.
</P>
<P>
   ARCO has not joined the industry in building stations where
customers can use a wide variety of credit cards to fill up at the
pumps. It still relies on cash and debit cards.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts think that employees of the former Amoco, who were
considered savvy marketers of gasoline, will be of great help in
revamping ARCO's gasoline business.
</P>
<P>
   While ARCO has been more of a no-frills seller of gasoline, it
nevertheless has been making good money at it, with profits from
its stations surpassing many of its larger rivals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not talking Bloomingdale's, we're talking Sam's,'' said
Sieminski, referring to the discount retail chain. ``They're price
conscious and they're doing very well.''

COUPLE IN EMBRYO MIX-UP TENTATIVELY AGREE TO GIVE UP ONE BABY
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Last April, Donna Fasano and Deborah Perry-Rogers
arrived separately at a fertility clinic in Manhattan filled with
hope and apprehension. Both women had tried without success for
years to conceive a child. Both had the same doctor, and they had
appointments on the same spring day to be implanted with fertilized
eggs.
</P>
<P>
   A month later, Fasano, of New York City, was pregnant with
twins, but Rogers, of Teaneck, N.J., was not pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks later, the lives of two women who had never met
became unexpectedly entangled: they were told, according to lawyers
for both women, that a mistake had occurred. The lawyers said that
Dr. Lillian Nash had implanted Fasano not only with four of her
eggs fertilized by her husband, but also with several other
fertilized eggs, apparently from Rogers and her husband.
</P>
<P>
   DNA tests showed that Fasano was the biological mother of one
baby, but not the other.
</P>
<P>
   Three months ago, the mix-up was confirmed when Fasano gave
birth to two healthy boys. One baby, like the Fasanos, is white.
The other, like the Rogerses, is black.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, lawyers representing the Fasanos announced a stunning
solution to the mix-up: the Fasanos will raise one boy, but they
will allow the Rogerses to raise the other, if DNA tests confirm
that the Rogerses are the biological parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Fasanos have reared, loved and cared for both children as
their own,'' said Ivan L. Tantleff, one of three lawyers
representing the New York couple. ``She is doing this because she
loves her boys, and she is a victim here, not the culprit. She
doesn't look at them as white and black. She looks at them as her
sons. She is torn apart by this.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday's announcement came two weeks after the Rogerses filed a
lawsuit that seeks custody of one boy and claims negligence,
malpractice and breach of contract on the part of Nash and two
other physicians. Tantleff informed the lawyer for the Rogerses,
Rudolph Silas, on Monday that the Fasanos had decided to allow the
other couple to raise one of the boys, pending the results of the
DNA tests.
</P>
<P>
   Silas said he reached an astonished Mrs. Rogers late Monday
afternoon with the news. ``She was very excited to hear the good
news and overwhelmed after so many failed efforts to conceive,'' he
said. ``Delighted, overwhelmed and mostly tears.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers said neither couple would speak with reporters, and
Tantleff said the Fasanos refused to release photographs of the
babies or their names. The Rogerses and the Fasanos are expected to
meet for the first time within a week, with the two brothers.
Tantleff did release a handwritten statement by Mrs. Fasano.
</P>
<P>
   ``This wasn't my doing,'' Mrs. Fasano said. ``People with
infertility problems should be able to go to their doctors and
trust them to do the right thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Fasano then seemed to address Nash and the other two
doctors. ``To them, it may be a job,'' she said. ``To me, it's my
life. She may have given me two beautiful babies, but she destroyed
their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   She continued: ``We both want what's in the best interest of the
child. We're giving him up because we love him.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nash could not be reached for comment; her answering service
said Monday afternoon that her office had closed for the day.
</P>
<P>
   In their lawsuit, the Rogerses have accused Nash, Dr. Dov B.
Goldstein and an embryologist named only as Dr. Obasaju with
negligently mishandling their embryos. Tantleff said the Fasanos
were planning to file a separate lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Silas said the Fasanos will probably be dropped as defendants in
the Rogerses' suit since the custody issue appears to have been
resolved. Before Monday's announcement, Silas said the Rogerses had
been undergoing counseling and had been emotionally distraught.
</P>
<P>
   ``She had approached this at the end of many years trying to
conceive,'' Silas said, referring to Mrs. Rogers. Now, he said,
there was reason for optimism.
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly raises the possibility of a happy ending for all
parties,'' he said, ``at least happier than it would have been if
there had not been two children.''
</P>
<P>
   Tantleff said the Fasanos will insist upon a visitation
agreement so that the boys will know each other as brothers.

<P>
   &QR;  A 28,000-member peacekeeping force is proposed to go into the

about 7,000 of those are from the U.S. 1st Cavalry Div. based at
Fort Hood, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  There is an expeditionary unit of 2,200 U.S. Marines aboard

   NEW YORK _ For several weeks, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and first
lady Hillary Rodham Clinton have waged a kind of shadow campaign
for the U.S. Senate. He is raising money and she is peppering
people with questions, but both have refused to announce their
intentions. It has all been so maddeningly ... polite.
</P>
<P>
   Until Monday, that is, when the mayor's Friends of Giuliani
fund-raising committee posted a new Web site on the Internet. It is
called Hillaryno.com and seeks to raise money and enlist volunteers
for Giuliani by capitalizing on what the mayor's advisers sense is
an untapped world of inveterate Hillary haters.
</P>
<P>
   The Web site _ including an unflattering photograph of the first
lady with her mouth agape _ portrays Mrs. Clinton as a would-be
carpetbagger with aspirations for running for president. ``Born in
Illinois and carried to power in Arkansas, with no connection of
any kind to New York,'' it reads, ``Hillary has set her sights on
the New York Senate seat and maybe ... probably ... set her sights
even higher.''
</P>
<P>
   It also suggests that Mrs. Clinton is unqualified to serve in
the Senate, recalling her ``failed health care experiment'' and
saying that she has no governmental experience and has never been
elected to public office. A subtitle to the Web site reads: ``U.S.
Senate: For Proven Leaders, Not a Proving Ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Those sufficiently outraged by the prospect of a Senator Clinton
from New York are provided with a few ways to vent their anger _
all to the benefit of Giuliani. In fact, the Web site strongly
implies that the Republican mayor will be running for the Senate
seat being vacated by Daniel Patrick Moynihan, a Democrat, next
year.
</P>
<P>
   For example, people are informed that they can donate to Friends
of Giuliani, a federal fund-raising committee, through the mail or
online. ``Either way, your dollars will send your message loud and
clear _ Hillary No!''
</P>
<P>
   People are also encouraged to sign a petition intended to ``send
a clear message that you object to Hillary Clinton using the U.S.
Senate as a stepping stone to higher office.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Teitelbaum, executive director of Solutions America,
Giuliani's political action committee, said that the Web site was
intended to ``alert people who are users of the Internet about Mrs.
Clinton's potential run for the Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   Teitelbaum declined to elaborate further on why the campaign had
decided to bolster Giuliani's support by attacking Mrs. Clinton;
why, for example, the campaign did not have a Web site called
Rudyyes.com.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani had said that Mrs. Clinton's entry into the New York
Senate race would strengthen his resolve to run, and before his new
Web site appeared, he said he would refrain from criticizing her
for not being from New York. Several Republican strategists have
said that her candidacy would considerably bolster the state
party's fund-raising efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet broadside did not exactly intimidate Mrs. Clinton's
supporters; in fact, they described it as the kind of nasty stunt
they would expect from Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   Judith Hope, the Democratic state chairwoman, said: ``The tone
of the Web site matches the direction of his approval numbers:
negative, negative, negative.'' Her comment referred to the recent
drastic dip in the mayor's poll ratings, after police killed an
unarmed West African immigrant last month.
</P>
<P>
   Norman Adler, a political consultant who works with candidates
in both parties, said hillaryno.com was ``kind of amateurish.'' He
added, ``And I think it's jumping the gun.''

DIGITAL TRACKS YIELD CLUES TO CREATOR OF INTERNET VIRUS
</HEADLINE>
   ( kd ) 
 By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ Following the telltale digital fingerprints
of the author of a rapidly spreading computer virus, a lone
software detective has assembled a dossier suggesting that the
virus writer has struck previously and that the programmer's
activities are already well known to computer security experts.
</P>
<P>
   The investigator, Richard Smith, 45, is the president of Phar
Lap Software, a small software development company here. Although
Smith usually spends his time designing software tools and
operating systems, over the weekend he used programmers' tools to
peer inside the document that carries the virus known as Melissa,
which has wildly spread through the Internet in recent days.
</P>
<P>
   Smith found indications that the virus is a work of a programmer
_ or possibly a small group _ who wrote and distributed a similar
program two years ago. Moreover, by searching the World Wide Web,
he has found clues to the identity of the programmers and even more
striking evidence that could lead the authorities to the computer
on which the program was written.
</P>
<P>
   Monday Smith turned that information over to the FBI. Paul
Bresson, an FBI spokesman, would say only, ``We have a case that's
open, and we're actively investigating the virus.'' Distributing a
computer virus is a federal crime. Whoever the virus writer is, the
work took its toll Monday. The Computer Emergency Response Team, a
Pentagon-financed security service at Carnegie Mellon University,
reported calls from 250 organizations indicating that the virus had
affected at least 100,000 workplace computers.
</P>
<P>
   The virus, which began to cause havoc on Friday, is like a chain
letter spread in an e-mail attachment listing several pornographic
Web sites. When recipients open the attachment, it tries to mail
itself to 50 other e-mail addresses stored in the user's computer,
propagating itself each time with the subject line ``Important
Message From'' followed by the name of the previous victim.

ATTACKS INCREASE; US LOOKS TO RUSSIAN VISIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT AND LOUISE D. PALMER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As NATO trained its bombs on Yugoslav ground troops
and as refugees streamed Monday from Kosovo with fresh horror
stories of genocide, US officials turned warily to Russian Prime
Minister Yevgeny Primakov's planned visit to Belgrade Tuesday as a
possible first step toward peace.
</P>
<P>
   Primakov, who scrapped a US visit after the NATO airstrikes
began last week, made for an unlikely beacon of hope. Russia, a
longtime Serbian ally, protested the bombings from the outset, and
even Monday, several Russian officials blamed ethnic Albanians in
Kosovo for the mass destruction sweeping the southern province.
</P>
<P>
   But on the sixth day of NATO airstrikes, amid growing anxiety
that the reported atrocities by Serbian forces might not be stopped
without ground troops, Western officials spoke of Primakov's
pending visit with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic in
increasingly optimistic terms. NATO Secretary General Javier Solana
paid Primakov a personal compliment, saying: ``I know his
diplomatic skills.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope he will be able to convince Milosevic to stop and
return to the path of negotiations worked out at Rambouillet,''
Solana said, referring to the recent failed peace talks in France.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said: ``We welcome those who
have influence on Belgrade, who will take a message about what it
is they need to do in order to end this allied air campaign. It
could be constructive.''
</P>
<P>
   Primakov's impromptu trip follows the urging of Russian
President Boris Yeltsin, who also sent several other top Russian
officials. It also followed a deal Monday with the International
Monetary Fund, which will loan more money to Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Russian Defense Ministar Igor Ivanov confirmed that the purpose
of Primakov's trip was to ``coordinate steps which could help find
a political solution to the conflict,'' though he blamed the crisis
on the West, saying it ``emerged because of NATO's military
actions.''
</P>
<P>
   But despite continued international criticism, US and NATO
warplanes stepped up their attacks on Yugoslav forces, zeroing in
on ground troops widely reported to be committing atrocities
against Albanians. In addition to reportedly sending in the A-10
ground-attack planes, a large low-flying aircraft known as the
``Warthog,'' the United States made plans to increase its airpower
with additional B-1B bombers and EA-6B aircraft, said Pentagon
spokesman Kenneth H. Bacon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are reducing the Yugoslav ability to sustain operations,''
Bacon said. ``But the impact of choking off supply lines and
eliminating ammo facilities and fuel supplies, of course, is a
delayed impact.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, ethnic Albanians, exhausted, petrified and traveling
by foot, continued to flood into neighboring Albania and Macedonia
by the thousands. They told horrible stories of mass lootings and
killings.
</P>
<P>
   Macedonia, fearing the flood of refugees, appealed urgently to
neighboring countries to open their borders to accept refugees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have reached our limit of 20,000 refugees,'' Deputy Premier
Radmila Kiprijanova said at a news conference. ``A larger number
will result in the destabilization of the country and the region,''
Reuters reported.
</P>
<P>
   Among those murdered execution-style were five ethnic Albanian
leaders, including Fehmi Agani, a delegate to the recent peace
talks in Rambouillet, France, NATO officials said. Baton Haxhiu,
the editor-in-chief of the main Kosovar Albanian newspaper, Koha
Ditore, was also among the victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at what's going on at the borders, you have what
appears to be a textbook definition of ethnic cleansing,'' Lockhart
said at the White House. State Department spokesman James Rubin
said there were ``indications genocide is unfolding in Kosovo,''
calling the massacres and the resulting crisis ``abhorrent and
criminal action on a maximum scale.''
</P>
<P>
   To help combat the growing potential for disaster, particularly
in Albania, one of the poorest nations in Europe, where some 60,000
refugees have fled in the past week, the United States gave $8.5
million to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to
help pay for relief items such as blankets and medicine, according
to Assistant Secretary of State Julia Taft. Food supplies were also
being sent, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Questions remained about what further steps the United States
should take within the borders of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   After six days of bombing, and with no signs Milosevic would
relent anytime soon, some military analysts increased their call
for officials to consider the possibility of using ground troops.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they don't have a better option for ending this war, I
don't know how they can rule ground troops out,'' said Michael
O'Hanlon, a senior analyst at the Brookings Institution. Senator
John McCain, Republican of Arizona, made similar remarks.
</P>
<P>
   But others continued to express serious reservations about such
plans. Representative Sam Gejdenson, Democrat of Connecticut, said,
``With the exception of Senator McCain, there's almost a universal
aversion to ground troops.'' Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, also a
Connecticut Democrat, agreed, saying he was ``surprised at those
calls,'' and that the risk of sending in troops are ``higher than
the stakes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a real potential for a quagmire _ a situation where
we find it hard to get out, a situation of combat, not peacekeeping
troops,'' Lieberman said.
</P>
<P>
   Bacon, the Pentagon spokesman, said NATO had ``no intention'' of
sending ground troops into Kosovo, which analysts have said would
require some 200,000 troops.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no magic military bullet here,'' Bacon said. ``Even
if a decision by some NATO countries was made to deploy ground
troops from parts of Europe into Kosovo, it would take a long
while.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pew Research Center released a national poll Monday showing
Americans favor NATO strikes only for a limited time, and only as
long as ground troops were not involved. Only a minority said they
thought the Kosovo situation is a serious problem for the United
States, while more than half were ``very worried'' about troop
casualties. Sixty percent said NATO has a responsibility to act.
But only 47 percent said that responsibility fell to the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   All of which helped explain US officials' increasing eagerness
for the visit by Primakov to succeed. Vice President Al Gore, who
has close contact with Primakov and who last week told Primakov
about the airstrikes, prompting the Russian to cancel his US trip
in mid-flight, canceled his own six-day vacation this week.
Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright has also had conversations
with the Russian foreign minister, Ivanov, both Sunday and Monday,
spokesman Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials have not backed away from their assertion that
Serbs are not to blame for the conflict. Indeed, Russian Defense
Minister Igor Sergeyev blamed NATO Monday for killing some 1,000
civilians in the airstrikes. And Ivanov blamed NATO for protecting
the Kosovo Liberation Army, casting it as the terrorist instigators
of the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   But as Primakov's visit neared, US officials tried to brush
those differences aside. The ultimate aim is for the strikes to
end, Lieberman said. ``I hope we'll get to a point _ and maybe
Primakov's visit will open the door _ where Milosevic is ready to
talk peace again,'' he said.

ADVANCE IN DOW IS MATCHED BY OTHER SHARE MEASURES 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Dow Jones industrial average's surge above 10,000
highlighted a session that saw broader market gauges move sharply
higher, pushed by merger talk in the oil patch and continued strong
demand for a relatively small group of big technology stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We finally did it,'' said Jeffrey Applegate, chief investment
strategist at Lehman Brothers. ``To some extent, Dow 10,000 is just
a number. But it is psychologically important.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday was the fourth day this month that the Dow has broken
through 10,000, the previous being on March 19. But enough sellers
emerged in those earlier sessions to push the index below that
level by the close of trading.
</P>
<P>
   By the closing bell on Monday, though, the Dow had risen 184.54
points, or 1.88 percent, to 10,006.78. Earlier in the day, the Dow
rose as high as 10,089.48.
</P>
<P>
   The close above 10,000 came nearly a year after April 6, 1998,
when the Dow first closed above 9,000.
</P>
<P>
   Almost lost in the shuffle was a powerful performance by broader
market gauges.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index rose 27.37, or 2.1
percent, to 1,310.17. The gain put the index close to its record of
1,316.55, set on March 18. The Nasdaq composite index, up nearly 14
percent this year, jumped 73.67, or 3 percent, on Monday, to
2,492.84, just under the peak of 2,510.09 it hit on Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
   To some analysts, the session's most encouraging development was
a good gain in the shares of smaller companies.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index, which tracks smaller-company stocks,
gained 5.84, or 1.5 percent, Monday, to 399.76. Still, the Russell
2000 is down by more than 5 percent for the year.
</P>
<P>
   For some time, the bulk of the market's gains have been
concentrated in a small number of big, well-known companies. Many
analysts have questioned whether the market can continue to advance
if the leadership does not widen.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is obvious we are operating in a very narrow window of
strength,'' said Michael Clark, head of U.S. stock trading at
Credit Suisse First Boston. ``In this kind of marketplace, prices
can go a lot higher, but you have to look very clearly at the kind
of risks you are talking.''
</P>
<P>
   Market averages, including the Russell 2000, were helped by news
that BP Amoco &UR;  &LR; is in talks to acquire ARCO &UR;  &LR; for about $28 billion
in stock.
</P>
<P>
   ARCO jumped 8 11/16, to 74 1/16, on the news, and the American
depository receipts of BP Amoco gained 4 9/16, to 105. Chevron, a
Dow component, gained 2 13/16, to 89|. Exxon, which is also part of
the Dow, gained 1 7/16, to 73. And Phillips Petroleum gained 2
7/16, to 48 1/16.
</P>
<P>
   Technology issues were also big winners.
</P>
<P>
   IBM was the Dow's best performer, rising 5{, to 177~. Microsoft,
which split its shares 2 for 1 last Friday, gained 3\ on Monday, to
93]. Intel jumped 4}, to 121 7/16. And Cisco Systems rose 4 13/16,
to 110.
</P>
<P>
   Word that Computer Associates had agreed to buy Platinum
Technology International for $3.5 billion in cash also helped to
lift prices in the technology sector. Platinum Technology soared 14
3/16, to 24 1/16; Computer Associates gained 3 1/16, to 37.
</P>
<P>
   Financial service stocks, which have been cited by some analysts
as undervalued, also improved.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill Lynch gained 1 15/16, to 90 11/16. Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter rose 2}, to 105]. And Chase Manhattan rose 1}, to 82\.

HOUSE-TO-HOUSE ATTACKS BY SERB PARAMILITARY FORCES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROGZIYA, Yugoslavia _ Systematic, methodical, and deadly, they
came house to house, dressed in their Australian bush hats and
bright green camouflage uniforms, brandishing side-holster bayonets
and AK-47 automatic rifles.
</P>
<P>
   They are known as ``the Frenkis,'' the Serbian paramilitary
forces carrying out what they call ethnic cleansing in a brutal
expulsion of ethnic Albanians from the Kosovo town of Pec
(pronounced Pesh).
</P>
<P>
   ``They will not leave even one Albanian alive in Pec,''Arsim
Kelmendi, 34, said Monday just hours after fleeing for his life in
the predawn darkness from the smoldering remains of the town
roughly 10 miles from the Montenegro border.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are horrifying. They are evil,'' Kelmendi said, shivering
in an icy rain at the border crossing where tens of thousands of
refugees from Pec formed a human tide of misery and fear pouring
into this relatively safe part of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The second-largest city in Kosovo, Pec has become the grim
setting for among the worst atrocities committed by paramilitary
forces loyal to Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic. Behind much
of the ethnic cleansing in Pec is an obscure and shadowy covert
military unit loyal to one of Milosevic's secret police commanders,
Franko ``Frenki'' Simatovic, from whom the Frenkis take their name.
</P>
<P>
   In the last week, eyewitnesses said the units have worked in
coordination with Milosevic's Yugoslav army and Serbian police in
an effort to force out almost all of the ethnic Albanians who made
up nearly 90 percent of the population of roughly 100,000 in Pec
and neighboring villages.
</P>
<P>
   The area of Pec is the ancient seat of the Serbian Orthodox
Church and a holy land to the ultranationalist forces who want to
rid it of the overwhelmingly Muslim Albanian population.
</P>
<P>
   Simatovic, who some believe is alive and others say was recently
killed by Albanian guerrillas, emerged from the state security
department of the Serbian Interior Ministry, according to a former
interior minister who is now a member of the anti-Milosevic
opposition.
</P>
<P>
   They are referred to within the ministry as jojna linija, or
``the military line,'' said the former minister and witnesses
trying to build a case against Milosevic in the war crimes tribunal
in The Hague.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Frenkis'' and other paramilitary units, such as Arkan's
Tigers, carried out a murderous campaign from 1991 to 1995 during
the war in Bosnia and Croatia in the former Yugoslavia. They are
believed to recruit convicts, then train and arm them, and set them
loose on ethnic communities. In Bosnia and Croatia in the early
1990s, they participated in some of the worst massacres of the war
and committed vast looting of homes and businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are criminals and killers,'' said the former interior
minister, a respected government official who has spent a lifetime
as a military leader and in high-level political posts. Saying he
feared for the safety of his family in Belgrade, he spoke on
condition he not be identified.
</P>
<P>
   The Frenkis descended on Pec in January, just weeks before the
world focused on futile peace talks in France. As many as 1,000
members of the force, working in units of up to 10, methodically
established a base for their campaign of terror.
</P>
<P>
   Interviews with dozens of witnesses, including two ethnic
Albanian members of the international monitoring committees who
remained in Pec until Monday, reveal a horrifying picture of the
suffering and fear and killing of ethnic Albanians that enveloped
Pec, not only in the six days since the NATO bombing began, but
months before.
</P>
<P>
   After stealing cars and trucks for transportation, the units
carried out several sporadic attacks, beginning with a fire-bombing
in the village of Ljodja, outside Pec. One woman described seeing a
load of dead bodies in the back of a military truck from the
balcony of her home days after the firebombing. One of the members
of the international monitoring team who visited the site on Feb.
21 said, ``The village does not exist amymore. They burned it to
the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   This was only an introduction to the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   When the first air raid siren sounded Wednesday afternoon,
signaling that the NATO attacks were underway, the Frenkis wasted
no time exacting swift and sustained revenge on the ethnic
Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   ``While the siren was going, they came and they smashed the
windows on my house. They broke into my cafe and they destroyed
everything,'' said Kelmendi.
</P>
<P>
   By Thursday, witnesses say, they had begun the killing.
</P>
<P>
   Halil Dylenikum, 30, was found, his throat slit, lying in a
small stream that trickled through the neighborhood of Ilirjana. He
was still wearing the jogging suit and running shoes neighbors say
they had seen him wearing earlier that day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw him lying face up,'' said one neighbor, who asked not to
be identified because he still has family in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Although a precise death toll is impossible to determine, two
members of the monitoring team, who also spoke on the condition of
anonymity, said they believed, based on the first-person accounts
they had heard in recent days, that at least 30 people were killed.
</P>
<P>
   Others have disappeared. Mentor Chavoli, 20, called from Kosovo
Monday to a friend, who told him that his uncle, Hacim Kocan, 45,
had been kidnapped and was feared dead. He had gone out to buy
food. All that was found was his bicycle and a quart of milk by the
side of the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are sure he is dead,'' said a friend of the family who
spoke with Chavoli from the other side of the border. ``So now they
have left to get out to save their own lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday night, the Frenkis were active in Karagagac, a
neighborhood near the center of Pec.
</P>
<P>
   Five members of a unit descended on the home of Valir Basha.
They broke through his front door, ordered him and his family out
of the house, and took to the roof. They doused it with gasoline
and ignited it. As the paramilitary forces fled, the house exploded
in flames.
</P>
<P>
   Kelmendi, who lives next door, tried to help his neighbor put
out the fire. But the Frenkis tossed a grenade, he said, and the
fragments from the blast knocked Basha off his feet, the shrapnel
tearing through his skin. Somehow, he lived.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of witnesses described a pattern of cooperation among the
Frenkis, the Serbian Police, and the Yugoslav army.
</P>
<P>
   The Frenkis served as shock troops, witnesses said, coming to
the homes of ethnic Albanians and firing bursts of machine gun fire
at the windows and ordering them out. Then the Frenkis would
proceed to loot most of the homes of anything valuable, often
stripping women of jewelry. Men who tried to resist were beaten.
Some were taken to unknown locations.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after the initial assault came the sound of Yugoslav Army
tanks. They fired incendiary shells into the homes, engulfing them
in flames. Many witnesses described seeing their homes and all
their belongings go up in a bright-orange blaze that gave Pec an
eerie glow in the darkness as the city burned, block by block. From
a hillside on the outskirts, an army artillery position shelled
ethnic Albanian neighborhoods nightly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw houses burning, cannons firing shells every day. It is
all day and all night,'' said 18-year-old Edita, who nursed a
newborn in a ramshackle house of a relative where she had sought
refuge across the border in the republic of Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   She was surrounded by 25 family members who recounted their own
tales of what they had seen in Pec in recent days. One, Ayna Gogad,
37, stared out a window at the snow-covered mountains outside. Her
eyes were fixed on a pass where she hopes her husband, her two
teenage sons, and a daughter will arrive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told my husband, `Please, let's not separate. I can't live
if something happens to you,' '' she said, before she packed into a
car with 12 relatives and raced to the border.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone on the street risked arrest, beatings, and death. Scores
of young men between 18 and 35 have been rounded up and taken to
the Karajac Sports Center next to an army barracks, witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the days of the NATO bombing, the violence has been
relentless.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Saniya Studenica, 80, said she saw her neighbor
shot. The Serbian police rang the doorbell of Abdel Rahman Salimi,
40, and when he came to the door, there was a burst of five shots.
Salimi collapsed in the doorway, bleeding but alive.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors, unable to find care for him in Pec, rushed him,
bleeding, across the border. He is now in a hospital, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Halid Bachiri, 65, was gunned down in front of his two children,
said several relatives and neighbors. Men in fatigues came to his
house and asked him and his family to step outside. When he did
not, they shot him in his doorway. Bachiri, called a ``good man, a
good father,'' was highly respected in the ethnic Albanian
community.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he spoke, the room would be quiet,'' said a neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   Amid all this misery, virtually every refugee said they
supported the NATO airstrikes as the only way to destroy
Milosevic's forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``If NATO ground forces don't come, there will be no Albanians
left alive in Kosovo,'' said Margarita Gjikoli as she rushed to
catch a bus to a refugee camp and waved goodbye to neighbors and
friends.
</P>
<P>
   Gjikoli had escaped with Bachiri's brother and comforted him as
the van they were packed into plodded along in a column of hundreds
of cars, tractors, and horse-drawn carriages that lined the roads
to the border Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The scene in this border town of Rogziya was one of confusion,
sorrow, and apprehension. The refugees had made it to Montenegro,
the smallest of the two republics that make up what is left of
Yugoslavia. Here, a Western-leaning government has opposed
Milosevic and said it would accept refugees.
</P>
<P>
   But Montenegro is deeply divided. About half support Milosevic,
and the arrival of tens of thousands of refugees has already begun
to stir resentments among nationalist Serbs. Some lined the roads,
taunting and waving Yugoslav flags at the miles-long column of
refugees.
</P>
<P>
   In the chaos and cold rain at the bus station just on the
Montenegrin side of the border, Father Thomas Pietri, his white
clerical collar ringed with dirt and his black suit soaking wet
after hours walking across the border, said he was a refugee like
everyone else. Although the pro-Milosevic Serbs often fuse their
Orthodox Christian faith with their nationalism, they treated
Albanian Catholics no different than Albanian Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   Pietri said a group of six men dressed in camouflage uniforms,
who he believed were Serbian police, came to his church in Pec
Sunday at 5 p.m., after Palm Sunday services. About 100
parishioners had gathered for sanctuary and to attend the services
marking the beginning of Holy Week.
</P>
<P>
   One of the soldiers told the priest that all of them would have
to leave by 8 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a deadline. Go, or you will be killed,'' the soldier
told the priest and his congregation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why?'' the priest asked defiantly.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a military order,'' Pietri was told.
</P>
<P>
   Asked later about the use of Christian symbols and traditions in
the campaign of terror by Milosevic's forces, Pietri said, ``Let
God be their judge.''

   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ When Trajan Langdon was 14 years old and
had played exactly three games in high school, the Anchorage Daily
News proclaimed he would become the best basketball player in the
history of Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   Thank you, media gypsies.
</P>
<P>
   Not that there was any pressure or anything. After all, Langdon
only had to top the fabulous Muff Butler to accomplish it.
</P>
<P>
   Still, 14?
</P>
<P>
   I wonder why the paper waited so long.
</P>
<P>
   Langdon has fulfilled the gypsies' prediction. He is a
three-time first-team All-Atlantic Coast Conference player and
acknowledged emotional leader on the nation's No. 1 college team,
Duke.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Devils spent Monday night trying to bedevil Connecticut
and establish themselves as the undisputed Team of the Decade with
three national championships.
</P>
<P>
   Trajan Shaka Langdon was named after Trajan, the Roman emperor
who ended the persecution of Christians, and Shaka, a leader who
organized the Zulu tribe of Africa into a nation.
</P>
<P>
   Kind of makes being named after your uncle seem a little trite,
doesn't it?
</P>
<P>
   Langdon was a natural athlete, but one who always wanted more.
In grade school, when most of his classmates were frolicking in the
snow at recess, Langdon would shoot a basketball alone at an
outdoor rim.
</P>
<P>
   Zero degrees? Twenty below?
</P>
<P>
   Big deal. Gloves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't even feel the ball with the gloves on,'' he said.
``But it was a challenge. It was good practice to dribble the ball
in the snow. You never knew what way it would bounce.''
</P>
<P>
   The glass is half full.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've coached for 34 years and have never had a player work as
hard as he did,'' said his high school coach, Chuck White.
``Whatever he's gotten, he's earned it 10 times over by working
hard.''
</P>
<P>
   What he got was three state high school championships and three
State Player of the Year awards.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, coach Mike Krzyzewski sold him on Duke. Even though
over the previous four years the Blue Devils had won two national
titles and finished runner-up for another, the program was headed
into turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   Coach K had back surgery and missed most of 1994-95, Langdon's
freshman season, which ended 13-18. Recruiting suffered. Then
Langdon missed his sophomore season with a knee injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``That (freshman) season was very humbling,'' the 6-foot-3 guard
said. ``It was as if Duke ceased being Duke overnight.''
</P>
<P>
   Langdon came back in 1996-97 and in the next two seasons, Duke
was 56-13, but the Devils lost to Providence in the second round of
the tournament in '97 and lost to Kentucky in a regional final last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Langdon's mission was to see that doesn't happen again. When
Temple jumped to an 10-5 lead in the East Regional final last week,
Langdon was ready with his reply. He hit a runner in transition;
stopped on the right key and nailed a trey; hit another trey; then
another.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven points in four possessions.
</P>
<P>
   ``As pure a shooter as I've seen in the game of basketball,''
said Temple coach John Chaney. ``He only needs to look through a
hole in the needle to see the basket.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He is the rock,'' said teammate Shane Battier. ``Anytime we
get a little frazzled, all we have to do is look at him and see his
calm demeanor and realize that everything is all right.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He came here with snowshoes on,'' Krzyzewski joked Sunday.
``We had to get him regulation basketball equipment before he could
help us.''
</P>
<P>
   Now all he wants is a regulation ring.

<P>
   Now phone companies are seizing on this affection for
``one-stop-shopping,'' offering customers a potpourri of products _
local, long-distance and wireless phone service, and sometimes
Internet access and cable TV service _ from a single provider and
itemized on a single bill. By Deborah Solomon.

<P>
   &UR; CABLE &LR;  _ Antonio Randolph is kneeling outside a home in Orange
County's Aliso Viejo, splicing a long, thick piece of cable.
</P>
<P>
   Randolph, a cable technician for Cox Communications, connects
the end of the spliced wire to a cream-colored plastic box that
he's attached to the side of the house.

 Shades of Dick Tracy _ 2-Way Pagers
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Tom Abate &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
For everyone who's been buzzed, beeped or paged, here's a thought _
what if that gadget on your hip or in your purse could buzz, beep
and page right back?
</P>
<P>
   That's only the beginning of what you can do with the new,
two-way pagers just beaming onto the market.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to sending and receiving pages, these tiny gizmos
can handle e-mail and brief voice messages in either direction.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, by loading optional software onto a corporate network,
a company can allow two-way pagers to tap into Windows e-mail,
databases and organizers _ tasks that used to require laptop
computers.
</P>
<P>
   All this from a gizmo small enough to clip onto a belt and that
can run for a week or more on AA batteries.
</P>
<P>
   But before you scrap your venerable one-way pager, consider the
cost of this two-way novelty.
</P>
<P>
   Two-way pagers made by companies like Motorola, Glenayre and
Research in Motion range from $200 to $400, though most vendors now
offer rent-to-own programs that can eliminate this up-front
expense.
</P>
<P>
   Two-way service provided by carriers like SkyTel, PageMart,
PageNet and Bell South Wireless Data can cost from $25 to $100 per
month, depending on the volume of characters you send and receive.
</P>
<P>
   Two-way pagers also can be a challenge to use, given that you
reply by tapping away at a keyboard with buttons the size of those
on a pocket calculator.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, market analysts see two-way technology growing from an
insignificant part of the pager universe _ they represented just a
few hundred thousand units of the 50 million pagers in service last
year _ to 13 percent of the market in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   ``One-way paging is reaching a saturation point,'' said Cynthia
Hswe cq  &LR; with Strategis Group of Washington, D.C. ``Two-way is the
only way for the market to grow. But first, the industry has to
change people's perception about what paging is about.''
</P>
<P>
   The exact service varies depending on the pager manufacturer and
the service provider. But in general, all the systems offer the
following incoming services:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _Ordinary alphanumeric pages up to 500 characters. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _Voice-mail messaging. &LR;  People trying to reach you can phone a
toll-free number and dictate a message to an operator, who types it
in and sends it to the pager as a text message.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _Incoming e-mail messages &LR; . These work provided they are sent
to your pager number, for example, 555-5555 &LR; skytel.com.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _Guaranteed delivery &LR; . If you are paged on a one-way unit and
your pager is off when the message comes, you miss it. Two-way
pager networks keep sending out the message until your device
acknowledges receipt.
</P>
<P>
   In the outbound mode, two-way pager users can:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _Send a return page,  &LR; using the keyboard, to any other
alphanumeric pager.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _Send a voice message to any phone.  &LR; In this case, the pager
owner taps out a message and inputs the phone number to be dialed.
The information travels over airwaves to the pager service, which
dials the number. Someone must be there to answer. (Sorry, you
can't leave it on voice mail _ yet.) If your party does answer, the
pager service renders your text message into digitized sound.
So-the-voice-does-sound-robotic, but what can you expect from a new
technology?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _Send an e-mail to anyone on the Internet. &LR;  ``I can do this
while sitting in my car,'' said Toni Cupal, marketing manager for
the wireless division of Glenayre in Santa Clara.
</P>
<P>
   John Stupka, chief executive of Mississippi's SkyTel, said a key
feature of two-way paging is that it makes people reachable _ while
giving them control of when and how they respond.
</P>
<P>
   ``People love e-mail because they can send and respond to
messages when they want,'' Stupka said. ``Two-way paging offers the
same convenience. You can receive a message in the middle of a
meeting and send back a quick, short response without the
distraction of using a cell phone.''
</P>
<P>
   SkyTel began deploying the first two-way paging network in 1995.
But the service really wasn't practical to use until Motorola
started selling its PageWriter 2000 two-way pager in December 1997.
</P>
<P>
   And it is only this year, with the appearance of several
competing two-way carriers and pager manufacturers, that the
service is starting to be taken seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first year we've truly had competing services with
nationwide coverage,'' said Gerry Purdy, editor of the Mobile
Letter, which follows the handheld market. ``We'll have to see
whether corporate professionals view two-way pagers as an
alternative to one-way pagers used in conjunction with a cell
phone.''
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturers of two-way pagers hope to distinguish their
products by encouraging third-party software developers to create
add-on services that turn two-way pagers into something like a
cross between a laptop and a personal organizer.
</P>
<P>
   San Mateo's Corsoft Corp. is an example. Chief executive Chirag
Patel sells a program that allows a server computer running
Microsoft Exchange to send and receive data to and from two-way
pagers. Corsoft charges $300 to $500 per pager-user. The client
version of the software is downloaded to the pager via the user's
PC _ all the two-way pagers come with recharging cradles that plug
into a PC, so they double as a link that allows the pager to
communicate with the desktop PC.
</P>
<P>
   With Corsoft's software running on server and pager, the person
using the two-way pager can access various Microsoft Exchange
functions, including e-mail, the calendar and the contact database.
``The pager becomes a wireless, remote access device to get at
information stored on your networked PC,'' Patel said.
</P>
<P>
   Because two-way pagers _ not to mention such ancillary services
_ are new, there isn't much experience with them yet.
</P>
<P>
   But Andrew Seybold, who follows the wireless industry from his
office in Boulder Creek (Santa Cruz County), said two-way pagers
have the makings of a killer device _ they're small enough to carry
everywhere yet powerful enough to connect to contacts, calendars
and e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Seybold is particularly fond of the BlackBerry two-way pager
from Research in Motion, a company in Ontario, Canada. The
BlackBerry costs $400 to own or $20 a month to rent. Two-way
service, delivered over the BellSouth Wireless Data network, costs
a flat fee of $40 a month _ an advantage over other services that
meter usage and can charge up to $100 per month for unlimited
sending and receiving .
</P>
<P>
   Seybold said using BlackBerry has cut down on his monthly cell
phone bill because he now uses the two-way pager to e-mail quick
replies to colleagues whom he used to call.
</P>
<P>
   Industry pioneer SkyTel has taken note of flat-rate pricing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our industry is used to charging by the character,'' Stupka
said. ``Our challenge is reducing our complicated rates to
something friendlier.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Stupka is keeping his sights set on the ideal user:
``It's anyone who spends more than 50 percent of their time away
from their building, desk or cubby.''

   (NYT24) SAN JOSE, Calif. -- March 29, 1999 -- BKW-PURDUE, 3-29
-- Members of the Purdue team rejoicing after winning the school's
first women's national title. Purdue scored only 17 points in the
first half Sunday night, a tournament final record for futility in

KODAK ISSUES RARE WARNING ON EARNINGS
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Eastman Kodak Co., worried that analysts were ignoring the
informal cautions it had been sounding about its first quarter,
turned up the decibel level Monday. In a radical departure for the
traditionally secretive company, Kodak warned that its
first-quarter earnings would come in below many analysts'
expectations but gave detailed, and much rosier, forecasts for the
rest of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Investors, who have time and again dumped Kodak's stock on the
slightest whisper of negative news, broke with tradition, too.
Although several analysts lowered their first-quarter estimates
after the announcement, Kodak's shares held firm, rising 37.5
cents, to $65.625.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't think the lower first quarter will have any bad
implications for the year,'' said Jack L. Kelly, an analyst with
Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co., whose view was widely echoed by other
analysts.
</P>
<P>
   In Monday's announcement, Kodak reaffirmed its prediction that
its 1999 earnings would come in at $4.81 to $5.24 a share, or 10
percent to 20 percent more than last year's $4.37 a share. But it
warned that the improvements would not show up immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, Kodak predicted earnings of 73 to 80 cents a share
for the first quarter, below the Wall Street consensus of 82 cents.
However, it said its second-quarter earnings would bounce back to
$1.50 to $1.59 a share. And it predicted earnings of $2.58 to $2.85
a share for the first half.
</P>
<P>
   Although the news sent analysts scrambling to adjust their own
quarterly forecasts, most accepted Kodak's statement that the year
remained promising and retained ``buy'' recommendations on the
stock.
</P>
<P>
   ``If their estimates are right, then at 13 times earnings, this
is still a cheap stock,'' said B. Alexander Henderson, an analyst
with Prudential Securities Research.
</P>
<P>
   Kodak does face problems in the first quarter. The strong dollar
and shaky overseas economies continue to take their toll on Kodak's
overseas sales. Kodak remains under intense competitive pressures
in its film business, and it is running into extra costs associated
with its acquisition of Imation's medical business in August.
</P>
<P>
   But Kodak just sold its cash-draining copier business to
Heidelberger Druckmaschinen A.G., shedding a unit that lost $15
million last quarter and will probably lose $10 million in this
one. Kodak's cost-cutting programs are ahead of schedule, and it
has moved some manufacturing operations to low-cost areas like
China.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's definitely good reason to believe that the second half
will be better than the first,'' Robert Stern, an analyst at
Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co., said.
</P>
<P>
   Even more heartening to analysts is that Kodak's film sales,
while not soaring, have remained strong, while sales of the
company's digital products are picking up. ``The top line just
doesn't look so daunting anymore,'' said Jonathan Rosenzweig, an
analyst with Salomon Smith Barney.
</P>
<P>
   Kodak's new openness with its numbers seems to prove yet again
that there is no zealot quite like a recent convert. Until
recently, Kodak's management steadfastly refused to forecast
anything, maintaining variously that it feared lawsuits if they
were wrong and that forecasting was the analysts' job, not theirs.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the answer wasn't a matter of public record, they simply
did not answer the question,'' Ulysses Yannas, an analyst with
Mercer, Bokert, Buckman &AMP; Reid, said.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts welcome the changed attitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kodak is finally realizing that its stock has been penalized
for the uncertainty that has historically surrounded its
earnings,'' said Michael Ellmann, an analyst with Schroder &AMP; Co.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The first crack in Kodak's secretive armor came on Jan. 14, when
George M.C. Fisher, Kodak's chief executive, forecast earnings and
cost cuts for the full year. Then, on March 3, Kodak's chief
financial officer, Harry L. Kavetas, appeared at an office
equipment industry conference sponsored by Salomon Smith Barney and
told analysts they could expect Kodak to ``strengthen and broaden''
its communications with investors.
</P>
<P>
   Kavetas also said that Kodak's earnings would not improve until
the second half of this year. Several analysts lowered their
earnings estimates then. Indeed, the consensus of the First Call
Corp., which tracks company earnings, had already dropped to 82
cents from 89 cents a month earlier when Kodak issued its earnings
alert Monday. Even though some analysts cut their estimates by more
than a dime, the consensus was down just 4 cents, to 78 cents, on
the news.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the analysts were already within that range,'' said
Thomas O'Keefe, a research associate at First Call.
</P>
<P>
   But many were not.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was still this misalignment between the internal and
external views of what would happen,'' said Charles S. Smith, a
Kodak spokesman.

 How to Haggle for Low Phone Rates, Bonuses
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Jamie Beckett &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
Robert Marshall used to pay a whopping $800 a month for
long-distance calls. Now, the Walnut Creek businessman spends just
$200 even though he hasn't cut down on his calling. His secret?
Negotiation.
</P>
<P>
   Most consumers don't think about bargaining with their
long-distance company. But for those willing to haggle, the rewards
can be significant: better rates, more frequent-flier miles, free
minutes or cash bonuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I negotiate everything,'' said Marshall, an international
trade and finance consultant who does a lot of business in
Australia and in his native New Zealand. He used to pay $1.42 a
minute for these calls until he bargained AT&AMP;T down to 75 cents a
minute. To whittle his rate further, he switched carriers twice,
eventually lowering his rate to less than 29 cents a minute.
</P>
<P>
   He was happy until he heard that his carrier, a dial-around
service called Worldxchange, had an even better deal _ an
introductory rate of just a nickel a minute.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said I couldn't get that because I wasn't a new
customer,'' Marshall recalled. But he insisted, so the company
agreed to the nickel rate for 60 days.
</P>
<P>
   No deal, said Marshall. He wanted 90 days _ and he got it.
</P>
<P>
   Many consumers find it easier to switch than fight. But often,
you can get the best deal by negotiating with your current carrier.
</P>
<P>
   ``They know how much you're worth to them and how much it will
cost to get you back, so they'll probably be the most responsive,''
said Sam Simon, chairman of the Telecommunications Research and
Action Center, a Washington consumer group.
</P>
<P>
   Simon said phone companies' rate plans rarely are negotiable.
Where you'll have the most wiggle room are promotions and benefits
such as frequent-flier miles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The companies aren't likely to charge you 8 cents a minute
when they're charging everyone else 9 cents,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   What they may do is allow you to participate in a special
promotion, but it's up to you to do the research.
</P>
<P>
   Find out what promotions are available and ask for them, Simon
advised. Ask the company to extend a promotional rate for an extra
six months or to bump up the number of frequent-flier miles you're
getting.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they give rewards, you can ask for extras. You can ask that
fees be waived for a couple months,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The TRAC founder recently took his own advice. When he switched
long-distance companies, he asked his new carrier to pay the $5
switch fee. The company offered something better: 250 free minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to ask, `What other promotions do you have that I'd
qualify for? What else do you have?''' Simon suggested.
</P>
<P>
   But he also cautions that companies won't negotiate with
everyone. Don't expect much if you don't spend a lot on
long-distance calls. The more you spend, the more likely carriers
are to go out of their way to get or keep you as a customer.
</P>
<P>
   Suzan and Stewart Cochrane, a San Mateo couple spending $60 to
$80 a month on long-distance, were able to bargain for a better
deal after AT&AMP;T raised rates for calls to England. The Cochranes
call relatives there two or three times a week.
</P>
<P>
   The couple say they found out about the rate increase, from 12
cents to 15 cents a minute, when they received an unusually large
bill. Surprised, they called AT&AMP;T, which told them the rate change
had been published in the newspapers and that there wasn't anything
the company could do about it. The Cochranes switched to MCI, which
had offered them a 12-cent rate.
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, AT&AMP;T called and asked why they'd switched.
They explained _ and suddenly AT&AMP;T was able to restore their
12-cent rate. To sweeten the deal, the company tossed in a $100
check. AT&AMP;T has since lowered rates again, to 10 cents a minute.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't normally volunteer anything,'' said Suzan Cochrane.
``You just have to be bold enough to ask.''
</P>

 Looking for Mr. Goodbar? Try the Internet
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Deborah Solomon &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
With the rapid pace of area code changes across the country,
keeping track of friends and relatives is harder than ever.
</P>
<P>
   Some phone companies, realizing that they can capitalize on
people's desire to stay in touch, have started offering national
directory assistance for a fee.
</P>
<P>
   At a cost of about 95 cents per call, consumers can get one or
two phone listings for any city in the country, without having to
know the area code.
</P>
<P>
   But if paying a buck to find your Uncle Phil seems too steep,
there is a cheaper way _ the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of search engines have cropped up on the Web, offering
people a free way to find old college flames, long-lost friends and
relatives.
</P>
<P>
   But not all directory-assistance sites are equal.
</P>
<P>
   Some have a limited database and can be more frustrating than
fruitful. Others can give you listings for a person's 10 last-known
addresses and phone numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Two sites that stand out from the rest are 555-1212.com and
InfoSpace.com.
</P>
<P>
   Both are free and offer thorough white and yellow pages,
international directories and country codes.
</P>
<P>
   At 555-1212.com, users can look up area codes for any city in
the country. The site keeps up with new area codes and also offers
maps of the region a user is looking up.
</P>
<P>
   InfoSpace.com and 555-1212 also do reverse lookups, meaning that
if you only have a phone number, you can plug it in and find the
name and address to match. InfoSpace goes one step further,
offering ``celebrity searches.'' However, searches for David
Duchovny and Francis Ford Coppola produced no matches.
</P>
<P>
   Those who want to do a more thorough search on a person can tap
into InfoSpace's public records database. The site charges for the
information but provides users with bankruptcy records, liens,
lawsuits and credit information.
</P>
<P>
   Most search engines also offer their own directory assistance.
Both Excite and Yahoo have people searches, but the databases did
not produce results as thorough as some other sites.
</P>
<P>
   But these sites also offer to look up the e-mail address of the
person for whom you're searching, a handy tool to have.
</P>
<P>
   Hunting for businesses on the Web also is easier than trying to
figure out where they are based or find the right Yellow Pages for
the company's headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   At BigYellow.com, users can plug in a company's name and get a
listing of the corporation's business units. And rather than
getting a generic main number, clicking on the link brings up the
full name, phone number and address of that particular sector.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the sites are helpful and, if nothing else, offer a good
starting point for finding phone numbers. However, with the
availability of information on the Internet, there may no longer be
an excuse for not calling Uncle Phil.

 A Flat-Out Simpler Approach to Wireless Phone Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Deborah Solomon &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
The explosion of wireless phone companies may be great for
consumers, but it can also be awfully confusing.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the more than 59 wireless phone plans now available in
the Bay Area. There are plans for digital service and analog
service, with contracts and without contracts, with peak talk times
and off-peak talk times, with roaming fees or activation fees and a
sliding scale of per-minute rates. And that doesn't even take into
account choosing a phone.
</P>
<P>
   If it makes you dizzy, take heart: There may be a simpler way.
</P>
<P>
   Many cellular phone companies, such as AT&AMP;T Wireless, Sprint PCS
and GTE Wireless, now offer customers one rate for all calls,
regardless of where they're calling to and from. There are no
long-distance charges, and talking on your phone while traveling in
another city doesn't cost any extra.
</P>
<P>
   The trend, known as flat-rate pricing, is giving consumers a
cheaper way to make wireless phone calls and is helping carriers
attract more customers.
</P>
<P>
   Industry watchers say flat-rate pricing has evolved because
wireless companies finally are responding to consumers, who have
long complained about confusing plans, high per-minute rates and
exorbitant roaming fees for calls made while on the road.
</P>
<P>
   Getting rid of those costly fees has become the battle cry of
wireless carriers, who are struggling to convince customers that
cell phones are an affordable alternative to traditional
telephones.
</P>
<P>
   Unless a carrier has a nationwide network, it must pay other
wireless carriers hefty fees to handle calls outside its geographic
area so that customers can use their phones across the country. The
fees, known as roaming charges, are then passed on to wireless
customers at rates that can reach 60 cents per minute.
</P>
<P>
   Those fees have stopped many customers from using their phones
for more than local or emergency calls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers hate roaming charges,'' said Jeff Goldberg, editor
of WirelessDimension.com, a Web site that tracks cell phone plans
and helps consumers choose the best one. ``They don't understand
them, and the rates are fairly high.''
</P>
<P>
   But industry analysts expect roaming fees to soon go the way of
the rotary-dial phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a year or two, you won't be able to find roaming anymore,
and good riddance to it,'' Goldberg said.
</P>
<P>
   The death of roaming fees has come about largely because of
AT&AMP;T, which was the first company to announce a single rate for its
wireless service. The Digital One Rate plan, which is not available
in the Bay Area, has been siphoning off customers from Bell
Atlantic and other regional wireless carriers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although other companies made no roaming an option, last May
was the first time a carrier made this a standard feature,''
Goldberg said. ``It's been an astounding success for AT&AMP;T, and
other carriers almost had no choice but to follow suit.''
</P>
<P>
   The result is flat-rate pricing, which is available in the Bay
Area from GTE Wireless, Nextel, Sprint PCS and, on a limited basis,
through Cellular One, a joint partnership between AT&AMP;T and
AirTouch.
</P>
<P>
   For $30 to $160 a month, customers get a bucket of minutes they
can use anytime and anywhere. There is no distinction between local
and long-distance calls, with customers paying the same amount to
make a call at home in San Francisco and while on vacation in San
Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Although customers are paying a flat rate, the cost of the calls
usually boils down to between 10 cents per minute and 25 cents per
minute, depending on the plan.
</P>
<P>
   GTE Wireless, for example, offers nationwide rates ranging from
10 cents to 15 cents per minute. The plans cost between $95 per
month for 650 minutes of air-time to $155 per month for 1,500
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The company also has a flat-rate plan that applies only to
states west of the Mississippi. Rates range from $40 for 100
minutes to $140 for 1,550 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Cellular One offers flat-rate plans ranging from $50 for 300
minutes to $110 for 1,000 minutes, for calls made within
California. Depending on the plan, the cost per minute ranges from
11 cents to 17 cents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We took a look at our customers and found that the majority of
people who roam, roam within California,'' said Erin Eggleton, a
spokeswoman for Cellular One. ``We wanted to take this step first
and provide customers with a flat rate in California.''
</P>
<P>
   Because Cellular One does not have a nationwide network, it has
no immediate plans to do away with roaming fees outside California,
Eggleton said, but is continuing to look at partnerships with other
carriers.
</P>
<P>
   With Sprint PCS' Free and Clear Plan, customers pay about 10
cents per minute for calls nationwide. The plans cost between $70
and $150 for 600 to 1,500 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``With flat-rate pricing, you get better value and a plan that's
simple to understand,'' said Chip Graves, area vice president for
Sprint PCS. ``You know what your phone bill is going to be in
advance, and you never get charged for long-distance.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what attracted customers like Courtney Chan, who said he
wanted to know in advance what his monthly cell phone bill would
be. He also wanted to make long-distance calls without being
charged exorbitant per-minute rates.
</P>
<P>
   He signed up with Sprint PCS, and for $30 a month, Chan can make
120 minutes of calls, anytime and anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``The free long-distance is great; it's cheaper than my house
phone, so it's a great option,'' said Chan of San Francisco. ``I
use the phone a lot more than I did before. Calls that I wouldn't
have made before I make now.''
</P>
<P>
   But flat-rate pricing is not for everybody. While heavy users
and frequent travelers will benefit from these plans, those who use
their cell phones minimally and only at home actually could wind up
paying more for a flat-rate plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't roam, these national plans don't make a lot of
sense,'' Goldberg said. ``If you use the phone a lot during the
evening and on weekends, these plans are something you'd want to
look at.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the per-minute rates might seem cheap, consumer experts
warn that unless people use all the included minutes, they can wind
up paying a lot more than they would with a traditional plan.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, if a customer pays $95 for 650 minutes but uses
only 450 minutes per month, that person actually winds up paying 21
cents per minute, instead of 15 cents per minute.
</P>
<P>
   Because the average wireless consumer uses about 200 minutes per
month, the plans might not be best for the majority of people.
</P>
<P>
   To find out which plan may suit them, consumers can check out
 &LR; www.wirelessdimension.com.  &LR; The Web site, which is free, asks a
series of questions about customer preference and then recommends a
list of plans available in that customer's hometown.

GOLDMAN SACHS TO TAKE STAKE IN WIT CAPITAL 
</HEADLINE>
 (fb) 
 By EDWARD WYATT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Goldman Sachs Group, the venerable investment partnership that
is planning an initial offering of its shares to the public, said
on Monday that it will buy 22 percent of Wit Capital Group, a
pioneer in using the Internet to sell stocks to individual
investors.
</P>
<P>
   The investment, which comes as Wit Capital is preparing its own
initial public offering, joins two of Wall Street's more disparate
institutions and illustrates how the Internet has changed almost
everything about the way the securities industry does business.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman is the 130-year-old partnership that made its reputation
in large part by avoiding Wall Street fads; if it completes its
public offering as expected this spring, it will be the last of the
big Wall Street investment partnerships to go public.
</P>
<P>
   Wit Capital, in contrast, recently sprang from one of Wall
Street's more ill-fated and short-lived crazes, the fever for
publicly traded microbreweries. In 1996, Andrew D. Klein, a former
associate at the law firm Cravath, Swain &AMP; Moore, founded Wit
Capital to underwrite shares of the Spring Street Brewing Co.,
producer of Wit beer, a wheat-brewed spiced ale. Wit offered shares
of Spring Street directly to investors over the Internet and gave
them an electronic forum to trade the shares, presaging today's
frenzy for anything that can be sold over or linked to the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   In the three years since, Wit Capital has greatly expanded its
securities business, participating as a member of the underwriting
group in dozens of public stock offerings. In addition, its online
brokerage operation has about 20,000 customers, and it recently
hired a high-profile financial analyst from Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. to
head an equity research department to offer them research. Wit
Capital is also planning to start an after-hours, Internet-based
market for stock trading.
</P>
<P>
   People close to the transaction between Goldman and Wit said on
Monday, however, that Goldman's interest was primarily in Wit
Capital's ability to include individual investors in initial public
offerings, an ability that is particularly attractive to the many
Internet-related companies that in recent months have rushed to
sell their own shares to the public.
</P>
<P>
   As such, Goldman is not likely to try to exploit the link with
Wit for entree into the online stock brokerage business, these
people said. While online brokerage has grown rapidly in popularity
among individual investors, Goldman's client base is almost
exclusively made up of institutions, like pension and mutual funds,
and very wealthy individuals.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman will buy shares and equivalents representing about 22
percent of Wit's shares before the offering. Goldman would not
disclose how much it agreed to pay for the stake, which includes
warrants to buy shares at a price which has yet to be determined.
But a person close to the investment said that Goldman was likely
to own a stake that is similar in size to that of Capital Z
Partners, a venture capital firm that recently invested $25 million
in Wit Capital.
</P>
<P>
   Technology companies that operate Web sites catering to
consumers have shifted the balance of power among underwriters and
companies seeking to go public. Traditionally, the underwriters
placed shares of the hottest offerings almost exclusively in the
hands of their biggest institutional clients; any individuals who
wanted to invest in a newly public company had to wait until the
shares started trading, often at sharply higher prices.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, many Internet companies are requiring underwriters
who want their business to include an Internet company's most loyal
customers in the public offering. That has led to links between
traditional investment banks like Salomon Smith Barney and
BancBoston Robertson Stephens and electronic or discount brokers
like Fidelity Investments or E-Trade.
</P>
<P>
   Wit Capital's link with Goldman Sachs is therefore likely to
immeasurably raise its stature by giving it a part in Goldman's
generally high-profile deals. While Wit is only one of several
electronic brokerage firms that have linked with investment banks
to help place shares of initial public offerings in the hands of
individual investors, Goldman generally attracts more sought-after
clients.
</P>
<P>
   Wit Capital has recently served as the ``e-manager'' of several
high-profile public offerings, coordinating the distribution of
shares among individual investors of offerings by, among others,
Earthweb and Marketwatch.com.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman Sachs recently set up a committee to sort out the firm's
Internet strategy, which includes investments in Archipelago and
Optimark, electronic trading networks, and in a handful of Internet
start-up companies. While its negotiations with Wit gained speed
since that committee began its work, the talks have stretched over
a year, people involved in the transaction said.
</P>
<P>
   Wit Capital will soon reveal details about Goldman's investment
in a revised version of its initial offering statement, which it is
required to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission before
it completes its sale of shares to the public. While Goldman and
Capital Z are expected to own stakes of roughly equal size, Capital
Z also received the right to elect two members to the board of Wit
Capital. Goldman is not expected to nominate any directors for
Wit's board.

 Phone Firms _ One-Stop Shops
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Deborah Solomon &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
Americans love to buy things in bulk _ think Costco, Sam's Club,
Home Depot.
</P>
<P>
   Now phone companies are seizing on this affection for
``one-stop-shopping,'' offering customers a potpourri of products _
local, long-distance and wireless phone service, and sometimes
Internet access and cable TV service _ from a single provider and
itemized on a single bill.
</P>
<P>
   Phone companies say they can offer customers substantial
discounts on packages of telecom services, which offer come with a
single per-minute rate for all calls.
</P>
<P>
   The trend, known as ``bundling,'' is in its early stages, but
industry watchers expect it to explode.
</P>
<P>
   But while telecom companies say bundling will help simplify our
lives, there are potential drawbacks. Customers may have a harder
time comparing prices _ for example, someone who makes a lot of
calls to Canada but doesn't use a wireless phone might have a hard
time figuring out which package offers the best long-distance
price. And bundling actually could raise costs for customers who
don't embrace it, as companies increase charges for things such as
calling-card calls, long-distance and other services in an attempt
to push people toward bundles.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, phone companies are plugging along with the idea
that the more services they offer, the better, and industry
watchers say we better get used to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the new playing field,'' says Jeffrey Kagan, a
telecommunications analyst in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   In January, AT&AMP;T Corp. became one of the first nationwide
carriers to offer a bundled package of communications products for
a flat rate. With the Personal Network plan, customers pay $29.99
per month, plus 10 cents per minute, for all local, long-distance,
wireless and calling card calls, including those to Canada, the
United Kingdom and parts of Mexico. The plan also includes a
personal 800 number that rings at a customer's home phone. For
another $15 per month, customers can get their Internet service
through AT&AMP;T's WorldNet as well. Down the road, cable TV also will
be a part of the package for an additional fee.
</P>
<P>
   The plan offers a savings off what customers would pay if they
purchased all those services separately from AT&AMP;T. For instance,
customers who buy services a la carte pay a $4.95 flat fee in order
to get that 10-cents-per-minute rate, but that doesn't include
calls to Canada, the United Kingdom or Mexico, which cost more. And
without the Personal Network plan, calling-card calls are 25 cents
per minute and Internet service is an additional $19.90.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  The full plan is not available in the Bay Area because AT&AMP;T
does not have its own branded wireless product here. But customers
here can pay $10 a month and get 10 cents a minute on all local and
long-distance calls from their home phone, including those to
Canada, Mexico and the United Kingdom. For an additional $15, Bay
Area customers can add online service.
</P>
<P>
   And AT&AMP;T's announcement is just a foreshadowing of what's to
come.
</P>
<P>
   Companies such as Sprint Corp. and MCI WorldCom are developing
their own bundled packages that soon will allow local consumers to
get almost every telecom product conceivable from a single
provider.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  A New Jersey company called RCN Corp. is now laying fiber
optic cable around the Bay Area so that it can deliver a bundle of
local phone, long-distance, cable and Internet services to San
Francisco residents by the end of the year. And regional phone
companies, such as Pacific Bell, also plan to offer a package of
services including local, Internet, wireless and, eventually,
long-distance to customers.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of one-stop telecom shopping isn't new _ MCI tried it
several years ago with its MCI One plan, which combined
long-distance and other services on a single bill. But MCI was a
little ahead of the curve, reselling services to a public that
wasn't ready to embrace bundles, industry watchers said.
</P>
<P>
   Today, with so many providers vying for attention and with such
complicated pricing schemes, customers are looking for a simpler
and cheaper way to get their phone, cable and Internet service.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somewhere between 20 percent and 30 percent of customers want
the convenience of a single bill and a single point of contact,''
says Vince Tobkin, director of technology and telecommunications at
Bain &AMP; Co., a research firm in San Francisco. &UR;  &LR; ``Customers will buy
a bundle of services for that convenience.''
</P>
<P>
   Corporations have caught on and realized that customers who buy
a multitude of services from a single company are less likely to
leave that provider on a whim because they have a financial
incentive to stay.
</P>
<P>
   With plans like AT&AMP;T's Personal Network, customers are forced to
stick with the carrier for a multitude of services to get the best
rates. For example, the 10-cent rate only applies to customers who
get both their long-distance and wireless service from AT&AMP;T. That
makes it harder to leave when MCI comes dangling a carrot.
</P>
<P>
   And RCN, which already operates in Boston, New York and
Washington, D.C., offers customers discounts when they use more
than one RCN service. Customers who get $30-per-month cable service
from RCN get $3 off their bill if they add phone service and even
more of a discount with Internet service.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can get a customer using more than one of your
services, the chances of them leaving your company drops
dramatically,'' Kagan said. ``Companies make more money and get
`sticky' customer loyalty.''
</P>
<P>
   And the competition is getting fierce.
</P>
<P>
   Since the 1996 Telecommunications Act, which allowed cable,
local and long-distance companies to get into one another's
business, nearly a dozen mega-mergers have occurred in the
industry, spawning giant corporations capable of offering a wider
variety of services than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   Conventional wisdom is that during the next 10 years, a handful
of giant, global telecom providers will emerge, leaving the smaller
companies in the dust.
</P>
<P>
   ``The purpose of all of these mergers is to enable companies to
provide the broadest array of telecom services through any
medium,'' said industry consultant Herschel Shosteck. ``The winners
are going to be the companies that provide a full array of bundled
services, and in order to do that, they are going to have to be in
every dimension of telecom.''
</P>
<P>
   By joining forces, telecom companies are able to trim fat from
their combined operations and save money by itemizing every service
on a single bill. Companies are expected to pass those savings
along to consumers, giving customers a cheaper, easier way to get
telecom services.
</P>
<P>
   While prices probably will go down, bundling will make it harder
for customers to do comparison shopping.
</P>
<P>
   The migration to bundled services will happen largely because
companies will raise prices on a la carte services. Just this
month, AT&AMP;T announced a series of price increases on individual
services, such as calling-card calls. Although the company denies
that the increases have anything to do with the Personal Network
plan, analysts disagree.
</P>
<P>
   ``What AT&AMP;T is basically saying, and absolutely others will
follow, is `We are going to pass on economies of scale to
customers, but we are going to rationalize our pricing by
convincing customers to get services from us and only us,'''
Shosteck said. ``There are going to be increases in the prices for
separate services to encourage consumers to move to bundled
services.''
</P>
<P>
   Some consumer groups have expressed fears that this is unfair
and will force customers to buy services they don't want. The
Consumers Union in Washington, D.C., recently voiced concern that
bundling would recreate giant monopolies. But the companies say
customers will benefit from bundling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Customers like packaging or bundling for three reasons: They
like to buy stuff that works together ... they like it if it
enables them to get discounts, and they like it if the company is
easy to do business with,'' said Steve Dimmitt, Pacific Bell vice
president of consumer marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Dimmitt said Pac Bell already is experimenting with bundling,
offering customers discounts when they sign up for additional local
phone features, such as voice mail, Caller ID and call waiting. And
the company currently puts local phone and Internet service on the
same bill.
</P>
<P>
   Toward the end of this year _ assuming Pac Bell gets into
long-distance _ Dimmitt said the company plans to offer a bundled
package of local, long-distance, wireless and Internet service at a
discounted price.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trick here is to be flexible enough to give consumers
everything they want,'' Dimmitt said.

EDITORIAL: TERROR IN KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>
  (fb) 
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Tuesday, March 30:
</P>
<P>
   Slobodan Milosevic has answered six days of NATO aerial attack
with a vicious campaign of terror against the ethnic Albanians of
Kosovo, creating a military and refugee crisis of major
proportions. The United States and its European allies must respond
with alacrity on both fronts, while giving Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov of Russia a chance to seek a diplomatic settlement when he
travels to Belgrade on Tuesday. Since the end of the Cold War, NATO
has not faced a greater test of its unity or ability to react
effectively to a rapidly developing threat to European stability.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic's butchery in Kosovo was not caused by the bombing. It
began long before the air attacks commenced. It now calls for a
sharp escalation in NATO bombing, a step that the alliance started
to take on Monday as it turned its guns against Serbian army units
in Kosovo. Though air defense systems, airfields and other military
targets in northern and central Serbia must not be neglected, the
alliance should concentrate its attacks against Serbian forces that
are killing ethnic Albanians and burning their villages as they
sweep across Kosovo. If that requires further reinforcement of NATO
squadrons with additional U.S. warplanes and helicopters, President
Clinton should not hesitate to do so quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Intensified airstrikes may not bring the carnage to a halt, but
they can slow the Serbian offensive by disrupting supply lines,
knocking tanks and artillery out of service and scattering infantry
units. Any effort at this point to send arms to ethnic Albanian
guerrillas, an idea gaining support in Congress, would be unwise.
These forces lack the training to deal with the Serbian army and it
would take weeks to get the arms to them.
</P>
<P>
   Pressure is building in Washington to dispatch NATO ground
troops to Kosovo, including Americans. Clinton should resist this
option. The NATO air campaign must be given time to work before
other tactics are considered. Assembling a large enough ground
force to seize control of Kosovo _ as many as 200,000 troops might
be required _ would take several weeks or more, making the option
unsuitable for the immediate crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Much can be done to help care for the tens of thousands of
refugees pouring across Kosovo's borders into neighboring Albania,
Macedonia and Montenegro. Washington has pledged an initial $8.5
million to international agencies working in the region and on
Monday was scrambling to make additional resources available.
Money, food and medicine are desperately needed. NATO military
forces may be needed in Albania to build temporary shelters and to
provide food and clothing.
</P>
<P>
   Primakov's mission to Belgrade may yield nothing, but he should
be given a chance to see if Milosevic is prepared to accept a
diplomatic solution. There need be no bombing pause outside
Belgrade while the Russian leader is there, but NATO forces will
have to hold their fire over the Serbian capital itself while
Primakov is visiting. NATO must either bend Milosevic to accept the
international peace agreement or destroy his capacity to terrorize
the people of Kosovo, kill their leaders and drive them from their
land.

 Phone calls over cable TV lines are a cheaper alternative
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Deborah Solomon &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
Antonio Randolph is kneeling outside a home in Orange County's
Aliso Viejo, splicing a long, thick piece of cable.
</P>
<P>
   Randolph, a cable technician for Cox Communications, connects
the end of the spliced wire to a cream-colored plastic box that
he's attached to the side of the house.
</P>
<P>
   Within minutes, a red light on the box begins flashing and
Randolph smiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have dial tone,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   With a few splices, tugs and screws, Randolph has done something
monumental: He has brought competition to the local phone market by
getting a cable TV line to do double duty as a phone line.
</P>
<P>
   Here, in Aliso Viejo and neighboring parts of Orange County,
Randolph and his fellow Cox Communications technicians are blurring
the line between cable TV and telephone service.
</P>
<P>
   Customers in these Southern California communities are among the
first in the nation to get their dial tone over cable TV
lines. &UR;  &LR; The same wires that bring them HBO and CNN now allow them
to call relatives and friends across the world.
</P>
<P>
   The technology is known as cable telephony, and it soon will be
coming to a channel near you.
</P>
<P>
   A True Alternative
</P>
<P>
   During the next year, AT&AMP;T Corp. will work with
Tele-Communications Inc. to test and deliver cable telephony in the
Bay Area. When it's up and running, it will be one of the first
true alternatives to Pacific Bell for local phone service.
</P>
<P>
   Already, the idea of competition is attracting customers in Cox
territory. With lower monthly prices for phone lines &UR;  &LR; and with
cheap local and long-distance rates, Cox already has attracted
33,000 cable telephony customers _ about 15 percent of the
customers in the 17 Orange County communities where it offers cable
service.
</P>
<P>
   The popularity of the product is evident to anyone who walks
into the Cox office in Aliso Viejo. Technicians are scrambling
around, picking up equipment and checking in with supervisors
before heading out to install telephone service.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been really popular,'' said Randolph, who does between
four and five installations a day. ``Most people say they're happy
to have a choice. And they know Cox is a good company with good
customer service, so they're eager to get service from us.''
</P>
<P>
   Cox, TCI and other cable TV firms can offer cable telephony as a
result of the 1996 Telecommunications Act, which lifted
restrictions and allowed cable and telephone companies to dip into
each others' business. Since the law was passed, the companies have
spent billions of dollars to upgrade their cable lines and develop
technology to deliver local and long-distance phone service.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T, which recently merged with TCI, doesn't have a firm start
date for its cable telephone service, but officials say they'll
spend 1999 upgrading and testing the system in 10 cities across the
nation.
</P>
<P>
   One of those trials is going on in Fremont, where a handful of
TCI employees quietly are testing the phone service over the
company's cable TV lines.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry DiFrancisco, AT&AMP;T's executive vice president of wireline
telephony, said the company is hesitant to name a start date
because AT&AMP;T wants to make sure the product is flawless before
offering it to customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real challenge is how do we build the infrastructure and
bring tens of millions of customers onto the network,'' he said.
``We don't want to introduce it and say we can only accommodate
several hundred customers.''
</P>
<P>
   And it takes time before the system is ready to go. Cox, which
began offering phone service about a year and a half ago, still is
not able to offer it to all customers. Officials say they are
rolling it out slowly as they upgrade the system, construct the
proper infrastructure and hire technicians to install the service.
</P>
<P>
   Each installation can take anywhere from 45 minutes to two
hours, meaning technicians can do only a few per day.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh1  &LR; How It Works
</P>
<P>
   To make cable telephony work, cable companies must install new
equipment at their main offices and at the customer's house.
</P>
<P>
   With Cox's product, the company has installed voice processors
in its head-end facility _ the building where all the signals are
processed. Those processors convert the telephone and voice signal
sent over the cable lines to a radio frequency that can be
transmitted over a voice network.
</P>
<P>
   At the customer's house, technicians such as Randolph must
install new coaxial cable, which is capable of sending and
receiving data, along with a voice port, which powers the telephone
service.
</P>
<P>
   The cream-colored box, which is known as a network interface
unit, is what enables customers to talk over their cable lines. It
converts the phone call from a radio frequency, which is what cable
TV uses, to a telephone signal.
</P>
<P>
   The NIU is then attached to the home's inside wiring, allowing
customers to use their existing telephones and wall jacks for cable
telephone service. Cable telephony works just like regular phone
service; the only difference is that instead of telephone wires
carrying the call, underground cables are routing it through.
</P>
<P>
   So far, customers seem to like the service, especially the
price. AT&AMP;T hasn't disclosed its pricing for TCI's service, but
Cox's rates are significantly less than Pac Bell's.
</P>
<P>
   A single phone line costs $10 a month, and additional lines are
$5 per month. Pac Bell charges $11.25 per month for every phone
line.
</P>
<P>
   Cox also offers cheap rates for local toll and long-distance
calls. Within California, toll calls are 5 cents per minute and
long-distance calls are 10 cents per minute. Customers are not
required to use Cox as their long-distance provider and can choose
other carriers like AT&AMP;T or MCI.
</P>
<P>
   Cheaper Service Deal
</P>
<P>
   Like TCI, Cox also offers the AtHome cable-modem service, which
allows people to access the Internet over their cable lines at fast
speeds.
</P>
<P>
   Being able to provide all these products means customers can get
their local, long-distance, cable TV and Internet service from a
single company and for a cheaper price.
</P>
<P>
   The ability to provide local phone service and give consumers
``one-stop shopping'' is what's driving AT&AMP;T to offer telephony via
TCI's lines. Companies want to be able to capture and keep as many
customers as they can, something that's made easier when consumers
are getting all their services from one provider.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a critical part of AT&AMP;T's strategy for the future,''
DiFrancisco said. ``It's clear that the world is changing ... and
this is AT&AMP;T's way of blending together any service _ local,
long-distance, video, entertainment and Internet access.''
</P>
<P>
   DiFrancisco said the company hopes to attract 20 to 30 percent
of local phone customers in the Bay Area to its cable telephony
product. In addition to TCI, AT&AMP;T also has signed a deal with Time
Warner cable, which offers service in parts of Southern California
and on the East Coast, and is working on other agreements,
DiFrancisco said.
</P>
<P>
   Courting Customers
</P>
<P>
   But whether customers will bite remains to be seen. Although the
Cox rollout is viewed by many as a success, there still are a lot
of customers who have not and will not make the switch.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a huge power of incumbency, and consumer inertia is a
very powerful tool,'' said Bruce Leichtman, director of media and
entertainment strategies for the Yankee Group, a Boston research
firm.
</P>
<P>
   While some people already have made the switch, they are the
``low-hanging fruit,'' Leichtman said _ the customers who were
ready to jump to almost any competitor.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the market might not be as easily swayed, Leichtman
said, particularly because it will take a long time before cable
telephony is widely available.
</P>
<P>
   ``First, you have to build it and make it available. The next
part of it is, once it is built, will customers (adopt) it? That
remains to be seen,'' he said. ``To the consumer, it's not about
what the provider can provide, it's about what the customer wants.
It's going to be a challenge, but the AT&AMP;T name on the phone will
help a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Some customers, like Remus Rafols of Aliso Viejo, already are
convinced of cable telephony's appeal.
</P>
<P>
   As Randolph installed a phone line in Rafols' bedroom, Rafols
smiled as he recounted what the incumbent provider told him about
getting a phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pac Bell told me I couldn't get a third line in the house
without permission from the residential association,'' said Rafols,
who shares the house with seven other people. ``So the owner told
me to go to Cox. They said it was no problem and it's even cheaper.
I like the idea of getting my phone from Cox because they are a
good cable company.''
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T officials say they hope to seize on some of that same
frustration in the Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
   ``With AT&AMP;T's brand image, we feel we'll have an attractive
product to offer,'' DiFrancisco said. ``Everybody wants a choice.''

 Toll-Free Numbers Make It Easy to Stay in Touch
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Carolyn Said &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Everyone know that making a phone call to an 800 number is free.
But not everyone knows that it's easy to get your own 800 number _
also for free.
</P>
<P>
   Long-distance companies now routinely offer personal 800 numbers
_ toll-free numbers that ring at a regular home phone _ to their
residential customers with no extra monthly fees. In fact, one
long-distance firm, MCI WorldCom, hands out toll-free numbers to
each and every one of its residential customers _ about 20 percent
of the 100 million U.S. households.
</P>
<P>
   For people who want family and friends to be able to reach them
easily, or who are on the road a lot, a personal 800 number is
cheap and convenient. The toll-free numbers can be called from
anywhere in the United States. The customer's only cost is the
per-minute rate for incoming calls _ at most about 15 cents to 35
cents a minute. Often, customers pay just their regular
long-distance rate, which can be as low as 10 cents a minute.
</P>
<P>
   For parents of college kids, a personal 800 number provides a
direct link with the dorm room.
</P>
<P>
   ``It adds an extra element of control,'' said Charlie Sutlive, a
spokesman for MCI WorldCom. ``If a child goes off to college with a
calling card, they can use it to call anyone. If you give them your
personal 800 number, you know they can only use it to call you.''
</P>
<P>
   Stefani Rose, a political science major at St. Mary's College in
Moraga, said her parents' toll-free number means she can call home
frequently, even if she just has a quick question to ask.
</P>
<P>
   The toll-free number proved invaluable a couple of weeks ago,
when Stefani and some friends went skiing at Sugar Bowl and one of
them hit a tree. During the lengthy wait in the Truckee emergency
room, none of the students had any change or a phone card to make
calls. Rather than hassling with calling collect (which is possible
only when someone is home on the other end), Rose called her family
in Oregon on their 800 number.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the numbers help elderly relatives stay in touch.
``You can give the number to your grandparents or parents who may
be on a fixed income so they don't have to worry about spending
their money to call you,'' said telecom analyst Jeffrey Kagan.
``It's cheaper than calling collect.''
</P>
<P>
   Stefani's father, Robert Rose, an appraiser in Medford, Ore.,
said: ``Having an 800 number is like a little gift for my mother
and daughter to help them keep in touch without having to pay for
the call.''
</P>
<P>
   People who travel a lot find that having a personal 800 number
can cut down on exorbitant hotel phone bills. ``You can't beat it
for calling home from the road,'' said Kagan. ``Calling
long-distance from your hotel room is the biggest rip-off there
is.'' Most hotels charge a flat $1 rate for calls to toll-free
numbers but tack on 30 percent or higher surcharges for
long-distance calls.
</P>
<P>
   A personal toll-free number can be more secure than a calling
card number that you have to punch in at a public location. ``If
someone is shoulder-surfing you at an airport phone booth, they
won't be able to steal the number and make long-distance calls with
it _ the worst they can do is use it to call your house,'' said
Fred Voit, senior analyst with the Yankee Group in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Personal 800 numbers aren't suitable for businesses: Usually,
you don't get to pick your number, so there's no clever mnemonic
like CALLMOI to help customers remember it. Because the pool of 800
numbers is drying up fast, companies like AT&AMP;T and MCI WorldCom
actually assign you an 800 (or 888, 877 or other toll-free prefix)
number along with a unique four-digit PIN that identifies you. That
way, they can put 9,999 customers on a single 800 number. (Sprint,
however, gives its residential customers a toll-free number that
works without a PIN.)
</P>
<P>
   A business is better off paying a little extra for a ``regular''
toll-free number that doesn't require punching in an extra four
digits.
</P>
<P>
   Toll-free numbers have come a long way since their introduction
in 1967. They started as special, dedicated lines that corporations
paid big bucks to install and use. In the late '80s, toll-free
numbers became available through regular phone lines, leading to an
explosion in use by small and medium-sized businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Phone companies started offering personal 800 numbers to
residential customers several years ago but usually charged an
installation fee, a monthly fee and slightly higher per-minute
rates.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, phone companies dropped the set-up and monthly
fees, aligned the per-minute rates with their regular rates and
made personal 800 numbers an integral part of their service
packages.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T, which has 60 percent of the market, offers personal 800
numbers through several plans, including its new Personal Network
plan, a bundle of local, long-distance, wireless and toll-free
service, all for 10 cents a minute.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, many customers don't realize that they can easily
get their own toll-free number through their long-distance company.
</P>
<P>
   A survey in October by the Yankee Group found that 13.5 percent
of MCI customers knew they had an 800 number _ even though the
figure should have been 100 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts say awareness and use should soar as cost-savvy
customers are learning to shop around and analyze phone service
features.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market is more ready for it today than ever,'' Kagan said.
`Customers are used to 10-10-321 and other (dial-around services).
Marketing of telephone services has become hot. All of a sudden,
toll-free service is positioned to take its place among marketing
successes like dial-around.''
</P>
<P>
   As Robert Rose put it: ``When you leave a message for someone to
call you back, if it's your dime, they'll call you back a lot
quicker.''

<HEADLINE>
AT YALE, STAFF ON TENURE TRACK IS TEACHING LESS, A STUDY SAYS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Nev.)   (nk) 
 By KAREN W. ARENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Universities across the country are increasingly using graduate
students and adjunct faculty to replace more expensive tenure-track
professors, and a new study by graduate students at Yale suggests
that better-endowed universities are no exception.
</P>
<P>
   The study by Yale University's graduate student teachers' union,
released Monday, said that Yale has made growing use of both
graduate students and nontenure-track faculty in educating its
undergraduates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone knows a lot of faculty are not putting in a lot of
face time with undergraduates, and this confirms it,'' said Antony
Dugdale, a graduate student in religion and a member of the
Graduate Employees and Students Organization at Yale that produced
the study. He said the study ``shows that the problem is much
deeper than we thought.''
</P>
<P>
   Any shrinkage in tenure-track positions reduces the chance that
graduate students like Dugdale will be able to find permanent
teaching jobs with tenure after they earn their Ph.D.'s.
</P>
<P>
   A Yale official said Monday that he could not immediately say
whether the conclusions in the study were correct. But the
official, Tom Conroy, deputy director of public affairs, said Yale
did not think the study was a fair portrayal of teaching at the
university.
</P>
<P>
   Still, James Richardson, the president of the American
Association of University Professors, said the study confirmed his
sense that elite universities were part of a ``very disturbing''
national trend away from using tenure-track professors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is odd that Yale sits on such a huge endowment and yet
chooses not to increase the number of faculty,'' said Richardson,
who is also a professor of sociology and judicial studies at the
University of Nevada at Reno.
</P>
<P>
   The graduate students' study concluded that full-time
tenure-track faculty taught only 30 percent of Yale's classes,
while adjunct instructors and graduate students taught the other 70
percent, if all classes were counted equally: large lectures,
discussion sections of lectures, regular classes and small
seminars.
</P>
<P>
   The number of graduate-student teachers jumped to more than
1,000 in 1997 from 778 in 1980, even as the number of tenure-track
faculty dipped slightly, to 653 from 688, according to the study.
The number of undergraduates was roughly constant during this
period.
</P>
<P>
   Conroy faulted the study for grouping graduate students with
nontenure-track faculty, who, he said, typically have Ph.D.'s and
may be retired Yale professors or distinguished visiting faculty.
</P>
<P>
   But John Mack Faragher, a Yale history professor, said that the
study accurately captured the decline in the role of tenure-track
faculty.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have allowed ourselves as an institution to get into
terrible trouble,'' he said.

 Using Your Computer to Make Phone Calls
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By David Einstein &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
Want to save money on international telephone calls? Forget the big
carriers, whose rate structures would make a cryptographer dizzy.
</P>
<P>
   The hippest way to talk to someone overseas is to place a
telephone call using your PC. You can reach phones almost anywhere
in the world by using PC-to-phone technology, and the person at the
receiving end probably won't know the call is coming from a
computer.
</P>
<P>
   In most cases, PC-generated calls to far-off places are less
expensive than regular phone calls. For 10 cents a minute, you can
talk to someone in Western Europe. Japan can be called for less
than 20 cents a minute. And you can make that hotel reservation in
Fiji for under $1 a minute.
</P>
<P>
   You also can place calls to phones within the United States
using your computer, but that's not a money-saving proposition.
Daytime PC-to-phone calls cost about 15 cents a minute whether the
call is local or long-distance.
</P>
<P>
   About the only reason to place a domestic call from your PC is
if you want to talk to a customer representative at an Internet
shopping site. Increasingly, online retailers are providing links
that let you have a conversation with a live person.
</P>
<P>
   To place a PC-to-phone call, you need a software program known
as a dialer, a microphone to talk into and a PC speaker for hearing
the person on the other end of the line. (The most convenient
solution is a headset with a built-in microphone.)
</P>
<P>
   You also need an account with a company that can take calls from
your PC and connect them to a phone. Several companies both provide
the necessary software (for free) and handle your calls for you.
Two of the most popular are Net2Phone  &LR; (www.net2phone.com)  &LR; and
Delta Three &LR;  (www.deltathree.com) &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   Here's how a PC-to-phone call works:
</P>
<P>
   _When you place a call, your speech is digitized and compressed,
then transported over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   _When the digitized signal nears its destination, a special
``gateway'' operated by the company handling the call changes it so
that it can be recognized by an ordinary phone. The call is then
completed through local phone lines.
</P>
<P>
   _When the person on the phone talks, the process of converting
the signal is reversed, sending it back to your PC.
</P>
<P>
   Despite having to go through all that, voices come through loud
and clear. With most PC-to-phone systems, the sound quality is just
as good as a regular phone call.
</P>
<P>
   There is one catch, however. If your Internet connection isn't
fast enough, there can be delays in the signal that will make you
think you're talking to somebody on the moon. A 56K modem is barely
adequate for PC-to-voice, and to make it really shine, you need a
high-speed connection using a cable modem, DSL or a T1 line.
</P>
<P>
   PC-to-phone technology isn't the first stab at using the
Internet as a telephone system. For several years, it's been
possible to conduct voice conversations between two PCs. That
hasn't really caught fire, however, despite the fact that you can
talk to anyone in the world in this way with no long-distance
charges whatsoever.
</P>
<P>
   PC-to-PC phoning, it turns out, has some pretty significant
drawbacks. It's terribly inconvenient because both the caller and
the person receiving the call must have the same telephony software
installed on their computers. What's more, the person getting the
call must be online and ready to accept it when it comes in.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem is that there is no way for anyone to make money
on PC-to-PC calls, which transmit your voice over the Internet just
as if it were e-mail. Without a profit motive, there has been no
rush to standardize PC-to-PC software and make it really universal.
</P>
<P>
   PC-to-phone calls, by comparison, represent a promising source
of revenue for companies that route the calls between the Internet
and the telephone system.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, during the next few years, all the major long-distance
carriers are expected to shift large segments of their business
from standard telephone lines to the main pipelines that run the
Internet. When that happens, international phone calls may become
so cheap that the PC-to-phone system will offer no cost advantage.

AN ARM IS WORTH MORE THAN A WIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By VINCENT BONSIGNORE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The kid was pitching a one-hitter in Chaminade
High School's season opener. It was the fifth inning, and he
appeared just as strong now as he did to start the game.
</P>
<P>
   The easy thing would have been to let him finish the game. He
earned it, it was his game. Why shouldn't the sophomore close it
out, maybe have a nice memory to look back on?
</P>
<P>
   But a rule is a rule, and Jason Urquidez had reached his
team-imposed maximum pitch count. Even if Urquidez was throwing a
perfect game, it wouldn't have changed Eagles coach Scott Drootin's
thinking.
</P>
<P>
   It was time to take him out.
</P>
<P>
   Of course Urquidez was upset when Drootin came to the mound and
took the ball away.
</P>
<P>
   But Drootin didn't budge. He has a pitch count to protect his
pitchers, not stand in the way of their glory.
</P>
<P>
   ``You talk to the kid and hope he understands you're looking out
for his best interest,'' Drootin said. ``I told him he was pitching
a great game, but that it wasn't worth throwing any more pitches
and risking injury. Maybe later in the year, when he's stronger and
the weather is warmer, it would be different. But I've got to look
out for the kid.''
</P>
<P>
   It's nice to know somebody was. Three years ago, when Chicago
Cubs phenom Kerry Wood was pitching for Grand Prairie High during
the Texas State Playoffs, that wasn't the case.
</P>
<P>
   On the day Grand Prairie won the state championship, Wood
pitched all seven innings in the first game of a doubleheader and,
after a 30-minute break, pitched two innings of the second game.
More disturbing was Wood's pitch count _ a staggering 175.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, Grand Prairie won the title and Wood proved he was
Superman, but at what cost? Less than four years later he's got an
elbow ligament so mangy it might take all of this year and next
until he's able to throw a ball again. Whether he regains that
97-mph fastball won't be know for awhile.
</P>
<P>
   It's not certain if Wood's current troubles started in high
school, but the Cubs were disturbed enough with his nine-inning
performance that they practically shut him down after signing him.
The Cubs limited Wood to 71/3 innings of professional ball that
summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's how serious injuries occur,'' general manager Ed Lynch
said at the time of coach Mike McGilvray's decision. ``I'm sure
that, counting warm-ups, he threw over 300 pitches. It's beyond
belief that the coach would risk his future. That's very
short-termed thinking. We're very concerned with this.''
</P>
<P>
   McGilvray defends his use of Wood, even the 175-pitch marathon
in the playoffs. During 14 games that year, Wood pitched 72
innings, and rarely pitched more than five innings per start. In
addition, he pitched just one game per week and was regularly
monitored by a former college trainer.
</P>
<P>
   As far as McGilvray is concerned, the Cubs are making him a
scapegoat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody wants to point to that one day,'' McGilvray said.
``But prior to that, we treated Kerry with kid gloves and took
every imaginable precaution. I can see if we used him like that on
a consistent basis, then we're talking about a problem. But it was
one day.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, but 175 pitches for a 17-year-old in one day is simply
too much. And is it a coincidence that that less than a year later
while pitching at Single-A Daytona, Wood went on the disabled list
with elbow soreness?
</P>
<P>
   RISKY DECISIONS
</P>
<P>
   What would you do if you desperately needed to win one game, but
your best pitcher wasn't 100 percent or was showing signs of
fatigue?
</P>
<P>
   For Scott Muckey, it's a simple question with an equally
uncomplicated answer. ``There isn't a championship out there worth
a kid's arm,'' said Muckey, Crespi High's veteran coach.
</P>
<P>
   What if you had a once-in-a-lifetime talent like Wood, so
dominant it seemed unfair when he faced high school batters.
Wouldn't you want to use him as much as possible, as much as the
rules allowed?
</P>
<P>
   Not if it meant even remotely jeopardizing Wood's future,
according to Muckey.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the kid has a chance to make a lot of money, I'm not going
to stand in the way of that,'' Muckey said.
</P>
<P>
   For Muckey, and other area coaches, the thought of letting one
pitcher throw a complete game, then two innings of another on the
same day is so outrageous, it's not even worth considering. They
understand a high school coach is burdened with two priorities, and
how important it is to keep them in the proper order. The first is
to develop and protect players. The second is to win games.
</P>
<P>
   For pitchers, coaches use safeguards such as pitch counts,
studying mechanics to easier determine fatigue levels, bullpen work
on off-days and conditioning. They also get to know their players,
because each pitcher is different, each arm unique.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some guys bounce back quicker than others, and guys have
different pain thresholds,'' Muckey said. ``As a coach, you need to
know that stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   At Chatsworth, Tom Meusborn has a simple rule: If a pitcher is
hurt, tired or just sore, he doesn't play.
</P>
<P>
   Period.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't get talked out of many things,'' Meusborn said. ``And
in this case, it's pretty clear how I feel. Look, we appreciate
your competitiveness and it's great that you want to play. But we
also want to look out for you and always remember the big
picture.''
</P>
<P>
   California high schools operate under the 10-inning maximum
rule, which means individual pitchers can't throw more than 10
innings per week. When Wood pitched in both games in 1995, he was
still one-inning short of Texas' high school limit for one day. So,
technically, McGilvray was within the rules. But to allow a pitcher
to throw that many pitches on the same day is absurd.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly wouldn't think of doing that,'' Muckey said. ``You
need to be careful, and we as coaches need to know better than to
do that. I've always said that, when in doubt, less is always
better.''

DOW TOPS 10,000 MARK   AND STAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIMBERLY BLANTON AND ROSS KERBER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The stock market rose above the 10,000-point
milestone Monday and stayed there, finally breaking a barrier that
has come to symbolize a remarkable period of prosperity for the
country.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in its history, the Dow Jones industrial
average finished the day above 10,000, closing at 10,006.78, up
184.54 points, after weeks of flirting with the mark. Even as NATO
bombs fell on Yugoslavia, investors _ energized by merger talks
between BP Amoco PLC and Atlantic Richfield Co., which drove up oil
company shares, and by huge gains in blue-chip technology stocks _
drove the market upward.
</P>
<P>
   While the day's event represented only a 1.9 percent increase in
the Dow, the index has risen more than 7,000 points this decade. On
April 17, 1991, when the Dow broke 3000 for the first time, the
economy began what would become the longest-running peacetime
expansion in US history.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been fantasy land for investors,'' said Ned Riley, chief
investment officer for BankBoston Corp. The average yearly return
in the 1990s, about 20 percent, is double the yearly average return
over the past 70 years.
</P>
<P>
   Experts cautioned the Dow could fall back below 10,000 Tuesday.
But Monday's trading was big news on Wall Street, which lately has
marked time _ and profits _ in increments of 1,000 points.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, the greater significance of the market's new high,
however, may be what it portends for the future, investment experts
said.
</P>
<P>
   The 10,000 level ``is a deceptive number,'' said Thomas O'Neill,
chief investment officer of Fleet Financial Group. Though the index
overall is at a new high, the majority of stocks have sunk in
recent months. Many money managers are concerned that the market
may not continue at its present rate of growth.
</P>
<P>
   Harry Laubscher, a veteran market analyst who works at Tucker
Anthony Inc. in New York, said the soaring Dow masks weakness in
most stocks. That's because money managers, when in doubt, invest
in the large and profitable firms that make up the index like
pharmaceutical giant Merck &AMP; Co., General Electric Co. and Walt
Disney Co.
</P>
<P>
   If the market rally doesn't broaden to include other stocks,
Fleet's O'Neill said, ``it won't be a healthy long-term condition''
that would suggest strong future growth.
</P>
<P>
   But Monday's rally went well beyond the Dow. The Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 index, a broader market indicator, had a stronger day,
gaining 2.13 percent, compared with the Dow's 1.88 percent rise.
The S&AMP;P 500 added 27.37 points, closing at 1310.17.
</P>
<P>
   The technology-heavy Nasdaq rose even more, gaining 3.05
percent, or 73.67 points, to 2492.84.
</P>
<P>
   The old-fashioned Dow, which has few technology stocks, is no
longer a reliable gauge of the market, analysts said. For example,
Microsoft Corp., which trades on the Nasdaq but is the nation's
most successful computer company, is not among the 30 stocks that
make up the index.
</P>
<P>
   The true start of the current bull market can be traced back to
1982 when a market rally was sparked by falling interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   After a bear market for much of the 1970s, the Dow climbed past
1000 for the first time on Nov. 14, 1972, and crashed in October
1987. But, the Dow recovered and soared, breaking through 3000 in
1991; 4000 and 5000 in 1995; 6000 in 1996; 7000 and 8000 in 1997,
breaking through 9000 on April 6, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street cheered as the Dow reached its milestone, after two
weeks of watching it rise above 10,000 briefly, only to dip below
it. Monday's rally came on the heels of a 169.5-point rise Thursday
and a small decline Friday. The day's activity brought more ups and
downs: The market rose above 10,000 around 2:30 p.m., fell below it
for a time and broke through to trade above it during the final
hour before trading halted at 4 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing stocks on the New York Stock Exchange led decliners by
1,829 to 1,127.
</P>
<P>
   ``At last, we made it _ a new record,'' said Marshall Acuff,
stock strategist for Salomon Smith Barney in New York. ``We
certainly have been working on it. It took a while in coming, but
we did it.''
</P>
<P>
   The gains were the result of a confluence of positive factors.
News that BP Amoco and Atlantic Richfield were in merger talks
signaled that other deals could follow in the struggling oil
industry, driving up the market.
</P>
<P>
   Atlantic Richfield stock rose 8 11/16, closing at 74 1/16.
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks also had a good day, continuing recent strong
performance. IBM gained 5 3/16, closing at 177 9/16, and Sun
Microsystems rose 8, to 124 1/2. Intel rose 4 3/4, closing at 121
7/16.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is the psychological factor of a 10,000 target.
``Ten thousand has acted as kind of a magnet, bringing stocks up to
that level,'' said Bill Morton, chief executive of the Boston Stock
Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   In itself, the Dow's high closing price had little significance.
The higher the market gets, the less numeric import can be
attributed to each increase of 1,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big deal because people think it's a big deal,'' said
Samuel Hayes, a finance professor at Harvard Business School.

RUSSIA'S ROLE GROWS   WITH PEACE EFFORT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Just a week ago, Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov ordered his Washington-bound plane turned around after he
learned that NATO intended to bomb Yugoslavia despite Moscow's
objections.
</P>
<P>
   The midflight U-turn seemed to sum up how little Russia's
opinion meant when NATO had serious business to do. But after a
week of massive NATO bombardments, Serb defiance, and harsh
criticism from Moscow, Russia is suddenly relevant again.
</P>
<P>
   No one in the US-led alliance will be ignoring Primakov when the
Russian premier, bolstered by the promise of a new loan from the
International Monetary Fund and the backing of NATO members France
and Italy, leaves Tuesday for urgent peace talks in Belgrade with
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Primakov's mission could produce a breakthrough in the Kosovo
crisis _ or deal the Clinton administration a devastating blow by
exploiting cracks that have appeared in the alliance. That depends
on whether Primakov can get Milosevic to sign a peace agreement
ending the Serb offensive and reported atrocities against ethnic
Albanians in Kosovo, and under what conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think his mission is . . . very welcome by Clinton
officials, but they are also very nervous,'' said Michael McFaul,
of the Washington-based Carnegie Endowment for Peace. ``A real
concern for the Clinton administration is that Primakov is in the
driver's seat, and that allows him to draft his own terms.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia was part of the six-nation Contact Group that mediated
between the Serbs and Kosovo's ethnic Albanians before the the
bombings began, and Russia encouraged Yugoslavia to sign an
agreement that would give Kosovo autonomy. But both Russia and
Yugoslavia, traditional allies who share Orthodox Christian
religion and a Slavic ethnic identity, oppose stationing NATO
troops in Kosovo to implement the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   One concern for US officials is that Primakov might make a deal
with Milosevic that substitutes European monitors for NATO troops,
something France and Italy, under domestic pressure to end the
airstrikes, might be willing to approve.
</P>
<P>
   That would put the Clinton administration ``in an awkward
position,'' McFaul said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Russia has issued harsh daily criticism of NATO's
airstrikes, it has made mostly symbolic moves, such as suspending
contact with NATO, while avoiding any action that could
significantly affect relations with the West.
</P>
<P>
   Russian analysts credit this tactic to Primakov, the wily former
intelligence chief, who has slowly consolidated power since his
surprise appointment to prime minister in September. Primakov's
Cold War rhetoric, accompanied by protests across the political
spectrum, in the media, and in the street, has raised the question
of whether the West underestimated Russia's reaction to the
bombing.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Primakov's anti-Western posture has left the
Russians in a position to travel to Belgrade as a friend while
leaving Moscow the option of trying to pressure Milosevic to
approve a political solution NATO would find acceptable. Such a
solution would be a major diplomatic coup for Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Primakov has intervened this way in the past, most successfuly
early last year when, as Russia's foreign minister, he extracted
last-minute concessions on arms inspection from Saddam Hussein to
halt planned US airstrikes against Iraq. Both Primakov and US
leaders took credit for the last-minute breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
   Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov, who will accompany
Primakov along with Russia's defense, intelligence, and foreign
policy chiefs, sought to show that Tuesday's trip to Belgrade was a
purely Russian initiative. He said Moscow had not asked NATO to
halt its daily airstrikes on the Serb capital during the talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going there not to save face for anyone, but to stop
aggression,'' Ivanov said in a news conference. Privately, Russian
officials say they are confident that a positive outcome could
indeed save face for NATO.
</P>
<P>
   Primakov's trip appeared likely to further upstage President
Boris N. Yeltsin, who was planning to use his annual address to
parliament as a forum to denounce NATO's attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin had sent a delegation of three leading liberal
politicians to Belgrade on Sunday. Primakov announced his trip
after Milosevic declined to meet with the trio.
</P>
<P>
   Primakov got another boost Monday when the IMF agreed in
principle to extend a loan to help Russia pay off billions of
dollars in foreign debt. The new loan, reportedly worth $4.8
billion, is a victory for Primakov, as the IMF had suspended a $22
billion aid package to Russia after the country's financial crash
in August.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, the IMF and the Clinton administration had demanded
proof that Primakov had a plan to reform Russia's huge state-owned
natural resource monopolies, improve revenue collection, and crack
down on waste and corruption. But the new credit comes without
signs of significant improvement.
</P>
<P>
   ``This money was clearly given for political reasons,'' said
Sergei Markov of the Moscow-based Institute for Political Studies.
``Western countries have decided to underscore that the
disagreements with Russia are local, not global.''

U.S. EASES STANCE ON EVICTION OF LANDOWNERS IN TRIBE'S SUIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By DAVID W. CHEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The federal government moved Monday to soften its
support of the Oneida Indians' claim to 270,000 acres of land in
central New York, saying it did not want to evict any private
landowners from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   A Department of Justice official said that the government still
supported the Oneidas' original claim that state and local
governments had acquired Oneida lands in the late 1700s and early
1800s through illegal and coercive treaties.
</P>
<P>
   The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, reiterated
that the 20,000 or so landowners who lived within the land-claim
area were still defendants in the lawsuit, and therefore liable for
any future damages.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent months, the specter of eviction _ or ejectment, in
legal terms _ had so overshadowed the lawsuit, and distracted from
the parallel effort to hammer out a compromise, that the Justice
Department felt that it was imperative to assure landowners that
eviction was not a viable part of the solution, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   So Monday, the Department of Justice formally asked for
permission to amend its complaint during opening arguments in
federal district court in Syracuse.
</P>
<P>
   It was not immediately clear when Judge Neal McCurn would rule
on the government's request. But if the request is granted _ which
seems all but certain _ then it could help assuage the anxiety that
has been percolating in recent months in Madison and Oneida
Counties, where there have been boycotts of Oneida businesses,
protest meetings and personal threats and uncivil language.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are listening. They are paying attention, and I think
that's very significant,'' said Rep. Sherwood Boehlert, R-Utica,
summing up his discussions with government officials. ``I think
this takes away the cloud of uncertainty that's hovering over all
the private property owners in the region that someone is going to
knock on their door and say, `Get out!'''
</P>
<P>
   Others, including Gov. George Pataki, want the government to go
even further.
</P>
<P>
   ``The federal government's decision to back down from its
outrageous attempt to frighten and intimidate the people of central
New York by seeking to eject them from their homes is a small first
step, but not nearly enough,'' Pataki said in a statement. He added
that the government ``must end its aggressive campaign against its
own citizens by completely removing all homeowners from the land
claim lawsuit.''
</P>
<P>
   Leon R. Koziol, a lawyer for Upstate Citizens for Equality, a
landowners group that says it has 3,500 members, was even more
blunt. While he said he believed that the government's request took
a little bit of the steam out of the Oneidas' claim, he also blamed
the government for stirring up fear and resentment in the first
place.
</P>
<P>
   ``They used the people as pawns,'' Koziol said. ``It was an
unconscionable act, to use their own citizens as pawns in a scheme
to raise the level of political discussion and legal argument in a
lawsuit.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the Oneida Indian Nation, Carole Trimble,
characterized the government's request as inconsequential to the
merits of the case. She restated the Oneidas' hope that they can
reach a resolution that is fair to all sides.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute between the Oneidas and the state officially dates
from 1970, when the Oneidas filed a lawsuit in federal district
court saying that their land had been seized illegally. In 1985,
the Supreme Court upheld the Oneidas' claim. But talks between the
Oneidas and the state stalled for years.
</P>
<P>
   So in December, to prod the negotiations along, the federal
government sided with the Oneidas, filing an amended complaint that
named 20,000 landowners as defendants. And that, in turn, unleashed
a latent sense of resentment over the Oneidas' recent good
fortunes.
</P>
<P>
   Like all federally recognized tribes, the Oneida Indian Nation
does not pay taxes. And thanks in part to their new Turning Stone
Casino, the Oneidas have seemingly risen from abject poverty to
unbridled affluence in a very short time, while their neighbors
have been grappling with a tough local economy.
</P>
<P>
   To vent their frustration, more than 2,000 motorists
participated in a rally in January in front of the casino. An even
larger one is scheduled for May 1, when Koziol said he expected
that 5,000 cars would travel from Buffalo to Albany to protest the
Oneidas.
</P>
<P>
   The next court hearing on the land-claim issue is scheduled for
May 26. The court-appointed mediator, Ronald J. Riccio, who was
brought in last month to try and broker a compromise, has arranged
two mediation sessions and has visited the land-claim area, and
said he planned more visits and more meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Riccio, the mediator who is also dean of Seton Hall University
School of Law, described the progress as encouraging, even
suggesting that there might be some kind of agreement in mid-May.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's possible; I'm not ruling it out,'' Riccio said. ``At
least what's possible is you can come up with the broad framework
of a settlement. I think the actual implementation would take some
time, but you want everyone to say, `Yes, these are the components
of a settlement,' and I think we're at the stage where I think
everybody has a good idea of what the components are.''

 &HT;    Langdon: From Alaskan media darling to Duke's 'rock'
 &HT;    (EDS: Resending with headline.)
 &HT;    By Gary Nuhn
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ When Trajan Langdon was 14 years old and
had played exactly three games in high school, the Anchorage Daily
News proclaimed he would become the best basketball player in the
history of Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   Thank you, media gypsies.
</P>
<P>
   Not that there was any pressure or anything. After all, Langdon
only had to top the fabulous Muff Butler to accomplish it.
</P>
<P>
   Still, 14?
</P>
<P>
   I wonder why the paper waited so long.
</P>
<P>
   Langdon has fulfilled the gypsies' prediction. He is a
three-time first-team All-Atlantic Coast Conference player and
acknowledged emotional leader on the nation's No. 1 college team,
Duke.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Devils spent Monday night trying to bedevil Connecticut
and establish themselves as the undisputed Team of the Decade with
three national championships.
</P>
<P>
   Trajan Shaka Langdon was named after Trajan, the Roman emperor
who ended the persecution of Christians, and Shaka, a leader who
organized the Zulu tribe of Africa into a nation.
</P>
<P>
   Kind of makes being named after your uncle seem a little trite,
doesn't it?
</P>
<P>
   Langdon was a natural athlete, but one who always wanted more.
In grade school, when most of his classmates were frolicking in the
snow at recess, Langdon would shoot a basketball alone at an
outdoor rim.
</P>
<P>
   Zero degrees? Twenty below?
</P>
<P>
   Big deal. Gloves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't even feel the ball with the gloves on,'' he said.
``But it was a challenge. It was good practice to dribble the ball
in the snow. You never knew what way it would bounce.''
</P>
<P>
   The glass is half full.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've coached for 34 years and have never had a player work as
hard as he did,'' said his high school coach, Chuck White.
``Whatever he's gotten, he's earned it 10 times over by working
hard.''
</P>
<P>
   What he got was three state high school championships and three
State Player of the Year awards.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, coach Mike Krzyzewski sold him on Duke. Even though
over the previous four years the Blue Devils had won two national
titles and finished runner-up for another, the program was headed
into turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   Coach K had back surgery and missed most of 1994-95, Langdon's
freshman season, which ended 13-18. Recruiting suffered. Then
Langdon missed his sophomore season with a knee injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``That (freshman) season was very humbling,'' the 6-foot-3 guard
said. ``It was as if Duke ceased being Duke overnight.''
</P>
<P>
   Langdon came back in 1996-97 and in the next two seasons, Duke
was 56-13, but the Devils lost to Providence in the second round of
the tournament in '97 and lost to Kentucky in a regional final last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Langdon's mission was to see that doesn't happen again. When
Temple jumped to an 10-5 lead in the East Regional final last week,
Langdon was ready with his reply. He hit a runner in transition;
stopped on the right key and nailed a trey; hit another trey; then
another.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven points in four possessions.
</P>
<P>
   ``As pure a shooter as I've seen in the game of basketball,''
said Temple coach John Chaney. ``He only needs to look through a
hole in the needle to see the basket.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He is the rock,'' said teammate Shane Battier. ``Anytime we
get a little frazzled, all we have to do is look at him and see his
calm demeanor and realize that everything is all right.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He came here with snowshoes on,'' Krzyzewski joked Sunday.
``We had to get him regulation basketball equipment before he could
help us.''
</P>
<P>
   Now all he wants is a regulation ring.
</P>

FINAL DIALLO PROTEST AT POLICE HEADQUARTERS IS HELD 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MICHAEL COOPER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After two weeks and more than 1,200 arrests, the last
of the daily protests outside Police Headquarters that have placed
the death of Amadou Diallo at the center of the city's political
consciousness was held Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The final protest took place as the Bronx district attorney
announced that the four police officers who shot Diallo will be
arraigned Wednesday on criminal charges. Three Democratic members
of Congress _ Eliot Engel of the Bronx and Major Owens and Nydia
Velazquez, both of Brooklyn _ were among the 166 people arrested
for civil disobedience. But one protester in particular attracted
the attention of veteran police officers at the scene: William
Bracey, a compact man in a tan three-piece suit and a brown fedora.
</P>
<P>
   Bracey, 79, was the department's chief of patrol from 1979 until
1982. On Monday, he returned to the building where he once held
command to be placed under arrest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really feel I'm obligated to be here,'' said Bracey, a
member of the National Organization of Black Law Enforcement
Executives. ``This is not just a black problem. This is not just a
community problem. This is a people problem, and police officers,
chiefs and whatnot, are people, and we have families, children,
people that will be affected if we don't do something.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking on from the crowd was Carleton Irish, 71, a former
police sergeant who was teamed up with Bracey in 1954 as a rookie
patrolman in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   ``It breaks my heart to see a man like Bill Bracey taken away in
handcuffs,'' said Irish. ``I think he wanted to make a point, that
these are not crazies who hate the police. These are people who
hate what has happened to the Police Department.''
</P>
<P>
   The protests began 15 days ago with a few dozen people chanting,
``No justice, no peace!'' outside 1 Police Plaza, and grew by the
hundreds after Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., and former Mayor David
Dinkins were arrested. It ended on a buoyant note in the sunshine
Monday, as the Rev. Al Sharpton told the protesters they could take
credit for helping force changes in the Police Department and the
city's political discourse.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we started they said it was silly, they said it was a
publicity stunt,'' Sharpton said, echoing the phrases that Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani had used to dismiss the protests. ``The mayor, 15
days ago, said to meet with black officials would be pandering. Now
he's meeting with everybody he can.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor, for his part, sought to balance his remarks on the
protests by expressing his sympathy for the Diallo family, his
support for the Police Department and his anger at the personal
attacks against him. He complained that several protesters held
aloft signs that compared him to Adolf Hitler and the Police
Department to the Ku Klux Klan.
</P>
<P>
   The police union, the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, spent
more than $150,000 on advertisements published in newspapers Monday
denouncing what it called a rush to judgment of the four police
officers involved in the Diallo case and of the department as a
whole. The union has planned a large demonstration of off-duty
police officers for Tuesday outside the Bronx County Courthouse.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the four officers who shot and killed Diallo _
Kenneth Boss, Sean Carroll, Edward McMellon and Richard Murphy _
said they were telephoned by Bronx prosecutors Monday and told to
be prepared to surrender their clients for arrest Wednesday morning
at an undisclosed location.
</P>
<P>
   The Bronx district attorney, Robert Johnson, said in a statement
that an indictment would be unsealed Wednesday. The statement did
not say what the charges would be, but a law enforcement official
and a lawyer connected to the case who spoke on the condition of
anonymity have said the four officers would be indicted on charges
of second-degree murder in the Feb. 4 shooting.

COMPANY'S PLAN TO PRIVATIZE ANGERS SHAREHOLDERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even in a raging bull market, some New York Stock Exchange
companies wallow in neglect. A few, like dusty antiques in the
attic, turn out to be gems.
</P>
<P>
   PEC Israel Economic Corp., a holding company that has stakes in
Israeli ventures, is one such company. Management takes a low
profile. Analysts ignore the company. The stock price has gone
mostly downhill since the early 1990s. So forgotten is PEC that it
is slated for extinction, with its largest shareholder preparing to
buy up the remaining shares and delist it as of Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The delisting, however, comes as several PEC investments,
including a stake in Cellcom, Israel's largest mobile telephone
operator, are scheduled to go public and capture a market value
that analysts believe will greatly exceed the amount that PEC says
they are worth.
</P>
<P>
   Discount Investments Corp., a company controlled by the Recanati
family of Israel, is the majority PEC shareholder that wants to
privatize PEC. By doing so, it would not have to share any future
gains in the market value of PEC assets with other stockholders,
disgruntled shareholders contend.
</P>
<P>
   The offer to privatize PEC was made several months after
Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co., the investment bank, paid $78 million for a
9.5 percent stake in the Israeli holding company that controls
Discount Investments. Goldman, jointly with Lehman Brothers, also
happens to be a lead underwriter of Cellcom, which plans to list
shares in the United States shortly.
</P>
<P>
   Minority PEC shareholders have filed lawsuits to block the deal,
contending that the offer substantially underestimates the value of
the investments PEC has made over the years. Unless the suits
prevail, the delisting is a done deal because Discount Investments
already holds an 80 percent stake in PEC. Shareholders will
formally vote on the proposal at a shareholder meeting Tuesday in
New York.
</P>
<P>
   The conflict involves a tangled story of American-Israeli
economic connections that turned sour. Some shareholders see the
demise of PEC as an ignominious end to a company founded in 1926 by
Justice Louis Brandeis of the Supreme Court. He and other Zionists
established the company to support Palestine at a time when Jews
there had difficulty raising money for even the most basic
necessities, like housing and utilities.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, until the Israeli stock market boom of the 1990s made
it easier for Israeli companies to raise capital, PEC was run as
much as a charity as a corporation. Its stock is still widely held
by Jews around the world who once regarded it as much as a donation
as an investment.
</P>
<P>
   ``This company was never supposed to be about squeezing every
last dime out of shareholders,'' said Murray Greenfield, a retired
72-year-old Israeli broker who sold PEC stock to Jewish visitors to
Israel in the 1960s. ``It was about building Israel. If Brandeis
woke up today he would not be the happiest man in the world, I can
tell you that.''
</P>
<P>
   For more recent shareholders, PEC's privatization is a fresh
lesson about the risks of investing in undervalued companies. Some
investors said they snapped up PEC stock in recent years because
the price fell far below the level at which analysts estimated the
value of its underlying investments. These investors were hoping
PEC would eventually enjoy a run-up in the value of Israeli
companies that went public after the 1993 peace accord with the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Like PEC, some investment holding companies trade at a discount
to the book value of their underlying assets, especially when
management is indifferent. But PEC's discount _ more than 46
percent, according to an estimate made by an analyst at Lehman
Brothers late last year _ was large enough to make PEC a prime
target for investors seeking the most undervalued companies on the
U.S. stock market.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pity is that this is happening just as some of PEC's
investments are just about to take off,'' said one large
shareholder who declined to be identified because his company has
legal action pending. Among the largest minority shareholders are
mutual funds run by Credit Suisse Asset Management and Vanguard
Group.
</P>
<P>
   PEC's management team, which includes two members of the
Recanati family, declined to comment through a spokesman on the
lawsuits or the buyout offer, citing Securities and Exchange
Commission regulations that they say prohibit them from speaking
publicly while the offer is pending. Goldman, which stands to
benefit if the Recanatis have their way at PEC, also declined to
comment.
</P>
<P>
   But in documents, the company says that the $30-a-share purchase
price for the shares of PEC that Discount Investments does not
already own is fair, pointing out that the price is 32 percent
higher than what the shares were fetching before Discount
Investments made a bid.
</P>
<P>
   Late last year, PEC management hired Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. to
appraise its value. After Merrill's review, Discount Investment
raised its bid to $30 a share from $25.50. Merrill called the $30
price fair, a fact that PEC officials said validates the latest
offer.
</P>
<P>
   But some shareholders fault Merrill for collecting as much as
$625,000 from PEC in fees if the deal flies, but failing to extract
from PEC management the sort of information Merrill normally seeks
to judge the fairness of a deal. Merrill acknowledged in its
fairness opinion, for example, that it did not have access to the
management of Cellcom, the mobile phone operator and what many
consider to be the portfolio's hidden jewel.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not been afforded the opportunity to meet with the
management of Cellcom Israel, the company's largest single holding,
and thus have not been able to discuss with such management the
business prospects of Cellcom,'' the Merrill review states.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Israeli newspapers have reported that Cellcom plans to go public
in the United States this year. Both Merrill and Goldman competed
for the right to underwrite that company's shares, which are
expected to generate considerable investor interest because of
Cellcom's rapid growth and its status as the No. 1 provider of
mobile phone services in Israel, itself a leader in per-capita use
of cellular telephones.
</P>
<P>
   In its fairness opinion, dated Dec. 11, Merrill explored various
ways to value Cellcom and settled on a range of $2 billion to $2.5
billion. More recently, Israeli news reports and Wall Street
analysts close to the company have placed a value on Cellcom closer
to $3.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill officials declined to comment in detail on the fairness
opinion. But a spokesman said the opinion explored the reasons that
PEC shares traded at such a heavy discount to the value of its
individual investments. It also weighs the possibility that
Cellcom's plan to go public could be delayed by a downdraft in the
American stock market, as it was late last year.
</P>
<P>
   Shareholders opposed to Discount Investments' offer contend that
the discrepancy between Merrill's valuation of Cellcom and the
price underwriters now hope to achieve in the initial public
offering amounts to $11 a share for PEC's current holders. Discount
Investments, they say, should pay at least $41 a share instead of
the $30 being proposed.
</P>
<P>
   The dissenting shareholders also say that the understatement of
PEC holdings goes beyond Cellcom and extends to PEC's stakes in
several private companies and real estate holdings in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The offer to take PEC public, these shareholders say, does not
account for a recent spike in the value of its stake in Gilat
Satellite Networks, which just went public on the Nasdaq market
last month. Another example: PEC has the right to convert a loan it
made to United Pan-Europe Communications, a European cable
television company, into shares in that prosperous concern.
Shareholders say they consider that conversion right a lucrative
opportunity that they will miss if PEC is privatized anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence that some long-dormant PEC investments are starting to
ascend can be seen in the value of Discount Investment stock listed
on the Tel Aviv stock exchange, the shareholders said. Discount
Investments' assets mirror many of those held by PEC, as the two
invest side by side in many ventures. The two, for example, each
hold a 12.5 percent stake in Cellcom, and have identical positions
in many other Israeli technology and industrial companies.
</P>
<P>
   Discount Investment stock has been on a tear, with shares rising
from less than 80 shekels, or about $19, at the time it offered to
buy the shares of PEC it did not already control last fall, to more
than 140, or about $34.68, in recent days, an all-time high. PEC
shares on the New York Stock Exchange, which closed Monday at
$29.6875, rose in December when Discount Investment made its
$30-a-share offer, but are still well below 1993 highs.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the issue seems destined to end up in court. But for
some shareholders, it's an unfortunate paradox that American Jews
who once bought PEC shares to support cash-short Jews in Palestine
would wind up in court contending that Israeli financiers are
profiting at their expense.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a shame,'' said Greenfield, the former broker and PEC
shareholder. ``But if they are hellbent on profits, then at least
we should have our share.''

STARKS HAVING A BLAST WITH THE WARRIORS
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By MIKE WISE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The volcano finally blew 10 days ago, erupting at 9:37 p.m. in
the fourth quarter of a game against Seattle. It promptly shook the
timeout huddle of the Golden State Warriors.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just went off,'' veteran Warrior guard Bimbo Coles said of
his new teammate, John Starks. ``He started screaming and pounding
his chest, `You gotta get hyped! You gotta have heart!' It was
wild.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were all like, `Oh. This must be the other personality.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Here's Johnny, still living and dying by the bomb and
emotionally carrying a team. The Warriors did not let Seattle back
in the game. Starks hit the game-clinching 3-pointer with about two
minutes left, and he is still ribbed about the outburst.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's funny, because as a teammate, I love him,'' Coles said.
``When I was in Miami and we were going at it with the Knicks, I
hated him. He has that effect on people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at New York now. You can see they definitely lack an
emotional leader. They don't have anyone to get them up.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in 10 years, the Knicks came West last week
without Starks. Traded for Latrell Sprewell in a deal that also
brought Terry Cummings and Chris Mills to the Warriors in January,
the shooting guard who once seemed tethered to Madison Square
Garden now kick-starts another franchise.
</P>
<P>
   This one does not have aspirations for a championship anytime
soon, but Starks has helped the Warriors remove the stain of a
19-63 season, one forever remembered for the star player choking
the coach after 13 games.
</P>
<P>
   At 12-16. the Warriors are only one game out of the Western
Conference's eighth and final playoff spot and their frenetic style
of play has again enraptured Bay Area basketball fans.
</P>
<P>
   Starks is averaging 14.1 points, 5 assists and 3.5 rebounds _
his best numbers since the 1994-95 season. But he is also playing
more and shooting a career-low percentage of .368 through 28 games.
After the victory over Seattle, he missed 15 shots in a loss at
Portland.
</P>
<P>
   ``When is Starks going to stop shooting?'' inquired a caller
named Eduardo from San Francisco, venting on KNBR radio last week.
``He killed us last night.''
</P>
<P>
   Within moments, the program host defends Starks, saying his
attributes balance out the occasional 23-footer with 23 seconds
left on the shot clock.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing changes, except the call letters.
</P>
<P>
   Lacking his usual intensity for a stretch, Starks warned Bay
Area reporters earlier this month that he was returning to his old
self _ the hyperkinetic, emotional guy from New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``They probably feel the same way New York fans did about him,''
said Tim Roye, the Warriors' play-by-play announcer. ``They love
him for his energy and his histrionics. But the night he goes 5 for
20, they wish he would take a few less shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overall, though, he's been perfect for this team. The Sprewell
teams, there just wasn't any leadership or work ethic. John has
helped change the attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   His teammates embrace him. His coach, P.J. Carlesimo, lives with
the bad because he knows the good is around the corner. And Starks
has helped vindicate Warriors general manager Garry St. Jean, who
two months ago was pilloried for giving up Sprewell for three aging
veterans.
</P>
<P>
   ``My game kind of suits the West Coast,'' Starks said through
his cackling giggle, the one that sounds like an idling lawn mower.
``I've adjusted pretty well to this team.''
</P>
<P>
   Starks spoke as he sat in front of his cubicle one night
recently, the lone Warrior left in the locker room. Compact disks
competed for time and space with his high-tops and his fan mail.
Pondering how he picked up his life in New York and moved it into a
downtown Oakland hotel in a span of two months, he smiled.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took a while to sink in, but this is a business,'' he said.
``We all know that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Warriors and Knicks do not play this regular season, most
likely canceling Starks' return to the Garden until next season.
When the Knicks face the Indiana Pacers at the Garden Tuesday
night, they presumably will be reminded of his absence in view of
his memorable duels with Reggie Miller.
</P>
<P>
   Starks has acted the part of a mature veteran since the trade,
saying all the right things about fitting in and contributing.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Jackie, and his children, John Jr., 10, and Chelsea,
7, came to visit over spring break. He said he plans to keep his
home in Stamford, Conn., and maintain a residence in New York. He
talks to his former teammates frequently, sometimes telephoning
Patrick Ewing a few times a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talk trash,'' Ewing said. ``Then he tells me to keep it
going, keep playing hard and don't worry about all the
distractions.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he ever imagined the mercurial Starks as counseling
another player, Ewing just smiled and shook his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely wish he was still here,'' he said. ``He's a
friend. We hung out on the road and we hung out here. He's
definitely missed. He's a good friend. You only play this game for
so long, and then it's over. But the relationships you develop,
that's what going to last.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   With 48 hours of rumors to warn him, a numb Starks was
officially traded on Jan. 21. Unlike Charles Oakley, he does not
hold a personal grudge against Ernie Grunfeld, the team president
and general manager. But he believes it was a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we had another run left in us,'' Starks said. ``When
you trade away two of your core guys _ guys that go on out there
who are committed to winning and being vocal when things are going
bad so that they push each other _ then you lose something.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just regret that I'm not able to finish my career there.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month against Dallas, Starks hit an arching, teardrop jump
shot to seal a victory with 10.8 seconds left. After the shot, he
began pointing to his chest and yelling at Coles: ``We're Warriors,
baby! Warriors hang in there!''
</P>
<P>
   It was one of those awkward, almost comical, scenes in which
Coles was at first not sure how to respond. This wild man, his face
contorted, slapping him on the back, pointing to the team logo with
pride.
</P>
<P>
   Remembering Starks used to do the same thing in New York, Coles
finally warmed to the moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm used to the craziness now,'' he said. ``In a lot of ways,
John Starks just grows on you.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ NATO bombers hunted for Serbian troops in embattled
Kosovo on Monday and the administration said evidence of
``genocide'' by Serbian forces was growing to include ``abhorrent
and criminal action'' on a vast scale. The language was the State
Department's strongest yet in denouncing Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   There were also more reports of assassinations of ethnic
Albanian leaders and of the scorched-earth torching of Kosovar
villages by Serbian forces.
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands of refugees continued to flee in terror from
Serb forces, pouring into neighboring Albania, Macedonia and
Montenegro and compounding the Balkan region's massive refugee
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``President Milosevic has adopted what can only be described as
a siege mentality,'' said British Air Commodore David Wilby at NATO
headquarters in Brussels. ``He believes he can realign his ethnic
problems in one week and that NATO unity will crack in that same
period,'' he said of the nonstop refugee flow.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are indicators that genocide is unfolding in Kosovo,''
said State Department spokesman James Rubin, invoking a word heady
with implications of proof and punishment in international law.
There is no reason to await confirmation before using the word, he
argued, ``because we can clearly say crimes against humanity are
being committed'' that carry penalties of life imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``Let me say that the abhorrent and criminal actions,
I mean on a massive scale, are occurring in Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials said their assault was directed increasingly at
Milosevic's forces in Kosovo. ``Major attacks'' were delivered
Sunday night on the 243rd Serb Combat Group at Donja Somanja,
Kosovo, according to NATO military officials who said the unit had
directed attacks on Albanian villagers.
</P>
<P>
   But military officials acknowledged that the hunt for Serbian
forces was complicated by the fact that they were operating in
small and dispersed groups.
</P>
<P>
   Belgrade claimed its forces had shot down a second NATO
warplane, but this was denied by the Pentagon. Officials continued
to withhold information on what had brought down an American F-117
stealth fighter over Yugoslavia on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon officials said the new air assaults in Kosovo were thus
far directed at barracks, headquarters and other bases, rather than
at the tanks, artillery pieces and small mobile military units
deployed in the fiel against Kosovo villages. A-10 ``Warthog''
planes, designed to make low-run, low-speed attacks on tanks and
field artillery, were reported taking to the air for the first time
in the six-day-old NATO assault, but there were no immediate
reports of any dramatic success in stopping Serbian attacks on
civilians.
</P>
<P>
   More American warplanes were committed to the NATO operation
Monday, including B-1B bombers equipped with a variety of bombs,
such as cluster ``bomblets.'' More EA-6B Prowler aircraft designed
to confuse enemy radar systems were also dispatched.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no magic military bullet here,'' said Pentagon
spokesman Ken Bacon, facing increasingly sharp questions about the
efficacy of the air attacks in the face of the heightened Serbian
onslaught. ``There is not a quick solution.''
</P>
<P>
   Bacon said one problem was that Serbian troops and special
police are widely dispersed through the area and operating in small
groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started first with the infrastructures and the supply
lines, and we will move as quickly as we can to actual forces,''
Bacon said. ``The problem is that although we are going to hit
increasingly staging areas where we find them, as I tried to
indicate, there aren't large concentrations of troops at this
stage.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They're attacking villages from different directions in small
groups,'' Bacon continued. ``So that is a complicating factor.''
</P>
<P>
   In London, British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said he was
alarmed by reports of ``some of these refugees being herded into
concentration areas'' by Serb forces. He cited one report,
unconfirmed as yet, of 20,000 refugees concentrated around Srbica.
</P>
<P>
   ``We remember the way in which many refugees were herded
together and executed by the Serb forces during the civil war in
Bosnia,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   One immediate question was whether the political leaders of NATO
might ease restrictions on on targets like the Ministry of the
Interior in Belgrade, where much of the Kosovo onslaught has
reportedly been mapped.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that's a question that I would like to address
today,'' Wilby responded when asked whether the NATO command had
prevented the allied bombers from attacking the ministry.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic was denounced by NATO officials for waging a
``scorched earth'' siege in routing the ethnic Albanians, whose
autonomy within Serbia was stripped away by the Serbian dictator 10
years ago. Kosovo, the southern province of the Serbian republic in
which ethnic Albanians account for nine-tenths of the population,
is hallowed ground to the Serbs, and a touchstone in Milosevic's
ultranationalist campaign to maintain power.
</P>
<P>
   Seven Kosovo villages were reported under assault and burning
between Pec and Klina on Monday, with Albanian residents fleeing
the Serbs, NATO said. Three villages west of Pristina, the Kosovo
capital, were also reported aflame by NATO officials, who have
tended to offer the public more specific details on the Kosovo
scene than their American counterparts here.
</P>
<P>
   As calls mounted for more immediate results by NATO, President
Clinton interrupted a Virginia golf outing to telephone British
Prime Minister Tony Blair and German Chancellor Gerhardt Schroeder.
At the Pentagon, the Joint Chiefs of Staff met in private, with
Kosovo heading their agenda.
</P>
<P>
   On the diplomatic front, administration officials expressed
little optimism that Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov's trip
to Belgrade Tuesday would bear much fruit in the way of ending the
NATO assault unless he somehow reverses Milosevic's adamancy in
refusing to retreat from his year-long Kosovo campaign. Some
officials voiced concerns that Primakov might push the Serbs into a
deal short of what NATO is demanding: autonomy for Kosovo under the
protection of NATO troops.
</P>
<P>
   About half a million ethnic Albanians _ a fifth of the province
_ were already reported to have fled their homes over the past
year. Tens of thousands more have taken to the roads since the NATO
bombings began, with some even being stripped of their
identification papers and being forced to pay bribes at the Serb
borders, NATO said.
</P>
<P>
   The refugees are being prodded by Milosevic's troops and
paramilitary police as well as by what NATO officials described as
murderous gangs in civilian clothes bearing names like the Vucak
Wolves, names already infamous from earlier ethnic wars.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty thousand Kosovo refugees descended upon hard-pressed
neighboring Albania today, according to the U.N. High Commissioner
for Refugees. State Department officials estimated the flow was
continuing at 2,000 per hour.
</P>
<P>
   In Macedonia, there were an estimated 22,000 refugees as U.N.
relief officials held emergency meetings to deal with the crisis.
In Montenegro, at least 28,000 refugees have flowed in from Pec,
the Kosovo border city that remained under siege and burning,
according to the State Department.
</P>
<P>
   NATO and Clinton administration officials heightened warnings
Monday that war-crime investigations will be pressed all the way
down the Serb military command to line officers in the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is your responsibility,'' declared Cook, angrily
addressing the Serbian officers corps. ``We know the chain of
command back to the political leadership in Belgrade.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Wilby said the Albanians remaining in Kosovo were despairing.
``Helicopters are being used against the civil population,'' he
said. ``Paramilitaries enter towns and villages and terrify the
people.''
</P>
<P>
   As the war misery of the Kosovars deepened, the White House
denied the NATO raids had only encouraged Milosevic to hasten the
routing of ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were faced with a choice here, which was do we act or do we
not act?'' said Joe Lockhart, the president's spokesman. ``And we
think by acting we will make him pay a price,'' he said. ``The
reason they, as a group, are better off is that this was done in
the past with impunity,'' he said of the Serb assaults.
</P>
<P>
   Britain's Cook, facing similar questioning, declared, ``If we
had not acted, all of you would now be asking why we stood by while
this ethnic cleansing took place.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House declared once more that there was ``absolutely
no change'' in the president's insistence that American ground
troops would not be used against the Serbs. Pentagon officials
emphasized that an adequate troop operation could take weeks to
mount, if it ever were decided upon, because the Serbs already have
40,000 troops in Kosovo backed by hundreds of tanks and artillery
pieces.
</P>
<P>
   The reported atrocities cited by the State Department and NATO
officials, who stressed on-site confirmation was not yet possible,
included 20 village school teachers who were said to have been
gunned down by Serbs in front of their students in Goden.
</P>
<P>
   NATO reported Serbian gunmen had tracked down and executed at
least five prominent ethnic Albanians, including Batan Haxhiu,
editor of the main ethnic Albanian newspaper, and Fehmi Agani, a
member of the Kosovar Albanian peace negotiating team that met in
February at Rambouillet, outside Paris. The NATO attacks began when
those talks stalled two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials strenuously denied that the air assaults had
prompted the heightened Milosevic onslaught against the Kosovars,
noting that Serb forces have been massing in Kosovo for months and
were aggressively on the move when NATO felt obliged to step in.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a campaign under way to ethnically re-engineer the
makeup of Kosovo, to reshape the political map of Kosovo so that
Milosevic later on would hope to achieve a negotiated solution more
favorable to Belgrade,'' said Jamie Shea, the NATO spokesman in
Brussels, indicating Milosevic may be seeking to carve a Serb-only
region in Kosovo..

 EDITORIAL: 10,000  (jw)

<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Tuesday, March 30:
</P>
<P>
   It was only last fall that stock markets in the United States
and most other countries were reeling in fear of a possible
worldwide recession. That it failed to appear is readily apparent
from the fact that the Dow Jones industrial average Monday closed
above 10,000 for the first time _ an increase of more than 30
percent in less than seven months.
</P>
<P>
   The Asian crisis that sparked the worries is far from over, and
the best thing that can be said about Russia, whose default on its
debt precipitated the market plunge, is that the country has not
descended into anarchy. Latin American economies remain troubled,
with Brazil in a severe recession.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the developed world is optimistic. The British
stock market also hit a record high this month, and most European
markets have moved up as well, although not to new highs. Even
long-suffering Japan seems to be reviving. One reason is that
central banks in all major economies lowered interest rates,
spurring economic growth and providing liquidity for stock market
speculation.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to the expectations of most economists _ and of this
page _ the American economy did not even pause while much of the
world was suffering. Instead, consumers benefited from lower prices
for commodities and imported goods, and their willingness to spend
rather than save more than offset weakness in the manufacturing
sector.
</P>
<P>
   There are ample signs of speculative excess in the stock market,
most notably in Internet stocks. Corporate profits have not risen
nearly as rapidly as stock prices, a fact that is likely to be
important when economic growth starts to slow. But for now, America
is in love with the market and happy to see rising stock prices as
an endorsement of its supremacy in the world economy.

EDITORIAL: ANOTHER ALBANY BUDGET IMPASSE 
</HEADLINE>
  (fb) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Tuesday, March 30:
</P>
<P>
   Two days before the start of a new fiscal year, Gov. George
Pataki and the New York State Legislature are not even close to
agreement on a new budget. Even worse, the progress made last year
in opening up the budget process has been cast aside because of the
inability of all parties to agree on basic revenue and cost
estimates. As usual, few outsiders are paying attention, so the
governor and the lawmakers feel little pressure to compromise. In a
switch from years past, the current impasse results from surplus,
not scarcity, and squabbling over how best to spend money in a time
of plenty.
</P>
<P>
   Budget breakdowns and delays are routine in Albany. But the
major new factor this year is the surprisingly enhanced power of
Pataki. Not only does he remain popular, and confident enough to
exhibit national political ambitions, the governor also is enjoying
an unanticipated advantage from reforms that were designed to give
new clout to the legislature. The most important reform,
inaugurated last year, had the Senate and Assembly deliberate
openly, resolve their differences in budget conference committees
and send Pataki a budget that was nearly on time. The idea was to
avoid the old habit of deciding the budget among ``three men in a
room,'' namely the governor and the leaders of the Senate and
Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   The reform backfired, however, at least in the view of the
legislature. The governor, feeling miffed at being shut out of the
budget as it sailed through the legislature last year, simply
vetoed large portions of it. The legislature lacked the votes to
override, as it does this year. Sheldon Silver, speaker of the
Democratic-controlled Assembly, has fallen back on the old practice
of passing a Democratic budget, with more spending than the
governor wants for education and health, and hoping for public
pressure to bend Pataki.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Pataki ran for re-election with a lavish budget that
increased spending by 8 percent from the year before. Now he wants
to increase it by less than 2 percent. The Assembly wants to
increase it by 4.6 percent, and the Republican-controlled Senate is
in between. There are ingredients in here for agreement. The first
should be to reject Pataki's steep cuts in education and payments
to hospitals, nursing homes and health clinics. The second should
be to use as much of the surplus this year as possible for
budgetary reserves or debt retirement _ not new spending or new tax
cuts. As a step to hasten the process, the Assembly and Senate can
try to agree quickly on cost and revenue estimates for the options
they face. They may discover that other accords can follow.

 &HT;    No water slides for Lion Country
 &HT;    By Marc Freeman
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH _ Finally siding with furious residents, Palm
Beach County commissioners on Monday denied Lion Country Safari's
proposal to build a water park but allowed a hotel and a Ferris
wheel.
</P>
<P>
   About 80 homeowners from the Deer Run and Fox Trail communities
cheered the commission's 5-1 vote, which ended more than six months
of bitter debate about adding water slides to the 660-acre
drive-through animal preserve in the rural western part of the
county.
</P>
<P>
   Lion Country, which insists it needs a popular summertime draw
to compete against Disney's Animal Kingdom and other Florida
tourist attractions, is free to try again when it gets an access
road separate from the one the residents now share with the park.
</P>
<P>
   A proposal favored by three commissioners would allow the
22.6-acre water park if the county extends Okeechobee Boulevard a
half-mile to a new Lion Country entrance. The only entry now is off
Southern Boulevard.
</P>
<P>
   The road extension is not now in the county's plans or budget.
</P>
<P>
   Fox Trail President Michael Sinclair said his neighbors hope the
park plan doesn't return for fear it would ``ruin their way of
living.''
</P>
<P>
   Commissioner Mary McCarty, who cast the lone vote supporting the
water park, said the county should ask tourism officials to allow
hotel bed-tax dollars to cover road costs, which were not known
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In view of the defeat, Lion Country President Leon Unterhalter
said he may not build the approved 147-room bungalow-style hotel
because its summer customers were to be mostly guests of the water
park.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's disappointing,'' he said after Monday's five-hour zoning
hearing. ``The water park is good for the county and good for the
western area.''
</P>
<P>
   The vote, with Commissioner Burt Aaronson out recovering from
heart surgery, wasn't as lopsided as it appears. A succession of
ties had stymied commissioners.
</P>
<P>
   In those split votes, Chairwoman Maude Ford Lee and
Commissioners McCarty and Carol Roberts supported the water park as
long as Unterhalter would be required to meet 60 conditions dealing
with everything from traffic to noise. Commissioners Tony
Masilotti, Warren Newell and Karen Marcus voted against it.
</P>
<P>
   That's when Roberts suggested the board postpone action until
Aaronson returns in two months. As residents screamed, ``No!''
Masilotti and Marcus blasted the idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Commissioner Aaronson's heart has had enough,'' Marcus
said. ``We shouldn't put pressure on him.''
</P>
<P>
   To help reach closure, McCarty announced she would become the
fourth and deciding vote to kill the water park.
</P>
<P>
   That initiated a reshuffling and the final 5-1 vote, during
which McCarty reversed herself again and voted for the water park.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the board allowed Lion Country to build a
70-foot-tall Ferris wheel as part of an expansion of its
walk-through Safari Village. The board didn't have much choice
because Lion Country won approval to add amusement rides in 1976,
though it never built them.
</P>
<P>
   Some residents yelled from their seats Monday that the Ferris
wheel doesn't belong either. But Masilotti, who represents western
Palm Beach County, said homeowners had nothing to fear.
</P>
<P>
   ''Well folks, you can't see it and you can't hear it,'' he said.
``I don't see why it's harmful to anyone in the area.''
</P>
<P>
   But with its hopes for a water park at least temporarily dashed,
Lion Country may decide not to build the Ferris wheel either.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to step back and think about what we're going to bring
back'' to commissioners, said park representative Ellen Smith.

DEFENSE TO SEEK OUSTER OF LOUIMA JURY PANEL
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By JOSEPH P. FRIED   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After more than 600 prospective jurors filled out
questionnaires Monday to begin the jury selection process in the
case of police officers charged with brutalizing Abner Louima,
lawyers for the officers said they would ask the judge to dismiss
the entire panel because some of its members gave interviews to
reporters as they left the courthouse.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers contended that the entire panel had been tainted and
a new one should be summoned, even though it appeared that only a
small number of the prospective jurors paused to answer a few
reporters' questions on the sidewalk outside federal District Court
in Brooklyn. Others were seen waving off reporters and television
crews who approached them as they left the building.
</P>
<P>
   The potential jurors who gave the interviews, some of which were
broadcast on television later Monday, violated the instructions
they had been given not to discuss the case with anybody.
</P>
<P>
   The prospective jurors had also been instructed that the jury
would be anonymous, and that their identities would not be made
known to the public or to the lawyers and other parties in the
case, either as members of the jury pool now or if they were chosen
to be jurors, in line with a decision by the judge in the case,
Eugene H. Nickerson.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution had requested an anonymous jury, not uncommon in
highly controversial cases, to keep the jurors' judgments from
being tainted by outside pressures, which the prosecutors had
argued could well occur in the racially and politically charged
case.
</P>
<P>
   Four white officers are on trial on charges of violating the
civil rights of Louima, a Haitian immigrant, after he was arrested
in a street brawl in Brooklyn in August 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors say all four beat him in a police car and that two
of them later tortured him at the 70th Precinct station house, one
by shoving a stick into his rectum, causing severe internal
injuries, and the other by holding him down. A sergeant, the fifth
defendant, is charged with trying to cover up the reported beating
in the police car. All the defendants say the charges are untrue.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for at least three of the officers said Monday that at a
hearing scheduled for Friday, they would ask Nickerson to dismiss
the entire panel of prospective jurors and start anew. One of the
lawyers, Marvyn M. Kornberg, said, ``The purpose for which
anonymity was created in the first instance is violated.''
</P>
<P>
   Kornberg, who represents Officer Justin A. Volpe, held that even
if only a small minority of the panel gave interviews, and even if
an interview was not broadcast or published, ``if it happens that
that person is selected for the jury, some reporter may know who he
or she is but the lawyers won't.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Gillers, a law professor at New York University, said he
did not think that Nickerson would disqualify the entire panel, but
that when he questioned prospective jurors individually _ a process
scheduled to begin in about two weeks _ he would ask if they spoke
to the press and dismiss those who said they had.
</P>
<P>
   Prospective jurors whose interviews were broadcast on television
described the queries on the questionnaire, which is intended to
determine such things as their specific knowledge and opinions of
the Louima case and their general views about police treatment of
minority members.
</P>
<P>
   They also spoke of matters like whether they wanted to serve in
the trial. One man said on television that his employer ``told me
to get out of it as soon as possible.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   The final score was low, the fewest points in the history of the
women's tournament final, but perhaps that was because the stakes
have grown so high.
</P>
<P>
   Purdue scored only 17 points in the first half Sunday night,
another tournament final record for futility in a half. But in the
end, Purdue soared to win the school's first women's college
basketball championship with a 62-45 victory against Duke that was
gratifying, if inelegant.
</P>
<P>
   The 107 points scored were a low for a final since the National
Collegiate Athletic Association began overseeing the tournament in
1982, but the weekend of Final Four games broke ground in other
significant and esthetic ways.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when there are rumblings that the women's championship
round of the NCAA might be moved in the calendar to avoid clashing
with the men's Final Four, Duke, an intrepid team with a appealing,
pass-happy playing style, and Purdue, a close-knit, persevering
group with a charismatic coach, brought new faces and story lines
to the game.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, the two teams proved that one can have a
compelling women's Final Four without Tennessee or Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   If the final had its rough edges, it was also a breakthrough for
Purdue and the Big Ten Conference; neither had won a women's
national title before Sunday night's game.
</P>
<P>
   The victory should help establish Purdue as a national
collegiate power in the burgeoning women's game, something Duke's
team felt it too accomplished in some measure with its ascent
through the tournament as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what we've done is huge,'' Duke's Georgia Schweitzer
said. ``When people hear about Duke now, they're not just going to
think about the men.''
</P>
<P>
   Duke Coach Gail Goestenkors said, ``We made a big step forward,
although the end goal was to win the last game.''
</P>
<P>
   Chasing the end goal seemed to be the very problem for both
teams in the early going Sunday night when turnovers and missed
shots had each team scrambling to find any offensive rhythm.
</P>
<P>
   Purdue and Duke had played fluid, orderly games in their
semifinal victories Friday night, but midway through the first half
Sunday, the score was an unsightly 9-to-8.
</P>
<P>
   Players from both teams later acknowledged that their focus on
the prize disturbed their focus on the basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a pretty ugly first half,'' the Duke point guard Hilary
Howard said. ``You could attribute it to nerves maybe, or being too
anxious to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Or too anxious to win, especially against former teammates.
Duke's Nicole Erickson and Michele VanGorp had played for Purdue
before transferring to Duke two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a long season and when you get to the championship final
it's easy to try so hard you kind of overwhelm yourself,'' Purdue
Coach Carolyn Peck said. ``That's OK''
</P>
<P>
   It was OK for Peck because her players, who were a little more
seasoned to big-game pressure, found their way out of their
first-half funk. Duke just played worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of us ever got into a flow,'' Erickson said. ``It was an
ugly game. Period.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, it appeared that top-ranked Purdue, which had
defeated Tennessee and the semifinalist Louisiana Tech in the
regular season on its way to 32 consecutive victories, had more
veteran leadership and more balance.
</P>
<P>
   Purdue also had secret weapons. Katie Douglas, a 6-foot-1-inch
forward, had the foot speed and size to harass Duke's smaller
guards whenever they tried to set up Duke's halfcourt offense.
Douglas made it very difficult for Duke to get the ball inside to
the 6-6 VanGorp, who took only 10 shots.
</P>
<P>
   And Purdue handled the adversity of a sloppy first half with
more grit. Purdue's senior leaders, Ukari Figgs and Stephanie
White-McCarty, had played for three coaches in their four years.
They had watched as Erickson, VanGorp and two other teammates fled
the program when Lin Dunn was unceremoniously fired as the coach in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   The other Purdue players stuck around and they grew closer,
relying on each other because they had no other choice.
</P>
<P>
   And when White-McCarty was helped from the court, dragging a
sprained ankle with four minutes to play Sunday, they rallied
again.
</P>
<P>
   White-McCarty's injury stunned and rattled the boisterous Purdue
cheering section that was seated just behind the Purdue bench.
Their upset and concern seemed to filter down to the bench area,
where there was a bit of chaos briefly as players tried to console
White-McCarty, who was also trying to get herself back into the
game.
</P>
<P>
   Figgs calmed her teammates and told White-McCarty to take a seat
for the evening. Led by Figgs, Purdue then went out and played its
most poised basketball of the Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had got through a lot of hard times a long time ago,''
Figgs said. ``We knew we could get through one more.''
</P>
<P>
   Purdue scored the next 13 points, making 12 consecutive free
throws at one point. Duke's hopes faded with more turnovers and
even fewer good shots. ``I'm not one for making bold statements,''
Peck said when it was over. ``But I think the games and quality of
play here this weekend was very good for the game. There was a lot
of teamwork, some competitive pride. We saw some new faces, a new
champion and some excellent basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's what the championship and the Final Four is all
about.''

 &HT;    Bacall works the crowd in Atlanta appearance
 &HT;    By Miriam Longino
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ She still has that Cheshire cat smile, half-ironic,
half flirtatious. The voice remains husky, low and tobacco-cured.
And although she is now 74, actress Lauren Bacall was instantly
recognizable to the 2,000 fans gathered to see her Monday at the
Fox Theatre, where she shared stories of her famous life and
answered questions for nearly two hours.
</P>
<P>
   The appearance, part of the Unique Lives &AMP; Experiences lecture
series, began a bit stiffly as Bacall read from a prepared text.
But when she left the podium and took a hand-held mike, the evening
turned into a warm and intimate conversation as she answered
questions about Bogie (famous husband Humphrey Bogart), Hollywood,
happiness, politics and aging.
</P>
<P>
   The Tony Award-winning actress often used her flair for the
dramatic, opening with a passage from Tennessee Williams' ``Sweet
Bird of Youth'': ``Time is the enemy of us all.'' But unlike other
female film legends of Hollywood's golden era _ Bette Davis or
Ginger Rogers, for example _ Bacall seems to have seasoned with
age, the passing of time making her more attractive, self-effacing,
confident and accessible. The only time she displayed any signs of
being a septuagenarian was in her slow movements across the stage.
</P>
<P>
   Although her show opened with film clips that have become movie
history (such as the famous ``You know how to whistle don't you?
Just put your lips together and blow'' from ``To Have and Have
Not''), Bacall managed to come down off the silver screen. Dressed
in a black pantsuit with knee-length jacket, she entertained the
mostly female audience by interspersing tidbits from her years in
Hollywood (such as the first time Bogart kissed her) with wisdom
from her years as careerist, single mother, widow, divorcee and
Hollywood survivor.
</P>
<P>
   With four standup microphones placed in each aisle of the Fox,
Atlanta fans waited patiently to hear Bacall answer their
questions:
</P>
<P>
   On Bogart: ``I wanted to marry him as much as I wanted to
breathe.''
</P>
<P>
   On being a working mother: ``It never occurred to me I was
making some kind of statement.''
</P>
<P>
   On the lecture series: ``Anytime I have to appear as myself, I'm
totally nervous.'' On today's Broadway: ``I'm sick of revivals. I
want to be in something original.''
</P>
<P>
   On today's Hollywood: ``Look at films like `Central Station' and
`Life Is Beautiful.' When foreign films make that much of an
impression, it shows you how little Hollywood is doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, in her suite at the Four Seasons Hotel,
Bacall seemed as flattered as a schoolgirl when asked if she put a
lot of effort into looking much younger than her 74 years. ``God
no,'' she said, laughing. ``I've never been one to look in the
mirror much. It may be because I've kept working. I haven't sat
around and waited. That's one reason why I love doing these
conversations (such as the show at the Fox). I still have something
to contribute. You've got to have a goal and a purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   And hers?
</P>
<P>
   ``Staying alive is my main one,'' she quipped.

MICHAEL V. ARIS, 53, DIES; SCHOLARLY HUSBAND OF LAUREATE
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By WARREN HOGE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ It was as exotic an offer as a young college graduate
could imagine. Michael Aris, freshly out of Durham University with
an honors degree in modern history, was invited to become the
private tutor of the children of the royal family of the remote
Himalayan Kingdom of Bhutan.
</P>
<P>
   In the six years he was to spend there, he began the intense
acquaintance with the languages, history, art, religion and
literature of the region that was to make him a leading Western
authority on Bhutanese, Tibetan and Himalayan culture.
</P>
<P>
   His death in an Oxford hospital on his 53rd birthday Saturday
drew much attention because he was the husband of the Nobel
Prize-winning Burmese opposition leader Daw Aung San Suu Kyi. But
the academic achievements of the shy and modest Oxford don over
three decades earned him high regard in his own right as a scholar
who combined the study of textual sources with the experience of
firsthand encounters and extensive travel.
</P>
<P>
   It was during his college years that he met his future wife, who
was studying philosophy, politics and economics at Oxford and
staying in the home of a classmate of his whose father was Sir Paul
Gore-Booth, a former British ambassador to Burma. It was in the
Gore-Booths' London home that the couple were married in a Buddhist
ceremony on Jan. 1, 1972, after a courtship maintained largely by
mail between Bhutan and England.
</P>
<P>
   They spent the first year of their married life in Bhutan where
Aris had become, in addition to the royal tutor, the head of the
kingdom's translation department and its official history
researcher.
</P>
<P>
   They came to England a year later for Aris to do postgraduate
studies at the School of Oriental and African Studies of the
University of London and in 1976 moved on to Oxford where Aris
became a junior research fellow at St. John's College and a member
of the university faculty. He obtained a Ph.D. in Tibetan
literature in 1978 from the University of London.
</P>
<P>
   The first 16 years of their life together were spent in academic
pursuits and raising their children, Alexander, born in 1973, and
Kim, born in 1977. Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi studied, wrote and worked
in the Oriental department at the Bodleian Library.
</P>
<P>
   The daughter of her country's independence hero, Gen. Aung San,
who was assassinated in 1947, she expressed a preoccupation with
the future in one of the hundreds of letters she wrote to Aris
before their marriage. ``Sometimes I am beset by fears that
circumstances and national considerations might tear us apart just
when we are so happy in each other that separation would be a
torment,'' she wrote.
</P>
<P>
   That moment arrived in an understated episode that Aris recalled
in a forward to ``Freedom From Fear,'' a 1991 collection of essays
by and about his wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a quiet evening in Oxford, like many others, the last
day of March 1988,'' he wrote. ``Our sons were in bed and we were
reading when the telephone rang. Suu picked up the phone to learn
that her mother had suffered a severe stroke. She put the phone
down at once and started to pack. I had a premonition that our
lives would change for ever.''
</P>
<P>
   She returned home to care for her dying mother and became swept
up in the pro-democracy protests that brought down the government
of the longtime military ruler, Gen. Ne Win. By the time the new
National League for Democracy was elected to power in 1990, only to
be ousted by a uniformed junta, she had become what her husband
called ``an icon of popular hope and longing.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus began years of house arrest, often with all contact with
the outside world cut off, for Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi and strictly
controlled visits to Burma, now called Myanmar, by Aris and the
couple's two sons. She refused to leave for fear of being
permanently exiled by the military authorities.
</P>
<P>
   The last time Aris saw his wife was on a Christmas visit in
1995. Since he discovered two months ago that his prostate cancer
was terminal, he had repeatedly asked permission to pay her a last
visit, and the Burmese regime had turned down every request.
</P>
<P>
   During the years of separation, Aris continued his teaching and
research at Oxford while raising the couple's sons. Both are still
students: Alexander doing graduate work in the United States and
his younger brother an undergraduate in Britain. Polly Friedhoff,
spokeswoman for St. Antony's College at Oxford, where Aris was a
senior research fellow and member of the governing body, said that
the family, in keeping with its wishes to maintain privacy, did not
want to identify the schools publicly. The funeral also is private.
</P>
<P>
   When Burmese authorities blocked his wife from accepting human
rights awards like the Sakharov prize of the European Parliament in
1990 and the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize a year later, Aris and the sons
stood in for her.
</P>
<P>
   Aris convened numerous panels on Himalayan subjects, served in
the leadership of various academic societies, supervised students
doing master's and doctoral degrees and worked in his last years to
set up a specialist Tibetan and Himalayan studies center on a
permanent institutional basis at Oxford. From 1990 to 1992 he was a
visiting professor at Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Vaillancourt Aris was born in Havana, Cuba. His mother,
Josette, was French Canadian, and his English father, John, was an
officer with the British Council, Britain's principal agency for
cultural relations overseas. Michael Aris' identical twin, Anthony,
is a publisher whose house specializes in scholarly books on
Tibetan culture.
</P>
<P>
   According to close friends, Aris was unflinchingly supportive of
his wife's decision and never once complained that she should
abandon the mission and come home.
</P>
<P>
   In his forward to ``Freedom From Fear,'' Aris reflected his
disciplined Buddhist detachment in assessing the circumstances of
his life. ``Fate and history never seem to work in orderly ways,''
he wrote. ``Timings are unpredictable and do not wait upon
conveniences.''

MICROSOFT WILL REORGANIZE INTO 5 UNITS 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Heralding an era he referred to as the ``vision version 2.0,''
the Microsoft Corp.'s president, Steven Ballmer, announced the
reorganization of the company Monday into five divisions that he
suggested would act with some independence.
</P>
<P>
   In a morning teleconference held with his friend, William H.
Gates, who co-founded the company, Ballmer, who became president of
Microsoft eight months ago, said that he was beginning to reinvent
the company, the world's largest independent software maker,
focusing it on initiatives that he said were largely ``customer
driven.''
</P>
<P>
   Ballmer, who has a reputation as a hands-on manager who likes to
burrow deeply into the company's different businesses, said that
the reorganization had nothing to do with the bitter antitrust
lawsuit Microsoft is now fighting with the federal government and
19 states.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not at all,'' Ballmer said in response to a question about
whether the software publisher was simply looking for a new
divisional structure that might facilitate a future breakup
instituted by the Justice Department. He added, ``There's certainly
no breakup of this company into smaller companies that I would find
acceptable, and we're certainly not in any way thinking of that as
a possibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Gates said that it was ``inappropriate'' to comment on
settlement talks with the Justice Department and state attorneys
general that were scheduled to begin Tuesday in Washington. He said
his two objectives going into the discussion were that the
company's Windows operating system retain its integrity and that
the company maintain its ability to add innovations to its
products.
</P>
<P>
   Under the reorganization announced Monday, Microsoft has been
divided into five separate divisions, and two veteran executives
have been named to head its troubled online operations.
</P>
<P>
   These are the five new groups within Microsoft under the
reorganization:
</P>
<P>
   _ The Business and Enterprise Division, which will focus on
software for information technology customers.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Consumer Windows Division, which will focus on developing
Windows for the consumer.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Business Productivity Group, which will focus on products
for so-called knowledge workers, which includes telecommuters and
home-office workers.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Developer Group, which will focus on software developers.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Consumer and Commerce Group, which includes the Microsoft
Network, will focus on bringing consumers and businesses together
on line.
</P>
<P>
   The company also announced an expanded 14-member executive
committee, which analysts said was intended to help decentralize
the management of the giant software company, based in Redmond,
Wash. The group, which will be headed by Gates, will meet monthly
to discuss the company's broad goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hidden between the lines is the reality that this can no
longer continue to be the Bill and Steve show,'' said an executive
who is close to the company.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts generally favored the reorganization, and the stock
market was positive as well, sending the shares up $3.25, to
$92.375, on the first day of trading after a 2-for-1 split.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes a lot of sense,'' said Arthur V. Russell, an analyst
with the brokerage firm of Edward Jones, adding that it would
``allow Microsoft to get closer to its customers.''
</P>
<P>
   Russell said neither investors nor consumers were likely to see
any immediate change from the reorganization. However, he said, if
the reorganization is successful, eventually customers will see
more reliable products and intensified marketing efforts, while
investors could see increased sales and higher returns.
</P>
<P>
   Under the reorganization James Allchin, a technologist, will run
two groups: the Business and Enterprise Division and the Windows
division, aimed at developing the Windows operating system for
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Two other Microsoft veterans, Brad Chase and Jon DeVaan, will
run the Consumer and Commerce Group, and Paul Maritz will supervise
the software-developers group. Robert Muglia will oversee the
division aimed at knowledge workers.
</P>
<P>
   All of the executives named except DeVaan have testified at the
antitrust trial.
</P>
<P>
   Although it was not mentioned Monday, the company's Windows CE
consumer operating system for hand-held computers and set-top boxes
has been split between the Business Productivity Group and the
Consumer and Commerce Group.
</P>
<P>
   Missing from Monday's announcement were two Microsoft veterans
who have played significant roles in the past. Ballmer said that
Brad Silverberg, who had been a key executive both in the company's
Windows desktop business and its Internet effort, had recently
returned to work half-time after a leave of absence and had an
office several doors down from his own.
</P>
<P>
   He said that Silverberg would serve as an adviser to him and
that he was already being peppered with e-mail from him.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, when he was asked why Nathan Myhrvold, who heads the
software publisher's basic research efforts, had not been named to
the company's expanded executive committee, Gates said that
Myhrvold's work had a research and not a business focus.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has until now been organized into three
technology-oriented groups: computer operating systems,
applications, and other activities similar to its online business.
</P>
<P>
   In a series of interviews Monday and during the teleconference,
Ballmer stressed that he was attempting to streamline the company
to make it more responsive to customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I want to talk about is the reinvention of Microsoft,''
he said, adding that the company would now shift its focus to a
changing model of computer technology, one not so radically focused
on the desktop personal computer as Microsoft has been.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has increasingly found itself under attack from
competitors that argue that the computer industry is entering a
post-PC phase and that new growth will largely come in areas in
which Microsoft is not dominant, such as hand-held devices and
wireless appliances. &QL;

 &HT;    Lee to students: Do your own thing
 &HT;    By Plott Brice
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ Spike Lee charmed an audience of mostly University
of Georgia students Monday night even after he had warned them that
he didn't plan to ``be here very long.'' He was well aware that
``CBS Got Game'' and he wanted to see it.
</P>
<P>
   But as Duke and Connecticut neared tip-off time for the NCAA
Championship, Lee still was leaning on the podium and patiently,
and often humorously, answering questions, although by then he had
mentioned the game a few times.
</P>
<P>
   But this standing-room-only crowd of over 1,200 came to hear
America's foremost black director and they didn't seem inclined to
let go.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, raised in Brooklyn and educated at Atlanta's Morehouse
College, didn't bring the controversial baggage that seems to have
followed him since he broke on the scene in 1986 with ``She's Gotta
Have It.'' He didn't shy away when asked sensitive questions, but
he wasn't the attack dog as he is usually portrayed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am here today because of my parents. When (after four years
of school) I told my parents that I wanted to make films, they
encouraged me. You know, most of us are not from well-off families
and parents have to work two shifts and go into hock just to get
you through those four years. And you don't want to come home and
say, `I want to be a poet,''' Lee said as the crowd laughed.
</P>
<P>
   But Lee urged the students to follow through with whatever they
wanted to do, even if it meant ``fighting through whatever guilt''
their families may lay on them.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want to get to that point in life where you end up
saying `I coulda', shoulda' woulda'.' Even if you have to wash
dishes for 10 years, you ought to pursue your goal.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he got the film bug after he had just about completed
his four years at Morehouse, where he majored in mass
communications. He said he considered West Coast graduate schools
like USC and UCLA but they wanted ``astronomical GREs'' that he
didn't have. NYU, a noted film school, didn't require GREs. In
telling that story, his first aside came up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never believed that standardized test scores should be the
only criteria for getting into school. I am not saying you should
do away with them, but that you should consider other things,'' he
said and the crowd seemed to agree.
</P>
<P>
   He took a swipe at the recent Academy Awards, which he called a
joke.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tone was set when Whoopi (Goldberg) came out in white
face. The Academy Awards was a joke. We keep reading about all the
advances African Americans have made in the (industry) and then you
watch the Academy Awards . . .you see it as it is.''
</P>
<P>
   In the question and answer session with the students, Lee
addressed ``He Got Game,'' his story of a relationship between a
father (Denzel Washington) and his basketball-star son (Ray Allen)
that seemed to be a favorite among the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did it because I like sports. I love basketball. I am sure
blacks said `Spike's selling out' because it was so different from
my other movies.''
</P>
<P>
   And he brought the crowd to hysterics. A black student asked him
if he planned to make a true Egyptian movie that showed Egyptians
as people of color. He interrupted the student asking:
</P>
<P>
   ``What's the matter? You don't like Elizabeth Taylor? You don't
think she looks like Cleopatra?''
</P>
<P>
   Lee's new movie, slated for release in July, is ``Summer of
Sam.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After two weeks and more than 1,200 arrests, the last
of the daily protests outside Police Headquarters that have placed
the death of Amadou Diallo at the center of the city's political
consciousness was held Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The final protest took place as the Bronx district attorney
announced that the four police officers who shot Diallo will be
arraigned Wednesday on criminal charges. Three Democratic members
of Congress _ Eliot Engel of the Bronx and Major Owens and Nydia
Velazquez, both of Brooklyn _ were among the 166 people arrested
for civil disobedience. But one protester in particular attracted
the attention of veteran police officers at the scene: William
Bracey, a compact man in a tan three-piece suit and a brown fedora.
</P>
<P>
   Bracey, 79, was the department's chief of patrol from 1979 until
1982. On Monday, he returned to the building where he once held
command to be placed under arrest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really feel I'm obligated to be here,'' said Bracey, a
member of the National Organization of Black Law Enforcement
Executives. ``This is not just a black problem. This is not just a
community problem. This is a people problem, and police officers,
chiefs and whatnot, are people, and we have families, children,
people that will be affected if we don't do something.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking on from the crowd was Carleton Irish, 71, a former
police sergeant who was teamed up with Bracey in 1954 as a rookie
patrolman in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   ``It breaks my heart to see a man like Bill Bracey taken away in
handcuffs,'' said Irish. ``I think he wanted to make a point, that
these are not crazies who hate the police. These are people who
hate what has happened to the Police Department.''
</P>
<P>
   The protests began 15 days ago with a few dozen people chanting,
``No justice, no peace!'' outside 1 Police Plaza, and grew by the
hundreds after Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., and former Mayor David
Dinkins were arrested. It ended on a buoyant note in the sunshine
Monday, as the Rev. Al Sharpton told the protesters they could take
credit for helping force changes in the Police Department and the
city's political discourse.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we started they said it was silly, they said it was a
publicity stunt,'' Sharpton said, echoing the phrases that Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani had used to dismiss the protests. ``The mayor, 15
days ago, said to meet with black officials would be pandering. Now
he's meeting with everybody he can.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor, for his part, sought to balance his remarks on the
protests by expressing his sympathy for the Diallo family, his
support for the Police Department and his anger at the personal
attacks against him. He complained that several protesters held
aloft signs that compared him to Adolf Hitler and the Police
Department to the Ku Klux Klan.
</P>
<P>
   The police union, the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, spent
more than $150,000 on advertisements published in newspapers Monday
denouncing what it called a rush to judgment of the four police
officers involved in the Diallo case and of the department as a
whole. The union has planned a large demonstration of off-duty
police officers for Tuesday outside the Bronx County Courthouse.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the four officers who shot and killed Diallo _
Kenneth Boss, Sean Carroll, Edward McMellon and Richard Murphy _
said they were telephoned by Bronx prosecutors Monday and told to
be prepared to surrender their clients for arrest Wednesday morning
at an undisclosed location.
</P>
<P>
   The Bronx district attorney, Robert Johnson, said in a statement
that an indictment would be unsealed Wednesday. The statement did
not say what the charges would be, but a law enforcement official
and a lawyer connected to the case who spoke on the condition of
anonymity have said the four officers would be indicted on charges
of second-degree murder in the Feb. 4 shooting.

SPORTS COLUMN: OUR FORGOTTEN NATIVE 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   It's the fish, stupid!
</P>
<P>
   Last year's New York state Department of Environmental
Conservation survey indicates that the number of anglers is
declining. The demographic reality of our future flyfishers
indicates that they are not particularly geared to sitting about in
sedentary discussion of the relative worth of dubious fly patterns,
cane-rod workmanship or the minutiae of method. Lamentably, they
have been reared, even more than my generation, on rock-and-roll
music, audio-visual stimulation, extreme sports, and instant
gratification.
</P>
<P>
   Take children flyfishing for stocked trout on public water in
the East and watch as their attention span shrinks with every
passing minute. Take the same children to a warm-water fishery with
aggressive wild smallmouth along with the other ``fish in the
'hood'' _ rock bass, fall fish, sunfish _ and they will have a
blast. More important, they will be hooked on flyfishing for life.
</P>
<P>
   The ethereal jump to a dedicated concern for the environment and
a quest for understanding the wonders and relationships of the
natural world will inevitably follow, but first you have to get
their attention.
</P>
<P>
   Living and guiding in the northwest corner of Montana for almost
a quarter century, I became well acquainted with the activity of
wild fish in their native habitats. West Slope cutthroats and
Columbia red band rainbows would regularly be slandered as dumb
because of their bold propensity to hit any fly offered, while
``experts'' from points east would proclaim their stocked fish more
intelligent because of their selectivity and wary demeanor.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the reality is that wild trout are by natural
selection genetically engineered to make the most of the short
growing season of their high-altitude, natural environments, while
hatchery stockies have become behaviorally altered and genetically
retarded by the manipulations of man. To the unenlightened, the
poorer the fishery, the smarter its fish become.
</P>
<P>
   Forget stocked trout. River smallmouth or black bass in the
eastern United States are the wild freshwater fish of the
flyfishing future, the new wave, Generation X, millennium fish, the
fin de siecle uebertrout. They represent a direct, yet long ago
broken, hyperlink to the past in our North American flyfishing
heritage.
</P>
<P>
   Most modern-day flyfishers have encountered smallmouth bass as
merely an incidental side catch in the pursuit of trout on the
cusp, or transition, sections between cold- and warm-water
fisheries. Catching unimpressive, diminutive (9-ounce) specimens on
6 weight, or heavier, trout rods would be the equivalent to
flyfishing for trout with a stiff saltwater rod. What gratification
is there fishing with a telephone pole?
</P>
<P>
   But when you make river smallmouth your quest, gear up with
light 3 or 4 weight rods and angle in their prime habitat _ steep
gradient, warm water rivers and kills with rocky pocket water and
cascading ledge pools _ then and only then will you experience
their true potential.
</P>
<P>
   Smallmouth are smashmouth-aggressive attack dogs. Throw a
streamer fly or leech pattern in pocket water and two or three will
bolt out to ambush it. Twitch an attracter pattern in feigned
helplessness as it drifts over a deep pool and await an explosive
take. Smallmouth inhabit the same lies and holding areas that
customarily hold trout; look for them on the slow-water side of
current seams, beneath foam lines, the undercut banks, behind the
rock, lurking below the underwater ledge, hiding beneath the debris
in an eddy, the downstream side of a gravel bar.
</P>
<P>
   Smallmouth's original range stretched from Minnesota and the
Dakotas, included the Mississippi drainage south to the Ozarks, the
Tennessee River, the Ohio River and all of the Great Lakes and
their tributaries, all the way east to the grand cataracts of the
St. Lawrence. They readily invaded the Mohawk and Hudson watersheds
with the opening of the Erie Canal, and further railroad stockings
continued to spread them to their present distribution.
</P>
<P>
   Flyfishing for river smallmouth provides the closest freshwater
equivalent in the East to what I would term Montana Action: The
reaches where they are most abundant are practically deserted, and
you will have them to yourself. River smallmouth for the majority
of fly-fishermen have truly been our forgotten other native.

EDITORIAL: SAFEGUARDING NUCLEAR SECRETS 
</HEADLINE>
  (fb) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Tuesday, March 30:
</P>
<P>
   Top officials of the Energy and Justice Departments and the Los
Alamos National Laboratory were amazingly careless in their
handling of a scientist suspected of stealing nuclear secrets for
China, judging from two reports last week by The Times' James
Risen.
</P>
<P>
   It was in June 1996 that the Federal Bureau of Investigation
began investigating Wen Ho Lee, a Taiwanese-born American citizen,
for possibly leaking nuclear weapons designs to China. Yet for more
than two years, Lee maintained his top level security clearance,
was assigned to highly sensitive weapons work and was even briefly
allowed to employ a Chinese citizen as a research assistant.
</P>
<P>
   FBI officials initially seemed more concerned with not tipping
off their suspect to the investigation than they were with keeping
him away from additional weapons secrets. Even after the FBI told
the Energy Department that Lee could be removed from weapons work,
he kept his job and his security clearances for more than another
year. He was finally dismissed this month.
</P>
<P>
   Energy Secretary Bill Richardson has promised strict new
security procedures for the weapons labs. Congress will rightly
hold him to that promise. But the changes must be carefully
targeted.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional proposals to discourage exchange programs with
foreign labs, for example, could actually weaken America's nuclear
security. Visits to U.S. labs help Russian scientists learn new
technologies for dismantling Moscow's nuclear arsenal. These same
programs also allow American scientists into Russia's and China's
hitherto secret weapons facilities. Care must be taken to keep
foreign visitors from unauthorized snooping. But the exchange
programs themselves should be extended, not curbed.
</P>
<P>
   The most important change needed is much more careful selection,
training and supervision of employees in weapons design and
simulation. More thorough background checks should be carried out
and clearances promptly lifted when there is serious suspicion of
misconduct. The Clinton administration must move wisely to protect
vital secrets.

ON BASEBALL: HAUNTING WHAT-IF LEFT FOR TALENTED CUBANS
</HEADLINE>
   (With BBO-TV-SPORTS) 
(nk) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA _ The baseball commissioner and the owner of the
Baltimore Orioles sit on either side of Fidel Castro for 11
innings, talking baseball like good buddies, and eat his food and
drink his wine as he spends hours showing off his knowledge of the
game. Other major league officials and team owners show off color
pictures taken of them with the world's longest-running despot and
can't wait to get home to display them for their friends.
</P>
<P>
   But Omar Linares has not had, nor will he ever have, the chance
to show that his five Cuban League batting championships, each with
an average over .400, were worthy of a job as a third baseman with
a major league team. Jose Contreras struck out 10 Baltimore batters
and shut them out on two hits for eight innings on Sunday, but he
will never get to test his wily pitching and sharp scouting eye in
the majors.
</P>
<P>
   Linares, Contreras and their friends are condemned to a what-if
future: what if Castro had allowed them the opportunity to play
with Mark McGwire and Roger Clemens and not just against
overmatched amateurs in tournaments around the world? They will
never know what might have been.
</P>
<P>
   Their situation, however, does not stop Major League Baseball
from going to Cuba in an effort to open a window, to improve
relations between the countries. But what good is improving
relations if the plight of the Cuban players is not improved?
</P>
<P>
   And while officials and owners ate Castro's pork and lobster at
the National Palace last Saturday night, children asked for bubble
gum on the crumbling streets of Old Havana. They were not the
children of the players _ the stars, after all, do receive elite
treatment, using the term relatively _ but they were the children
of the players' fans and future fans themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball people were impressed with the Cuban team that nearly
sent the Orioles home in shame. Not all of the players on the team
could play in the majors, but some of them could, just as the
Hernandez half brothers do and just as Tony Oliva and Perez did.
</P>
<P>
   The opportunity to see the Cuban team, Chuck LaMar of Tampa Bay
said Monday while waiting for the flight off the island, was not
just special but ``extremely special.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They've lost players over the past few years because of the
defections they've had,'' LaMar, the Devil Rays' general manager,
said, ``but it's obvious that the flow of talent continues. For a
baseball man, it was an honor to be able to see them play on their
home turf, to see that they still have the abilities that we all
thought they have.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Beattie, the Montreal Expos' general manager, was impressed
that the Cubans were not awed by the professional major leaguers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were fouling off pitches, good major league pitches,''
Beattie, a former pitcher, said. ``They were able to battle and put
the ball in play.''
</P>
<P>
   The pitchers, he added, didn't give in to the hitters, at least
not after Charles Johnson hit a 3-0 fastball for a second-inning
home run.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said no more of that,'' Beattie said. ``They were
throwing 3-0 breaking balls. They had a strikeout- throw-out double
play on a breaking ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Contreras walked Will Clark intentionally to pitch to Albert
Belle, a move unheard of in the States. But Belle promptly grounded
to third base for the start of an inning-ending double play.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't only that he hit into a double play,'' Beattie
noted, ``but they had him played the way they were going to pitch
him. The guy was right down the line.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Angelos, the Orioles' owner, said other teams would go to
Cuba in the future. The Yankees could be next because Cuban fans
want to see the Yankees. And the Cuban team will play in Baltimore
on May 3, then perhaps in New York and other cities as relations
continue to thaw.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Cuban system, it will remain the same as long as
Castro lives. Based on his performance last weekend, that might be
forever.
</P>
<P>
   Beattie told of Castro's triple-header Sunday: the 11-inning
game, an evening reception for baseball people and a post-midnight
reception, lasting until 3 or 4 in the morning, for musicians who
were here for a festival.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were probably 300 or 400 people there,'' Beattie said.
``You all stood in line and met him. It wasn't just that you
introduced yourself and walked on. He had something to say to
everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   An impressive man, at 72, no doubt. But his 40-year-old system
is less impressive and he has failed his favorite people, his
baseball players.

MCI WORLDCOM SAID TO BE INVESTING $200 MILLION in WIRELESS DEAL 
 (fb) 
 By SETH SCHIESEL    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MCI Worldcom Inc., seeking advanced wireless Internet links, is
investing about $200 million in what is incongruously known as the
wireless cable business, executives close to the plans said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   MCI Worldcom is the No. 2 long-distance phone company, after
AT&AMP;T, and the No. 1 Internet carrier. Even so, it has become
frustrated in trying to use lines owned by the Bell local phone
companies to connect to its customers.
</P>
<P>
   The Bells must lease their lines to other companies that want to
use them, and the Bells say that process is easy. The Bells'
competitors, including MCI Worldcom, almost invariably contend that
the process is arduous and expensive.
</P>
<P>
   So, the executives close to the transactions say, MCI Worldcom
is buying the shares and bonds of four so-called wireless cable
operators: CAI Wireless Systems Inc., CS Wireless Systems Inc., the
People's Choice TV Corp. and Wireless One Inc. Control of those
companies could allow MCI Worldcom to avoid using the Bells in some
places.
</P>
<P>
   CNBC, the cable television channel, first reported the plans
Monday. It said the company might have already spent as much as
$300 million to $400 million, but executives close to the deals
said MCI Worldcom had committed only about $200 million to the
initiative.
</P>
<P>
   The companies in which MCI Worldcom is investing have tried to
use wireless technology to transmit signals from the television
stations that most consumers view using cable. Though
direct-broadcast satellite systems have proven effective, the
land-based wireless technology embraced by the wireless cable
operators never proved broadly cost-effective for transmitting
television signals. Nevertheless, MCI Worldcom apparently believes
that the spectrum owned by the wireless cable operators could be
used efficiently to transmit Internet data.
</P>
<P>
   CS Wireless, People's Choice and Wireless One are all in
financial trouble, and control of those companies may lie in their
bonds, rather than in their shares, allowing MCI Worldcom to
accumulate control through the traditionally secretive corporate
debt market. As for CAI, executives close to the deals said
securities regulations would soon force MCI Worldcom to disclose a
large investment in that company's stock.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to gain control of the wireless cable carriers cheaply
and quietly would be a move typical of Scott D. Sullivan, MCI
Worldcom's chief financial officer, who has developed a strong
financial reputation in the telecommunications industry for his
swift seizing of opportunities and his delivery of consistent
earnings.

A MANIC DAY FOR DODGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   JUPITER, Fla. _ The Los Angeles Dodgers' muddy roster situation
became clearer Monday, one week before the team's opening day.
</P>
<P>
   The club placed pitcher Antonio Osuna and infielder Alex Cora on
the disabled list, retroactive to March 25. Left-handed pitcher
Chris Haney and infielder Scott Livingstone were reassigned to the
minor-league camp and infielder Juan Castro and catcher Angel Pena
were sent to Triple-A Albuquerque. Also, right-handed reliever Doug
Bochtler elected to become a free agent.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest roster decision is whether the team carries two or
three catchers. General manager Kevin Malone said that won't be
decided until Saturday or Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   But if the Dodgers elect to go with three catchers, they would
be leaning toward using four outfielders until they can get their
catching corps down to two, which most likely would be Todd Hundley
and Rick Wilkins. Paul LoDuca remains in the mix although Pena
impressed manager Davey Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told Angel I like him, but if I wasn't able to catch him
half the time, I didn't want him sitting,'' Johnson said. ``I like
everything he does. Calls a good game, a good catcher, a good
thrower. I'm not going to bring him up so he can catch three days a
week.''
</P>
<P>
   Malone said the Dodgers would likely go with seven infielders.
That group is all but set. The starters are third baseman Adrian
Beltre, shortstop Mark Grudzielanek, second baseman Eric Young and
first baseman Eric Karros, and there are only three other healthy
infielders in camp _ Jose Vizcaino, Dave Hansen and Tripp Cromer.
</P>
<P>
   Cora is also still considered in camp, but he broke his right
hand two weeks ago and won't be ready for another two to four
weeks. Hansen apparently survived despite hitting .205 while his
main competitor, Livingstone, hit .364.
</P>
<P>
   In the outfield, the quartet is obviously Gary Sheffield, Devon
White, Raul Mondesi and Todd Hollandsworth.
</P>
<P>
   Osuna, who is yet to pitch this spring because of since-subsided
soreness in his pitching elbow, is eligible to come off the
disabled list April 9. The Dodgers want him to pitch in five or six
games before they activate him.
</P>
<P>
   Malone said the Dodgers would try to head west Wednesday with 31
players, needing to cut down to 25 after Sunday's exhibition with
the Yankees. He said he would try to find major-league jobs for
Haney and Livingstone via a minor-league trade.
</P>
<P>
   Hubbard to Blue Jays?: If the Dodgers elect to start the season
with two catchers, which would mean five outfielders, it could be
Jacob Brumfield beating out incumbent Trenidad Hubbard. If that
happens, Hubbard could wind up with the Toronto Blue Jays.
</P>
<P>
   Sources said the Blue Jays have kept an eye on Hubbard. Toronto
is in the market for a fourth outfielder and Hubbard could fit that
role.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Dodgers and Blue Jays would have to work out a deal
for the trade to happen since the Dodgers won't release Hubbard.
</P>
<P>
   Hubbard, who missed more than two weeks with thumb and shoulder
injuries, is hitting .100 this spring. The speedy Brumfield, who
played for Johnson in Cincinnati, is hitting .293.
</P>
<P>
   Balks, walks and chalk: Pitching coach Charlie Hough said
pitcher Ismael Valdes would start for the Dodgers against the
Angels on Friday at Edison Field. Carlos Perez and Darren Dreifort
are also slated to pitch against the Angels.... Reliever Jeff
Williams is scheduled to pitch for the Dodgers today as they
continue to search for a left-hander in the bullpen.

WRITERS' DEN PUTS SQUEEZE ON TYPISTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (fb) 
 By CLYDE HABERMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ You don't need a military historian to tell you who
is winning the typographical wars. You know the answer. Bit by bit
_ byte by byte? _ computers have pushed typewriters to the same
musty shelf where you'll find buggy whips, bottles of cod-liver oil
and, any day now, New York City subway tokens.
</P>
<P>
   Still, if you look carefully, you can spot bands of typewriter
holdouts here and there, dedicated souls who refuse to give up the
fight. It's hard not to think of those grizzled Japanese soldiers
who burrowed deep in the jungles of the Philippines and stayed
there for decades after World War II was over.
</P>
<P>
   One redoubt is finding itself under fire, a small group of
typewriter users who fear they are about to be declared personae
non gratae at, of all places, the Writers Room in Greenwich
Village.
</P>
<P>
   Is it possible in this hypersensitive age to be technologically
incorrect? These typists believe that is what they have become, and
even though others say their concern is overblown, they feel about
as welcome as FBI agents at a Gotti family picnic.
</P>
<P>
   In case you do not know the Writers Room, it is a quiet haven
for novelists, playwrights, historians, cookbook writers, you name
it. It came into being in 1978 when refugees from the Frederick
Lewis Allen Memorial Room, an exclusive writers' retreat in the New
York Public Library, decided that the city needed a more democratic
sanctuary for scribblers to do whatever it is scribblers do,
including taking a nap while waiting for the Muse to alight on
their shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   ``The purpose of the Room was to deny no writer the opportunity
to write,'' said Roberta Brandes Gratz, an urban historian who was
an original Roomster, along with well-known authors like Nancy
Milford and Lois Gould. The Writers Room now occupies a loft at 10
Astor Place above a Barnes &AMP; Noble store and Astor Wines and
Spirits, an admirable combination for a writers' hangout, you might
say: books and booze.
</P>
<P>
   The first members were mostly typewriters users. But now the
computer is king, and many laptoppers cannot endure the steady
clackety-clack from the half-dozen or so surviving typists (which
is kind of funny, given how insufferable Roomsters initially found
the R2D2 blips and squawks of the computers).
</P>
<P>
   So the typists were banished to a room of their own, where they
still bang away in splendid isolation on their Royals and
Smith-Coronas. On the main floor, only the faint clicking of
laptops pokes through the hush. Any new typist wishing to become a
member _ and none is now on the waiting list _ has to agree to use
a silent machine.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like peace in our time.
</P>
<P>
   But the technological entente is crumbling because of a problem
familiar to any New Yorker: lack of space.
</P>
<P>
   The Writers Room has some 300 members, with 100 more people,
computer types, clamoring to get in. Where to put them? Looking
around, the administrators laid eyes on the special room for the
typists, who do not always show up. There it was, the computer's
new frontier.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not some sort of prejudice against typewriters,'' said
Donna Brodie, the Room's executive director. ``There is simply an
imbalance in the service that's provided. There's a real-estate
crisis in New York, and young writers have nowhere to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Some laptoppers complain that if anything, it is the typists who
consider themselves a privileged caste. Not so, the typists reply.
They feel the atmosphere has turned hostile, and are convinced the
goal is to squeeze them out even if the Room's president, Tom
Shachtman, says nothing has been decided.
</P>
<P>
   Why cling so hard to an obviously outdated technology?
</P>
<P>
   ``The perfection I see on the computer screen I find
dangerous,'' Lois Gould said. ``It looks good, therefore you think
it's right.''
</P>
<P>
   Another writer, Frances Whyatt, said the typewriter ``slows you
down enough to make you better,'' a point echoed by a younger
typist, Corey Sabourin, at work on his first novel. ``When I revise
a chapter,'' he said, ``I'm basically retelling the story to myself
instead of cutting and pasting the way you do with a computer. It
brings me deeper into the work.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Shachtman insists no one is looking ``to do any behavior
modification whatsoever,'' the typewriter users are not so sure.
``There's this irrational exuberance for technology,'' Sabourin
said. But, he cautioned, ``one size does not fit all.''

FUTURE OF SUPERMARKET HAS VILLAGE IN AN UPROAR 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By CLAUDIA ROWE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WARWICK, N.Y. _ Those who insist that big business always wins,
who believe that concrete and asphalt are destined to inherit the
earth, have never witnessed the power of well-placed raffia ribbons
and certainly have never lived in a place like this.
</P>
<P>
   For the last decade, people in Warwick have been debating the
future of their Grand Union supermarket with a level of passion
more often reserved for presidential elections. The fight became so
intense recently that the mayor lost his job over it.
</P>
<P>
   To hundreds of residents of this idyllic Orange County village
of 6,000, the fate of their only downtown supermarket _ whether it
should modernize and move into a strip mall proposed for a plot of
farmland, or remain an old-fashioned Main Street grocery _ had come
to symbolize the fate of small-town America. And perhaps because so
many of those residents had just fled nearby Rockland County and
northern New Jersey for tiny, rural Warwick, they were prepared to
fight the specter of suburbanization to the end.
</P>
<P>
   So scores of these newer, commuter residents _ advertisers,
lawyers, public relations specialists and artists _ made phone
calls, printed fliers on home computers and fastened green ribbons
of protest to their neighbors' trees and mailboxes. On March 16,
calling themselves the Green Ribbon Group, they helped spur the
largest voter turnout in Warwick's history, defeating Mayor Frank
Lacalamita, a 24-year veteran of town and village offices, and
winning a majority on the village board. They have effectively
stopped Grand Union from building on the farmland, and are working
on plans to control Warwick's future growth.
</P>
<P>
   But in the process, they have antagonized many lifelong village
residents, who say they have been waiting for years to get more
jobs and businesses to add to the tax base.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my opinion, Warwick's a hick town and it's got to grow,''
said Leo McGovern, a retired postal worker who was born and raised
in the village and considers its quaint roadside farms nothing but
``dilapidated old buildings.''
</P>
<P>
   Warwick's Main Street would fit better on Cape Cod, he said: ``A
man can't buy a pair of pants or a pair of shoes here. All we have
is craft stores, women's dress stores and that's it. But these
newcomers, with their ribbons and their groups and their
organizations, they don't want nothing to change.''
</P>
<P>
   Similar debates are simmering in many communities across the
nation, and they promise to heat up with the approach of the 2000
elections, in which Vice President Al Gore has signaled that he
will make curbing suburban sprawl a major part of his presidential
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Warwick, sandwiched between the department-store meccas of
northern New Jersey and the shopping centers of Orange County,
seems an unlikely place to take such a stand. Many of its newer
residents, people who commute to jobs in New York City and
Westchester, hardly have time to keep up with their children, let
alone join in village politics.
</P>
<P>
   John Stage, a Warwick native who traveled the world as a
magazine photographer before retiring here, believes it is
precisely their status as outsiders that helps the newcomers
recognize the rarity of a place where merchants know their
customers by name and the hardware store has been selling nails for
100 years.
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Steyer, owner of Warwick's only liquor store, on Main
Street, said: ``Nobody's really against growth. It's just that
somehow, some way, it's got to be controlled, unlike what's
happening all over the rest of America. We want to avoid becoming a
Bergen County or a Long Island, because, frankly, all those towns
end up becoming outhouses.''
</P>
<P>
   The supermarket battle began in the early 1990s, when Grand
Union Co. decided that it needed to expand its store to compete
with a newer Shop-Rite store about a mile away. Contending that
there was not sufficient space on Main Street, Grand Union asked
the village to rezone a 10-acre plot of farmland owned by Orange
County Trust, a Middletown bank, for a strip mall. The supermarket
chain and the bank joined with Pyramid Construction Co., a mall
developer in Ramsey, N.J., for a public relations and advertising
campaign to sell the mall to residents.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first, the attitude here was like, it's inevitable,'' said
Jane Newman, who lives next door to the proposed building site.
``It's developers, and you're a pathetic, lonely voice in the
crowd, so don't even bother. We were fighting the idea that
progress looks like malls. It doesn't have to.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The parcel that looked so attractive to Grand Union was adjacent
to the 160 acres of rolling fields, winding paths and scenic duck
ponds settled in the 18th century by Warwick's founding family, the
Wellings, and bought in 1982 by Ms. Newman, an advertising
executive from New York City, Helen Jones, a food stylist, and
their husbands. For 17 years they had stubbornly guarded their
preserve from builders.
</P>
<P>
   Using Ms. Newman's living room as a command center, hundreds of
residents deluged the mayor with phone calls and letters begging
that the rezoning be denied.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I was moving out of Manhattan to retire in Warwick
and do nothing,'' said Ms. Newman, rewrapping rolls of green ribbon
strewn across her dining room table. ``Certainly not to run a
political campaign. But what blew my mind is the board got nearly
1,000 phone calls and letters on this and they didn't budge. It was
just a complete travesty of democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   So in August, they turned to grass-roots politics, forming the
Green Ribbon Group and supporting Anthony Portelli, who had been
trying to unseat Lacalamita for years.
</P>
<P>
   On Election Day, they mounted a huge get-out-the-vote effort
with volunteers like Stage, 72, who marched up and down a road at 5
a.m. wearing a sandwich board. All three Green Ribbon candidates
were elected to the five-member, nonpartisan village board.
</P>
<P>
   ``This sweep was so unexpected, everybody just went crazy,''
said Stage, who used his home, a former tannery built in 1830, as
election night headquarters for the anti-mall forces. ``There are
all these hardened advertising people coming in from jobs in New
York City just going bonkers.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Grand Union's corporate vice president for public
affairs, Don Vaillencourt, says the chain still plans to move its
supermarket elsewhere in Warwick, even Lacalamita said that ``it
would be an embarrassment'' for the company to continue pushing for
the farm site.
</P>
<P>
   But the former mayor believes that development is inevitable in
Warwick, whose population has increased 30 percent in the last 30
years. ``The village is bursting at the seams right now,'' he said.
``We need a new supermarket that can handle all these people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Keeping the lands open and the farms intact, I have no
question that that's a good idea, but there comes a time when
somebody says: `I don't want to farm anymore. I want to sell my
land and make a profit and go on a vacation.' And why shouldn't
they be able to sell it to a business developer? It's still a free
country.''
</P>
<P>
   And Warwick will no doubt continue to struggle with growing
pains. On Main Street, the post office and library need more space,
and two car dealerships want to move.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason so many of our Main Streets disappear is that they
lose that essential mix of businesses,'' said Carol Bartanowski,
who heads the village's merchant group. ``You can't have a
gift-shop Main Street. You've got to have services people need and
use every day. Once that heart is gone, you can't ever go back.''

ESPN, SI! DAY FOR BASEBALL AND CIGAR AFICIONADOS
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ESPN could not have improved much on its telecast of Sunday's
game between the Baltimore Orioles and the Cuban all-stars short of
hiring Ted Koppel to be host of a town meeting about the production
of deadened baseballs in Fidel Castro's Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Jon Miller and Joe Morgan were in loose, midseason form, showing
their evident immersion in the game, which Baltimore won, 3-2, in
11 innings. It felt like a typical ESPN Sunday night telecast,
largely because the Cuban team was more than competitive, which
freed Miller and Morgan from spending downtime spinning tales of
the great smuggled Cuban cigars they have smoked.
</P>
<P>
   But the game's unusual subtext _ Castro _ was always present
because of the frequent reaction shots of the Cuban president, who
was flanked by Bud Selig, the baseball commissioner, and Peter
Angelos, the Orioles' owner. They reportedly argued about the
revenue chasm between large and small markets. From reading
Castro's lips, I believe he cautioned his guests that they must
share all local television revenues or face economic catastrophe in
Major League Baseball.
</P>
<P>
   When the Orioles scored their third run, Miller said, ``Angelos
is enjoying that more than the local jefe.''
</P>
<P>
   When the game ended, Castro threw up his arms in frustration,
and Miller said, ``I hope he didn't take it personally.''
</P>
<P>
   Jed Drake, ESPN's vice president for remote production, said the
exhibition was a ``unique and magical'' event, from taking Morgan
to a downtown park where the denizens ceaselessly debate baseball
to showing Cuban viewers their players in super slow motion for the
first time.
</P>
<P>
   The day's scene stealer was Conrado Marrero, an aged Cuban who
pitched for the Washington Senators from 1950 to 1954 (he recorded
a 39-40 record) and taught at Cuba's Sports Institute. Called on to
throw out the first pitch, Marrero tossed out seven _ and dared
Brady Anderson to step up to the plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe you, Brady,'' Morgan said. ``You tried to bunt
on an 84-year-old pitcher.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Miller: ``He was nervous. If he swung and hit it back to
the mound, there'd be an international incident.''
</P>
<P>
   The extended first-pitch act was vintage Marrero to Bob Wolff,
the senators' announcer from 1947 to 1961. ``Connie was one of the
Senators' all-time popular players,'' he said. ``He was a wily,
chunky guy, always with a cigar, even on the bench. He could really
make the ball do tricks. He was one of many Cuban players the
senators had. He was an excellent pitcher on a lousy team, a great
character who kept everybody laughing with his jokes and antics.''
</P>
<P>
   A Milestone for Emrick
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's Devils-Penguins game on MSG Network will be Mike
Emrick's 2,000th professional hockey game, dating to his radio days
with the minor league Port Huron (Mich.) Flags on WHLS-AM.
</P>
<P>
   ``The station gave me a red suitcase, which had a two-channel
mixer and a little antenna. And the engineer made a headset for me
out of a coat hanger, with the microphone slipped into an end of
the hanger, which was bent into an eye-screw,'' Emrick said. He
donned that primitive headset for two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Emrick's path led to the Maine Mariners of the American Hockey
League, the Philadelphia Flyers, his first stint with the Devils,
fill-in radio work for Rangers games, ESPN, SportsChannel America,
a second tour with the Flyers, a second hitch with the Devils (now
in its sixth season), CBS and now, Fox.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel very lucky to get to 2,000 because there was a cancer
scare in 1991,'' he said from his home near Port Huron. ``Ernie
Harwell, whom I love listening to up here, said you have to lucky

   Hoops Before War
</P>
<P>
   At 6:58 p.m. Saturday during the Connecticut-Ohio State
semifinal of the National Collegiate Athletic Association men's
basketball tournament, CBS showed good sense in offering a crawl
informing viewers that an American stealth fighter had gone down
over Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   But CBS displayed bad news judgment by not returning to the
breaking story with more complete studio reports. Instead, CBS used
its breaks for commercials, program promos, an interview with Craig
Kilborn, the new host of CBS' ``Late Late Show,'' and a 3-point
shot contest.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, MSNBC, CNN and Fox News Channel showed Serbian video
of the fiery, downed fighter. CBS opted not to let a war interfere
much with March Madness.

TREND IS SEEN OF CLINICS CATERING TO LESBIANS, WHO OFTEN SHUN
HEALTH CARE
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There's always an uneasiness when the doctor wants to
talk about sex, a young woman said at a recent meeting of her
lesbian support group.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, when they ask, `Are you having intercourse?' And you
say, `No,' '' said the woman, with amber skin and a short Afro.
``Then they ask, `So you are not sexually active?' And you say, `I
didn't say that.' Then they ask, `Well what do you do?' And you
have to decide whether to lie or whether to come out.''
</P>
<P>
   Coming out was once the predominant topic for groups like this
one, All the Queens Women, which gathers each month at the borough
hall in Queens. But the issues for these women have evolved. No
longer battling for a voice in the feminist movement, no longer
consumed only with their gay brothers dying of AIDS, lesbians have
turned their attention to their own health.
</P>
<P>
   As the young woman spoke the other night, the discussion leader,
Katherine Strieder, nodded. ``It's a scary choice,'' she said. ``If
you lie, then you may not get the information you need to take care
of yourself. And if you come out, your doctor may become really
uncomfortable with you.''
</P>
<P>
   Experiences like that have forced many lesbians to drop out of
the health care system, experts said, putting them at greater risk
for preventable illnesses and making them more likely to die from
diseases that are treatable if detected early. Many surveys have
found that most lesbians avoid going to the doctor for routine
checkups _ especially gynecological exams _ because of hostility
from doctors, or because they are uncomfortable talking about
issues that may reveal their sexual orientation.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the risks, lesbian health has been virtually ignored by
the medical establishment. But a growing movement, led primarily by
lesbian health care providers and political advocates, has pushed
the issue forward.
</P>
<P>
   Today there are a growing number of health care centers that
cater to lesbians, including two that opened recently in Manhattan:
the Beth Israel Medical Center established the Gay Women's Focus in
Union Square 18 months ago, and the Michael Callen-Audre Lorde
Community Health Center opened in Chelsea a year ago. Callen-Lorde
is the largest primary health care center in the nation devoted to
lesbians, bisexuals, gay men and ``transgenders'' _ an umbrella
term for transsexuals, cross-dressers, hermaphrodites and others
with unconventional sexual identities. Similar centers have opened
in Boston, San Francisco and Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the Institute of Medicine, a division of the
National Academy of Science, issued a report on lesbian health that
urged the federal government to support studies that would identify
conditions for which lesbians are at risk and that would test
long-held myths, including that lesbians are less susceptible to
sexually transmitted diseases and that they are more susceptible to
breast cancer, alcoholism and drug abuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lesbians have gone from an invisible population to a visible
and desirable population,'' said Dr. Jane Petro, a surgeon in
Westchester County. ``Hospitals all over the place are looking into
the idea of opening clinics for lesbians because they are starting
to realize that lesbians have special issues and concerns, and that
it's good business.''
</P>
<P>
   Some lesbian advocates worry that clinics like Callen-Lorde and
the Gay Women's Focus keep lesbian health care at the margins of
the medical community. They say they would rather see more efforts,
like one by Planned Parenthood, to make all health care providers
aware of the concerns of lesbian patients. Planned Parenthood
officials said their program teaches counselors not to assume
patients are heterosexual and uses interviewing techniques that
make it easy for all women to discuss their sexual behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Most agree, however, that until such training spreads, there is
still a need for lesbian health care havens.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course we should not be discriminated against,'' said
Lillian, a 61-year-old patient at the Gay Women's Focus. Like other
lesbian patients, she agreed to be interviewed on the condition
that her last name not be used. ``We should be able to talk openly
about ourselves and our partners with doctors. That would be great.
But that is not the case.''
</P>
<P>
   A few months ago, after Lillian contracted Hepatitis C, she
appreciated being able to talk openly with her doctor about her
lesbian partner. ``I wanted to know whether we could kiss or drink
out of the same glass, not to mention sex,'' Lillian said.
``There's no way I would have asked a straight doctor those
things.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with chronic high blood pressure and asthma, Sandy, a
61-year-old resident of Staten Island, avoided going to the doctor
for years until she found Callen-Lorde. Instead, she said, she used
energy healers and chiropractors.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you tell a doctor, `I am a 61-year-old celibate
lesbian?' '' Sandy said. ``What doctor could handle that?''
</P>
<P>
   Money has also been a barrier. While studies have shown that
women, in general, are less likely than men to have health
insurance, the problem is greater for lesbians because they cannot
depend on husbands with family insurance policies, and lesbians
with health insurance at work are usually unable to add their
partners to their coverage.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, experts said, even many lesbians with insurance
avoided doctors. If they got sick, they often relied on the
grapevine to find sympathetic doctors. Many of those doctors were
themselves lesbians, and their patients' experiences pushed them to
advocate national studies of lesbian health issues.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Joan Waitkovitz, director of the Gay Women's Focus at Beth
Israel, remembers what it was like in the early 1980s when her name
was part of that grapevine. ``There was an unpublished list of
numbers that circulated,'' she recalled. ``Everyone knew the tailor
on Sixth Avenue who would alter a man's suit to fit a woman. And
everyone knew the friendly doctors.''
</P>
<P>
   Until now, almost all studies on lesbian health were small and
financed with grants from the Lesbian Health Fund, established in
1992 by an association of lesbian doctors. Last year, it gave out
30 grants, totaling $200,000.
</P>
<P>
   But now mainstream scientific organizations are underwriting
such research. A Chicago scientist, Tonda Hughes of the University
of Illinois, for example, has started the first federally financed
study of lesbians and alcohol abuse with a $400,000 grant from the
National Institutes of Health.
</P>
<P>
   Some large women's health studies _ the Women's Health
Initiative, a study of more than 100,000 women by the National
Institutes of Health, for example, and a different study by Harvard
University of more than 100,000 nurses _ have also added questions
about sexual orientation to their surveys.
</P>
<P>
   In its January report, the Institute of Medicine identified
cancer and mental health among lesbians as two areas in critical
need of research. Many doctors feel that lesbians may face greater
risks for breast and cervical cancers because they are less likely
than heterosexual women to go through the hormonal changes that
come with having children. And the stresses of living in a world
with widespread homophobia has made mental health a serious
concern.
</P>
<P>
   Callen-Lorde, funded by a $7.6 million dollar state government
bond and $3.5 million in donations, was named after Michael Callen,
the advocate for AIDS causes, and Audre Lorde, the poet who died of
breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The center receives more than 1,000 patient visits a month. At
least half the patients are women, because of an energetic outreach
campaign that includes advertisements in gay newspapers and staff
visits to lesbian community meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Patients at the center pay on a sliding scale according to their
income. Soon, administrators said, the clinic will accept health
insurance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want people to use us as their family doctor, for regular
preventive care,'' said Dean LaBate, executive director of the
center. ``We want to be the health provider of choice, not just the
provider of last resort.''

 ASSIST TO BRADLEY FOR WIFE'S BOOK  
 AN AIDE'S QUIET EXIT 
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By JAMES BARRON with DAN BARRY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ At every book party there is an Academy Awards-like
moment when the author tries to thank everyone who had anything to
do with the just-published work. And so Ernestine Schlant looked
over at the tall man near the door and said, ``Thanks to my
husband, Bill.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bradley _ former basketball star, former U.S. senator,
potential presidential candidate _ smiled. After all, he did have
something to do with the book, besides whatever manuscript-reading
chores he may have undertaken: He is credited with taking the
postage-stamp-size picture of Ms. Schlant on the back of ``The
Language of Silence: West German Literature and the Holocaust.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Schlant, a professor of German and comparative literature at
Montclair State University, said ``The Language of Silence'' had
been a 10-year project. She said she set out to look at how German
writers had looked at the Holocaust, starting with the Cold War and
ending with unification.
</P>
<P>
   Why writers?
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought literature was a more reliable indicator, and Bill
agrees with me so I can say it, than our politics or politicians,''
she said during the party, at Leo Baeck Institute, on 73rd Street
near Lexington Avenue, on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   One of Ms. Schlant's high school classmates was on hand, but the
crowd had a decidedly Princeton flavor, the place where Bradley
first came to basketball prominence. Among those with ties to
Bradley's alma mater were Dr. Ruth Westheimer (whose son went to
Princeton); Steven Cohen (who taught at Princeton before he became
a professor of Russian studies at New York University); Cohen's
wife, Katrina Vanden Heuvel (who graduated from Princeton in 1981
and is the editor of The Nation); John McPhee (who wrote a
biography of Bradley in the 1960s and has taught a course at
Princeton for more than 20 years) and Cornel West (who graduated
from Princeton in 1970 and now teaches at Harvard).
</P>
<P>
   ``She's like a dear sister,'' West said. ``They're very much
like family. We're all pushing for the campaign, but this is nice
because it's a wonderful text on the whole problem of evil in
modernity.'' That led to a discussion of the Amadou Diallo shooting
and what he hoped Bradley would say about it in a forthcoming
speech.
</P>
<P>
   An Aide's Quiet Exit  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For the last four years, Colleen Roche has had one of the
toughest jobs in public relations: press secretary to the always
interesting, sometimes confounding and occasionally volatile Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani. One day she was trumpeting the administration's
crackdown on crime, the next trying to put a positive spin on the
mayor's rocky relations with black and Hispanic officials.
Virtually everything she said was news.
</P>
<P>
   But the days of being on call 24 hours a day are over. Ms.
Roche, 41, is leaving this week to join the public relations firm
of Linden Alschuler &AMP; Kaplan. The move means that she will be able
to spend more time with her husband, Peter Casolaro, a prosecutor
in the office of Robert Morgenthau, the Manhattan district
attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Before going to City Hall, Ms. Roche was communications director
for the State Division of Criminal Justice Services and deputy
press secretary for Morgenthau. Neither job brought her anywhere
near the scrutiny she has received as Giuliani's conduit to _ or
buffer against _ the city's press corps.
</P>
<P>
   The job ``is probably one of the most complex jobs in the United
States,'' Giuliani said during a public farewell Monday. ``Colleen
has handled it with exceptional professionalism, has handled it
with great honesty and integrity. She's done an absolutely superb
job.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Roche complimented her co-workers, then answered a question
not asked but still burning. ``The one thing I will not be doing,''
she said, ``is writing a book.''

MILOSEVIC TRYING FOR SERB-ONLY ENCLAVE, NATO SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to replace first 3 grafs with 6 new grafs that include
information on Primakov's visit to Belgrade.) (See also: KOSOVO-RDP, KOSOVO-PROTECT, KOSOVO-DRONES,

<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ NATO officials said Monday that Slobodan
Milosevic's goal in Kosovo was to carve out a Serb-only enclave in
the province that he could hold onto after the fighting had ended.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the impression that there is a campaign under way to
ethnically re-engineer the inside of Kosovo, to achieve a solution
more acceptable to him,'' said the chief spokesman for NATO, Jamie
Shea.
</P>
<P>
   Although the immediate allied concern is the bombing campaign,
officials are looking beyond it and trying to predict Milosevic's
long-term aims. For eight years, he has proved adept at creating
what diplomats call ``facts on the ground,'' territorial conquests
that end in cease-fires and are presented to the West for
ratification through a peace deal.
</P>
<P>
   Those concerns were heightened Monday with the announcement that
Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov and the foreign and defense
ministers of Russia had been dispatched on a mission to Belgrade,
Yugoslavia. NATO officials feared that the Russians would try to
broker an agreement that could be well short of the allies' stated
goal of an autonomous Kosovo protected by NATO troops.
</P>
<P>
   American officials said Primakov's mission could be part of an
effort to split NATO, because some members have become uneasy over
the prospect of unlimited attacks without results. There have
already been some tensions among the 19-member alliance, with the
Italians and Greeks' expressing doubts about the wisdom of an
extended bombing campaign.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials on Monday denied that the bombing had set off the
Yugoslav military offensive in Kosovo and that it was causing
additional civilian casualties instead of preventing them. Military
and civilian officials here said the Serbs had carefully built up
the forces to launch the offensive over six months.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslav military and police units began driving Albanian
civilians out of towns and villages the day that the peace talks in
France were suspended in late February, the officials said, and
began attacking over large areas of the province in force two weeks
ago, when the talks were called off in failure.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a spontaneous outbreak following NATO's actions,''
Shea said.
</P>
<P>
   A European diplomat said the geographical pattern of the attacks
in Kosovo suggested that Milosevic's police officers and troops
were trying to drive out the ethnic Albanians from lands once
inhabited by Serbs in the north and center of the province.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are ancient Serb monasteries in the center of the
province and industrial development in the north that the Serbs
apparently want to stake permanent claim to,'' the diplomat said.
He speculated that if Milosevic ever did bow to allied demands,
stop the fighting and agree to resume peace talks on a plan for
autonomy for the Albanians, he could claim that the ``ethnically
cleansed'' territory should stay Serbian, no matter what.
</P>
<P>
   The tactic is similar to the one that the allies used in Bosnia
in the war that ended in 1995. Soldiers of one ethnic group drove
people descended from other ethnic origins out of their houses and
then burned the houses to make sure that the refugees would not try
to return. In the Serbian part of Bosnia where that occurred, only
ethnic Serbs stayed or were later resettled in such places to lay
claim to them as Serbian territory.
</P>
<P>
   The allies said Monday that nine villages had been reported set
afire west of Pristina, north and south of the road to Klina, in
the last 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, a spokesman for the allied military commander, Gen.
Wesley Clark, said that ``reliable sources'' had reported that
Fehmi Agami, an adviser to the ethnic Albanian leader, Ibrahim
Rugova, was executed on Sunday. Four other prominent Albanian
leaders, including Baton Haxhiv, were also reportedly executed,
said the military spokesman, Air Commodore David Wilby.
</P>
<P>
   Two regions where allied officials said ``ethnic cleansing'' had
been most intense for two weeks were west and south of Kosovo
Field, where the Serbs were defeated by a Turkish force in 1389 and
gave rise to a powerful and defining historical myth of Serb
martyrdom.
</P>
<P>
   Western officials said Monday that the Serbs had driven 280,000
people from their houses in Kosovo. Large regions to the west and
southwest of the provincial capital, Pristina, in an area roughly
bounded by Djakovica, Malisevo, Urosevac and Prizren, almost to the
Albanian border, and smaller areas between the cities of Klina and
Pec, around Srbica and Glogovac, and between Kosovska Mitrovica and
Podujevo to the north of Pristina, were ``areas of ethnic
cleansing,'' the alliance said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   On Sunday night, officials said, allied warplanes went after a
headquarters that was directing the largest operations and blasted
the internal police headquarters in Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking for the allied military command, which said Monday that
it was intensifying the bombing of the Serbian military and police
headquarters that ordered the attacks, and going after tank and
artillery units in Kosovo around the clock, Wilby said Milosevic
was showing a ``siege mentality.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He believes he can realign his ethnic problems in one week and
that NATO unity will crack in that same period,'' Wilby said.
``Helicopters are being used against the civilian population.
Paramilitaries are entering towns and terrorizing the people,
followed by military and police, who cynically give people leaflets
saying it's safe to leave their homes.''
</P>
<P>
   Refugees were being systematically driven toward Albania, Shea
said, with 60,000 seeking shelter in that impoverished country.
Many refugees, he said, had been forced to surrender identification
papers and passports.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost as if they were being declared nonpersons, making
re-entry into Kosovo that much more difficult,'' he said. ``Whole
towns and cities, including the old center of Pec, have been
totally destroyed.''
</P>
<P>
   A European Union official who deals with refugee problems, Emma
Bonino, conferred with the secretary-general of NATO, Javier
Solana, on Monday and said afterward that it looked as if 80,000 to
100,000 people might be pushed into Albania.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a human tragedy that I would like to underline has
been going on for many years, and in the last year in particular,''
Ms. Bonino said. ``Now we are faced with a new phase of the same
ongoing tragedy and a new phase in the same long-term strategy of
repression.''

 &HT;    CONNECTICUT 77, DUKE 74: UConn believe it, Huskies
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ In 1990, Duke gave the University of
Connecticut the greatest basketball heartache in its history when
it beat the Huskies at the buzzer for a spot in the Final Four.
Monday night in a game that will go down as one of the NCAA
Tournament's greatest upsets, UConn returned the favor in stunning
fashion, beating the seemingly-unbeatable Blue Devils 77-74 to win
the 1999 NCAA championship.
</P>
<P>
   UConn (34-3) snapped Duke's 32-game winning streak with a
determined performance for the ages.
</P>
<P>
   Duke, which was going for its third national title of this
decade, had its chances in the closing seconds. Down 75-74, the
Blue Devils got the ball back after a miss by Khalid El-Amin with
20 seconds left. That's when Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski picked
senior Trajan Langdon to go one-on-one with Augusta's Ricky Moore.
Langdon forced a shot and was called for traveling with 5.4 seconds
left.
</P>
<P>
   El-Amin then made two three throws with 5.2 seconds remaining.
Langdon tried to get off a final three-point shot but end the game
on the floor as time ran out.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing by as many as six, 63-57, with 9:34 to go, Duke finally
clawed its way back and tied the game at 66-66, on Chris
Carrawell's driving shot in the lane with 4:53 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Hamilton put UConn back up two, 70-68, with a pair of
free throws with 3:50 remaining and then stretched the lead to five
with a three-pointer after a turnover by Duke's Will Avery. UConn
still led by four, 73-69, at the two-minute mark.
</P>
<P>
   But Duke climbed back to within one after Carrawell's missed
shot was grabbed by Shane Battier and kicked back out to Trajan
Langdon, who canned a three-pointer with 1:44 left to make it
73-72.
</P>
<P>
   With the shot clocking winding down, Khalid El-Amin scored from
the baseline with 1:05 left to put UConn up by three, 75-72.
</P>
<P>
   Then Avery hit a pair of free throws with 54.1 seconds left to
bring Duke to within one 75-74.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton led all scorers with 27 points while Langdon had 25.
</P>
<P>
   Up 39-37 at halftime, Duke expanded its lead to five, 46-41, on
Brand's layup with 17:58 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   But UConn simply would not go away, rallying to tie the game
49-49 on a pair of free throws by Hamilton with 14:47 remaining.
The score tied two more times before UConn took a four-point lead,
57-53, on a basket by Albert Mouring with 12:35 left in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Still up by two, 59-57, Hamilton knocked down a 3-point shot off
a fast break and Duke failed to score on two straight possessions.
After a free throw by Edmund Saunders, UConn had its largest lead
of the game, 63-57, with 9:34 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   But Duke, the ACC champions, kept fighting back and climbed
within two, 65-63, on Chris Carrawell's 15-footer with 7:28
remaining, and the stage was set for the final dramatic minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Duke jumped out to a 9-2 lead in the first 3:17 of the game, and
then Augusta's Ricky Moore got hot, scoring nine of UConn's next 13
points. The Huskies put together a 15-4 run in just over four
minutes to take a 17-13 lead with 12:29 remaining in the period.
</P>
<P>
   Duke came back with a 10-1 run of its own, fueled by another
Augusta native, Will Avery, who scored five straight points. The
Blue Devils led 23-18 with 11:09 left.
</P>
<P>
   But UConn would not wilt under the Duke pressure as the Huskies
came right back to tie the score at 24-24 on Richard Hamilton's
bucket at the 8:25 mark.
</P>
<P>
   UConn took another four-point lead, 36-32, on Hamilton's basket
with 1:29 left, but it would not last.
</P>
<P>
   Duke's Langdon hit a long 3-pointer at the top of the key and on
the Blue Devils' next possession, made another 3-point shot with
Moore literally hanging on to him. Langdon was awarded a free
throw, which he made to covert the four-point play and put Duke up
39-36 with 24.1 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton added a free throw with 1.7 seconds left and Duke held
held a 39-37 lead at the intermission.
</P>
<P>
   Moore ended the half with 13 points after hitting 6 of 8 shots
from the floor. UConn handled the Duke defense well enough to shoot
53.1 percent from the floor (17 of 32).

   WASHINGTON _ If NATO nations ordered ground troops to Kosovo, a
force of 30,000 to 40,000 troops could be assembled in days and
would be sufficient to protect many refugees from further attack,
according to several current and former American commanders.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials have emphasized they are not planning to send
ground troops into Kosovo, but American generals had estimated that
any ground action would require as many as 200,000 soldiers to
quell the fighting, a force that would not be ready for months.
Thus far, allied political leaders have balked at committing even a
single soldier to combat in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   The commanders said the smaller number of troops, backed by air
power, could sweep into the besieged province and create safe
havens for the tens of thousands of ethnic Albanian refugees who
are fleeing Serbian attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. George Joulwan, who retired in 1997 as NATO's military
commander, said that a 12,000-member European force in Macedonia
poised to enter force any Kosovo if a peace agreement, could take
on a new mission within seven to 14 days.
</P>
<P>
   Some 2,200 Marines aboard ships in the Adriatic could respond
even quicker. Additional NATO forces could flow in from bases in
Europe and the United States over the next few weeks, depending on
road and port conditions. A 1,200-member American reinforced
infantry battalion is based in Italy. In Bosnia, 8,200 troops from
the elite 1st Cavalry Division in the international peacekeeping
force could be tapped.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have to go all the way to Belgrade,'' Joulwan said
in a telephone interview from Madrid. ``You'd give that force
limited objectives, create a corridor, focus on the refugees and
save some lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Even a scaled-back NATO operation would have to overcome the
deep reluctance of the Clinton administration and NATO to push for
a mission that greatly increases the likelihood of casualties.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of the situation's military urgency, the Joint Chiefs
of Staff met Monday on short notice for about an hour to weigh
developments in Kosovo. A Pentagon official, who spoke on the
condition of anonymity, said if ground forces were discussed, it
was only in passing.
</P>
<P>
   While confronting the approximately 40,000 Yugoslav troops in
and around Kosovo would pose enormous risks, a NATO force of equal
size would have several advantages, the commanders said.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavia's infantry and armored forces are untested against
well-trained NATO troops, and would be the targets of a withering
air attack. Its heavy weapons would come under fierce attack from
allied artillery and tanks, which are trained to engage the enemy
from miles away.
</P>
<P>
   And with NATO warplanes controlling Serbian skies and bombing
supply, fuel and communication lines, Yugoslav forces would be cut
off and isolated from reinforcements, military experts say. NATO's
edge in intelligence and reconnaissance would also give the allied
forces important advantages.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're credible, but we shouldn't be overawed by their
army,'' said Lt. Gen. William Carter III, a retired chief of staff
of Southern NATO forces who helped direct the allied operation in
Bosnia. ``In many cases, our respect has been translated into
making them taller than they are. I'm not convinced we need the
size forces that people are talking about.''
</P>
<P>
   Adm. Leighton Smith, a former commander of southern NATO forces,
agreed: ``It's entirely possible you might be willing to take a
geographic area and make it a demilitarized zone. That might
require a much smaller force than one to eject the Serb army from
Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   Virtually all of these former commanders, as well as several
current ranking officers, said at the very least, NATO and
administration officials should not be so adamant about ruling out
a ground campaign, if nothing else than to give President Slobodan
Milosevic pause.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've telegraphed that we're not prepared to come in on the
ground, and that's coloring his reaction to the air campaign,''
said one senior Army general. ``Milosevic figures he can string
this out, and see if the NATO alliance cracks.''
</P>
<P>
   While political leaders continue to rule out ground forces
publicly, there are signs that allied officials are leaving the
door ever so slightly ajar for a ground option. Asked Monday if any
contingency planning was under way for land forces, NATO spokesman
Jamie Shea said, ``Not for the time being.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Army logisticians on their own conducted a detailed
assessment of what American forces in a Kosovo operation might
need, patterning such a contingency on the four-year-old
peacekeeping mission in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking at how you link things in Bosnia like supply
lines and electronic lines, into the theater in Kosovo,'' said one
senior officer. ``We haven't received any official directive to do
this. It's just prudent planning.''
</P>
<P>
   Without a peace agreement, NATO ground forces would face a
daunting set of perils. Between 17,000 and 20,000 Yugoslav troops
now occupy Kosovo, an area the size of Connecticut, with another
20,000 soldiers outside the region.
</P>
<P>
   These forces are equipped with more than 400 tanks, 300 armored
personnel carriers and more than 400 artillery pieces in the field,
or in garrison, Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Only 14 roads lead into Kosovo, Bacon said, two from Macedonia,
and these roadways and bridges are pocked with land mines.
Surface-to-air missiles still threaten NATO aircraft. In addition
to regular army forces, there are roving paramilitary groups that
could threaten NATO forces with guerrilla or terrorist attacks.
</P>
<P>
   A NATO operation forcibly entering Kosovo would have to
anticipate all these threats. Last fall, NATO determined in a
confidential assessment it would take 200,000 troops to invade and
occupy Kosovo, and several weeks to muster those troops.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, President Clinton remains opposed to using
ground troops to supplement the air strikes, despite growing calls
for him to do so.
</P>
<P>
   But some administration officials say the real hurdle to sending
ground forces is political, not military. The administration has
not prepared the American public, Congress or its NATO allies for a
protracted, even if limited, ground operation.
</P>
<P>
   Few, if any, American officials predicted Milosevic's defiantly
brutal response. As a result, administration officials acknowledge
there has been little formal planning for a ground option.
</P>
<P>
   ``We miscalculated,'' conceded one administration official who
is deeply involved in the crisis. ``We thought when the bombing
started Milosevic would play the victim, not turn into Adolph
Hitler Jr.''
</P>
<P>
   With reports of atrocities mounting and hundreds of thousands of
refugees on the move, pressure to launch a ground operation may be
inexorable if the air campaign fails to stop the Yugoslav
offensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the killings continue, how can you have 12,000 NATO troops
5 to 10 miles from where the atrocities are being committed, and do
nothing?'' Joulwan asked.
