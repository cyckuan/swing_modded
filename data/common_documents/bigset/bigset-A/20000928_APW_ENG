<HEADLINE> Attempted Chinese Hijacking Foiled  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- A man who attempted to hijack a Chinese domestic
airliner was killed by on-board security using the hijacker's own
knife, an airline spokesman and state media reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The plane's pilot and co-pilot were injured in the botched
hijacking Wednesday morning, but no passengers were hurt and the
plane landed safely, the Beijing Youth Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
   The man entered the cockpit brandishing a knife and what
appeared to be a handgun about five minutes after the Beijing-bound
Xinhua Airlines flight took off from Baotou, in China's Inner
Mongolian region, the newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
   An airline spokesman who declined to give his name confirmed the
newspaper's account:
</P>
<P>
   The man demanded the plane, a Boeing 737, fly south, but grew
agitated as fuel on board began to run low. He stabbed the pilot
and co-pilot with his knife. Desperate security officers and crew
members, aided by two passengers, then assaulted the hijacker,
breaking his gun, which they then discovered to be fake.
</P>
<P>
   In the ensuing struggle, the man was beaten with a police club
and stabbed with his own weapon, dying on the spot, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
   The plane then landed at the closest airport, in the city of
Jinan, about 190 miles south of Beijing, just over two hours after
taking off. All 143 passengers were safe, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The paper ran a photo of what it said was the dead hijacker, his
hands and face covered in blood.
</P>
<P>
   China Central Television's Web site gave the surname of the
hijacker as Li, and said he was a 33-year-old unemployed man from
Baotou.
</P>
<P>
   The reports and airline spokesman gave no further details and
did not specify the hijacker's intended destination.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese hijackers have in the past mostly demanded to be flown
to Taiwan, Beijing's rival in an unfinished civil war, which lies
about 1,000 miles southeast of Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   China strengthened airport security following a series of
hijackings to Taiwan in the early 1990s. But hijackings still
occur. On Jan. 29 this year, a man with a knife and a gasoline bomb
tried to commandeer a domestic flight bound for the southern city
of Fuzhou to Taiwan but the crew stopped him.

<HEADLINE> Anna Nicole Smith Awarded $449.7M  </HEADLINE>
By DENISE PETSKI
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A federal bankruptcy judge awarded former
Playboy Playmate of the Year Anna Nicole Smith $449.7 million
Wednesday in her claim to the estate of her late billionaire
husband, Texas oilman J. Howard Marshall.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Samuel Bufford ruled that Marshall's
youngest son, E. Pierce Marshall, had deprived Smith ''of her
expectancy of an inheritance.''
</P>
<P>
   Her attorney, Philip Boesch Jr., said Smith was ''very pleased''
and believes the ruling ''puts the matter to rest.''
</P>
<P>
   Marshall called the ruling a ''miscarriage of justice'' and said
he would appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Bufford's decision came just a day before jury selection was
scheduled to begin in probate court in Houston, in a dispute over
the validity of Marshall's will, which left all of the oilman's
estate to his youngest son. That case pits both Smith and
Marshall's disinherited elder son, J. Howard Marshall III, against
E. Pierce Marshall.
</P>
<P>
   Smith testified last year that E. Pierce Marshall defrauded her
of between $556 million and $820 million she was entitled to as her
share of her late husband's estate.
</P>
<P>
   The former model for Playboy, Guess jeans and other magazines
and advertisements, was working as a stripper at a topless bar in
Houston when she met Marshall. She was 26 and he was 89 when they
were married in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   He died in 1995 at age 90, leaving behind a fortune estimated at
as much as $1.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who uses her married name of Vickie Lynn Marshall in
court documents, claims her husband intended she would receive half
of his estate.
</P>
<P>
   ''He wanted to make me happy,'' she testified last year. ''My
wish was his command.''
</P>
<P>
   But when he died, Marshall's will bequeathed everything to the
younger of his two sons.
</P>
<P>
   Bufford ruled that Marshall promised Smith half his fortune if
she would marry him. Smith's expected inheritance was based on her
''widow's election,'' or right to elect against her husband's will,
''which made no provision for her,'' Bufford said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This extraordinary decision is a miscarriage of justice that
is not supported by the facts and will not stand up on appeal,'' E.
Pierce Marshall said in a statement issued Wednesday night. ''We
are confident that a Texas jury that is permitted to evaluate all
of the evidence in the case will allow my father's clearly stated
wishes to be carried out.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Texas probate court case, Smith and Howard Marshall III
both insist that the elder Marshall promised them a share of his
fortune.
</P>
<P>
   Marhsall's wealth consisted mostly of his ownership of 16
percent of the outstanding shares of Koch Industries Inc., an oil
company that is the nation's second largest privately held
corporation.
</P>
<P>
   The stock was worth an estimated $1.4 billion at the time of his
death. During their marriage, its value rose by $449.7 million, the
amount of Wednesday's judgment.

<HEADLINE> FDA To Decide Fate of Abortion Pill  </HEADLINE>
By LAURAN NEERGAARD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- With a deadline fast approaching, the Food and
Drug Administration was poised to decide, perhaps as early as
Thursday, the fate of the long-awaited abortion pill RU-486.
</P>
<P>
   Abortion-rights advocates said Wednesday they expected the pill
to be approved under certain restrictions designed to ensure women
take it safely.
</P>
<P>
   If so, it would be a long-awaited victory for abortion-rights
groups. Anti-abortion organizations have battled to keep RU-486 out
of the United States since the drug debuted in France in 1988 -- and
they pledged Wednesday to continue fighting the drug if it is sold
here.
</P>
<P>
   Approval has been long expected. The Clinton administration in
1994 persuaded French manufacturer Roussel Uclaf to give U.S.
rights to the pill to the nonprofit Population Council, which hired
a U.S. marketing company to apply for FDA clearance. In 1996, the
FDA declared RU-486, now known by its chemical name mifepristone,
safe and effective for early abortion. But problems passing
manufacturing and labeling requirements delayed final approval. The
FDA had set Saturday as its deadline to decide, and could accept or
reject the drug or request more information.
</P>
<P>
   Studies show mifepristone is 92-95 percent effective in causing
abortion when taken during the first seven weeks of pregnancy --
earlier than most surgical abortions.
</P>
<P>
   But it does require at least two, sometimes three, doctor
visits, to ensure the abortion is complete and finish it surgically
if necessary. Women swallow mifepristone, which blocks a hormone
essential for maintaining pregnancy. Two days later they swallow a
second drug that causes uterine contractions to expel the embryo.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is an extraordinarily safe and effective method for
terminating a very early pregnancy,'' said Vicki Saporta of the
National Abortion Federation, noting studies found less than a 1
percent rate of complications.
</P>
<P>
   Expecting approval, the federation beefed up its national hot
line Wednesday in preparation for calls seeking mifepristone.
</P>
<P>
   Abortion-rights groups said they expected the FDA to mandate
that women sign special consent forms agreeing to the doctor
visits, and to restrict the pill's distribution to doctors able to
assess gestational age and rule out ectopic pregnancies, thus
ensuring proper candidates get the drug.

<HEADLINE> Ex-academy employee gets 41 months for arranging tryst with 'boy'  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - It appears that a longtime employee of a
prestigious Pennsylvania military academy had sexual encounters
with at least two boys, one of them a cadet, a federal prosecutor
told a judge at the man's sentencing.
</P>
<P>
   James P. Hopkinson Jr. was sentenced Wednesday to the maximum 41
months in federal prison for crossing state lines to have sex with
someone he believed to be a New Jersey teen-ager.
</P>
<P>
   ''Billy'' was actually an undercover FBI agent who met Hopkinson
in an Internet chat room where adults have been known to seek
juveniles for sex, according to court papers.
</P>
<P>
   The computer specialist has not been charged with any actual
sexual encounters, but a prosecutor told U.S. District Judge
Garrett E. Brown Jr. that Hopkinson had told a former colleague at
Valley Forge Military Academy and College he did have sex with a
cadet.
</P>
<P>
   The school maintains he had no improper contact with any of the
800 students at the all-male school, who range in age from 12 to
21. No students, faculty or staff have been associated with his
criminal activity, school spokeswoman Heather Swech said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Hopkinson, 50, worked at Valley Forge for 25 years before
resigning days before his arrest April 21, 1999, at a central New
Jersey mall where he thought he would meet ''Billy.'' Hopkinson had
lived on the campus of the school in Wayne, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   Brown ordered Hopkinson to undergo sex offender treatment while
serving his term, which must be served without parole, and to pay a
$10,000 fine.
</P>
<P>
   He barred Hopkinson from working with children or having access
to computer networks for three years after his release from prison.
</P>
<P>
   Among the letters the judge received was a ''character
reference'' from Rep. Joseph M. Hoeffel III, D-Pa., who represents
most of Montgomery County in suburban Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Hoeffel said he and Hopkinson attended high school together, but
have rarely seen each other since, ''mostly at reunions.''
</P>
<P>
   ''While we weren't close friends, I admired his quiet
determination and good citizenship. I have only favorable and fond
memories of Jim's role in our class and school,'' Hoeffel said in
the handwritten note on his personal stationery.
</P>
<P>
   Hoeffel said Wednesday that he does not condone Hopkinson's
crimes. The first-term congressman noted that he did not ask the
judge for leniency in the letter, which he said was written as a
friend of the family after being contacted by Hopkinson's father.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Donna A. Krappa told the judge that the
FBI uncovered evidence that exploiting teens was ''a way of life
for Jim Hopkinson.''
</P>
<P>
   The FBI, however, was unable to locate the cadet Hopkinson
supposedly had sex with, Krappa said.
</P>
<P>
   The information came from a person who is now a vice principal
at a Philadelphia area high school. The educator, who Krappa would
not name, told the FBI that Hopkinson told him he had the cadet in
his apartment, showed him a ''hard core homosexual movie'' and then
engaged in a sexual act.
</P>
<P>
   The educator provided some identifying information, but did not
have the cadet's name, Krappa said.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI searched Hopkinson's computer and found evidence he had
been in contact with boys, including one who was traumatized after
a sexual encounter with Hopkinson, Krappa told the judge.
</P>
<P>
   The teen, who she referred to as ''M.R.,'' lived in the
Philadelphia area and was interviewed by the FBI, she said. He had
flashbacks for six months and remains under psychiatric treatment
more than a year after the incident, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Hopkinson had been under house arrest after his arrest but has
been jailed since Jan. 14 upon release from hospital following a
suicide attempt.
</P>
<P>
   Hopkinson pleaded guilty in July to a charge of traveling
interstate to engage in a sexual act with a minor. He also pleaded
guilty to a charge filed in Pennsylvania of possession of child
pornography.
</P>
<P>
   Krappa said authorities searched Hopkinson's home on the day he
traveled to New Jersey and found magazines that contained child
pornography.
</P>
<P>
   The collection included 20 years of publications from the North
American Man-Boy Love Association, which advocates sex between men
and boys, Krappa said.
</P>
<P>
   A message seeking comment Wednesday from Hopkinson lawyer
Michael Holsten was not immediately returned.
</P>
<P>
   Valley Forge, founded in 1928, is the alma mater of Gen. H.
Norman Schwarzkopf and author J.D. Salinger. Its 120-acre campus is
15 miles west of Philadelphia.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) -- Dr. Frank Albert Disney, a pediatrician
credited with popularizing office-based clinical research, died
Sept. 18 after a lengthy illness. He was 88.
</P>
<P>
   In 1946, Disney and Dr. Burtis Breese started the longtime
practice in pediatrics of combining clinical practice with
office-based studies of strep throat and related childhood
diseases.
</P>
<P>
   At the start of World War II, Disney directed the Rochester
Blood Bank, then one of less than a half-dozen blood collection
centers in the nation.

Art Edgerton
</P>
<P>
   TOLEDO, Ohio (AP) -- Art Edgerton, a broadcast reporter who took
his notes in Braille, died Tuesday of a heart attack. He was 76.
</P>
<P>
   Edgerton, who was born blind, also was a musician and community
activist. He learned to play the drums at age 9 and later played
the piano with bands and won a talent contest at the Apollo Theater
in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Edgerton was director of public and community affairs for Clear
Channel Communications Inc. in Toledo. He also hosted and played
keyboards for weekend shows on WCWA-AM in Toledo.
</P>
<P>
   He began his broadcast career in 1957 at the former WTOL Radio
as a part-time disc jockey. He later became a radio and television
reporter.
</P>
<P>
Bob Hurt
</P>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Bob Hurt, the driver who became a paraplegic
when he broke his neck trying to qualify for the 1968 Indianapolis
500, died in his sleep Sept. 23. He was 61.
</P>
<P>
   Hurt died at a hotel in Toronto where he was undergoing
treatment for prostate cancer, the Indianapolis Motor Speedway
announced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   He began his auto-racing career at 19, driving modified stock
cars and sports cars.
</P>
<P>
   Hurt drove his own Ferrari to victory in the Puerto Rico Grand
Prix in 1962 and competed in a Lotus 18 as well as driving USAC
stock cars in 1963.
</P>
<P>
   Hurt never drove in the Indy 500. In 1964, he passed his rookie
test but did not make an attempt to qualify. In 1967, he qualified
at 161.261 mph, but he was bumped from the field by a faster
qualifier.
</P>
<P>
   In 1968, rain marred practice and qualifying for 23 consecutive
days, so an extra qualifying day was added May 27 to fill the
field. Hurt was injured in the morning practice period.
</P>

Aleksandras Lileikis
</P>
<P>
   VILNIUS, Lithuania (AP) -- Aleksandras Lileikis, indicted for
sending scores of Jews to their deaths while he headed this city's
security police during World War II, died Tuesday of a heart
attack. He was 93.
</P>
<P>
   Nazi hunters sought for years to bring Lileikis, considered one
of the last major Nazi war criminals, to justice. He was indicted
by Lithuanian prosecutors, but the trial that began in 1998 never
went beyond the preliminary stages.
</P>
<P>
   Lileikis maintained his innocence throughout the on-again,
off-again court proceedings and claimed in a recent memoir that he
actively backed the anti-Nazi resistance and tried to foil the
massacres of Jews.
</P>
<P>
   Lileikis was charged with genocide for allegedly turning Jews
over to be executed during the 1941-44 German occupation, when he
headed the Vilnius security police. His alleged victims were shot
in sand pits near Vilnius.
</P>
<P>
   Lileikis emigrated to the United States after the war and lived
in Norwood, Mass., where he worked in publishing. He returned to
Lithuania in 1996 as a U.S. court moved to revoke his citizenship
for lying about his Nazi past.

Frank Wills
</P>
<P>
   AUGUSTA, Ga. (AP) -- Frank Wills, the Watergate security guard
who discovered the 1972 break-in that led to President Nixon's
resignation, died Wednesday. He was 52.
</P>
<P>
   Friends of the family told The Augusta (Ga.) Chronicle that he
suffered a brain tumor and had been ill for several months.
</P>
<P>
   Though he had spent the years since the break-in in relative
obscurity, Wills' discovery on the midnight shift at the
Washington, D.C., hotel-office complex thrust him briefly into the
spotlight. He later played himself in the movie ''All the
President's Men,'' about the scandal that brought down Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   Early on June 17, 1972, Wills found a piece of tape over a door
latch leading into the Watergate complex. Thinking a shift worker
had put it there to make getting in and out of the building easier,
he simply pulled it off and stuffed it into his pocket.
</P>
<P>
   When he later found a second piece of tape over the lock, he
called the police.
</P>
<P>
   Wills followed the officers to the Democratic National Committee
offices in the Watergate. Inside, they found five men: James
McCord, Bernard Barker, Eugenio Martinez, Frank Sturgis and
Virgilio Gonzales.
</P>
<P>
   The bungled burglary led to discoveries of conspiracy,
obstruction of justice, illegal use of the FBI and CIA and illegal
campaign contributions, all of which ultimately drove Nixon from
the White House.

<HEADLINE> Menninger Clinic Moving to Texas  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID MILES
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOPEKA, Kan. (AP) -- The Menninger Clinic, a world renowned
campus for the mentally ill that has struggled financially, is
moving to Texas despite a multimillion-dollar package designed to
keep it in Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Walter Menninger, the chief executive officer, told hundreds
of employees Wednesday that the clinic will become a partner with
the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston and the Methodist Health
Care System.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Wednesday night, he said the three
organizations will establish a national psychiatric center and a
brain and behavior research institute. A final agreement should be
reached by February.
</P>
<P>
   He also said Menninger and Baylor had committed to raise at
least $200 million in endowment funds.
</P>
<P>
   ''We know that this alliance will allow Menninger to continue
growing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Menninger said the clinic would be out of business in six to
eight years unless it moves from Topeka, where it was founded in
1925.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't intend for Menninger to be one of the casualties in
the shakeout of health care,'' he said. ''I'm certain that many
people feel frustrated about this, but it is our reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Menninger officials acknowledged earlier this year that changes
in psychiatric care and the reimbursement policies of health
insurance companies had forced them to consider relocating to a
metropolitan area.
</P>
<P>
   The clinic has had financial problems for at least a decade and
last year lost $2.9 million despite using $12 million of its
endowment to defray operating expenses. The clinic also is facing
an increased use of drugs instead of therapy to treat mental
illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Menninger said the clinic planned to relocate its education,
research and national services programs to Houston by 2002. He said
the 1,162 full- and part-time staffers in Topeka will be offered
incentives to stay with the clinic, but some jobs will be
eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   The Menninger trustees rejected proposals from the University of
Kansas Medical Center in Kansas City and the University of Texas
Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Gov. Bill Graves announced an incentive
package worth nearly $100 million designed to keep the clinic in
Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   The clinic was founded by Karl Menninger; his father, Charles;
and a brother, William. Karl Menninger became a giant in
psychiatry, writing influential books such as ''The Human Mind''
and ''Love Against Hate,'' and he is credited with convincing the
American public that mental disorders could be treated and cured.
</P>
<P>
   The founders converted a farmhouse into a clinic with 13 beds.
It still stands in Topeka but has been converted into a bed and
breakfast.

<HEADLINE> UN Reaches Compromise Over Iraq  </HEADLINE>
By NICOLE WINFIELD
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The Security Council reached a compromise
agreement Wednesday on yet another challenge to sanctions against
Iraq that had threatened a $15.9 billion payout to Kuwait's oil
company.
</P>
<P>
   France, Russia and China agreed to let the payment go through at
Thursday's meeting of the U.N. Compensation Commission in Geneva as
long as the United States and Britain support a reduction in the
amount of money that the fund receives from the U.N. oil-for-food
program.
</P>
<P>
   The three countries, Iraq's strongest supporters on the Security
Council, had sought to delay payment to the Kuwait Petroleum Co.,
saying such a large award to a corporation was unconscionable at a
time when Iraqis are suffering from decade-old sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, 30 percent of every dollar Iraq earns through the
program is diverted to the fund to compensate victims of Iraq's
1990 invasion of Kuwait. The bulk of the remainder is used to buy
humanitarian goods for Iraqis who are suffering under sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   The compromise deal, which the full 15-member council agreed to,
calls for the percentage to be reduced to 25 percent for the
six-month period that begins Dec. 6. The excess money, which would
amount to about $1 billion over a year under current oil prices,
would be targeted for humanitarian projects.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement comes against the backdrop of increasingly bold
attempts by Iraq's friends on the council -- France in particular --
to push the envelope on sanctions in Baghdad's favor, much to the
consternation of an increasingly isolated United States.
</P>
<P>
   France last week flouted procedures of the U.N. committee
monitoring sanctions against Iraq by sending a flight to Iraq
without giving committee members time to approve it -- a move the
United States said was a ''blatant violation'' of the embargo.
</P>
<P>
   Russia sent a flight over the weekend, without answering
questions raised by the United States and Britain, saying it only
had to notify the committee. A Jordanian flight flew to Baghdad on
Wednesday with full committee approval, after providing the United
States with information it wanted about the cargo.
</P>
<P>
   The flights have been a gray area for the council, with France
and Russia saying the committee need only be notified of proposed
flights. The United States and Britain say the committee must
actually approve them.
</P>
<P>
   But the compensation committee, made up of the 15 members of the
council, managed to remain relatively free of division, taking all
of its decisions by consensus.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian and French position on the Kuwait Petroleum Co.
claim had threatened to force a vote in the commission, which might
have politicized future compensation claims, diplomats said.
</P>
<P>
   At an OPEC summit in Caracas, Venezuela, Iraqi Deputy Foreign
Minister Riyadh Al-Qaisi derided the decision to allow the Kuwaiti
claim to go through, saying the United Nations should release Iraqi
funding so it can purchase food and humanitarian aid.

<HEADLINE> Former Miami City Manager Charged  </HEADLINE>
By ADRIAN SAINZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- The former city manager who was fired days after
the Elian Gonzalez raid was indicted Wednesday on federal charges
involving more than $86,000 taken from a police pension fund and a
charity.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Warshaw is charged with one count of conspiracy and four
counts of mail fraud and is scheduled to appear before a federal
magistrate on Thursday. He could face one to three years in prison
if convicted, U.S. Attorney Guy Lewis said.
</P>
<P>
   Warshaw's attorney, Martin Goldberg, said he was disappointed
that his client's actions were characterized as crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ''Don has devoted his career and life to this community for
which this city has greatly benefitted,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment accuses Warshaw of using the pension fund's
American Express card to buy $16,775 worth of hockey tickets. It
also lists $35,917 taken from the charity Do the Right Thing Inc.
in cash and $33,870 in checks, some written to the pension fund's
American Express account.
</P>
<P>
   Warshaw, the city's police chief before becoming city manager,
was chairman of the pension fund from 1991 to 1998 and secretary
and treasurer of the charity from 1991 until August.
</P>
<P>
   The dates in the indictment range from May 1993 to April 1999.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to the mayor last year, Warshaw said all the charges
had been repaid.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment also named the charity's former accountant, who
committed suicide last year. A note found after the suicide led to
the investigation, Miami-Dade Police Chief Carlos Alvarez said.
</P>
<P>
   As city manager, Warshaw was widely credited with cleaning up
corruption and helping restore the city's financial health after a
1996 kickback scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Joe Carollo fired him in April, accusing him of lying and
mismanagement, after Warshaw refused to fire Police Chief William
O'Brien in the wake of the federal raid that removed Elian from his
Miami relatives and reunited him with his Cuban father.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Criticized for Drug Monitoring  </HEADLINE>
By STEPHEN WILSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- News that world shot put champion C.J.
Hunter -- husband of Olympic sprinter Marion Jones -- failed four
drug tests and that more than a dozen other U.S. drug cases were
suppressed has sparked a ''we-told-you-so'' barrage against the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is a perception in Europe that while the U.S. is very
critical and very aggressive toward people who have responsibility
for anti-doping, there isn't a lot of evidence there has been a big
focus on the problem in the U.S.,'' said Kevan Gosper, an
International Olympic Committee vice president from Australia.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some of the most high-profile sports in the U.S. on the
Olympic program do not submit themselves to vigorous anti-doping
tests. Maybe it needs something like this for the Americans to take
a hard look at themselves,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday (Wednesday night EDT), IOC general secretary
Francois Carrard praised U.S. officials for leading the fight
against drugs but said they still had work to do.
</P>
<P>
   ''They have shown the way. They have to follow it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Jacques Rogge, an IOC executive board member and vice
chairman of the medical commission, said the IOC has asked the U.S.
Olympic Committee for an explanation of the ''worrying and
disturbing'' reports of drug test cover-ups.
</P>
<P>
   Rogge said he respected the principle that an athlete is
presumed innocent pending a full judicial process, but that
authorities should lift the confidentiality rules preventing the
release of names of suspected drug offenders.
</P>
<P>
   IOC vice president Dick Pound, a Canadian lawyer, said positive
test results should be made public to allay suspicions.
</P>
<P>
   ''Athletes are entitled to due process, but if you're charged
with murder, you're in the public,'' he said. ''You don't have a
murder trial and then announce the result of it. I don't think
there's any prejudice suffered by anybody and it's better for
sports as a whole if the facts are made public.''
</P>
<P>
   The drug scandals have given International Olympic Committee
officials ammunition to express the lingering anti-American
resentment related to the Salt Lake City bribery case.
</P>
<P>
   IOC members are still angry at being portrayed as corrupt as a
whole. They're also still bitter over the scathing attacks by U.S.
lawmakers and White House drug chief Barry McCaffrey, who said the
IOC was unfit, unwilling and unable to lead the fight against
drugs. While McCaffrey has recently praised the IOC's new
anti-doping efforts, all has not been forgiven.
</P>
<P>
   Even China, frequently targeted by U.S. swim coaches as being
lax on drugs, has weighed in.
</P>
<P>
   He Huixian, a spokeswoman for the Chinese Olympic Committee,
said that, by suppressing Hunter's positive tests, U.S. track
officials showed a lack of resolve.
</P>
<P>
   ''Only by properly managing your own affairs, with everybody
doing a good job of their own anti-doping work, can this big cancer
be eradicated,'' He said. ''You must start with yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Pound, who never misses a chance to criticize the United States,
said the country is in a ''state of denial'' about the drug
problem.
</P>
<P>
   ''The United States has been very slow to recognize there is a
problem in the U.S.,'' he said. ''This is an opportunity to embrace
the fact there is a problem, and show if they want to be a leader
in world sport, that they are in fact leaders.''
</P>
<P>
   Although no current members of the U.S. Olympic team have been
involved in the drug case thus far, the criticism has stung
America's Olympic leadership, who say they are being unfairly
singled out.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not aware of any positive tests whatsoever,'' U.S.
Olympic Committee CEO Norm Blake said Thursday (Wednesday night
EDT). ''And yet it seems like we're part of a conspiracy or
cover-up which is simply not true.''
</P>
<P>
   Blake said the USOC would announce in the next few days creation
of an independent panel to review American drug-testing programs
and make sure there are no unreported positive tests lurking.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need to create a vehicle in which the public at large will
have faith in this third party,'' he said. ''It will be made
public, absolutely.''
</P>
<P>
   International officials are always quick to point out the lack
of comprehensive testing for performance-enhancing drugs in
American pro football, basketball, baseball, basketball and hockey.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everything is permitted in professional sports,'' Italian
Olympic Committee official Luciano Barra said. ''They should not be
the first to accuse others.''
</P>
<P>
   That perception is recognized by Bob Ctvrtlik, a former U.S.
volleyball star who was appointed last year as an IOC member.
</P>
<P>
   ''Yes, in American sports we don't have a handle on
everything,'' he said. ''But on an amateur and Olympic level, a
huge effort is being made.''
</P>
<P>
   The lightning rod for criticism in Sydney has been USA Track &AMP;
Field, along with its executive director, former miler Craig
Masback.
</P>
<P>
   The IAAF has accused the national federation of suppressing
12-15 positive drug cases in the last two years.
</P>
<P>
   Several senior IOC officials said they were shocked that Hunter
could have tested positive four times for steroids this summer and
still remained on the U.S. team. He withdrew from the team a few
days before the games, citing a knee injury.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter's positive tests were disclosed only after a flurry of
media reports and speculation.
</P>
<P>
   Masback said USATF is bound by confidentiality rules and cannot
disclose positive cases until after due process is completed.
</P>
<P>
   ''I regret that we are made the scapegoat for what has been
perceived as U.S. misdeeds of all varieties,'' he said. ''We're not
responsible for the Salt Lake City scandal or comments by the White
House drug czar. I have never said our system is perfect. We have
never ever pointed any fingers.''

<HEADLINE> Olympic Closing Fireworks To Be Big  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- It's being billed as the biggest
fireworks display in Australia, and certainly the most unique.
</P>
<P>
   When the Olympic closing ceremony finishes Sunday night, an
8.5-mile set of timed fireworks called the ''River of Lightning''
will go off from the Olympic stadium to the Sydney Harbor Bridge.
</P>
<P>
   The explosive display -- 40 percent larger than Sydney's
millennium display -- will begin with the timed sequence of 24
firing positions along the 8.5 miles from Homebush Bay to the
bridge. More fireworks from the Harbor Bridge and four other launch
positions along the harbor will follow.
</P>
<P>
   Olympic ceremonies artistic director David Atkins said the
''fuse'' from Homebush will take more than two minutes to trigger
the fireworks on the bridge. The shells, to be set off every six
seconds and last for 30 seconds, will be fired every 500 yards
along the river.
</P>
<P>
   As many as 2 million spectators are expected to cram the harbor
shores to watch the display, while 16 giant screens will broadcast
the event to city and regional centers in Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Australia's Seven television network will utilize the Goodyear
blimp and two helicopters as well as cameras from NBC, BBC, CBC
Canada, ZDF Germany and TV2 Denmark to broadcast the event.
</P>
<P>
   Pyrotechnists from five continents, representing the Olympic
rings, are each creating a three-minute display to be fired from
four harbor locations.
</P>
<P>
   The companies are Haga Fireworks Company in Miyagi, Japan; Pyro
Spectacular in Johannesburg, South Africa; Pirotecnia Ricarda
Caballer in Valencia, Spain; Alonzo Fireworks Display Inc. of New
York; and Foti International Fireworks from Sydney.

<HEADLINE> Rockies 6, Diamondbacks 4  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- Terry Shumpert hit a tying home run and Jeff
Cirillo and Todd Helton had RBI singles as the Colorado Rockies
rallied in the eighth inning to defeat the Arizona Diamondbacks 6-4
Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Walker went 4-for-4 and Todd Hollandsworth hit a two-run
homer for the Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   Shumpert's solo shot off the left-field foul pole against Dan
Plesac (5-1) made it 4-all in the eighth. Two outs later, Juan
Pierre and Neifi Perez singled.
</P>
<P>
   Russ Springer relieved and gave up the run-scoring singles to
Cirillo and Helton. Cirillo had three hits after getting four on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Gabe White (11-2) pitched two innings for the win. Jose Jimenez
worked the ninth for his 22nd save in 28 tries.
</P>
<P>
   Luis Gonzalez hit his 30th home run for the Diamondbacks.
</P>
<P>
   Curt Schilling, 5-6 since being acquired on July 26 from
Philadelphia, started for Arizona and got a no-decision. He pitched
6 2-3 innings and gave up three runs and eight hits, striking out
five.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez gave the Diamondbacks a 1-0 lead with a home run in the
first.
</P>
<P>
   Hollandsworth capped an 11-pitch at-bat with his 18th home run
in the fourth for a 2-1 lead. Cirillo opened the inning with a
single and Hollandsworth fouled off five pitches before lining a
fastball into the seats in left.
</P>
<P>
   Schilling walked Helton with two outs in the fifth inning and
Walker hit an RBI double. Steve Finley, in a 3-for-31 slump, tied
it with a two-out, two-run double in the Arizona sixth.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks took a 4-3 lead off White in the seventh,
scoring a run on a double-play grounder.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Arizona RHP Todd Stottlemyre had successful surgery Tuesday
on his right elbow and won't be able for throw for at least eight
weeks. ... Helton became the eighth player in major league history
to have 100 walks, 100 runs, 100 RBIs and 200 hits when he drew a
fifth-inning walk. ... Colorado starter Julian Tavarez remained in
the game after being hit in the pitching hand by Craig Counsell's
grounder with one out in the fifth.

<HEADLINE> Cardinals 3, Padres 0  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Rick Ankiel broke Dizzy Dean's single-season
Cardinals record for strikeouts by a rookie, pitching six sharp
innings to lead St. Louis to a 3-0 win Wednesday night over the San
Diego Padres.
</P>
<P>
   The NL Central champion Cardinals are one game behind Atlanta
and San Francisco in the race for the league's best record and
home-field advantage in the playoffs. Each team has four games
left.
</P>
<P>
   Ankiel (11-7) gave up five hits and did not allow a runner to
reach third base in his last regular-season start.
</P>
<P>
   Ankiel struck out seven to raise his total to 193, surpassing
Dean's mark of 191 in 1932.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Veres pitched the ninth for his 28th save.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals beat San Diego for the 10th straight time,
including eight in a row this year. St. Louis has won 11 of 15
overall.
</P>
<P>
   Mark McGwire, who has yet to play in the field since coming off
the disabled list on Sept. 8, pinch-hit for Ankiel in the seventh
and flied out.
</P>
<P>
   Will Clark's RBI double in the fourth and a two-run single by
Eric Davis in the fifth provided St. Louis with all the runs it
needed against the struggling Padres.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego was shut out for the second time in four games, in
which it has scored just two runs.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Tollberg (4-5) allowed three runs -- one earned -- on five
hits in five innings.
</P>
<P>
   Clark doubled down the right-field line to score Jim Edmonds,
who walked, for a 1-0 lead in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   A two-out single by Ankiel and an error by second baseman Damian
Jackson on Fernando Vina's grounder set up Davis' single.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Ankiel is 2-0 against the Padres this season and has not
allowed a run in 11 innings. ... Ankiel is batting .250
(17-for-68). ... St. Louis has won eight of Ankiel's last nine
starts. ... San Diego dropped to 6-23 against NL division leaders.
... The Cardinals moved a season-high 28 games above .500 for the
third time this season. ... Padres LF Eric Owens, who left
Tuesday's game with a sprained left ankle, was back in the starting
lineup.

<HEADLINE> Crew Stuck on Casino Boat  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CORPUS CHRISTI, Texas (AP) -- Nearly 200 crew members on the
Texas Treasure casino ship are being sequestered as authorities
sort out their status, along with the boat's.
</P>
<P>
   The 2,000-passenger ship still makes its gambling cruises, but
the crew has to stay on board.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 10, the Immigration and Naturalization Service detained
the Texas Treasure to investigate the 133 crew members' immigration
status. That issue was resolved, as was the status of 55 foreign
nationals who boarded the ship later under temporary work visas.
</P>
<P>
   Now officials must determine if the cruise ship is registered in
the United States or another country. Under immigration law,
foreign ships must make foreign ports of call at least once every
29 days.
</P>
<P>
   Denton Lankford, an INS spokesman in San Antonio, said that
process could last through the week.
</P>
<P>
   John D. Lee, an attorney for the ship's owner, Las Vegas-based
Viva Gaming and Resorts Inc., said it should retain its temporary
foreign status, since similar gambling ship operations in Florida
and New York are not considered U.S. businesses.

<HEADLINE> Workers Comp a Political Issue  </HEADLINE>
By NANCY ZUCKERBROD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- If people who were sickened by working at
nuclear weapons plants during the Cold War receive government
compensation, it might have as much to do with politics as
compassion.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers say House-Senate negotiations on a compensation plan --
an idea that has significant bipartisan support in Congress --
gained momentum Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   They broke down on Monday, but resumed the next day after
Republicans such as Tennessee Sen. Fred Thompson made stinging
remarks accusing House GOP leaders of failing to negotiate in good
faith. Republican House members said the issue could hurt them at
the polls and possibly swing House control to the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is a lot of pressure being put on the House and rightly
so,'' said Rep. Zach Wamp, R-Tenn., who represents workers at the
Oak Ridge nuclear reservation.
</P>
<P>
   John Feehery, spokesman for speaker House Speaker Dennis
Hastert, R-Ill., acknowledged that the response from some GOP
lawmakers prompted Republican leaders to go back to the bargaining
table.
</P>
<P>
   ''It has given us a reason to change our mind and work toward
getting a satisfactory conclusion,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sometimes when constituents make their case in an election
year, their voices are a little bit louder.''
</P>
<P>
   Last spring, the Energy Department reversed 50 years of federal
policy by declaring that workers injured or killed by radiation at
weapons plants should be compensated. The agency proposed minimum
lump sum payments of $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate later approved a measure calling for workers exposed
to radiation and toxic chemicals to receive $200,000 in
compensation from the federal government, plus health benefits, but
House GOP leaders balked, expressing concern about an entitlement
program whose costs were uncertain because it's not known how many
workers would qualify.
</P>
<P>
   The Congressional Budget Office estimated the compensation
proposal would cost $1.7 billion to cover approximately 4,000
workers over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Among the places that are home to large groups of workers who
might qualify for compensation are the key presidential election
states of California, Ohio and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Ed Whitfield, R-Ky., who faces a tough re-election opponent
in Democrat Brian Roy, has been pushing GOP House leaders to reach
a compromise and redoubled his efforts after talks broke off.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm sure they (GOP leaders) understand the politics of it, and
that's why it's so puzzling,'' said Whitfield, whose district is
home to the Paducah uranium enrichment plant. ''The reality is if
you don't pass important legislation, your opponent can always talk
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Wamp's Democratic opponent, Will Callaway, issued a news release
shortly after talks broke down criticizing Wamp for not convincing
GOP House leaders to back the compensation package.
</P>
<P>
   House Minority Whip David Bonior, D-Mich., said failure to
approve a compensation plan says something about the
''compassionate conservatism'' Republicans have been touting.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's an excellent test of that, and we'll see how
compassionate they are,'' Bonior said.

<HEADLINE> Coal Mine Blast Kills 118 in China  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHANGHAI, China (AP) -- A gas explosion in a coal mine in
southern China killed 118 miners, a mine official said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The blast occurred Wednesday night at the Muchonggou Coal Mine
in Shuicheng, a city in Guizhou province, said Zhong Tianfang, an
official of the municipal mine bureau.
</P>
<P>
   Another 123 miners were rescued, leaving no one missing, Zhong
said by telephone from Shuicheng, which is 1,350 miles southwest of
Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
   ''The rescue work went very quickly and smoothly,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   China has the world's deadliest coal mines. More than 2,730
miners died in the first six months of the year, according to
government statistics. Many mines are poorly run, lacking adequate
fire and ventilation equipment, and safety regulations are spottily
enforced.
</P>
<P>
   Zhong said the state-owned Muchonggou mine was properly
licensed, unlike the small, unlicensed mines that account for a
large share of China's fatal accidents.
</P>
<P>
   Zhong said the blast in the Muchonggou mine was blamed on a
buildup of gas, but the exact cause was still under investigation.

FDA To Decide Fate of Abortion Pill
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- With a deadline fast approaching, the Food and Drug
Administration was poised to decide, perhaps as early as Thursday, the fate of
the long-awaited abortion pill RU-486. Abortion-rights advocates said Wednesday
they expected the pill to be approved under certain restrictions designed to
ensure women take it safely. If so, it would be a long-awaited victory for
abortion-rights groups. Anti-abortion organizations have battled to keep RU-486
out of the United States since the drug debuted in France in 1988 -- and they
pledged Wednesday to continue fighting the drug if it is sold here.

   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The Security Council reached a compromise agreement
Wednesday on yet another challenge to sanctions against Iraq that had threatened
a $15.9 billion payout to Kuwait's oil company. France, Russia and China agreed
to let the payment go through at Thursday's meeting of the U.N. Compensation
Commission in Geneva as long as the United States and Britain support a
reduction in the amount of money that the fund receives from the U.N.
oil-for-food program. The three countries had sought to delay payment to the
Kuwait Petroleum Co., saying such a large award to a corporation was
unconscionable at a time when Iraqis are suffering from decade-old sanctions.

Ex-KLA Chief Warns Yugoslav Leaders

   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Any attempts by Yugoslav leaders to return
police or military units to Kosovo would ''bring another war'' that could trap
NATO-led forces in the middle, the former Kosovo Liberation Army political chief
warned Wednesday. The increasingly sharp comments by Hashim Thaci are part of
efforts to tap into pro-independence sentiments and memories of the KLA's
struggle against Serb forces before Oct. 28 municipal elections. Thaci's
Democratic Party of Kosovo is particularly critical of the more moderate
positions of ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova.

Drug Industry Gave $800,000 to GOP

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The pharmaceutical industry gave more than $800,000 to
Republican Party committees last month after the Senate voted to allow reimports
of lower-priced U.S.-made drugs -- something the companies oppose. In addition,
the president of Bristol-Myers Squibb co-chaired a fund-raising dinner Wednesday
for Senate Republicans. But despite the intensive lobbying effort, Congress is
likely to pass the legislation. The pharmaceutical industry also is fighting a
Democratic proposal to expand Medicare, the health care program for the elderly,
to cover the cost of prescription drugs.

<HEADLINE> $450M Sought for Polio Eradication  </HEADLINE>
By EDITH M. LEDERER
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The number of polio cases around the world
has plunged over the past 12 years, from at least 350,000 in 1988
to 7,000 last year and only 1,149 so far in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   But stamping out the virus in the remaining 20 countries in
Africa and Asia will require access to war zones and $450 million,
World Health Organization Director-General Dr. Gro Harlem
Brundtland said Wednesday. About 30 countries had polio at the
start of 2000, she said, and the number is going down to 20 as the
new year approaches.
</P>
<P>
   At a summit of the public and private sector partners who have
been in the forefront of the global campaign to eradicate polio,
Brundtland launched a five-year plan to wipe out the disease by
2005 -- a target set in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   The plan calls for intensifying immunization activities against
polio, safely containing all laboratory stocks of the polio virus,
expanding routine immunizations, and agreeing on a timetable to
eventually end immunizations.
</P>
<P>
   For 10-year-old Thaddeus Farrow, who contracted polio in an
orphanage in India, eradication will be too late.
</P>
<P>
   But his mother, actress Mia Farrow, said they both dreamed of
living in a world where no child ever again suffers from the
disabling disease. She adopted Thaddeus five years ago and was
herself a child polio victim.
</P>
<P>
   ''If people could follow Thaddeus through just one day of his
life and see just how hard it is for him, I think there would be no
abstainees in saying 'let there be no more polio,''' she said,
describing his struggle to walk with braces.
</P>
<P>
   The final push to eradicate polio got a high-level endorsement
from Secretary-General Kofi Annan who warned that the ''race to
reach the last child ... is a race against time.''
</P>
<P>
   ''If we do not seize the chance now, the virus will regain its
grip, and the opportunity will elude us forever -- or at least for a
very long time,'' he told some 250 summit participants.
</P>
<P>
   Pledging the commitment of the U.N. system to meet the 2005
target, Annan called for intensified efforts to negotiate access to
all children for national immunization days, particularly in
countries where fighting has disrupted health care systems, such as
Afghanistan and Congo.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of Health and Human Services Donna Shalala also
pledged support, issuing ''a call to arms to finish the job ... to
save millions of children from polio's tears, and millions of
parents from polio's fears.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank Devlyn, president of Rotary International, and Ted Turner,
head of the United Nations Foundation, appealed to global
corporations and individual philanthropists for donations of $1
million or more to help raise the $450 million.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is estimated that the world will save $1.5 billion in
routine immunizations after polio is eradicated,'' said Devlyn.
</P>
<P>
   Turner, whose foundation donated $28 million, called on ''those
who have been blessed by more wealth than they need,'' to make
major contributions to the effort.

<HEADLINE> Congress Delays New Trucking Rules  </HEADLINE>
By JIM ABRAMS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- New federal rules on how long a trucker may
stay behind the wheel will be put off for at least a year,
upsetting highway safety advocates who say trucker fatigue
contributes to hundreds of road fatalities annually.
</P>
<P>
   But the trucking industry said the rules delay, being agreed to
as part of congressional budget negotiations, was needed to come up
with a workable plan.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Frank Wolf, R-Va., who has led efforts to improve truck
safety, said the compromise was fair because it would allow the
Transportation Department to continue gathering data on how
trucking hours can best be revised.
</P>
<P>
   But Wolf, chairman of the House Appropriations panel on
transportation, also cautioned: ''I want to tell the trucking
industry that we're not going to rest until there is a good rule to
protect the public.''
</P>
<P>
   The Transportation Department last spring issued proposed rules
to change an hours-of-service system adopted in 1937. Those rules
were based on an 18-hour cycle of 10 hours driving and eight hours
off, but since they don't account for the other six hours of the
day a driver could legally stay behind the wheel for 16 hours in
one 24-hour period.
</P>
<P>
   The department has estimated that those long hours are in part
responsible for the 755 annual fatalities and nearly 20,000
injuries resulting from crashes involving fatigued commercial
drivers.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed rules would require drivers of trucks and buses to
operate on a 24-hour cycle, with 12 hours of allowable driving
time. Two consecutive nights of sleep between midnight and 6 a.m.
would be required every seven days for long-haul drivers.
</P>
<P>
   Safety groups said the new rules didn't go far enough, but the
trucking industry attacked them as counterproductive to safe
highways. They said the rules would require trucking companies to
hire more new, inexperienced drivers and force trucks to operate
during daylight hours when highways are crowded with passenger
cars. Unions said truckers would see reduced earning power.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate, in its version of the $30 billion transportation
spending bill for fiscal year 2001, barred all funds for the
Transportation Department to move ahead with the new rules.
</P>
<P>
   While the House and Senate are still working out final details
of that spending bill, sources said they had agreed on a compromise
in which comments and research on the new trucking hours rules
could go forward but no final decision would be reached in fiscal
2001, which begins Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are going to let the industry decide when the rule is
going to be issued,'' complained Jackie Gillan, vice president of
Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety.
</P>
<P>
   ''They caved essentially,'' Joan Claybrook, president of Public
Citizen, said of the Clinton administration's role in putting
together the compromise. Her group had suggested that the
department make some revisions to their proposals and provide
another six months for comment.
</P>
<P>
   But Rob Black of the Teamsters said the union was pleased with
the compromise, which he said would give Teamsters officials more
time to get the opinions of their members about how to improve
rules on hours.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Whittinghill, senior vice president of the American Trucking
Associations, said that while new rules were needed, the group had
lobbied hard against the department's proposals because ''they just
flat don't work in the real world.''
</P>
<P>
   That message apparently was heard. Earlier this month 177 House
members signed a letter written to Wolf by Reps. Deborah Pryce,
R-Ohio, and Bob Clement, D-Tenn., expressing support for the Senate
ban on the rulemaking. They claimed the proposals ''will most
likely be detrimental to safety on the highways.''
</P>
<P>
   The Transportation Department issued the proposal last spring
and has twice delayed the suggested date for putting them into
effect, most recently until mid-December.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the trucking hours issue, lawmakers negotiating
the spending bill also were moving toward an agreement on another
major safety issue, setting a nationwide standard of 0.08 percent
blood alcohol content for drunken driving.
</P>
<P>
   Under the drunken driving standard included in the original
Senate bill but not the House version, states could eventually lose
up to 10 percent of their federal highway money if they don't
impose 0.08 laws. In the compromise being considered, there would
be no penalties in the first two years and those penalties would
rise only to 8 percent over four years.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The Transportation spending bill is H.R. 4475.

<HEADLINE> Budget Deals Sought in Congress  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN FRAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans are trying to nail down deals on
easing trade sanctions against Cuba and creating a new land
conservation program sought by the Clinton administration in hopes
of breaking Congress' logjam on its budget work.
</P>
<P>
   Just three days from the Oct. 1 start of fiscal 2001, lawmakers
were hoping to push at least one more spending bill through the
House on Thursday, providing about $23.6 billion for energy and
water projects. So far, only two of the 13 annual spending measures
for next year have become law.
</P>
<P>
   The energy bill, however, faces a White House veto threat
because it would block the administration from moving toward
allowing a seasonal surge in the Missouri River's waters to protect
endangered birds and fish.
</P>
<P>
   With Election Day just six weeks off, the issue pits
environmental concerns against opposition by farm and shipping
interests -- as well as members of both parties from Missouri, a
swing state in the presidential race. Among the opponents of
changing the river's flow are Gov. Mel Carnahan, the Democratic
Senate candidate, and House Democratic leader Dick Gephardt.
</P>
<P>
   ''That would be a serious error,'' Sen. Kit Bond, R-Mo., who
wants to leave the river's controlled flows unaltered, said of a
Clinton veto.
</P>
<P>
   White House budget chief Jack Lew told reporters that ''we were
as clear as we could be'' about vetoing the overall bill if the
Missouri River language remained.
</P>
<P>
   Sweetening the energy and water bill were dozens of new projects
that lawmakers squeezed in, including $24 million for flood control
and cleanup projects in Kentucky won by Rep. Harold Rogers, R-Ky.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, with the certainty that most spending bills won't be
approved by midnight Saturday, the Senate prepared to approve a
measure keeping federal agencies open through Oct. 6. That is
expected to be the first of several stopgap measures to avoid a
federal shutdown while budget talks continue.
</P>
<P>
   The energy and water measure -- $1.9 billion larger than the
version the House approved in June -- is one of many spending bills
whose price tags are swelling because of demands from the Clinton
administration and lawmakers from both parties.
</P>
<P>
   Another, the $18 billion Interior Department bill, is $3 billion
bigger than the version the House approved.
</P>
<P>
   To it, White House and congressional bargainers were hoping to
add a compromise multibillion-dollar land conservation program.
Still unclear were the exact cost and the specific programs it
could be used for, but the emerging measure was sure to be smaller
than a 15-year, $45 billion version the House overwhelmingly
approved in May.
</P>
<P>
   The administration also objected to some environmental
provisions in the Interior bill. Republicans were ready to drop
language, opposed by Clinton, easing environmental protections for
New Hampshire's White Mountains and Colorado's White River, aides
said.
</P>
<P>
   On a separate agriculture measure, GOP leaders agreed among
themselves to partly lift food and drug trade sanctions against
Cuba by letting U.S. financial institutions help arrange
third-country financing of such sales, said Rep. Roy Blunt, R-Mo.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear how widespread support for the plan was. But
partially easing the 37-year-old sanctions would end a lengthy
battle between congressional foes of Cuban leader Fidel Castro, a
coalition of farm-state lawmakers who want more trade, and liberals
and conservatives who say such trade is the best way to loosen
Communism's grip on the Caribbean nation.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers also were moving toward easing restrictions on
importing U.S.-made drugs from overseas, where they often sell for
less. They also were ready to include $3.5 billion to help farmers
hurt by fires, drought and other problems, said House
Appropriations Committee Chairman Bill Young, R-Fla.
</P>
<P>
   The agriculture bill was expected to exceed $75 billion.

<HEADLINE> Isler, Foerster Sail to 470 Silver  </HEADLINE>
By BERNIE WILSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Sydney Harbor's winds finally opened
up, and so did the haul of U.S. Olympic sailing medals.
</P>
<P>
   With a brisk nor'easter raking the harbor, J.J. Isler of San
Diego made a dramatic comeback on the final leg to win the women's
470 silver medal Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   A little more than an hour later on the same course, Paul
Foerster of Rockwall, Texas, took the men's 470 silver by winning
the final fleet race, leading at every mark.
</P>
<P>
   The Australian crews won both 470 gold medals, their country's
first in sailing since 1972. They were saluted with horn blasts
from the huge spectator fleet and passing ferries at the finish
line, with Sydney Opera House and Harbor Bridge in the distance.
</P>
<P>
   The women's 470 gold went to Jenny Armstrong and Belinda
Stowell. The men's winning crew was Tom King and Mark Turnbull, the
reigning world champions.
</P>
<P>
   Isler and Foerster became repeat Olympic medalists, giving the
United States three sailing medals in these games. Americans won
just two bronze medals in an embarrassing performance in home
waters in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Brothers Jonathan and Charlie McKee of Seattle won the 49er
bronze medal in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   Foerster entered the race in second place and needed to win and
have the Aussies finish sixth or worse in order to win the gold.
</P>
<P>
   Foerster did his part by pinching off the Aussies at the start
and forcing them to tack off. The Australians were toward the back
of the 29-boat fleet at the first mark, but made a stunning
comeback sailing into the wind for the second time and were third
rounding the mark, behind Foerster and the Ukraine crew.
</P>
<P>
   Having the big early lead over the Aussies ''was short-lived but
kind of exciting,'' said Bob Merrick of Portsmouth, R.I.,
Foerster's crewman.
</P>
<P>
   ''We expected to have a chance going into the last race,''
Merrick added. ''That's really all you can count on
</P>
<P>
   King and Turnbull finished second in the race, beating Foerster
and Merrick by four points in the standings.
</P>
<P>
   The deciding races had been scheduled for Wednesday, but the
wind died to practically nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday was a more typical Sydney Harbor day, with the wind
hitting 15-17 knots.
</P>
<P>
   Foerster, 36, of Rockwall, Texas, won the Flying Dutchman silver
medal in 1992, then saw the class knocked out of the Olympic
lineup. He sat out the 1996 Games, then switched to the 470.
</P>
<P>
   He trained intensely with Merrick, 29, of Portsmouth, R.I., and
was the world's top-ranked 470 skipper coming in.
</P>
<P>
   Isler, meanwhile, rode the harbor's notorious shifting wind to a
dramatic comeback.
</P>
<P>
   In 10th place and out of the medals at the top mark, Isler
sailed close to Bradley's Head and passed four boats on the
spinnaker run to the finish. She finished sixth, enough to beat
Ukraine by one point for the silver.
</P>
<P>
   Isler was in good position sailing upwind on the first leg, but
got into bad air coming off other boats' sails as they approached
the mark. She never recovered until the final leg.
</P>
<P>
   Isler said she was passed by the Greek and Dutch boats sailing
close to Bradley's Head on the second downwind leg and gaining from
a big puff. So she tried it on the last downwind run and began to
close in on the boat from Ukraine, which could have edged them for
the silver.
</P>
<P>
   ''Out of the corner of my eye I was counting boats between us
and the Ukrainian boat and realizing, 'Ooh, this looks pretty
good,' '' Isler said.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong and Stowell ran away with the race and handily won the
gold.
</P>
<P>
   It's the second Olympic medal for Isler, 36, who took the 470
bronze in 1992. Her crewmember, Pease Glaser, 38, of Long Beach,
Calif., was in her first Olympics and matched the silver medal won
by her husband, Jay, in the Tornado Class in 1984. Glaser had tried
and failed to make the Olympic team three previous times.
</P>
<P>
   Isler and Glaser were unsure of their chances coming into the
games, because they lost training time after Isler became pregnant
with her second daughter. But they also figured that their
experience would be a factor.

<HEADLINE> Aussie Walker Booted From 20k Race  </HEADLINE>
By ROB GLOSTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- After walking for nearly 90 minutes,
Jane Saville could hear the roar of a jubilant hometown crowd
awaiting her entry into Olympic Stadium. Then the stadium suddenly
went silent.
</P>
<P>
   Saville had a comfortable lead in the 20-kilometer walk, and was
only about 150 meters from an Australian gold medal, when disaster
struck. A race judge waved a red card at Saville, signaling her
disqualification.
</P>
<P>
   After entering the stadium tunnel in anticipation of a hero's
welcome, she turned around and walked away in tears.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's bitterly disappointing, I thought I was going to win the
gold medal in my hometown,'' she said. ''I was thinking this is
going to be the most awesome experience of my life, and it was not
to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Saville's disqualification allowed China's Wang Liping to
capture the gold medal. Kjersti Plaetzer of Norway won silver and
Maria Vasco of Spain took the bronze.
</P>
<P>
   In the men's 20-kilometer walk last week, Mexico's Bernardo
Segura crossed the finish line first -- only to find out later he
had been disqualified. That gave the gold medal to Poland's Robert
Korzeniowski.
</P>
<P>
   Saville already had been given two white warning cards, and knew
a third ''lifting'' infraction -- not maintaining contact with the
ground -- would warrant a red card and automatic disqualification.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the other leaders already had been disqualified.
Elisabetta Perrone of Italy continued to walk with Saville at the
front of the race even after getting a red card, but finally
stopped and walked off the course in the final kilometer.
</P>
<P>
   As Saville headed into the stadium tunnel, chief judge Lamberto
Vacchi suddenly pulled out his red card. Saville threw her arms in
the air and looked up in disbelief.
</P>
<P>
   ''I said, 'No, No, not me,'' she said. ''He said, 'Yes.'''
</P>
<P>
   In the stadium, where Saville's imminent arrival was being shown
on a jumbo video screen, there was a hush. Fans who had rushed to
the rail with cameras in hand put their heads down and walked
sullenly back to their seats.
</P>
<P>
   Saville did not continue walking through the tunnel, but headed
instead to a hill overlooking the stadium to look for her coach. A
half-hour later, she finally entered the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't know what to do, I was quite embarrassed -- all these
people waiting for me in the stadium,'' she said. ''I could hear
the crowd in the tunnel, and my friends were at the finish line.''
</P>
<P>
   Wang won in 1 hour, 29 minutes, 5 seconds in the inaugural
20-kilometer walk for women at the Olympics. The event replaced the
10-kilometer walk that was contested at the 1992 and 1996 games.
</P>
<P>
   Michelle Rohl was the top American in the race, finishing 17th
in 1:34.26. Chen Yueling, who won the 1992 gold medal in the
10-kilometer walk while competing for China and was granted
permission last month to compete for the United States, was 38th.
U.S. teammate Debbie Lawrence finished 44th.

<HEADLINE> Killer on probation, friend arrested in stadium bottle-throwing incident </HEADLINE>
By KATHERINE ROTH
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Corrections officials will review a copy of the
complaint against Brian Peterson and a recommendation from his
parole officer before deciding if his arrest on a charge of
interfering with a police officer will have any effect on his
probation status.
</P>
<P>
   Peterson, on probation for the 1996 killing of his newborn son,
was released on his own recognizance Wednesday after being
arraigned on the charge, which came after an arrest at Tuesday's
Mets game.
</P>
<P>
   A misdemeanor conviction would not necessarily mean his
probation would be revoked, said Beth Welch, a spokeswoman for the
Delaware Department of Corrections.
</P>
<P>
   ''Anything is possible,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Peterson, 22, pleaded innocent to the charge at the arraignment
in Queens criminal court. He was arrested Tuesday after a friend
allegedly threw a bottle at Atlanta Braves pitcher John Rocker and
he allegedly got in the way when police attempted to arrest the
friend.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Stephen Knopf chastised Peterson when talking to his
attorney, Russell Gioiella.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the media reports are correct, I hope your client realizes
the stupidity of his actions,'' Knopf said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nobody in Queens is more aware of the stupidity of his actions
than my client,'' Gioiella replied.
</P>
<P>
   The bottle landed about 10 feet from Rocker, who has been
vilified by New Yorkers since he disparaged them in a magazine
article last year.
</P>
<P>
   Police said Raymond Maniaci threw the bottle from the first-base
box seats. Maniaci, 22, of Wyckoff, N.J., was charged with reckless
endangerment. Peterson, also of Wyckoff, was charged with
obstructing governmental administration and disorderly conduct.
</P>
<P>
   Maniaci was arraigned Wednesday after Peterson. He pleaded
innocent to the reckless endangerment charge and was released on
his own recognizance.
</P>
<P>
   News reports said that when police tried to arrest Maniaci,
Peterson got between them and his friend and refused to step away.
</P>
<P>
   But Peterson told his mother, Barbara Zuchowski, that it was a
misunderstanding, that he was turning to step away as one officer
had instructed, his Delaware lawyer, Joseph Hurley, said after
talking to the mother.
</P>
<P>
   Peterson pleaded guilty in 1998 to manslaughter - along with his
girlfriend, Amy Grossberg - in the November 1996 death of their
newborn son at a motel room in Delaware.
</P>
<P>
   Peterson was given a two-year sentence, six months shorter than
Grossberg's, after he agreed to testify against her. He was
released from prison after serving 1&AMP;frac12; years and is currently
serving a two-year probation.
</P>
<P>
   Peterson also was sentenced to complete 300 hours of community
service and pay a $6,000 fine.
</P>
<P>
   Welch said Peterson is required to inform his probation officer
if he is arrested and if he leaves New Jersey. She added that he
did receive permission to attend Tuesday's game.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Police, Palestinians Clash  </HEADLINE>
By DINA KRAFT
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Israeli riot police fired rubber bullets
Thursday at about 200 Palestinian stone throwers in a key Jerusalem
shrine that is revered by Muslims and Jews and whose fate is hotly
disputed in Israeli-Palestinian peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   The clash broke out just moments after the leader of Israel's
hardline opposition, Ariel Sharon, left the compound, followed by
Palestinian chants of ''Murderer, get out.''
</P>
<P>
   About 200 young Palestinians threw stones at hundreds of police,
many in full riot gear, who were deployed around the shrine to
protect Sharon, leader of the Likud party. Police fired rubber
bullets at the protesters and marched toward them with clubs to try
to push them into nearby buildings.
</P>
<P>
   At least three Palestinians were injured by the rubber bullets,
including one who was struck in the mouth. Two demonstrators were
treated for head injuries, apparently from police clubs. Police
said about two dozen officers were injured by stones. One was
rushed to a nearby ambulance on a stretcher.
</P>
<P>
   The compound is the fault line of the Israeli-Palestinian
conflict. Deadly clashes erupted in 1990 and 1996, as rival claims
to the site heated up.
</P>
<P>
   The shrine is known to Jews as the Temple Mount, site of the
former Jewish Temple, the most sacred shrine of Judaism. Muslims
call it Haram as-Sharif, or Noble Sanctuary, home to two major
mosques -- Al Aqsa and Dome of the Rock -- that mark the spot where
tradition says the Prophet Muhammad ascended to heaven. The
compound is the third holiest site of Islam, after Mecca and
Medina.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli-Palestinian peace talks are hung up because of a dispute
over who will control the holy shrine. For now, Muslim clerics have
autonomy in administering the site, although Israeli police remains
in charge of security.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian leaders said Sharon's visit, intended to demonstrate
Israeli sovereignty claims, was a provocation.
</P>
<P>
   Sharon denied the allegation. ''What provocation is there when
Jews come to visit the place with a message of peace?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   When Sharon began his visit Thursday morning, accompanied by
members of his Likud party, about 1,000 Israeli police were
deployed around the site.
</P>
<P>
   Young Palestinians defiantly shouted ''Allahu Akbar'' (God is
great). Some tried to break through the police cordon but were
pushed back. Faisal Husseini, a senior Palestinian official
responsible for Jerusalem, was struck in the leg by a policeman's
club.
</P>
<P>
   After his Temple Mount visit, Sharon stopped at the Western
Wall, a remnant of the Temple and today the holiest site of
Judaism. Some Jewish worshippers cheered and clapped when they
spotted Sharon.,
</P>
<P>
   The mosque compound has been the site of bloody clashes in the
past.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, rumors that Jewish extremists planned to start
rebuilding the Temple started a riot in which 17 Palestinians were
killed and scores wounded by police gunfire. In 1996, the Israeli
government opened an archaeological tunnel just outside the
compound, sparking riots in which 80 people, most of them
Palestinians, were killed.

<HEADLINE> Kafelnikov Wins Tennis Gold Medal  </HEADLINE>
By STEVEN WINE
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- The first set alone took 70 minutes,
and at that point Yevgeny Kafelnikov and Tommy Haas were just
getting loose.
</P>
<P>
   They played more than 3 1/2 hours for a gold medal Thursday, and
Kafelnikov beat the unseeded German 7-6 (4), 3-6, 6-2, 4-6, 6-3 in
the Olympic final.
</P>
<P>
   Kafelnikov, seeded fifth, improved to 5-1 this year in
five-setters, including three victories at the French Open and one
at the U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
   The tournament title was the first this year for the Russian, a
two-time Grand Slam champion. He had talked of skipping the
Olympics because he was discouraged by the way he was playing.
</P>
<P>
   On a mild, sunny day, both players held up well physically
despite the many long points and long games. The match came down to
the only break point of the final set, and Haas hit an easy
backhand into the net. That gave Kafelnikov a 5-3 lead, and he
served out the match at love.
</P>
<P>
   The jubilant Russian heaved his racket 15 rows into the stands
and threw a ball into the upper deck. He then waved a Russian flag
to cheers from the crowd, which included International Olympic
Committee president Juan Antonio Samaranch.
</P>
<P>
   There were four service breaks in the opening set before
Kafelnikov won the tiebreaker. He landed a crosscourt backhand on
the sideline to reach set point, and Haas then dumped a backhand
into the bottom of the net.
</P>
<P>
   But the hustling Haas kept coming back and wowed the sellout
crowd with several scrambling saves, once blocking a Kafelnikov
overhead back for a winner.
</P>
<P>
   Kafelnikov seemed to have the momentum after dominating the
third set, but Haas broke to start the fourth set and easily held
serve five consecutive times to force a fifth set.
</P>
<P>
   Venus Williams, bidding for her second gold medal, played later
Thursday with sister Serena in the final of women's doubles against
Miriam Oremans and Kristie Boogert of the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   Arnaud Di Pasquale of France won the bronze in men's singles
Wednesday, beating Roger Federer of Switzerland 7-6 (5), 6-7 (7),
6-3.

<HEADLINE> Railroad Retirement Bill Threatened  </HEADLINE>
By CURT ANDERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A campaign-season bill to raise benefits for
thousands of retired rail workers and cut taxes for railroads
appears headed for passage in Congress despite concerns it could
drain $15 billion from the budget surplus and permit risky
investment in private securities.
</P>
<P>
   The bill arose from two years of negotiations between railroads
and unions representing 250,000 workers and 650,000 retirees,
widows and dependents -- from every state and most congressional
districts -- to overhaul a federal retirement system older than
Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, it would permit investment of some railroad
retirement funds in private securities in hopes of increasing the
rate of return to finance an increase in benefits for workers and a
$400 million annual reduction in payroll taxes paid by the
railroads.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is a win for railroads. It is a win for railroad labor. It
is a win for retirees,'' said Rep. Jim Oberstar, D-Minn., before
the House passed the bill earlier this month on a 391-25 vote.
</P>
<P>
   The retirement age for rail workers would fall to 60 from 62 and
surviving spouses of rail workers would see a sizable increase in
their benefits.
</P>
<P>
   But according to the Congressional Budget Office, the railroad
pension bill could consume $15 billion of the surplus in fiscal
2001, which begins Sunday. This would occur because a large pension
reserve fund now invested in government securities would be
transferred to a new trust overseen by a seven-member board, who
would invest it in private markets.
</P>
<P>
   That would jeopardize the plan by Republican congressional
leaders to set aside 90 percent of next year's surplus to pay down
public debt and use the remaining 10 percent for tax relief or
additional spending.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would be impossible to comply with the 90-10 debt plan,''
said Sen. Don Nickles, R-Okla., in papers filed with the Senate
Finance Committee -- which planned to consider the bill Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Nickles has proposed simply delaying by one year the effective
date of the legislation, which would sidestep the budget surplus
dilemma for now. The bill's sponsors also say the hit on the
surplus is a one-time cost associated with the redeeming of
Treasury bonds, which would eventually result in less public debt
and lower interest costs.
</P>
<P>
   But other proposed changes would be left in place, including
creation of a new, non-governmental board to invest a portion of
the pension money in private financial markets.
</P>
<P>
   The General Accounting Office, which acts as Congress'
investigative arm, noted in a report on the bill that these
investments offer ''the prospect of higher returns but greater
risk'' and that there is no limit placed on federal taxpayer
liability if things don't work out.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, GAO estimated that increasing the benefits and
reducing payroll taxes would worsen the current system's unfunded
liability of $40 billion over 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   The system, the GAO concluded, ''could face a more pronounced
shortfall if the new investment plan does not deliver the expected
results.'' That could require a tax increase, which would be borne
by the railroads, sponsors said.
</P>
<P>
   Some lawmakers, and the White House, are concerned that this
system sets a poor example for Social Security, where there are
several proposals to permit investment of payroll taxes in private
markets.
</P>
<P>
   A White House statement said the legislation ''could encourage
excessive risk without sufficient safeguards or oversight, in a
fashion that would set an unfortunate precedent.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, has proposed a series of amendments
requiring that any railroad fund tax cuts or benefit increases be
contingent on successful returns on the private investments and
giving beneficiaries individual rights over their portion of money
they've paid in.
</P>
<P>
   There has also been some grumbling among lawmakers about other
odd features of the rail retirement system, including a quirk in
the law in which income taxes paid by retirees on their benefits
are immediately transferred back to the retirement fund -- a
transfer amounting to $265 million in this fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   ''This bill maintains a special subsidy available to no other
industry,'' said Rep. Nick Smith, R-Mich.
</P>
<P>
   Still, given the lopsided House vote in favor of the bill and
the fact that 78 of the 100 senators are listed as co-sponsors, the
measure appears likely to win final approval before Congress
adjourns for the year.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. E. Clay Shaw, R-Fla., said one driving force behind the
legislation was ''seeing the industry and the unions coming
together to ask for these changes. This bill is a good thing for
the United States taxpayers.''
</P>
<P>

   The bill is H.R. 4844.

<HEADLINE> Land Conservation Bill Snagged  </HEADLINE>
By H. JOSEF HEBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Despite overwhelming bipartisan appeal,
prospects are fading for congressional approval of a widely
heralded $45 billion land conservation proposal that has fallen
victim to a congressional turf fight and determined opposition from
a handful of Western senators.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation, which would commit the government to spend $3
billion a year for 15 years on a wide range of land conservation
efforts, cleared the House earlier this year by a 3-1 margin.
Recently, 63 senators urged Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott,
R-Miss., to call it up for a floor vote.
</P>
<P>
   But its supporters acknowledged Wednesday that the proposal as
once envisioned was all but dead, with negotiations now focusing on
a significantly scaled back land conservation proposal, whose fate
also was uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   Protection of open spaces -- from vast tracks of federal forests
to suburban parks and bike paths -- gained growing interest on
Capitol Hill and at the White House this election year as opinion
polls suggested widespread public support for such spending.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton early on offered his $1 billion ''land
legacy'' initiative, and then the House did the president one
better approving on a 315-102 vote in May a package tripled that
size. In July, a similar $3 billion-a-year plan was drafted in the
Senate, but languished.
</P>
<P>
   This week a compromise proposal was crafted that would authorize
spending about $12 billion over six years, a pale version of the
Conservation and Investment Act, or CARA, that passed the House and
continues to have huge support in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The unusually broad support of the original proposal was
demonstrated in the House where two lawmakers who have rarely
agreed on anything -- Don Young, the conservative Republican from
Alaska, and George Miller, the liberal Democrat from California --
guided it through the Resources Committee.
</P>
<P>
   With money flowing from budget surpluses, the bill -- dubbed by
some as ''environmental pork'' and others as a ''land grab'' -- had
something for almost everyone: money for fixing up beach erosion,
creating new wetlands, establishing conservation easements to
protect imperiled species, buying land for suburban parks and bike
paths, and to protect wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   Its supporters included hunters and backpackers, most
environmental groups and business groups as well as most governors
and countless mayors, all of whom saw huge amounts of federal
dollars flowing their way.
</P>
<P>
   The bill promised an uninterrupted flow of money not subject to
annual congressional whims, requiring for the first time full
funding at $900 million a year a federal-state land buying program
that over the years has annually been shortchanged by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   And while states like Louisiana, California and Alaska stood to
reap the biggest windfall because of their association with
offshore oil development and long coastlines, even landlocked
states like Kansas and Vermont would get millions of dollars
annually under the distribution formula.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed like a bill destined to be put on a fast track to the
White House.
</P>
<P>
   But some of its supporters underestimated the power of a small
group of senators, especially in the closing days of the
congressional session, and the power of those lawmakers who chair
the committees that annually decide how the government's money is
spent.
</P>
<P>
   The $3 billion that would be distributed annually under CARA --
revenue from federal oil and gas leases -- would be released
automatically under a formula to states without any say from the
congressional appropriations committees. That unleashed a
high-powered turf fight from start.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., chairman of the Senate Interior
Appropriations subcommittee, and his counterpart in the House, Rep.
Ralph Regula, R-Ohio, argued that the bill amounts to an
uncontrolled entitlement that would release billions of dollars a
year without congressional controls.
</P>
<P>
   ''We shouldn't create an entitlement program and say land
acquisition is more important than education and health care,''
argued Gorton, whose subcommittee controls how money involving land
policies is spent.
</P>
<P>
   Just as significant was the strong opposition from a half-dozen
Republican senators from the intermountain West who saw the bill as
a threat to property rights. Their states -- Montana, Wyoming,
Colorado and Idaho, among them -- stood to gain relatively little in
money, but were regions of the country where the property rights
campaign has been strong.
</P>
<P>
   They vowed to filibuster if Lott, who supported CARA, brought it
to the floor, and they had as their ally Sen. Don Nickles, R-Okla.,
the Senate's assistant majority leader.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you're going to buy land it should have congressional
approval. It circumvents the constitution,'' argued Nickles,
predicting months ago the measure would never make it through the
Senate.

<HEADLINE> Combat Readiness Said in Threat  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The debate over whether U.S. troops are combat
ready has produced a paradox about today's military: While called
the best in the world, it also is described as overworked,
underpaid, and short of ammunition, pilots and research dollars.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush, the Republican presidential nominee, accuses the
Clinton administration of running the military into the ground by
sending it on too many overseas missions while skimping on defense
dollars. Morale among the troops is sinking and combat readiness is
on the decline, he proclaims.
</P>
<P>
   In its defense, the Clinton administration points out that last
year the troops received the biggest pay raise in a generation,
that defense investment is on the rise and that the highest
re-enlistment rates are among those units operating abroad on such
missions as peacekeeping in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, the chiefs of the military services are quick to
boast that the U.S. military is the best in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ''In my 37 years in uniform, I have never been around better
soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines,'' Army Gen. Henry H.
Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told the Senate
Armed Services Committee on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Shelton quoted a former Army chief of staff, retired Gen. John
Wickham Jr., as saying recently, ''The truth is that America has
the strongest, best-equipped, best-trained and best-led military
capability in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I think General Wickham has it right,'' Shelton said.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, each of the military chiefs also told the Senate and
House armed services committees they are worried that war-fighting
capability will erode unless spending goes up dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   ''We must find the resources necessary to modernize the force,''
said Shelton. Otherwise the cumulative strains of carrying out
peacekeeping and other overseas missions -- while also preparing for
major wars -- will erode combat readiness, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Shelton did not say how much more should be spent, beyond the
current budget of nearly $300 billion. He said specific figures
could be established after a planned review of national security
strategy next year.
</P>
<P>
   If the military is performing so remarkably well, what's all the
fuss about trouble in the ranks?
</P>
<P>
   Shelton, the highest-ranking military adviser to the president
and the secretary of defense, said that for several years the
Pentagon has used money that was meant to buy new weapons and
equipment to pay for training and other day-to-day costs. That has
kept troops ready for combat, but at the cost of replacing aging
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our equipment is wearing out at a much faster rate than
expected,'' Shelton said. ''Consequently, our troops are paying the
price'' by spending more time fixing mechanical problems instead of
training for war.
</P>
<P>
   And Gen. Eric Shinseki, the Army's chief of staff, said troop
reductions during the 1990s went too far.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need more people,'' he said. ''Our soldiers believe that
the Army is too small for the missions it is asked to perform.'' He
did not say how many soldiers the Army needs beyond the 480,000 it
now has on active duty.
</P>
<P>
   Shinseki and the other military chiefs were speaking to mostly
sympathetic audiences on Capitol Hill. Still, there were some
voices of caution.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Mary Landrieu, D-La., said the $300 billion in military
spending is more than five times larger than the military budget of
Russia, the second largest spender. It is more than 22 times as
large as the combined spending of the seven countries traditionally
identified by the Pentagon as our most likely adversaries: Cuba,
Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Sudan and Syria. And it is more
than the combined spending of the next 12 biggest-spending nations,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need to spend the money we have better'' before trying to
make the case for spending more, said Landrieu.

<HEADLINE> Official Accused of Obstruction  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY MARGASAK
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A House subcommittee chairman says a Labor
Department offical was ''orchestrating active opposition'' to
veterans legislation despite a law that prohibits use of federal
funds for a lobbying campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Terry Everett, R-Ala., chairman of the House Veterans
Affairs investigative subcommittee, told Assistant Labor Secretary
Espiridion Borrego at a hearing Wednesday that he asked the
department's inspector general to investigate whether there was
''serious obstruction'' by the official.
</P>
<P>
   A statute bars use of federal funds for lobbying activities
intended to influence a lawmaker's position on legislation. Borrego
has opposed a bill -- now expected to die in committee -- that would
have imposed performance standards for veterans job counselors
whose pay is funded by the Labor Department.
</P>
<P>
   Everett said he was concerned about allegations that Borrego
attempted to persuade Miss America, Heather French, to change House
testimony she was giving in favor of the bill; threatened to
withhold grant money from a homeless veterans organization unless
the group backed his view on the bill; and used federal funds to
lobby against the legislation in Everett's district.
</P>
<P>
   Everett said it appeared that Borrego was ''orchestrating active
opposition'' to the legislation despite the anti-lobbying law.
''This is serious obstruction to Congress doing its business. Who's
going to run the country, duly elected members of Congress or
overzealous bureaucrats?''
</P>
<P>
   He asked the inspector general to investigate letters,
memoranda, telephone logs, notes and e-mail to determine whether
the law was violated.
</P>
<P>
   Borrego, who is in charge of veterans employment and training
programs in the Labor Department, responded that the agency's chief
lawyer concluded earlier this month that no rules or laws were
broken by Borrego in his conversation with French. Borrego said he
made ''no attempt to have Ms. French advance any position in her
testimony.''
</P>
<P>
   He did not address other allegations, but previously has denied
through a department spokesman that he threatened to withhold grant
money.
</P>
<P>
   The inspector general acts independently of the labor secretary,
unlike the department solicitor who conducted the initial review;
that official who works directly for the secretary.
</P>
<P>
   French, who has made homeless veterans her cause, had told The
Associated Press in July that on the eve of her testimony in favor
of the legislation, Borrego tried in a telephone call to persuade
her to change her position. The AP reported last week that the
director of the National Coalition for Homeless Veterans, Linda
Boone, has told Labor Department investigators that Borrego had
threatened to withhold grant money.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 13, the department rejected a request from Boone's
coalition for a $121,277 grant to assist community groups serving
homeless veterans.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph McGowan, a spokesman for the inspector general, said the
office is evaluating Everett's request.

<HEADLINE> GAO Reports on U.S. Nursing Homes  </HEADLINE>
By JANELLE CARTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two years after federal investigators found
serious care problems at many of the nation's 17,000 nursing homes,
a new government report cites progress but notes an increase in
homes with deficiencies.
</P>
<P>
   ''Vigilance by both state and federal officials must be
unrelenting to ensure the safety and well-being of the nation's
nursing home residents,'' William Scanlon, director of health,
financing and public health issues for the General Accounting
Office said in testimony prepared for a hearing Thursday before the
Senate Special Committee on Aging.
</P>
<P>
   The president two years ago announced a series of initiatives to
improve nursing homes after congressional hearings found
significant problems. The GAO, Congress' investigative arm, has
been monitoring the progress of those initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   ''While we've made some improvements, it still seems in many
ways we've been stuck in the same position since day one,'' said
Sen. John Breaux, a Louisiana Democrat who is the committee's
ranking member.
</P>
<P>
   The committee's chairman, Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa, said
''These efforts must be sustained -- they must not be allowed to
falter -- in order for us to realize their potential for improved
nursing home care.''
</P>
<P>
   The agency's investigation found a ''marginal increase
nationwide in the proportion of homes with documented actual
harm.'' Seventeen states had an increase of 5 percent or greater of
the number of homes with deficiencies. For instance, Arizona had
the highest increase, 19.6 percent, followed by Arkansas with a
16.1 percent increase and New York with a 14.3 percent increase.
</P>
<P>
   But investigators said the results could be caused by several
things, including more rigorous efforts by states to identify
problems. ''The survey results could also suggest that nursing
homes may not have made sufficient strides to measurably improve
residents' quality care,'' Scanlon said.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reason for the change, Scanlon said it is
imperative that the Health Care Financing Administration, which
sets standards for nursing homes, continue to act.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the report noted that the health agency sometimes
lagged in its efforts to track how well states conducted surprise
visits.
</P>
<P>
   ''The performance of oversight can neither be taken for granted
nor relaxed, which means that neither HCFA nor the states can
afford to lose their current momentum,'' Scanlon said.

<HEADLINE> Hollywood Execs Admit Bad Judgment  </HEADLINE>
By MICHELLE DeARMOND
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- To Matt Casazza and fellow teens, the debate
raging over Hollywood's marketing of violent films to youth leaves
them with one question: Who cares?
</P>
<P>
   ''Sooner or later they're all gonna come out on tape and then
you can rent it,'' the 15-year-old Casazza said. ''It doesn't
really matter, because they don't card at (video stores).''
</P>
<P>
   Teen-agers across the country were largely unaware of -- and
uninterested in -- the Senate committee hearings under way in
Washington on Wednesday in which Hollywood executives admitted
marketing movies made for adults to children.
</P>
<P>
   Despite pressure from lawmakers, executives refused to promise
an end to the practice. Joseph Lieberman, the Democratic vice
presidential nominee and senator from Casazza's home state of
Connecticut, derided movie makers for refusing to ''say explicitly
that they would stop marketing adult-rated products to our
children.''
</P>
<P>
   Although many teens said there's too much sex and violence in
many films, they agreed with Casazza that Washington is powerless
to do much about it.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think (lawmakers) can stop you from seeing something
out there,'' said Cassity Hamilton, a 12-year-old resident of the
Atlanta suburb of Woodstock, Ga. ''Kids are going to watch what
they want, some way.''
</P>
<P>
   Sarah Wilson, a 16-year-old resident of Chapel Hill, N.C., said
her class at school had discussed the debate over advertising for
R-rated movies, which are supposed to be restricted to people 17
and older unless accompanied by a parent. While she goes to R-rated
films in theaters, she thinks Hollywood goes overboard on the
violence and nudity.
</P>
<P>
   ''Most of it's unnecessary anyway,'' she said. ''If they really
want kids to watch the movie, then they should put things in it
that are appropriate for kids. I think (violence) desensitizes us
to things that happen in everyday life.''
</P>
<P>
   Another 16-year-old North Carolina girl agreed that R-rated
movies are too violent for some young people.
</P>
<P>
   ''Little children don't need to be introduced to those things
until they're older. What kind of audience are they trying to
attract?'' asked Emily Alderman of Raleigh, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   One Southern California teen-ager who has been home-schooled
said he and his friends try to be selective about the R-rated
movies they watch.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of it is garbage in, garbage out. Know what I mean? The
movies tend to play up the sex and the violence,'' said Matthew
Beasley, an Orange County 17-year-old who watched R-rated movies
before his recent birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Studio executives said Wednesday that all R-rated films are not
inappropriate for young people and might even be valuable for
mature viewers under 17. The executives reminded the Senate
Commerce Committee that an ''R'' rating does not bar children, it
only requires they be accompanied by a parent.
</P>
<P>
   Rob White, a 17-year-old from Shelby, N.C., has gone to R-rated
movies with his parents.
</P>
<P>
   ''Ultimately I think it is the responsibility of the parents,''
he said. ''If the parents are responsible, then I don't think it
makes a difference what kids watch.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, teen-agers say they'll continue frequenting R-rated
movies because other films simply don't interest them.
</P>
<P>
   ''What else is there to go see? Any movie worth going to is
R-rated,'' said Shawn McReedy, a 13-year-old from Woodstock, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   Casazza and his 16-year-old friend Cate Holden agreed, saying
they shun ''G'' and PG-13 movies and ''don't do cartoons.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't want to see a G-rated movie,'' Casazza said. ''They
can make a PG-13 movie as long as it's not too corny. The Walt
Disney movies and stuff ... the happy endings -- I don't like
that.''

<HEADLINE> Church: Milosevic Opponent Wins  </HEADLINE>
By MISHA SAVIC
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Slobodan Milosevic's opponents
threatened on Thursday to call a general strike, shutting down
schools, offices and other public institutions until the president
recognizes their election victory and steps aside.
</P>
<P>
   Discussions about calling such a strike come amid efforts to
ratchet up the pressure on the Yugoslav leader, who is trying to
survive after finishing second to opposition leader Vojislav
Kostunica in Sunday's election.
</P>
<P>
   Kostunica earned 48.96 percent of the vote to 38.62 percent for
Milosevic, the State Election Commission said late Wednesday. That
would require a runoff Oct. 8. The opposition, however, using
figures from its poll watchers, claims Kostunica won 52.54 percent
to Milosevic's 32.01 percent -- which would mean he won outright.
</P>
<P>
   Kostunica's campaign manager called the government tally ''a bad
joke.'' Zoran Djindjic vowed to take the opposition beyond street
protests -- which have been unsuccessful -- by calling ''a total
blockade of the system and institutions.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We will call a general strike,'' Djindjic said. ''We shall
seek to paralyze all institutions, schools, theaters, cinemas,
offices ... call everyone onto the streets and stay on the streets
until he who wants to be president by force gives up his post.''
</P>
<P>
   The influential Serbian Orthodox Church also appealed for peace,
recognizing Kostunica's election victory and addressing him as
''president-elect.'' The church holds no direct political power in
Yugoslavia, but its dictates hold great moral sway in a population
that recognizes it as a pillar of rectitude in a corrupt society.
</P>
<P>
   The statements came the morning after more than 200,000 joyful
Milosevic opponents swarmed the capital's downtown district, waving
banners and chanting, ''He's finished.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest demonstration ever against Milosevic completely
blocked Belgrade's main streets around Republic Square. Much of the
downtown area teemed with people.
</P>
<P>
   ''Milosevic cannot resort to violence ... look how many people
took to the streets -- no one in this country has the power nor
dares give orders against these people,'' Milan Protic of the
opposition said. ''I believe no one in the police or army is
prepared to give his life for a man who lost the elections.''
</P>
<P>
   An opposition member of the electoral commission said the head
of the body presented the 13 members with the results late
Wednesday without allowing them to inspect the returns.
</P>
<P>
   Sinisa Nikolic said 300 of the more than 10,000 polling stations
never reported, and he accused the commission of reducing the
overall total by 600,000 votes.
</P>
<P>
   Some members of the election commission reportedly resigned from
their posts, due to ''pressures they were under to falsify the
results,'' media reported. Among them was Bojan Pudar, the deputy
head of the commission, FoNet news agency said.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton and other Western leaders have dismissed talk
of a runoff.
</P>
<P>
   ''The government's official election commission has no
credibility whatever,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   If Kostunica is installed in Belgrade, the United States will
move to lift economic sanctions against Yugoslavia and restore its
rights as a U.N. member state, Richard Holbrooke, the U.S.
ambassador to the United Nations, told the Security Council on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing the Belgrade crowd Wednesday, Kostunica repeated that
the opposition would not accept a runoff.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we bargained with them, we would recognize the lie instead
of the truth,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The victorious atmosphere at the Belgrade gathering also
suggested the pro-democracy Serbs no longer fear Milosevic's
autocratic government, sensing that he may not be able to hold on
much longer.
</P>
<P>
   Belgrade's ally Russia, however, warned Western countries not to
interfere. Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov said Moscow ''stands firmly
for the peoples of Yugoslavia to have full freedom to express their
will without internal or external pressure'' and urged other
countries ''not to allow destabilization of the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   A leader of the popular anti-Milosevic student group Otpor, or
Resistance, said students who took the brunt of Milosevic's
repression should also have a role in creating a new political
system in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ''Even the opposition must realize that a new, healthy system
can only be created with the energy of the young and
uncompromised,'' the student leader, Branko Ilic, said.

<HEADLINE> Suharto Ruled Unfit To Stand Trial  </HEADLINE>
By GEOFF SPENCER
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- An Indonesian court dismissed all
corruption charges against former dictator Suharto on Thursday
after doctors found him too sick to face charges he embezzled
millions from the state. One person was killed in ensuing riots.
</P>
<P>
   The decision of the five-judge panel to end the landmark trial
effectively ends attempts by pro-democracy reformers to punish
Suharto for allegedly abusing power during his 32-year reign. He
was accused of stealing at least $583 million before protests
forced him to step down in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of angry Suharto opponents took to the streets,
fighting in the pouring rain with police and with supporters of the
former president.
</P>
<P>
   At least one man was killed by an angry mob, police said, and
the private SCTV network reported the victim was a Suharto
supporter. A bus and several motorcycles were set afire.
Demonstrators threw rocks and gasoline bombs at officers, and
dozens were injured and arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses described how officers fired a tear gas gun at one
protester's head at close range and then beat him with sticks.
</P>
<P>
   As night fell scores of riot police guarded Suharto's central
Jakarta home as about 800 protesters and 200 Suharto supporters
threw rocks and bottles at one another.
</P>
<P>
   ''The doctors are all lying,'' Zul Sikri, a demonstrator, said
of the independent panel. ''Suharto must go to jail and we will
keep protesting until that happens.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision is likely to be considered a major setback to
efforts by the country's year-old reformist government to end
corruption and roll back Suharto's legacy of authoritarianism. It
also immediately freed him from house arrest and lifted other
travel restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Marzuki Darusman said state prosecutors would
appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no real will to give justice to the people,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''God is great! Long live Suharto!'' one of his jubilant
supporters cried out in the heavily guarded courtroom. For the most
part, the decision was greeted by the several hundred spectators in
the courtroom with stunned silence.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Thursday, a team of 23 court-appointed doctors said
three recent strokes had left the 79-year-old mentally incapable of
standing the rigors of a long court case. Suharto was facing
charges he embezzled the government funds in order to bankroll
businesses controlled by his cronies and children.
</P>
<P>
   ''Based on neurological and psychiatric tests, Suharto has
trouble expressing himself,'' said Dr. Zakaria, the head of the
independent team that examined Suharto last week. ''When he speaks
he stops often and uses sign language to express himself. He cannot
understand complex ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   The court appointed the medical team two weeks ago after
Suharto's private doctors said the strokes had left him
incapacitated. Government physicians maintained he was perfectly
capable of comprehending the case against him.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's session came as Suharto's youngest son, Hutomo
''Tommy'' Mandala Putra, waited to be arrested after being
convicted of corruption. He was sentenced to 18 months in jail.
</P>
<P>
   A surprise ruling by Indonesia's Supreme Court also ordered
Tommy to pay the equivalent of $3.5 million in fines.
</P>
<P>
   His lawyers said they were planning to launch an appeal against
the decision, which reversed a lower court acquittal last October.
</P>
<P>
   Tommy, 37, was charged in a multimillion-dollar property deal
with the state's main food supply agency in 1997. Prosecutors said
it enriched him but cost the government $10.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   There have been a series of deadly blasts in Jakarta recently,
including a Sept. 13 explosion at the Jakarta Stock Exchange that
killed 15 people. A bomb exploded Wednesday outside the office of a
human rights group, but nobody was injured and damage was minimal.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the blasts coincided with advances in the corruption
case against Suharto, leading to speculation that they were the
work of his supporters and elements of the security forces opposed
to President Abdurrahman Wahid's democratic reforms. At least 30
people have been arrested.

<HEADLINE> Clashes Erupt at Jerusalem Shrine  </HEADLINE>
By DINA KRAFT
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Helmeted Israeli riot police fired rubber
bullets Thursday at hundreds of Palestinian stone-throwers at a
Jerusalem holy site revered by both Muslims and Jews and hotly
contested in Israeli-Palestinian peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   The violence broke out just moments after the leader of Israel's
hard-line opposition, Ariel Sharon, left the compound. Chants of
''Murderer, get out'' followed Sharon.
</P>
<P>
   Near the West Bank town of Ramallah, about 200 Palestinian
university students angered by Sharon's visit threw stones at
Israeli troops who fired rubber-coated steel bullets. Four
Palestinians were injured, paramedics said. ''Jerusalem is the
capital of Palestine. Sharon, get out,'' read a banner carried by
the group.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat said Sharon's visit was ''very
dangerous'' and that Arab and Islamic nations should ''move very
fast'' in protecting the shrine.
</P>
<P>
   Also Thursday, an Israeli soldier critically injured in a bomb
attack on an army convoy in the Gaza Strip died of his wounds.
</P>
<P>
   The attack, blamed on Palestinian militants, occurred late
Wednesday as troops were escorting a convoy of Jewish settlers to
the isolated settlement of Netzarim, just south of Gaza City. An
officer was slightly injured in the attack.
</P>
<P>
   No Palestinian group has claimed responsibility. Barak demanded
that Arafat do more to rein in Islamic militants who are trying to
sabotage Mideast peace efforts.
</P>
<P>
   In the clashes at the Jerusalem shrine, Palestinian protesters,
many of them teen-agers still carrying their school bags, threw
stones, bottles and even a metal trash can at hundreds of helmeted
police in full riot gear, some huddling behind large Plexiglas
shields. The troops, deployed around the shrine to protect Sharon,
fired several rounds of rubber bullets at the protesters and struck
them with clubs to push them back.
</P>
<P>
   At least three Palestinians were injured by rubber bullets,
including a teen-ager who pressed his hands to his bloodied mouth
and then fell to the ground. Four Palestinians, including two
senior officials, were struck in the head by clubs. Police said
about two dozen officers were injured by stones. One was rushed to
a nearby ambulance on a stretcher.
</P>
<P>
   The compound is the fault line of the Israeli-Palestinian
conflict. Deadly clashes erupted in 1990 and 1996, as rival claims
to the site heated up.
</P>
<P>
   The shrine is known to Jews as the Temple Mount, site of the
former Jewish Temple, the most sacred shrine of Judaism. Muslims
call it Haram as-Sharif, or Noble Sanctuary, home to two major
mosques -- Al Aqsa and Dome of the Rock -- that mark the spot where
tradition says the Prophet Muhammad ascended to heaven. The
compound is the third holiest site of Islam, after Mecca and
Medina.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli-Palestinian peace talks are hung up because of a dispute
over who will control the holy shrine. For now, Muslim clerics have
autonomy in administering the site, although Israeli police remain
in charge of security.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian leaders said Sharon's visit, intended to demonstrate
Israeli sovereignty claims, was a provocation, but proved that
Israel has no real control there. ''He thought that this place
belongs to the Israelis, but the way he entered, with thousands of
police protecting him, was clear proof to all the world that the
Israelis have no sovereignty here,'' said Faisal Husseini, a senior
Palestinian official in charge of Jerusalem, who was struck in the
head by a club.
</P>
<P>
   Sharon, who staunchly opposes any concessions to the
Palestinians in Jerusalem, denied he was trying to provoke Muslim
worshippers. ''What provocation is there when Jews come to visit
the place with a message of peace?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Temple Mount is in our hands,'' he said, using the phrase
made famous by the late Israeli army officer Motta Gur when Israeli
troops captured Jerusalem's Old City and the holy shrines in the
1967 Mideast war.
</P>
<P>
   When Sharon began his visit Thursday morning, accompanied by
members of his Likud party, about 1,000 Israeli police were
deployed.
</P>
<P>
   Young Palestinians defiantly shouted ''Allahu Akbar'' (God is
great). Some tried to break through the police cordon but were
pushed back. Mohammed Abu Hawa, a 17-year-old protester carrying a
black school bag, said he and his classmates had come from nearby
schools to try to prevent Sharon from entering the shrine.
</P>
<P>
   Sharon is one of the most feared and reviled figures in the Arab
world, as the mastermind of Israel's 1982 invasion and occupation
of Lebanon. He was forced to resign in 1983 when an Israeli
commission found he bore some responsibility for the massacre of
hundreds of Palestinians in Beirut refugee camps by Lebanese
militias allied with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   After his Temple Mount visit, Sharon stopped at the Western
Wall, a remnant of the Temple and today the holiest site of
Judaism. Some Jewish worshippers cheered and clapped when they
spotted Sharon.
</P>
<P>
   The mosque compound has been the site of bloody clashes in the
past.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, rumors that Jewish extremists planned to start
rebuilding the Temple started a riot in which 17 Palestinians were
killed and scores wounded by police gunfire. In 1996, the Israeli
government opened an archaeological tunnel just outside the
compound, sparking riots in which 80 people, most of them
Palestinians, were killed.

<HEADLINE> Russia Refuses To Pressure Milosevic  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Russia will not join Western governments in their
call for Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to step down after
Sunday's disputed election, Russia's foreign minister said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Russia won't pressure anyone in Yugoslavia,'' Foreign Minister
Igor Ivanov said. ''This is an internal affair of Yugoslavia.''
</P>
<P>
   Many foreign leaders say Milosevic lost outright to challenger
Vojislav Kostunica, but Milosevic has defied calls to step down.
Yugoslavia's election commission says Kostunica got 48.96 of the
vote to 38.62 percent for Milosevic, necessitating a runoff because
neither won the required 50 percent. Kostunica, using figures from
opposition poll watchers, maintains he got 52.54 percent to
Milosevic's 32.01 percent.
</P>
<P>
   While Western countries have dismissed the talk of a runoff and
urged Milosevic to concede defeat, Moscow has warned other
governments to stay out of Yugoslav affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Russia vehemently opposed the NATO-led bombing campaign against
Yugoslavia last year, and has repeatedly welcomed Yugoslav
officials to Moscow. But it has shown signs of trying to distance
itself from Milosevic in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   A Russian election observer returning from Yugoslavia,
Konstantin Kosachov, said Thursday that the elections were ''normal
and democratic,'' the Interfax news agency reported. Kosachov is
deputy head of the lower house of parliament's international
affairs committee.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Boris Nemtsov, the leader of the liberal Union of
Right Forces faction in the lower house of Russian parliament, said
the government must pressure Milosevic to make the runoff fair.
</P>
<P>
   ''If Moscow makes no effort, the election in Yugoslavia will be
falsified,'' Nemtsov said.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Higher in Early Trading  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks opened higher Thursday in a tentative
change of direction after a week of mostly down trading.
</P>
<P>
   In the first hour of trading, the Dow Jones industrial average
was up 28.48 at 10,656.84.
</P>
<P>
   Broader indicators were also higher. The Nasdaq composite rose
3.31 to 3,659.61 and the Standard and Poor's 500 stock-index
climbed 3.84 to 1,430.41.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks have been down for most of September on market worries
about corporate profits.
</P>
<P>
   The market has swung up and down, as investors, unsure where to
put their money, have punished stocks of companies that even hint
at disappointing results when third-quarter earnings are announced
next month.
</P>
<P>
   Compounding the stress are energy prices at decade-high levels
and a weak European currency -- all factors that many companies say
will hurt their bottom lines.
</P>
<P>
   This week's slump has been across the board with particular
emphasis on two sectors: Internet companies and telecomm suppliers.
</P>
<P>
   That trend appeared to continue Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Nortel Networks, which makes telecom equipment, fell $1.03 to
$28.25 in early trading, extending a decline that began the
previous session.
</P>
<P>
   Discount travel Web site Priceline also slipped again, down 13
cents to $10.63, after losing more than 40 percent of its value
Wednesday when it warned about weak corporate earnings.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was down 0.03 at 508.10.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 0.08 percent. In
afternoon trading, Germany's DAX index was down 0.76 percent,
Britain's FT-SE 100 fell 0.83 percent, and France's CAC-40 dropped
0.50 percent.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Land Port Flooded  </HEADLINE>
By FARID HOSSAIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) -- Raging flood waters swept away roads
and submerged Bangladesh's largest land transport center, halting
trade with neighboring India, officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of trucks loaded with goods have been stranded on both
sides of the town of Benapole after it was inundated by waist-high
water on Wednesday, Abdur Rouf, the region's police chief said in a
telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   The sudden rush of water from the flooded rivers of the Indian
state of West Bengal has wreaked havoc along Bangladesh's western
and northwestern region, where floods are rare.
</P>
<P>
   Fed by late monsoon rains, the swirling flood waters swept away
mud embankments, dirt roads and culverts, swamped thousands of
villages, claimed nearly 850 lives and left at least 18 million
stranded in the two neighboring countries since Sept. 18.
</P>
<P>
   Figures available from separate government departments in West
Bengal indicated the death toll was as high as 1,000, the United
News of India news agency reported. But Deputy Chief Minister
Buddhadev Bhattacharya confirmed only 530 deaths and said 230 other
people had been swept away in the floods.
</P>
<P>
   The West Bengal government raised the number of people marooned
in the state to 17 million Thursday, up from 10 million a day
earlier, and said about 5 million of them had been rescued and
lodged in 5,000 relief camps in the nine flood-affected districts,
UNI said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a top aid official said Thursday about 20 children
are drowning daily in Vietnam after falling off dikes where tens of
thousands of families have taken refuge from floods.
</P>
<P>
   ''Imagine living on a dike four meters (13 feet) wide and maybe
sitting there from now until Christmas, along with another 120,000
families,'' said Peter Walker, head of the Asia-Pacific delegation
for the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent
Societies.
</P>
<P>
   Parts of Vietnam, Cambodia, Thailand and Laos have been
devastated by floods along the Mekong River and its tributaries,
affecting more than 6.5 million people. Vast areas of rice paddy
have been destroyed and at least 375 people have died -- 173 in
Cambodia, 140 in Vietnam, 47 in Thailand and 15 in Laos.
</P>
<P>
   Walker said it could be three months before families in Vietnam
can return to their abandoned homes, he said. Meanwhile, people are
sheltering under plastic sheeting on flat, exposed land or on
narrow earthen dikes.
</P>
<P>
   He said ''something like 20 children a day are drowning simply
because at night they walk off the dike.''

<HEADLINE> British Designers Go For Sexy Look  </HEADLINE>
By SUE LEEMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Three words sum up British fashions for the spring
and summer of 2001: sexy, sexy, sexy.
</P>
<P>
   From Jasper Conran's pleated micro-minis and knit bikinis in
tempting sorbet shades to Anthony Symonds' sharp leather suits and
ruched jersey tops, the emphasis is on looking glossy and gorgeous.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-nine catwalk shows over five days provided a riot of style
and entertainment. True, there were many not-so-welcome '80s
touches, including ruffled skirts, satin Lycra drainpipe trousers
and unflattering legwarmers. But there was much to keep the 21st
century woman happy -- and London reveled in its growing reputation
for cutting edge, wearable collections.
</P>
<P>
   The organizers of London Fashion Week, the British Fashion
Council, said the number of press and buyers attending in the first
two days alone surpassed five-day totals last season.
</P>
<P>
   Among the temptations that kept them coming were Clements
Ribeiro's array of striped knits and elegantly draped dresses in
fluid white silk jersey, showing the style that recently won
Suzanne Clements and Inacio Ribeiro the role of art directors to
the French fashion house Cacherel.
</P>
<P>
   For an audience that included actresses Joely Richardson and
Brenda Blethyn, Welsh knitwear whiz Julien Macdonald went heavy on
the crystal, disco beading and jewels, strewing them on dresses so
tiny they almost didn't qualify for the name.
</P>
<P>
   With an eye on the headlines, Macdonald also produced a dress
strewn with hand-embroidered 18-carat gold balls and two-carat
diamonds on the shoulder strap, valued at $1.4 million -- besting
the $350,000 diamond-encrusted gown shown by Maria Grachvogel
earlier in the week.
</P>
<P>
   Symonds' suits were precisely tailored with short bomber-style
jackets and knee-length skirts in suede and leather with box
pleats, or short swing jackets over beautifully cut trousers.
Flowing jersey tops and dresses with armholes slashed to the waist
featured ruching that surged dramatically from one shoulder to the
opposite hip.
</P>
<P>
   Big-print gingham shirts were teamed with floral printed cotton
skirts, all in combinations of peach, red, white, black and
turquoise. Halter tops in orange and pink nature prints
complemented boldly striped skirts in the same shades.
</P>
<P>
   Conran's palette included black, white, baby blue and pink and
many of his outfits were worn with supple leather trilby-style hats
and matching rucksacks or wraps.
</P>
<P>
   At a show packed with celebrities -- including actor Simon Callow
and Lady Sarah Chatto, niece of Queen Elizabeth II -- Conran sent
out his models in a series of micro shorts and ''bandage'' tops in
leather, cashmere or smothered in large pink sequins.
</P>
<P>
   Blue and pink diamond knit was used for swimsuits for both men
and women, and for men's tank tops, part of a male range that
included snappy double-breasted suits, clinging singlets and cotton
slouch trousers.
</P>
<P>
   Topless satin evening dresses were worn with wispy tulle
mini-jackets dotted with silver sequins.
</P>
<P>
   On the sharper end of the fashion spectrum, Polish-born Arkadius
Weremczuk presented a rural idyll dotted with hay bales, painted
birds and peasant outfits -- very Breughel, very bohemian.
</P>
<P>
   There were neckties made of pink plaited hair and breeches in
white and turquoise toweling, frock coats with bustles and ruched
trousers.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein Chalayan, ever the showman, dressed his models as
replicants from Ridley Scott's film, ''Blade Runner,'' in
futuristic outfits that featured topstitching on imaginary pockets
and seams and graph-print fabric crisscrossed with zigzag threads.
</P>
<P>
   Highly tailored jackets were reassembled to incorporate panels
from more casual denim jackets; concealed sunray pleats swung at
the hem of tapering skirts.
</P>
<P>
   At Burberry, Roberto Menichetti has reworked the famous check
into a diamond pattern in candy colors that featured on tops,
coats, trousers and layered wrap skirts.
</P>
<P>
   Candy colors were also prevalent in Matthew Williamson's striped
sundresses, figure-hugging sweaters and feminine blouses, many in
camouflage prints, teamed with prom skirts festooned with bugle
beads and stiffened with bright tulle underskirts.
</P>
<P>
   Ben de Lisi came up with pink silk skirts to the knee and floral
print chiffon shirts in bold turquoise and orange. And Elspeth
Gibson showed geometric chiffon prints in lilacs and pinks.

<HEADLINE> Fujimori Makes Surprise Trip to D.C.  </HEADLINE>
By MONTE HAYES
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- President Alberto Fujimori flew to Washington
before dawn Thursday for urgent meetings with the Organization of
American States as coup rumors unsettled the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori, who has ruled for a decade, flew out of Lima's
international airport on his presidential jet at 2 a.m., only hours
after an opposition congressman who had defected to his ranks
charged that the army high command was pressuring lawmakers to
participate in a plot to provoke a coup within 20 days.
</P>
<P>
   The congressman's warning that the army was plotting to restore
power to Fujimori's deposed spy chief, Vladimiro Montesinos, put
Peruvians on edge just when it appeared that dialogue was pushing
the country toward repairing its damaged democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Eduardo Latorre, the OAS' permanent secretary in Peru, met with
Fujimori for nearly two hours in the Government Palace shortly
after the congressman's denunciation of the coup plot.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, he downplayed the congressman's charge, saying it had
been mentioned in passing during the meeting with Fujimori. Latorre
said Fujimori planned to fly to Washington on Thursday to meet with
OAS Secretary General Cesar Gaviria ''to discuss the fortification
of the democratic process here in Peru.''
</P>
<P>
   Unconfirmed news reports said Fujimori also planned to seek
meetings with high-ranking officials in the U.S. State Department.
</P>
<P>
   The army's information office issued a statement Wednesday night
calling Congressmen Miguel Mendoza's allegations of a coup plot
''absolutely false.''
</P>
<P>
   Mendoza, who defected from the opposition to join Fujimori's
Peru 2000 party, said the army intended to permit the return of
Montesinos. He announced Wednesday that he was quitting Fujimori's
party, and said joining it had been a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am denouncing that a group of congressmen from Peru 2000
have been pressured to sign letters of resignation, prepared in the
army's high command, to form a congressional group in favor of
Vladimiro Montesinos,'' Mendoza said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the purpose ''would be to promote disorder within
Congress and throughout the country to unleash generalized chaos
and carry out a coup d'etat within 20 days, which would allow the
return of ... Montesinos.''
</P>
<P>
   A meeting between government and opposition representatives was
suspended soon after Mendoza made his allegation. The talks are
aimed at repairing Peru's damaged democracy and are being held
under the auspices of the OAS.
</P>
<P>
   Montesinos, who fled the country for Panama on Sunday amid a
corruption scandal, hand-picked the top commanders of the army, who
are believed to be loyal to him.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori announced Sept. 16 that he would call new elections in
which he would not be a candidate. He said he would relinquish
power to a new government on July 28, 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The decision was prompted by a corruption scandal surrounding
Montesinos, who was caught on videotape apparently bribing an
opposition congressman to defect to Fujimori's ranks.
</P>
<P>
   At least 10 lawmakers from Fujimori's Peru 2000 political
alliance have abandoned the party since the scandal broke. As of
Wednesday, Fujimori's legislative bloc held only 54 seats in the
120-member Congress, eliminating the control he maintained during
the last eight years of his 10-year presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Congressman Moises Wolfenson, one of the lawmakers who quit Peru
2000 on Monday, said his decision was not influenced by any outside
forces. ''There was no type of pressure, as (Mendoza) has
alleged,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Church Backs Milosevic Opponent  </HEADLINE>
By MISHA SAVIC
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Opposition leader Vojislav Kostunica
gained the critical endorsement of the Serbian Orthodox Church on
Thursday and his supporters threatened a general strike to force
Slobodan Milosevic to recognize their election victory.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic, however, confirmed Thursday that he will take part in
a runoff after finishing second to Kostunica in Sunday's
presidential election. Summoning his closest Socialist Party
associates, Milosevic focused on ''immediate tasks'' ahead of the
second round, the state-run Tanjug news agency said.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition discussions about calling a general strike -- shutting
down schools, offices and other public institutions until Milosevic
steps aside -- come amid efforts to ratchet up the pressure on
Milosevic to step aside.
</P>
<P>
   Kostunica earned 48.96 percent of the vote to 38.62 percent for
Milosevic, the State Election Commission said late Wednesday. That
would require a runoff Oct. 8. The opposition, using figures from
its poll watchers, claims Kostunica won 52.54 percent to
Milosevic's 32.01 percent -- which would mean he won outright.
</P>
<P>
   Kostunica's campaign manager, Zoran Djindjic, called the
government tally ''a bad joke.'' He vowed to take the opposition
beyond street protests -- which have been unsuccessful -- by calling
''a total blockade of the system and institutions.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We will call a general strike,'' Djindjic said. ''We shall
seek to paralyze all institutions, schools, theaters, cinemas,
offices ... call everyone onto the streets and stay on the streets
until he who wants to be president by force gives up his post.''
</P>
<P>
   The influential Serbian Orthodox Church recognized Kostunica's
election victory and addressed him as ''president-elect.'' The
church holds no direct political power in Yugoslavia, but its
dictates hold great moral sway in a population which recognizes it
as a pillar of rectitude in a corrupt society.
</P>
<P>
   Increasing the pressure on Milosevic to step down, European
Union officials said Thursday the 15 EU members will not back a
second round. In Brussels, EU officials said the organization will
hold off, for now, on lifting economic and other sanctions against
Serbia until Kostunica has been installed as president.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the days ahead you will see the EU nations treating
Kostunica as the president-elect'' of Yugoslavia, said one EU
foreign policy official.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking on condition of anonymity, the official said Sunday's
elections signaled ''the end of the regime'' of Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   But in Moscow, Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov said that
Russia will not join western governments in their call for
Milosevic to step down.
</P>
<P>
   ''Russia won't pressure anyone in Yugoslavia,'' Ivanov said.
''This is an internal affair of Yugoslavia.''
</P>
<P>
   Key officials in Kostunica's coalition conducted emergency
talks. In a statement issued afterward they pledged to ''defend the
truth and the democratic will of our people,'' but failed to
outline any specific strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Declaring that ''Vojislav Kostunica was elected Yugoslav
president in the first round of the elections,'' the opposition
leaders once again called on the members of the State Electoral
Commission to ''publicly acknowledge the true election results.''
</P>
<P>
   The developments came the morning after more than 200,000 joyful
Milosevic opponents swarmed the capital's downtown district, waving
banners and chanting ''He's finished.'' There was no visible police
presence near the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   An opposition member of the electoral commission said the head
of the body presented the 13 members with just before midnight --
shortly after the crowds had scattered for the night.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition members were not allowed them to inspect the returns,
but the commission voted to approve them, 10-3.
</P>
<P>
   Some members of the election commission reportedly resigned from
their posts, due to ''pressures they were under to falsify the

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Blue chips were higher but technology issues
lagged Thursday as ongoing worries about corporate profits
frustrated the market's efforts to rebound.
</P>
<P>
   In the first hour of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones
industrial average was up 21.82 at 10,650.18.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index was up 0.63 at 1,427.20, but the Nasdaq composite index fell
29.75 to 3,626.55.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks have been down for most of September on market worries
about corporate profits. And investors, unsure where to put their
money, have punished stocks of companies that even hint at
disappointing results when third-quarter earnings are announced
next month.
</P>
<P>
   Compounding the stress are energy prices at decade-high levels
and a weak European currency -- all factors that many companies say
will hurt their bottom lines.
</P>
<P>
   This week's slump has been across the board with particular
emphasis on two sectors: Internet companies and telecomm suppliers.
But there were signs of that trend weakening Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco Systems, which makes telecom equipment, fell $1.44 to
$55.88. Nortel Networks was down 28 cents at $59, extending a
decline that began the previous session. But Lucent moved higher,
trading up $1.19 to $29.75.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon.com slipped 38 cents to $37.50. Priceline, the discount
travel Web site, was down 6 cents at $10.69 after losing more than
40 percent of its value Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   News of a $6.5 billion merger between Global Crossing and
Exodus, two Web site hosting companies, had mixed results on the
Nasdaq. Exodus fell $5.75 to $47.50 in morning trading; Global
Crossing was up $1.44 at $31.31.
</P>
<P>
   A new videogame console helped push Sony up $1.50 to $100.88 on
the New York Stock Exchange, despite the company's warning that its
component shortages will affect initial shipments to North America.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by an 11-to-7 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 127,67 million
shares, agead if 135.87 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was up 0.79 at 508.92.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 0.08 percent. In
afternoon trading, Germany's DAX index was down 0.76 percent,
Britain's FT-SE 100 fell 0.83 percent, and France's CAC-40 dropped
0.50 percent.

<HEADLINE> 'Soap' Star Mulligan Dies at 67  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Actor Richard Mulligan, who won Emmys for his
portrayals of dads in the sitcoms ''Soap'' and ''Empty Nest,'' has
died at age 67.
</P>
<P>
   Mulligan died at his home Tuesday after a long battle with
cancer, publicist Julian Myers said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   A native of New York, Mulligan began his nearly 40-year career
in show business as an aspiring writer. He fell into acting when
was drafted into playing a role at a rehearsal while trying to sell
a play.
</P>
<P>
   From 1977 to 1981, Mulligan played lovable working-class
screwball Burt Campbell -- stepfather to Billy Crystal's character --
on the quirky television series ''Soap.'' He won an Emmy for the
role in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   On ''Empty Nest,'' a spinoff of ''The Golden Girls'' that ran
from 1988 to 1995, Mulligan played Dr. Harry Weston, a widower with
three grown daughters. The part won him another Emmy, in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's certainly different from my role on 'Soap,''' Mulligan
said in a 1988 Associated Press interview. ''This guy's a good
doctor who cares deeply about his patients. He's a good fellow
trying to take care of his daughters. His wife died 18 months ago
and he still can't take the ring off.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the other highlights of Mulligan's career was performing
on stage with James Stewart in ''Harvey'' and working with director
Blake Edwards in the 1981 film ''S.O.B.,'' which starred Julie
Andrews and William Holden.
</P>
<P>
   Mulligan was also featured in 1969's ''The Undefeated'' with
John Wayne and Rock Hudson, and portrayed Lt. Col. George Armstrong
Custer in the 1970 film ''Little Big Man.''
</P>
<P>
   Mulligan is survived by his son, James, and brothers Robert,
director of films such as ''To Kill a Mockingbird,'' and James.

<HEADLINE> Peru's Fujimori Takes Plane to D.C.  </HEADLINE>
By MONTE HAYES
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- President Alberto Fujimori flew to Washington
before dawn Thursday for urgent meetings with the Organization of
American States as coup rumors unsettled the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori, who has ruled for a decade, flew out of Lima's
international airport on his presidential jet at 2 a.m., only hours
after an opposition congressman who had defected to his ranks
charged that the army high command was pressuring lawmakers to
participate in a plot to provoke a coup within 20 days.
</P>
<P>
   ''He will be there for a couple of days and will return to Peru
on Saturday,'' Prime Minister Federico Salas said on
Radioprogramas.
</P>
<P>
   He downplayed the coup rumors, saying, ''I haven't observed any
indications that would make me think we are heading toward a coup
d'etat.''
</P>
<P>
   The congressman's warning that the army was plotting to restore
power to Fujimori's deposed spy chief, Vladimiro Montesinos, put
Peruvians on edge just when it appeared that dialogue was pushing
the country toward repairing its damaged democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Eduardo Latorre, the OAS' permanent secretary in Peru, met with
Fujimori for nearly two hours in the Government Palace shortly
after the congressman's denunciation of the coup plot.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, he downplayed the congressman's charge, saying it had
been mentioned in passing during the meeting with Fujimori. Latorre
said Fujimori planned to fly to Washington on Thursday to meet with
OAS Secretary General Cesar Gaviria ''to discuss the fortification
of the democratic process here in Peru.''
</P>
<P>
   Unconfirmed news reports said Fujimori also planned to seek
meetings with high-ranking officials in the U.S. State Department.
</P>
<P>
   The army's information office issued a statement Wednesday night
calling Congressmen Miguel Mendoza's allegations of a coup plot
''absolutely false.''
</P>
<P>
   Mendoza, who defected from the opposition to join Fujimori's
Peru 2000 party, said the army intended to permit the return of
Montesinos. He announced Wednesday that he was quitting Fujimori's
party, and said joining it had been a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am denouncing that a group of congressmen from Peru 2000
have been pressured to sign letters of resignation, prepared in the
army's high command, to form a congressional group in favor of
Vladimiro Montesinos,'' Mendoza said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the purpose ''would be to promote disorder within
Congress and throughout the country to unleash generalized chaos
and carry out a coup d'etat within 20 days, which would allow the
return of ... Montesinos.''
</P>
<P>
   A meeting between government and opposition representatives was
suspended soon after Mendoza made his allegation. The talks are
aimed at repairing Peru's damaged democracy and are being held
under the auspices of the OAS.
</P>
<P>
   Montesinos, who fled the country for Panama on Sunday amid a
corruption scandal, hand-picked the top commanders of the army, who
are believed to be loyal to him.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori announced Sept. 16 that he would call new elections in
which he would not be a candidate. He said he would relinquish
power to a new government on July 28, 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The decision was prompted by a corruption scandal surrounding
Montesinos, who was caught on videotape apparently bribing an
opposition congressman to defect to Fujimori's ranks.
</P>
<P>
   At least 10 lawmakers from Fujimori's Peru 2000 political
alliance have abandoned the party since the scandal broke. As of
Wednesday, Fujimori's legislative bloc held only 54 seats in the
120-member Congress, eliminating the control he maintained during
the last eight years of his 10-year presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Congressman Moises Wolfenson, one of the lawmakers who quit Peru
2000 on Monday, said his decision was not influenced by any outside
forces. ''There was no type of pressure, as (Mendoza) has
alleged,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Greek Ferry Captain, Crew Charged  </HEADLINE>
By LISA ORKIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   PAROS, Greece (AP) -- The captain and three crew members of a
Greek ferry boat that sank, killing at least 66 people, were
charged Thursday with multiple counts of murder.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators were focusing on reports that the ship loaded with
more than 500 passengers was apparently on automatic pilot minutes
before striking a well-marked rocky outcropping, bolstering
accounts by survivors that crew members were watching a soccer
match on television Tuesday night when the ship sank two miles from
shore.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts by navy divers and rescue crews to find at least eight
missing people were hampered by a fierce gale that has stopped all
boat traffic to and from this holiday island. Rescue teams said
there could be up to 14 missing.
</P>
<P>
   Although the ship had just passed an inspection, a prosecutor
was also investigating accusations the 34-year-old Express Samina
had propulsion and steering problems. Described as a ''rusting
hulk'' by the Greek Merchant Marine Mechanics Union, the ferry was
to be decommissioned next year.
</P>
<P>
   Greece's worst ferry sinking in 35 years has dealt a serious
blow to this nation that prides itself on a maritime tradition
dating back more than 2,000 years. In 1965, 217 people died in the
sinking of the passenger ship Iraklion.
</P>
<P>
   Survivors have also accused the crew of panicking and failing to
organize the evacuation of the ship, saying life boats were not
quickly deployed. Many attributed their rescue to the proximity of
the shore, and a small fleet of fishing boats that sped to the
sinking vessel.
</P>
<P>
   Premier Costas Simitis held an emergency Cabinet meeting to
discuss the shipwreck. Government officials said no mercy would be
shown to those found responsible for the sinking.
</P>
<P>
   ''Criminals, a blind course on autopilot'' screamed a banner
headline in the normally staid daily Eltherotypia. ''Murderers,''
ran another headline in the daily Eleftheros Typos.
</P>
<P>
   Ship's captain Vassilis Yannakis, his deputy, Anastasios
Psychoyos, and two crewmen were charged with four felonies,
regional prosecutor Dimitrios Dadinopoulos said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the charges included multiple counts of homicide with
possible malice, causing serious bodily injuries with possible
malice, violating maritime regulations, violating international
regulations on avoiding an accident, and sinking a ship.
</P>
<P>
   Officials plan to transfer the men to the island of Syros, the
administrative capital of the Cyclades island chain, to be
questioned by an investigating magistrate.
</P>
<P>
   Ship's owner Costas Klironomos also blamed his own crew, saying
''all the indications point to human error and that there are
members of the crew who have shown criminal negligence.''
</P>
<P>
   The ship left Athens' port of Piraeus on Tuesday afternoon and
headed for Paros, the first of six stops that would eventually
bring it to the tiny Lipsis islands near the Turkish coast. About
10 p.m., the 345-foot, 4,407-ton ferry rammed into the Portes
islet.
</P>
<P>
   Results of a preliminary investigation indicated the captain was
not on the bridge and that his second in command took the helm when
the ship was just 200 yards from the Portes outcroppings, which are
clearly marked on navigational chart and have a light beacon
visible for seven miles.
</P>
<P>
   According to a transcript published in Eleftherotypia, Psychyos
told investigators he saw the rocks at the last minute and ordered
the helmsman to turn the ship.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I saw the ship was headed for the two rocks I personally
grabbed the wheel and turned hard left. The bad thing happened
though. It is my fault,'' he was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
   But officials say it remains unclear why the ship rammed the
rocks if claims are true that at least one crewmember, the
helmsman, was on the bridge.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a rock with a light on it ... in a frequently traveled
area that has been passed thousands of times... my question is, why
did this happen?'' asked Coast Guard chief Andreas Sirigos.
</P>
<P>
   Coast guard investigators were examining passenger reports that
most of the crew was watching a European Champions League soccer
match when the ferry crashed.
</P>
<P>
   A survivor, Manolis Diktas told state television that ''members
of the crew, including officers, were watching the game.''
</P>
<P>
   A funeral service was held on this island for one of the dead,
port authority official Dimitris Malamas, 43. He died of a heart
attack when he heard news of the sinking. Hundreds of islanders
gathered in the main cathedral as ships in harbor blew their horns.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the dead were transferred by helicopter to a morgue in
Athens, where relatives have been identifying the remains.
</P>
<P>
   There were 72 foreigners on the boat, from Albania, Australia,
Belgium, Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Norway, South
Africa, Ukraine, and two from the United States.

   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks moved higher Thursday, buoyed by rebounds
in some technology and blue chips issues, as the market appeared to

   In late morning trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial

<HEADLINE> Government Reports on Nursing Homes  </HEADLINE>
By JANELLE CARTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two years after federal investigators found
serious care problems at many of the nation's 17,000 nursing homes,
a new government report cites progress but notes an increase in
homes with deficiencies.
</P>
<P>
   ''Vigilance by both state and federal officials must be
unrelenting to ensure the safety and well-being of the nation's
nursing home residents,'' William Scanlon of the General Accounting
Office said at a hearing Thursday before the Senate Aging
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton announced a series of initiatives to improve
nursing homes after congressional hearings two years ago found
significant problems. The GAO, Congress' investigative arm, has
been monitoring the progress of those initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   ''While we've made some improvements, it still seems in many
ways we've been stuck in the same position since day one,'' said
Sen. John Breaux, D-La.
</P>
<P>
   The committee's chairman, Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, said:
''These efforts must be sustained -- they must not be allowed to
falter -- in order for us to realize their potential for improved
nursing home care.''
</P>
<P>
   The agency's investigation found a ''marginal increase
nationwide in the proportion of homes with documented actual
harm.'' Seventeen states had an increase of 5 percent or greater of
the number of homes with deficiencies. For instance, Arizona had
the highest increase, 19.6 percent, followed by Arkansas with a
16.1 percent increase and New York with a 14.3 percent increase.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said the results could be caused by several
things, including more rigorous efforts by states to identify
problems. ''The survey results could also suggest that nursing
homes may not have made sufficient strides to measurably improve
residents' quality care,'' Scanlon said.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reason for the change, Scanlon said it is
imperative that the Health Care Financing Administration, which
sets standards for nursing homes, continue to act.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the report noted that the health agency sometimes
lagged in its efforts to track how well states conducted surprise
visits.
</P>
<P>
   HCFA deputy administrator Michael Hash agreed there were
shortcomings, citing a failure by about one-third of states to
promptly investigate serious complaints or conduct surveys of
facilities at least every 15 months, as required by law.
</P>
<P>
   But Hash said surveyors were doing a better job identifying
substandard care and noted that over 90 percent of facilities with
severe deficiencies have been referred for immediate sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are working to address these shortcomings and build on our
success,'' Hash said.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Roadman, president of the American Health Care
Association, said the vast majority of nursing homes provide
quality care. He said the government's inspection system is flawed.
</P>
<P>
   ''Poor care cannot be tolerated and instances of poor care are
certainly not representative of this nation's caregivers,'' Roadman
said.

Changes in 'In God We Trust' sign are not enough, ACLU says
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOPEKA, Kan. (AP) -- The sign has gotten bigger and the word
''God'' has shrunk, but Shawnee County Treasurer Rita Cline still
faces a lawsuit over a sign at her office proclaiming, ''In God We
Trust.''
</P>
<P>
   The American Civil Liberties Union last month filed a petition
in U.S. District Court in Topeka, asking the court to force Cline
to take down the sign.
</P>
<P>
   In the petition, the ACLU accused Cline of inappropriately using
her office to push her religion on many occasions.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Kurtenbach, executive director of ACLU's Kansas and western
Missouri chapter, located in Kansas City, Mo., said the changes
Cline made to the sign don't change the ACLU's position.
</P>
<P>
   ''The lawsuit is proceeding, and it's important to note the sign
is only part of the issue,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The ACLU had said the message went beyond the national motto
because the word ''God'' was printed in red letters bigger than the
letters of the rest of the phrase.
</P>
<P>
   Cline said she offered ACLU members the opportunity to redesign
the sign, but they never responded, so a staff member in her office
did.
</P>
<P>
   The original sign was 11 by 14 inches, purchased from the
American Family Association and displayed in a wooden frame just
inside the entrance to the treasurer's office. The new sign is 16
by 20 inches, includes the bald eagle image from the $1 bill and
uses uniform lettering similar to that on U.S. currency.
Congressman accuses group of intolerance
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- An Ohio congressman has accused the Family
Research Council of intolerance because its online newsletter
described a Hindu priest's prayer before Congress as ''one more
indication that our nation is drifting from its Judeo-Christian
roots.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 14, Venkatachalapathi Salmudrala from Shiva Vishnu
Hindu Temple in Parma, Ohio, became the first Hindu priest to
deliver the opening daily prayer in the House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   An item in the Sept. 21 Family Research newsletter ''Culture
Facts'' discussed that prayer, noting that the nation's founding
principle of religious liberty ''was never intended to exalt other
religions to the level that Christianity holds in our country's
heritage.''
</P>
<P>
   ''This is bigotry, plain and simple,'' said Rep. Sherrod Brown,
D-Ohio, who had asked House leaders to invite the Hindu priest to
serve as guest chaplain.
</P>
<P>
   ''Religious intolerance has no place in this country,'' Brown
said. ''It is unfortunate the FRC interprets the Constitution to
say that religious freedom means religious supremacy.''
</P>
<P>
   The council eventually pulled the article from its Web site and
issued a statement clarifying its position.
</P>
<P>
   ''We affirm the truth of Christianity, but it is not our
position that America's Constitution forbids representatives of
religions other than Christianity from praying before Congress,''
said Chuck Donovan, the organization's executive vice president.
Jewish community restores synagogue in eastern Ukraine
</P>
<P>
   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) -- A Jewish community in the eastern Ukrainian
city of Dnipropetrovsk has reopened its synagogue after the temple
stood closed for 71 years under the Soviet regime, community
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Some 5,000 people gathered last week at a reopening ceremony at
the synagogue, which was restored with the help of donations from
city residents, international Jewish organizations and private
donors.
</P>
<P>
   Several choruses and prominent musicians from Ukraine and Russia
performed.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was amazed by the fact that many different people --
businessmen and pensioners, schoolchildren and workers -- took part
in the synagogue's reconstruction,'' said city's rabbi, Shmuel
Kaminetskyi.
</P>
<P>
   The 400-seat synagogue was built in 1800 and 33 years later
rebuilt after a fire. It was closed in 1929 by order of the atheist
Communist government.
Hundreds pray near vision of Virgin Mary
</P>
<P>
   PERTH AMBOY, N.J. (AP) -- For days, hundreds of people have been
gathering outside Romona Collado's two-story apartment to pray to
the Virgin Mary.
</P>
<P>
   The people say they see the image in an upstairs window of
Collado's home.
</P>
<P>
   The image appears to be God's face, the Virgin Mary and an
angel, said Felix Prats, Collado's son-in-law. ''You look from
right outside to the window and you see it.''
</P>
<P>
   Several people filed into Collado's home to reach out and touch
the window, which appears to show changing colors when the light
hits it. Spectators set up candles on a downstairs ledge and many
people came with rosary beads.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know if it's the virgin or not, but it helps the
faith. It gives inspiration,'' the Rev. Michael Scott of St. Mary's
Roman Catholic Church told The Home News Tribune.
</P>
<P>
   Rayanne Damianno, a spokeswoman for the Archdiocese of Metuchen,
said the diocese had no comment on the apparition.
</P>
<P>
   Romona Collado said the image is a message from the Virgin Mary,
mother of Jesus Christ, to repent and pray.
</P>
<P>
   Prats said that Collado's son, Ramon, had become paralyzed
falling from the window more than a year ago. Ramon Collado had a
conversation with the Virgin Mary three weeks ago, he said.
</P>
<P>
   She told him ''we got to be prepared 'cause she's coming and her
son is coming,'' Prats said.
Polygamists in British Columbia are part of U.S. probe
</P>
<P>
   VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) -- A polygamous community in
southern British Columbia is part of a U.S. probe into the arranged
marriages of underage American girls.
</P>
<P>
   In Utah last week, Ron Barton was hired by the state attorney
general's office to investigate tax evasion, welfare fraud, child
sexual abuse, domestic abuse and other crimes in ''closed
societies,'' such as tax protest groups, white supremacist
organizations and polygamist sects.
</P>
<P>
   One of the largest of the polygamist sects is the Fundamentalist
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, located primarily in
Hildale, Utah, and neighboring Colorado City, Ariz. It has an
estimated 8,000 to 12,000 members.
</P>
<P>
   The sect has an enclave at Lister, British Columbia, with 800 to
1,000 members.
</P>
<P>
   Ex-members of the sect and a child advocacy group have asked
Utah authorities to investigate the movement of young girls between
Arizona, Utah and British Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   They say the arranged marriages are increasing because the
church's leader has predicted that the end of the world is near.
</P>
<P>
   The Lister enclave is headed by businessman Winston Blackmore,
44, who has 30 wives and 80 children, The Vancouver Province
newspaper reported.

<HEADLINE> Religion Today  </HEADLINE>
By MARK LAVIE
<TEXT>
<P>
   BET UZIEL, Israel (AP) -- For a while, farmer Eli Sella was
caught in a vise. Whether he kept the Bible's commandments or
defied them, he faced financial ruin.
</P>
<P>
   Every seventh year, according to the Leviticus, the fields must
be fallow. For many years, Israel's rabbis allowed Jewish farmers
to get around the law by arranging fictitious sales of their farms
to non-Jews.
</P>
<P>
   But this year, the country's most influential rabbi dug in his
heels. This coming year, beginning at sunset Friday, was the
sabbatical year. And this year, the farming sabbatical -- called
''Shmitta'' in Hebrew -- must be kept to the letter, he said.
</P>
<P>
   This was Sella's dilemma: Skipping a growing season would mean
defaulting on loans and losing his farm and home. But defying a
rabbinical ban would render his artichokes non-kosher, inedible to
the half of the Israeli population that keeps the dietary laws.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the 51-year-old farmer was spared the decision. A
compromise was reached that allowed the old system to remain in
place.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the controversy reverberates, reflecting continuing
conflicts between traditional Jewish Israelis versus secular
Israelis, and Orthodox Jews against ultra-Orthodox.
</P>
<P>
   ''Six years you may sow your field and six years you may prune
your vineyard and gather in the yield,'' Leviticus says. ''But in
the seventh year the land shall have a sabbath of complete rest, a
sabbath of the Lord: you shall not sow your field or prune your
vineyard.''
</P>
<P>
   Simple enough. But this year, rabbinic wisdom on the issue was
all over the map.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Shalom Elyashiv was unbending. The generation's premier
adjudicator of Jewish religious practice, Elyashiv ruled that there
would be no planting, no harvest for an entire year, and no
fictitious sales of land to non-Jews.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Eliahu Bakshi-Doron was humiliated. Bakshi-Doron, the
chief rabbi of Israel, had supported the symbolic sales, only to be
overruled by the nonagenarian Elyashiv, who holds no office but
outranks him in the unwritten consensus world of rabbinic
authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Doniel Hartman was furious. The modern Orthodox Zionist
educator criticized Elyashiv's ruling as too strict, but was even
more critical of fellow Zionist rabbis who did not come to
Bakshi-Doron's defense.
</P>
<P>
   Hartman pointed out that another verse in Leviticus asks the
question, ''What are we to eat in the seventh year?'' The biblical
response: ''I will ordain my blessing for you in the sixth year, so
that it shall yield a crop sufficient for three years.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, a miracle, Hartman said. Since there are no
miracles these days, he said, the strict Shmitta laws need not be
kept.
</P>
<P>
   Jumping into the fray, Yosef Lapid, leader of the secular
political party Shinui, or Change, encouraged farmers to set up
rabbi-free markets. ''We'll buy their produce,'' he pledged.
</P>
<P>
   Lapid said in a modern nation, secular citizens should not have
to pay more for their food to get a rabbinical certificate of
approval they don't want.
</P>
<P>
   There have always been degrees of strictness in observing Jewish
laws, and the Shmitta is no exception. Most Jews accept the
century-old practice of circumventing the Shmitta. But stricter
ultra-Orthodox Jews do not eat fruit or vegetables grown in the
Holy Land during this year, paying more for food grown in Gaza,
Jordan or the Golan Heights, outside biblical boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   At its heart, the dispute is over dueling interpretations of
another commandment from Leviticus: ''You shall keep my laws and my
rules, by the pursuit of which man shall live: I am the Lord.''
</P>
<P>
   The ultra-Orthodox who devote their lives to studying religious
tomes, do not recognize the state of Israel and refrain from
contact with the secular world, take this it to mean that the
biblical laws must be followed literally.
</P>
<P>
   Modern interpreters of the phrase emphasize the word ''live,''
and guard against rulings that would make it impossible for people
to live by the commandments.
</P>
<P>
   ''My brand of Zionism combines religion with life,'' Hartman
said. ''The ultra-Orthodox have no connection with daily life.''
Instead, he said, they took an opportunity to undermine the chief
rabbinate, associated with religious Zionism.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Eliahu Klugman, a follower of Elyashiv, disagrees. He said
Elyashiv outlawed the fictitious sale of land on the basis of
today's reality. ''The conditions that applied 120 years ago no
longer apply today,'' said Klugman.
</P>
<P>
   When the sham sales were first allowed, agriculture was the
mainstay of the economy, food could not be imported, poverty was
widespread and untilled land was in danger of being taken over by
non-Jews. The solution then was to bend the rules.
</P>
<P>
   ''Israel can live without this now,'' said Klugman.
</P>
<P>
   There are some who see other solutions.
</P>
<P>
   At his institute for the study of the commandments of the Holy
Land, near the entrance to Sella's farming village, Rabbi Shneour
Revach has developed ways to grow fruit and vegetables without
breaking the Shmitta laws and without selling the land.
</P>
<P>
   Revach persuaded some farmers to prune their grapevines before
the start of the Shmitta. Usually farmers wait until the winter.
Deftly handling a pruned vine, he said his experiments showed that
there is almost no financial risk from early pruning.
</P>
<P>
   Revach wants the laws to be followed, ''but not by coercion.
That makes religion hateful.''
</P>
<P>
   Sella, a mild, muscular veteran of three previous Shmitta years
in Beit Uziel, a modest village of small family farms in central
Israel, can only agree. The ultra-Orthodox attempt to force
compliance with a stricter code left him angry.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're driving people away,'' said Sella, ''and I don't mean
just people who have no feeling for religion at all. I mean people
like me who are traditional and respect religion.''

<HEADLINE> Report: Combat Readiness Declining  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The debate over whether U.S. troops are combat
ready has produced a paradox about today's military: While called
the best in the world, it also is described as overworked,
underpaid and short of ammunition, pilots and research dollars.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush, the Republican presidential nominee, accuses the
Clinton administration of running the military into the ground by
sending it on too many overseas missions while skimping on defense
dollars. Morale among the troops is sinking and combat readiness is
on the decline, he proclaims.
</P>
<P>
   In its defense, the Clinton administration points out that last
year the troops received the biggest pay raise in a generation,
that defense investment is on the rise and that the highest
re-enlistment rates are among those units operating abroad on such
missions as peacekeeping in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, the chiefs of the military services are quick to
boast that the U.S. military is the best in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ''In my 37 years in uniform, I have never been around better
soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines,'' Army Gen. Henry H.
Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told the Senate
Armed Services Committee on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Shelton quoted a former Army chief of staff, retired Gen. John
Wickham Jr., as saying recently, ''The truth is that America has
the strongest, best-equipped, best-trained and best-led military
capability in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I think General Wickham has it right,'' Shelton said.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, each of the military chiefs also told the Senate and
House Armed Services committees they are worried that war-fighting
capability will erode unless spending goes up dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   ''We must find the resources necessary to modernize the force,''
said Shelton. Otherwise the cumulative strains of carrying out
peacekeeping and other overseas missions -- while also preparing for
major wars -- will erode combat readiness, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Shelton did not say how much more should be spent, beyond the
current budget of nearly $300 billion. He said specific figures
could be established after a planned review of national security
strategy next year.
</P>
<P>
   If the military is performing so remarkably well, what's all the
fuss about trouble in the ranks?
</P>
<P>
   Shelton, the highest-ranking military adviser to the president
and the secretary of defense, said that for several years the
Pentagon has used money that was meant to buy new weapons and
equipment to pay for training and other day-to-day costs. That has
kept troops ready for combat, but at the cost of replacing aging
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our equipment is wearing out at a much faster rate than
expected,'' Shelton said. ''Consequently, our troops are paying the
price'' by spending more time fixing mechanical problems instead of
training for war.
</P>
<P>
   And Gen. Eric Shinseki, the Army's chief of staff, said troop
reductions during the 1990s went too far.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need more people,'' he said. ''Our soldiers believe that
the Army is too small for the missions it is asked to perform.'' He
did not say how many soldiers the Army needs beyond the 480,000 it
now has on active duty.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Thursday where he announced that the Army
had met its 2000 recruiting goal, Army Secretary Louis Caldera said
the branch has not calculated exactly how many more soldiers it
needs, but he suggested the number is between 15,000 and 40,000.
</P>
<P>
   Shinseki and the other military chiefs were speaking to mostly
sympathetic audiences on Capitol Hill. Still, there were some
voices of caution.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Mary Landrieu, D-La., said the $300 billion in military
spending is more than five times larger than the military budget of
Russia, the second largest spender. It is more than 22 times as
large as the combined spending of the seven countries traditionally
identified by the Pentagon as our most likely adversaries: Cuba,
Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Sudan and Syria. And it is more
than the combined spending of the next 12 biggest-spending nations,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need to spend the money we have better'' before trying to
make the case for spending more, said Landrieu.

<HEADLINE> Dow Gains 109; Nasdaq Adds 68  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks shot higher Thursday, buoyed by rebounds
in technology and blue chip issues, as the market appeared to find
its footing despite ongoing worries about corporate profits.
</P>
<P>
   The advance came despite a new report showing the U.S. economy
growing at the fastest rate since the fourth quarter of 1999, and
well ahead of expectations.
</P>
<P>
   In midday trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was up 109.13 at 10,737.49. The Dow had fallen in each of
the first three sessions this week.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 index was up 23.77 at 1,450.34, and the Nasdaq composite index
rose 68.49 to 3,724.79.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Nie, a technical analyst at First Union Securities, didn't
see any one driving force behind the market's behavior. He said of
the Dow, ''you simply have 23 issues up and only seven down, and
that's better news.''
</P>
<P>
   Stocks have been down for most of September on worries about
corporate profits. And investors have punished stocks of companies
that even hint at disappointing results when third-quarter results
are announced next month.
</P>
<P>
   Compounding the stress are energy prices at decade-high levels
and a weak European currency -- factors that many companies say will
hurt their bottom lines.
</P>
<P>
   A Commerce Department report released Thursday raised new
questions about whether the Federal Reserve's efforts to slow
growth to a more sustainable level have worked.
</P>
<P>
   But the report, which showed the economy expanding at a rate of
5.6 percent between April and June, a faster rate than the 4.8
percent growth in the first three months of 2000, didn't seem to
cause much concern on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   Investors again concentrated on corporate earnings, although
their reactions weren't consistent.
</P>
<P>
   Procter &AMP; Gamble jumped $4.31 to $66.19 after the consumer
products manufacturer said it would meet Wall Street expectations
for the third quarter after several disappointing quarters. But
investors unloaded Safeway, trading it down $3.63 to $50.50,
although the grocery store chain reported profits in line with
analysts' estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Internet and telecom stocks appeared to be recovering Thursday
from their slump.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco Systems, which makes telecom equipment, fell 13 cents to
$57.19 after it was downgraded by a Sanford Bernstein analyst. But
competitor Nortel Networks rose $3.28 to $62.56, halting a decline
that began the previous session. Lucent also moved higher, trading
up $2.88 at $31.44.
</P>
<P>
   Investors pushed Hewlett Packard up $2.94 to $105.75.
</P>
<P>
   And Web portal Yahoo! was up $6.13 at $96.50, gaining back half
of its loss Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   News of a $6.5 billion merger between Global Crossing and
Exodus, two Web site hosting companies, had mixed results. Exodus
fell $2 to $51.25, after slumping more than $5 in morning trading.
Global Crossing was up $2.38 at $32.25.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 13-to-7 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 514.64 million
shares, behind the 523.26 million in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was up 7.33 at 515.46.

<HEADLINE> House Makes Deals as Budget Looms  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN FRAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House, with just three days before the
Oct. 1 start of fiscal 2001, pushed through a spending bill
providing about $23.6 billion for energy and water projects.
</P>
<P>
   As the House passed the bill on a 301-118 vote, lawmakers were
conferring with administration officials on other spending
legislation, trying to nail down deals on easing trade sanctions
against Cuba and creating a new land conservation program sought by
the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   So far, only two of the 13 annual spending measures for next
year have become law. The energy bill faces a veto threat because
it would block the administration from moving toward allowing a
seasonal surge in the Missouri River to protect endangered birds
and fish.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats from the Northeast also protested the decision to
remove a provision in the House-passed version of the bill that
would have set up a 2-million-barrel home-heating-oil reserve to
deal with winter hardships in that region.
</P>
<P>
   That same provision would have reauthorized the president's
power to withdraw oil from the 600-million-barrel Strategic
Petroleum Reserve. President Clinton has announced plans to tap 30
million barrels from that reserve to check rising oil prices, a
move Republicans have criticized as aimed at winning political
points before the election.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Joe Moakley, D-Mass., said Republicans killed the reserve
proposal when people in his area are ''facing the worst winter
heating crisis in two decades.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Ron Packard, R-Calif., chairman of the House
Appropriations energy and water subcommittee, said the proposal was
removed from the final bill because matters dealing with fossil
fuels were the jurisdiction of a different panel handling Interior
Department spending.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of the Missouri River pits environmental concerns
against opposition by farm and shipping interests -- as well as
members of both parties from Missouri, a swing state in the
presidential race. Among the opponents of changing the river's flow
are Gov. Mel Carnahan, the Democratic Senate candidate, and House
Democratic leader Dick Gephardt.
</P>
<P>
   ''That would be a serious error,'' Sen. Kit Bond, R-Mo., who
wants to leave the river's controlled flows unaltered, said of a
Clinton veto.
</P>
<P>
   White House budget chief Jack Lew told reporters that ''we were
as clear as we could be'' about vetoing the overall bill if the
Missouri River language remained.
</P>
<P>
   Sweetening the energy and water bill were dozens of new projects
that lawmakers squeezed in, including $24 million for flood control
and cleanup projects in Kentucky won by Rep. Harold Rogers, R-Ky.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, with the certainty that most spending bills won't be
approved by midnight Saturday, the Senate prepared to approve a
measure keeping federal agencies open through Oct. 6. That is
expected to be the first of several stopgap measures to avoid a
federal shutdown while budget talks continue.
</P>
<P>
   The energy and water measure -- $1.9 billion larger than the
version the House approved in June -- is one of many spending bills
whose price tags are swelling because of demands from the Clinton
administration and lawmakers from both parties.
</P>
<P>
   Another, the $18 billion Interior Department bill, is $3 billion
bigger than the version the House approved.
</P>
<P>
   To it, White House and congressional bargainers were hoping to
add a compromise multibillion-dollar land conservation program.
Still unclear were the exact cost and the specific programs it
could be used for, but the emerging measure was sure to be smaller
than a 15-year, $45 billion version the House overwhelmingly
approved in May.
</P>
<P>
   The administration also objected to some environmental
provisions in the Interior bill. Republicans were ready to drop
language, opposed by Clinton, easing environmental protections for
New Hampshire's White Mountains and Colorado's White River, aides
said.
</P>
<P>
   On a separate agriculture measure, GOP leaders agreed among
themselves to partly lift food and drug trade sanctions against
Cuba by letting U.S. financial institutions help arrange
third-country financing of such sales, said Rep. Roy Blunt, R-Mo.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear how widespread support for the plan was. But
partially easing the 37-year-old sanctions would end a lengthy
battle between congressional foes of Cuban leader Fidel Castro, a
coalition of farm-state lawmakers who want more trade, and liberals
and conservatives who say such trade is the best way to loosen
Communism's grip on the Caribbean nation.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers also were moving toward easing restrictions on
importing U.S.-made drugs from overseas, where they often sell for
less. They also were ready to include $3.5 billion to help farmers
hurt by fires, drought and other problems, said House
Appropriations Committee Chairman Bill Young, R-Fla.
</P>
<P>
   The agriculture bill was expected to exceed $75 billion.

<HEADLINE> N.Y. Times Critiques Lee Coverage  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- For the second time this week, The New York
Times has critiqued its own writings about the Wen Ho Lee nuclear
secrets case -- this time on its editorial page.
</P>
<P>
   In an editorial that took up two full columns on the editorial
page Thursday, the newspaper said it had reviewed the editorials it
had published over the past 17 months about the fired Los Alamos
scientist and security at the New Mexico lab.
</P>
<P>
   ''Many of the main arguments have held up well,'' the editorial
said, ''although with the benefit of hindsight we find that we too
quickly accepted the government's theory that espionage was the
main reason for Chinese nuclear advances and its view that Dr. Lee
had been properly singled out as the prime suspect.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee, 60, was released last month from nine months of solitary
confinement after pleading guilty to one count of mishandling
nuclear secrets and agreeing to tell what he did with the
information he admits downloading onto tapes and unsecure
computers.
</P>
<P>
   He originally had been charged with 59 counts of breaching
national security.
</P>
<P>
   FBI Director Louis Freeh and Attorney General Janet Reno have
defended the government's case, most recently before the Senate
Select Intelligence and Judiciary committees.
</P>
<P>
   Freeh told the senators Tuesday the prosecution would likely
have succeeded at trial, but he said a trial would have exposed
nuclear secrets and might not have revealed what happened to the
downloaded information.
</P>
<P>
   Reno and Freeh also have denied accusations that Lee, a
Taiwanese-born naturalized U.S. citizen, was targeted because of
his race.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1,680-word editors note on Tuesday, the Times acknowledged
there were flaws in its coverage. Although the note defended the
work of its reporters and said that ''on the whole, we remain proud
of work that bought into the open a major national security
problem,'' it criticized decisions by ''those who directed the
coverage, for not raising questions that occurred to us only
later.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in a memo to the newspaper's staff that followed
publication of the editors note, Times Managing Editor Bill Keller
stressed that the phrase ''those who directed the coverage'' was
referring to himself and Executive Editor Joseph Lelyveld -- not to
the editors who directly supervised the stories.
</P>
<P>
   ''Joe and I have tried to make clear in meetings with staff what
seemed obvious to us,'' Keller wrote, ''that the paragraph referred
to ourselves -- not just in the general, the-buck-stops-here, way,
but in the very specific sense that we laid our hands on these
articles, and we overlooked some opportunities in our own direction
of the coverage.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's piece faulted the editorial page's past conclusions
that China's critical expertise on miniaturization of warheads was
''most likely'' stolen from lab computers.
</P>
<P>
   It also said the editorials ''may have been overly sharp'' in
questioning the fitness of national security adviser Samuel R.
Berger and in criticizing Reno for refusing to approve a wiretap on
Lee.
</P>
<P>
   The editorial said that although the paper had warned about the
dangers of racial profiling in Lee's case, ''we should have looked
more searchingly at the conditions under which he was confined and
the government's arguments for denial of bail.''
</P>
<P>
   The editorial said the importance of the nuclear weapons issue
to national security warrants aggressive reporting and commentary.
</P>
<P>
   It noted that Lee had been investigated for more than three
years before the newspaper published its first articles, and that
nuclear weapons security and transfer of technology to China had
been constant government concerns during this time.
</P>
<P>
   ''To withhold this information from readers is an unthinkable
violation of the fundamental contract between a newspaper and its
audience. The only choice is to bring that information forward in
news and opinion columns in a professionally careful, self-critical
way,'' it said.

<HEADLINE> 'Big Brother' Set To Move Out  </HEADLINE>
By FRAZIER MOORE
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- After getting booted from the ''Big Brother''
house, George Boswell felt good about his stint on the CBS reality
show.
</P>
<P>
   During 77 days under voluntary house arrest, George had done
what he set out to do: take a temporary leave from his
ordinariness. As he explained last Sunday on a visit to Manhattan,
he didn't enter that camera-and-microphone-filled house in a bid
for renown. He just wanted a breather from his anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm just an average, everyday guy that did something wild,''
said George, a roly-poly roofer and long-wed father of three.
</P>
<P>
   Wild indeed. While in the house, he hatched an alter ego as
''Chicken Man,'' the resident clown who sported Day-Glo-tinted hair
and wacky get-ups. Briefly turning rebel, he plotted to wreck the
show by mobilizing a group walkout. Then he pulled a switcheroo and
merrily decided to stay.
</P>
<P>
   A week after that, a phone-in poll banished him to the outside
world. For his exit from the house, he sheathed himself in a
bedsheet toga.
</P>
<P>
   George turns 42 on Friday, which, by chance, also marks the
''Big Brother'' finale, when one of the remaining trio -- Eddie,
Josh or Curtis -- will be named as the viewers' choice to win the
$500,000 grand prize.
</P>
<P>
   George will be in Los Angeles with the other nine original
cohabitants for the live broadcast at 8 p.m. EDT. Then he heads
back to Rockford, Ill., where, reunited with family and friends, he
has every expectation of vanishing for good, like the platinum
sheen that will vanish from his hair.
</P>
<P>
   Or so he said. But in formulating his plans, George divulged
blind faith in how the public might perceive him from his TV
persona.
</P>
<P>
   ''What you see on television is me,'' he insisted. ''That's who
I am.'' But he has never had a chance to actually watch ''Big
Brother.'' He has no idea what viewers have been seeing.
</P>
<P>
   By almost any measure, what they've been seeing is a mess. A
series designed to spy on people who agreed to be spied upon, then
hedged their bets by playing to the cameras, ''Big Brother'' has
managed to be both contrived and humdrum; both cynical and dismally
naive.
</P>
<P>
   The houseguests began at a huge disadvantage. They were
quarantined in drab surroundings and given few challenging
diversions. But then, all too quickly, they proved to be dullards
in their own right (including George, good for little more than his
comic bursts).
</P>
<P>
   Left to their own devices, they were seen mostly cooking,
eating, drinking, lounging, or working on their tans in the
fenced-in yard.
</P>
<P>
   And talking, of course. In the absence of activity, ''Big
Brother'' has been chockablock with talk. Pointless talk. Tacky
talk. The sort of talk you overhear in a bar or on a bus, then
wonder if the people know how stupid they sound.
</P>
<P>
   As they hung around the house, the ''Big Brother'' residents
seemed forever to be biding their time, too conscious of TV to ever
get down to the business the audience was looking for: fighting and
sex.
</P>
<P>
   Private lives, public boredom. Squalid, but not squalid enough.
A show of consummate mediocrity, ''Big Brother'' has diminished
everyone attached to it. Its producers. Its network. Julie Chen,
its hapless host. Even the chumps at home who, week after week,
wasted money to phone their ''votes'' in for the bogus popularity
poll.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly the houseguests aren't covered with glory.
</P>
<P>
   One day last week, Jordan, the former stripper who was ousted
early on, was brought back to address those still in the house.
</P>
<P>
   ''You have no idea how over-the-top, out-of-control HUGE this
show is,'' she chirped. ''We're all major celebrities and we're set
for life!''
</P>
<P>
   For a wonderful moment, the inmates believed her, particularly
Jamie, the plumpish beauty-pageant queen who dreams of Hollywood
stardom. As she listened, her face lit up like a movie marquee.
</P>
<P>
   Then everybody, even Jamie, realized that Jordan was yanking
their chains. Major celebrities? As if! Do they think they're on
''Survivor''?
</P>
<P>
   Even so, George doesn't mind that his fame, such as it is, may
be fleeting. To hear him talk, he doesn't even want that stardom
stuff.
</P>
<P>
   ''At this point,'' he declared, ''I look to settle back into a
normal-type life. I'm prepared for that.'' Maybe he will. Maybe he
is.
</P>
<P>
   But in the meantime, a larger question lingers with the ''Big
Brother'' stench: When, if ever before, has a TV network squandered
so much face time on 10 people of so little consequence?
</P>
<P>
   What a big, big bother ''Big Brother'' has been.

   '20/20': A month after five high-school girls died in a car
accident, the county medical examiner determined that four of them
had been inhaling a potentially toxic cleanser, an inhalant
commonly abused by teen-agers. The report outraged the community. A
year later, the medical examiner's contract was not renewed. The
head of the local county government says there were plenty of
reasons to be unhappy with the doctor. But others wonder whether
this was simply a case of killing the messenger who brought bad
news. Chris Cuomo reports on ABC News' ''20/20 Friday'' at 10 p.m.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Court Gives Model Millions  </HEADLINE>
By C. BRYSON HULL
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON (AP) -- Anna Nicole Smith headed back to a Texas probate
court Thursday, one day after a California bankruptcy judge awarded
her nearly $450 million in her battle for her late husband's oil
riches.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Samuel Bufford ruled Wednesday that Smith,
the model and sometime actress, had been deprived of the
inheritance due her when billionaire Texas oilman J. Howard
Marshall died in 1995 at age 90. The judge also ruled that Smith is
entitled to an unspecified amount of punitive damages. The other
side promised an appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm very happy with what came out,'' Smith said as she walked
into a Houston courthouse where a jury is being selected in her
probate fight over her late husband's estate.
</P>
<P>
   The California ruling came on a bankruptcy filing by Smith, who
claimed that fraudulent handling of her husband's estate had left
her penniless. The court fight here involves Smith and the oilman's
elder son, J. Howard Marshall III, who are contesting his will. It
left everything to his other son, E. Pierce Marshall.
</P>
<P>
   The precise effect of Wednesday's ruling on the Texas case
wasn't immediately clear, but Smith's attorney, Philip Boesch Jr.,
predicted that it paves the way for victory in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ''Does that change things? Oh, I think it does,'' Boesch said.
''It's pretty powerful language and it's telling of the damages
done to her.'' Terry Giles, the lawyer for J. Howard Marshall III,
also expressed satisfaction, saying ''we expect our verdict to make
the one in Los Angeles look small.''
</P>
<P>
   But E. Pierce Marshall said he would appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ''This extraordinary decision is a miscarriage of justice that
is not supported by the facts and will not stand up on appeal,'' he
said in a statement Wednesday night. ''We are confident that a
Texas jury that is permitted to evaluate all of the evidence in the
case will allow my father's clearly stated wishes to be carried
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Citing the Los Angeles ruling and its possible effect on jurors,
E. Pierce Marshall unsuccessfully requested a mistrial Thursday
morning in Harris County Probate Court. Opening statements were
tentatively set for Monday in a trial expected to last into
December.
</P>
<P>
   In the bankruptcy case, Smith testified last year that E. Pierce
Marshall defrauded her of between $556 million and $820 million she
was entitled to as her share of her husband's estate. In his
ruling, Bufford concluded that E. Pierce had made a key change to
the elder Marshall's will after it was signed, and said he had a
''scorched-earth'' policy toward his stepmother.
</P>
<P>
   Smith was working as a stripper at a topless bar in Houston when
she met Marshall in 1991. When they married in 1994, when she was
26 and he was 89, she had become Playboy's playmate of the year and
a nationally known model for Guess? jeans.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband died the following year, leaving behind an estimated
$2 billion fortune from holdings in Koch Industries, an oil company
that is the nation's second-largest privately held corporation.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who uses her married name of Vickie Lynn Marshall in
court documents, claims her husband intended she would receive half
of his estate. She argued there was an illegal revision to his will
made three weeks after their marriage.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no doubt in this case that (Smith) had an expectancy
to receive a substantial portion of (Marshall's) wealth after his
death,'' the judge ruled.

<HEADLINE> Suharto Ruling Prompts Protests  </HEADLINE>
By GEOFF SPENCER
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- Hours after a court dismissed
corruption charges against former President Suharto, thousands of
students battled Indonesian police Thursday in a swirl of tear gas,
rocks and gasoline bombs.
</P>
<P>
   At least one person was killed and dozens injured in battles on
Jakarta's rain-swept streets after five judges ruled Suharto's
health was too frail for him to face trial on charges of stealing
at least $583 million from the state.
</P>
<P>
   Mobs, indignant Suharto never set foot in court, set fire to
cars, buses and an office belonging to the former leader's old
political party, Golkar.
</P>
<P>
   Police, carrying Plexiglas shields and wielding bamboo staves,
charged several hundred students who pelted them with stones and at
least one gasoline bomb, TV footage showed.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, an officer shot a tear gas launcher into the face
of a man crouching on the side of a road and covering his head with
his hands. The round burst in yellowish white flash.
</P>
<P>
   The blast pitched the young man over his side, and 10 other
officers began kicking and beating the prostrate protester. One
officer tried to smash the man with another grenade launcher, which
discharged covering the group in a cloud of gas. Bleeding and
semiconscious, the man was hospitalized.
</P>
<P>
   Scores of riot police guarded the 79-year-old Suharto's central
Jakarta home while about 800 protesters and 200 Suharto supporters
threw rocks and bottles at one another. As motorcycles burned,
demonstrators threw rocks and gasoline bombs at officers.
</P>
<P>
   Bloody protests by students pushed Suharto from power in 1998,
but with his trial abandoned, students fear he will never face a
court for abuses during his more than three decades in power.
</P>
<P>
   ''Suharto ruined this country. Now he is going to get away with
it. If we don't stop him, who will? This is not democracy,''
protester Siong Dede said.
</P>
<P>
   The court accepted the findings of a 23-doctor medical team that
brain damage from three strokes reduced Suharto's intelligence to
that of a third grader.
</P>
<P>
   The court also ignored demands by prosecutors that Suharto be
tried in absentia -- an alternative favored by the government.
</P>
<P>
   The court freed Suharto from house arrest and lifted other
travel restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   Suharto's corruption trial had been regarded as central to
efforts by the year-old government to clean up endemic graft and
make amends for past human rights abuses.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Marzuki Darusman said prosecutors would appeal
the court's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no real will to give justice to the people,''
Darusman said.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's decision came as President Abdurrahman Wahid,
Indonesia's first democratically elected head of state in 44 years,
was on an official visit to South America.
</P>
<P>
   Disappointment with the failed attempt to try Suharto could
further erode Wahid's strength, already weakened by scandals and
infighting as well as outbreaks of religious and ethnic violence
across the sprawling nation of 17,000 islands.
</P>
<P>
   The proceedings against Suharto cast a shadow over Jakarta,
which has been rocked by a series of deadly blasts, including a
Sept. 13 explosion at its stock exchange that killed 15 people.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation is rife that the explosions were the work of Suharto
supporters and elements of the security forces opposed to Wahid's
democratic reforms. At least 30 people have been arrested.

<HEADLINE> Indian Air Force on Alert at Glacier  </HEADLINE>
By AJIT KUMAR
<TEXT>
<P>
   LEH, India (AP) -- Despite five layers of clothing, paratroopers
shiver as they wait to board an air force transport at the world's
highest air base.
</P>
<P>
   The AN-32A planes approach the stark runway at Leh in snowy
mist, pushed by tail winds. The pilots navigate the steep mountains
by sight.
</P>
<P>
   Higher on the icy Himalayan peaks, helicopter pilots battle
downdrafts as they land on helipads to deliver precious supplies or
rescue injured soldiers. The pilots stay on the ground no more than
30 seconds for fear of being shot.
</P>
<P>
   This is life on the 20,000-foot-high Siachen Glacier, the
world's highest battleground. Hundreds of Pakistani and Indian
soldiers face off, and often fire at each other, on the chunks of
ice.
</P>
<P>
   But cold kills more troops than bullets. Soldiers brought down
to base camp often suffer hearing, eyesight and memory loss because
of prolonged use of oxygen masks. Many lose eyes, hands or feet to
frostbite.
</P>
<P>
   Since India drove back Pakistan-based fighters in the Kargil
sector of Kashmir last year, the Indian military has been focusing
on Siachen to ward off another intrusion in the Himalayas.
</P>
<P>
   The Indian military was caught off guard in May 1999 when it
discovered that combatants had crossed a cease-fire line running
along the tops of mountains in Kashmir to occupy positions that
brought an Indian national highway within reach of Pakistani guns.
</P>
<P>
   India says it fought Pakistani soldiers for the next 11 weeks,
while Pakistan's government said the fighters were indigenous
Kashmiris opposed to Indian control of the mostly Muslim region.
</P>
<P>
   The Kargil fighting showed India that the most uninhabitable,
frozen land was not a sufficient barrier to intrusion. The Indian
air force, trying to show that it is on the alert in a region even
harder to defend than the sheer Kargil cliffs, has arranged a
series of trips for photojournalists to see the Siachen operation.
</P>
<P>
   ''Particularly since the Kargil war, the load of responsibility
of the air force has increased,'' Air Vice Marshal S.K. Jain told
journalists during a tour Tuesday. ''The forces are on alert, ready
to meet any threat.''
</P>
<P>
   The sound of incoming gunfire could be heard as the air force
transports loaded up at Leh, on the approach to the Siachen
Glacier.
</P>
<P>
   The last major gunbattle in the region was reported Sept. 4,
1999, when India said Pakistani artillery and mortar fire killed
nine Indian soldiers on the craggy slopes of Turtuk, near the
47-mile-long Siachen Glacier.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan and India have disputed the border at Siachen since the
first cease-fire line was drawn after their 1947-48 war. It was
only in 1984 that the Indian army sent a battalion to occupy the
glacier.
</P>
<P>
   Some army posts on the peaks are only 1,000 feet from Pakistani
entrenchments. Cheetah helicopters fly in to retrieve wounded or
sick soldiers and drop supplies to their comrades, who remain
behind on the lonely promontories.

<HEADLINE> 'Big Brother' Finds Fans Online  </HEADLINE>
By ANICK JESDANUN
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Call ''Big Brother'' boring if you wish, but
many fans on the Internet will miss the ''reality'' game show when
its three-month run ends Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Johnny Fisher, for one, will have to find another pastime. The
retired railroad worker watches the TV show each night, spends
another 10 to 20 hours a day following the contestants online, and
has posted more than 1,200 messages since July to fellow fans.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Internet site definitely enhances the enjoyment of the
program,'' said Fisher, 53, of Enid, Okla., who is known online as
Travln' John. ''I'm not entirely sure I'd be involved with the
program by itself on television.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure, ''Big Brother'' has been a ratings disappointment for CBS.
But the audience could have been even smaller without the Internet
there to engage fans.
</P>
<P>
   This has been the most ambitious television-Internet tie-in to
date in the United States. The show's official site,
bigbrother2000.com, offers live feeds of the contestants 24 hours a
day, whether they are sleeping, eating or shaving. CBS shows less
than four hours of footage each week, most of it taped.
</P>
<P>
   Ten strangers agreed to live in the ''Big Brother'' house for
three months with no privacy or outside contact. Seven have been
kicked out. One of the remaining contestants -- Curtis, Eddie or
Josh -- will win $500,000 on Friday, and the runners-up will get
$100,000 and $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   The show's online traffic has been respectable, but not
spectacular.
</P>
<P>
   Though it was the top new site in July, with more than 4.2
million visitors, traffic dropped by half to 2.3 million in August,
according to Internet measurement company Media Metrix. Visitors
averaged only 12 minutes at the site in August, and not every
visitor came to watch the video feed.
</P>
<P>
   Unofficial sites also saw diminished traffic. Paul Sims had up
to 400,000 daily visitors to SurvivorSucks.com, a fan site for CBS'
other ''reality'' show this summer, the hit ''Survivor.'' He
estimates that fewer than 100,000 are coming each day to
BigBrotherBlows.com.
</P>
<P>
   But the fans who do visit these sites regularly tend to be
devoted.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a show that is perfectly tuned to the Internet,'' said
David Card, an analyst with Internet research firm Jupiter
Communications. ''If you're really interested in watching those
boring guests, you can watch them all day long.''
</P>
<P>
   Stella Calvert, 51, a writer in San Francisco, said she may need
to buy an ant farm soon to replace the human fishbowl that is ''Big
Brother.'' She heard about the show online and has been hooked ever
since.
</P>
<P>
   In Richmond, Va., Web designer Tony Wittrien, 25, said he may
get his fix watching an Italian version of the show, ''even though
I can't understand what they are saying.''
</P>
<P>
   For Tanya Salazar, 17, of San Antonio, the show's conclusion
will be a good opportunity to start looking for a job. She has
spent several hours each day running a Web site devoted to ousted
contestant Brittany.
</P>
<P>
   ''You really feel like you know these people,'' she said. ''On
television, they can edit it to show the most interesting parts.
Online, you kind of see when they are being themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   America Online, which runs the official Web site, hosts more
than 14,000 unofficial fan pages. Elsewhere, there are sites for or
against Eddie, George and other contestants, and one where fans
take turns monitoring the online feeds and posting summaries for
each other.
</P>
<P>
   Even those who find the show boring like to complain on the
sites' message boards.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a strong contingent on the Internet that loves to hate
Big Brother and apparently watches the show just to put down the
houseguests,'' said Susan Cole, 45, a free-lance editor and teacher
in Palo Alto, Calif. -- and a fan.
</P>
<P>
   Many fans leave ''Big Brother'' running in the background while
they do other work, the way they would use a radio. AOL's online
adviser, Regina Lewis, said traffic increases at lunchtime and
after the evening broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
   AOL and other sites plan to follow the contestants periodically
once they leave the house.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Kersey, 29, a Web content provider in Atlanta, found
that the Internet discussions revealed motives ''that I wouldn't
have picked up if I just relied on CBS.''
</P>
<P>
   ''If you become a regular viewer, you start understanding their
sleeping habits, and when they get up,'' he said. ''At nighttime,
especially when they've had a few beers in them, that's the best
time to watch.''

<HEADLINE> Railroad Retirement Bill May Pass  </HEADLINE>
By CURT ANDERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A campaign-season bill to raise benefits for
thousands of retired rail workers and cut taxes for railroads
appears headed for passage in Congress despite concerns it could
drain $15 billion from the budget surplus and permit risky
investment in private securities.
</P>
<P>
   The bill arose from two years of negotiations between railroads
and unions representing 250,000 workers and 650,000 retirees,
widows and dependents -- from every state and most congressional
districts -- to overhaul a federal retirement system older than
Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   It was approved Thursday on a voice vote by the Senate Finance
Committee, clearing it for Senate action in the coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, it would permit investment of some railroad
retirement funds in private securities in hopes of increasing the
rate of return to finance an increase in benefits for workers and a
$400 million annual reduction in payroll taxes paid by the
railroads.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is a win for railroads. It is a win for railroad labor. It
is a win for retirees,'' said Rep. Jim Oberstar, D-Minn., before
the House passed the bill earlier this month on a 391-25 vote.
</P>
<P>
   The retirement age for rail workers would fall to 60 from 62 and
surviving spouses of rail workers would see a sizable increase in
their benefits.
</P>
<P>
   But according to the Congressional Budget Office, the railroad
pension bill could consume $15 billion of the surplus in fiscal
2001, which begins Sunday. This would occur because a large pension
reserve fund now invested in government securities would be
transferred to a new trust overseen by a seven-member board, which
would invest it in private markets.
</P>
<P>
   That would jeopardize the plan by Republican congressional
leaders to set aside 90 percent of next year's surplus to pay down
public debt and use the remaining 10 percent for tax relief or
additional spending.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think that makes it possible for us to complete the
other things we want to do,'' said. Sen. Don Nickles, R-Okla.
</P>
<P>
   Nickles is hoping to simply delay by one year the effective date
of the legislation, which would sidestep the budget surplus dilemma
for now. The bill's sponsors also say the hit on the surplus is a
one-time cost associated with the redeeming of Treasury bonds,
which would eventually result in less public debt and lower
interest costs.
</P>
<P>
   But other proposed changes would be left in place, including
creation of a new, non-governmental board to invest a portion of
the pension money in private financial markets.
</P>
<P>
   The General Accounting Office, which acts as Congress'
investigative arm, noted in a report on the bill that these
investments offer ''the prospect of higher returns but greater
risk'' and that there is no limit placed on federal taxpayer
liability if things don't work out.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, GAO estimated that increasing the benefits and
reducing payroll taxes would worsen the current system's unfunded
liability of $40 billion over 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   The system, the GAO concluded, ''could face a more pronounced
shortfall if the new investment plan does not deliver the expected
results.'' That could require a tax increase, which would be borne
by the railroads, sponsors said.
</P>
<P>
   Some lawmakers, and the White House, are concerned that this
system sets a poor example for Social Security, where there are
several proposals to permit investment of payroll taxes in private
markets.
</P>
<P>
   A White House statement said the legislation ''could encourage
excessive risk without sufficient safeguards or oversight, in a
fashion that would set an unfortunate precedent.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, has proposed a series of amendments
requiring that any railroad fund tax cuts or benefit increases be
contingent on successful returns on the private investments and
giving beneficiaries individual rights over their portion of money
they've paid in.
</P>
<P>
   There has also been some grumbling among lawmakers about other
odd features of the rail retirement system, including a quirk in
the law in which income taxes paid by retirees on their benefits
are immediately transferred back to the retirement fund -- a
transfer amounting to $265 million in this fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   ''This bill maintains a special subsidy available to no other
industry,'' said Rep. Nick Smith, R-Mich.
</P>
<P>
   Still, given the lopsided House vote in favor of the bill and
the fact that 78 of the 100 senators are listed as co-sponsors, the
measure appears likely to win final approval before Congress
adjourns for the year.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. E. Clay Shaw, R-Fla., said one driving force behind the
legislation was ''seeing the industry and the unions coming
together to ask for these changes. This bill is a good thing for
the United States taxpayers.''
</P>
<P>
   --------
</P>
<P>
   The bill is H.R. 4844.

<HEADLINE> Oscars Getting Cartoon Category  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) -- Cartoon movies are getting an
Academy Award of their own, the first new Oscar category in two
decades.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, animated features compete against live-action movies
in the best-picture category. Only one feature-length cartoon has
ever been nominated for best picture, ''Beauty and the Beast'' in
1992, and did not win.
</P>
<P>
   The Academy of Motion Picture Arts &AMP; Sciences board of governors
voted to create a separate category for animated features, which
will be added on a case-by-case basis and only when there are eight
or more eligible films.
</P>
<P>
   Animated feature Oscars could be handed out as early as March
2002, the academy said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Animators have been lobbying for a separate Oscar category for
years.
</P>
<P>
   Films submitted in the animated feature category may also
qualify for nominations in other areas, including best picture.
</P>
<P>
   The last time the academy introduced a new category was in 1981
when the makeup and Gordon E. Sawyer awards were added. The Sawyer
award is an honorary Oscar given for a career of technological
contributions.

<HEADLINE> Russia Plans to Cut 350,000 Troops  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID McHUGH
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- A top Russian general on Thursday reaffirmed plans
make deep cuts in Russia's military, saying the country no longer
has the money for such a large force.
</P>
<P>
   The reductions, to be made over 2001-2003, would cut 350,000
troops from the estimated 1.2 million people serving under the
Defense Ministry.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Vladislav Putilin, who heads the general staff's main
organizational and mobilization department, said: ''We are in a
situation in which external military perils have diminished and the
state is unable to fully finance the armed forces.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Therefore the reduction of armed forces personnel is
inevitable, and the armed forces command regards this as an
objective need,'' Putilin was quoted as saying by the Interfax news
agency.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, President Vladimir Putin said that there would be
no ''hasty or wholesale'' cuts in the number of soldiers and that
more time was needed to plan military reform.
</P>
<P>
   But Putin didn't reject cuts and insisted the country's military
was too unwieldy and had to be modernized.
</P>
<P>
   The cuts were first announced by Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev
earlier this month, but few details have been made public.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Defense Ministry troops, Russia has hundreds of
thousands of more troops spread across several agencies, including
intelligence services, the Interior Ministry, the Border Guards,
and even the railroad forces.
</P>
<P>
   Russian news media have reported, without naming sources, that
there are plans for broader cuts of 600,000 across the entire
military establishment of more than 2 million troops and about 1
million civilian workers.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's leaders have been vowing to reform the military for
years, but haven't followed through. Plans to end the draft and to
move to a professional army fell by the wayside.
</P>
<P>
   Planes can't fly and ships are mothballed for lack of fuel and
maintenance, new weapons are not bought and new soldiers are not
thoroughly trained -- or even regularly fed.
</P>
<P>
   The military suffered a stinging humiliation in Chechnya, where
several thousand lightly armed independence fighters drove out
Russian troops in 1996. Russian forces retook most of the region in
an operation that began last year, but have suffered high
casualties and haven't ended rebel resistance.
</P>
<P>
   Putin acknowledged there had been ''objections'' from commanders
to plans to cut the number of soldiers. Some Russian military and
political officials are clearly nostalgic for the Soviet Union's
superpower status and its large forces that confronted NATO during
the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts say Russia's lagging economy doesn't generate
enough money to support a large army. Russia's defense budget is
about $5.1 billion, compared with annual U.S. defense spending of
around $290 billion.

<HEADLINE> Sanctions May End If Milosevic Goes  </HEADLINE>
By SONYA ROSS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton called Thursday for lifting
economic sanctions against Yugoslavia once a democratically elected
government is installed in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Before having lunch with Prime Minister Wim Kok of the
Netherlands, Clinton said all NATO nations should consider removing
the sanctions if Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic is removed
from power.
</P>
<P>
   While he did not refer to Milosevic by name, Clinton said ''it's
clear the people prefer'' Milosevic's pro-democracy opponent,
Vojislav Kostunica.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we should all say, in unequivocal terms, as soon as
there is democratic government there, the sanctions should be
lifted,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic on Thursday refused to recognize Kostunica's apparent
victory in Sunday's elections, saying he would move ahead with
plans for an Oct. 8 runoff. The State Election Commission said
Kostunica earned 48.96 percent of the vote to 38.62 percent for
Milosevic, but opposition poll watchers said Kostunica won 52.54
percent of the vote, compared to 32.01 percent for Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he is more inclined to believe the opposition's
results, since the election commission ''met in secret and has not
documented its results.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Even they certified 49 to 38'' percent, Clinton said. ''I
thought the case the opposition made based on their actual numbers,
poll place to poll place, was pretty persuasive.''
</P>
<P>
   Kok agreed with Clinton's assessment of the vote, and said he
also believes the sanctions should be removed.
</P>
<P>
   ''That double message should be very clear,'' Kok said. ''The
people said, 'We want to get rid of Milosevic.' And we say as soon
as there will be a new leadership, the sanctions will be over.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Holbrooke, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations,
said the United States would move to lift the sanctions and restore
Yugoslavia's rights as a U.N. member state if Kostunica is allowed
to take office.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has declined to join Western governments in calling on
Milosevic to step down.

<HEADLINE> Army Denies Delay in No Gun Ri Probe  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Pentagon officials denied on Thursday that the
Army is delaying until after Election Day the release of its
investigation into the reported killing of South Korean civilians
by American soldiers in the early weeks of the Korean War.
</P>
<P>
   ''The No Gun Ri inquiry is not in any way or shape being driven
by considerations regarding the election,'' Army Secretary Louis
Caldera said in response to a reporter's question at a Pentagon
news conference on another matter.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's been driven by the need to do a very thorough inquiry
where there were millions of pages of documents that had to be
reviewed and individuals that had to be interviewed,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Caldera said ''much of the report'' on the investigation's
findings is being written now, although ''some pieces'' are not yet
completed. He said the goal is to complete the work before the end
of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he thought it would be done before the Nov. 7
election, he said he doubted it.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Bacon, chief spokesman for Defense Secretary William
Cohen, said, ''The report will be released when it's ready to be
released, but it's not done at this stage. ... It's not connected
to the election, it's connected to when we complete the report.''
</P>
<P>
   One year ago Friday, The Associated Press reported that U.S.
Army veterans, corroborating the accounts of Korean villagers, said
their unit killed a large number of civilian refugees at the South
Korean hamlet of No Gun Ri in July 1950. The villagers say about
400 were killed, including 100 in a preceding attack by U.S.
warplanes.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 30, Cohen ordered Caldera to initiate an investigation
into the matter, and he asked that it be done as quickly as
possible. The Army had hoped to finish the inquiry in June, in time
for the 50th anniversary of the start of the Korean War, but it
later estimated it would take until the autumn.
</P>
<P>
   The South Korean government is doing its own investigation.
</P>
<P>
   During meetings last week in Seoul on the U.S.-South Korean
defense relationship, the two sides pledged not to allow the No Gun
Ri investigation to undermine the close ties that developed over
the past five decades. They agreed the investigation should be
''thorough, complete, transparent and should be concluded as
quickly as possible.''

<HEADLINE> Dow Jumps 200 Points  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks shot higher Thursday, buoyed by rebounds
in technology and blue chip issues, as the market appeared to find
its footing despite worries about corporate profits.
</P>
<P>
   The rally, the first consistent advance this week, came on the
same day as a report showing the U.S. economy growing at the
fastest rate since the fourth quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   In afternoon trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was up 210.87 at 10,839.23, its highest level this week.
The Dow had fallen in each of the first three sessions this week.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 index was up 27.01 at 1,453.58, and the Nasdaq composite index
rose 82.13 to 3,738.43.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Nie, a technical analyst at First Union Securities, didn't
see any one driving force behind the market's behavior. He said of
the Dow, ''you simply have 23 issues up and only seven down, and
that's better news.''
</P>
<P>
   Stocks have been down for most of September on worries about
corporate profits. And investors have punished stocks of companies
that even hint at disappointing results when third-quarter results
are announced next month.
</P>
<P>
   Compounding the stress are energy prices at decade-high levels
and a weak European currency -- factors that many companies say will
hurt their profits.
</P>
<P>
   A Commerce Department report released Thursday raised new
questions about whether the Federal Reserve's efforts to slow
growth to a more sustainable level have worked.
</P>
<P>
   But the report, which showed the economy expanding at a rate of
5.6 percent between April and June, a faster rate than the 4.8
percent growth in the first three months of 2000, didn't seem to
cause much concern on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the market rallied on a mix of bargain-hunting and
end-of-the-month trading.
</P>
<P>
   Investors again focused on corporate earnings, although their
reactions weren't consistent.
</P>
<P>
   Procter &AMP; Gamble jumped $5.06 to $66.94 after the consumer
products manufacturer said it would meet Wall Street expectations
for the third quarter after several disappointing quarters.
</P>
<P>
   But profit-taking investors unloaded Safeway, trading it down
$3.50 to $50.63, although the grocery store chain reported profits
in line with analysts' estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Investor enthusiasm also appeared to be behind a mild recovery
by Internet and telecom stocks, which have been in a slump.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco Systems, which makes telecom equipment, was up 31 cents to
$52.63, despite a downgrade by a Sanford Bernstein analyst.
Competitor Nortel Networks rose $3.21 to $62.50, halting a decline
that began the previous session. Lucent also moved higher, trading
up $3.19 at $31.75.
</P>
<P>
   Investors pushed Hewlett Packard up $3.13 to $105.94.
</P>
<P>
   And Web portal Yahoo! was up $5.75 at $96.13, gaining back more
than half of its loss Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''You're getting some good boost of stocks that have been
bludgeoned as of late,'' said Charles White, portfolio manager at
Avatar Associates. ''You may have a little bit of bargain hunting
going on ... and a little bit of relief that we've gone one day
maybe without a company announcing a complete disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   News of a $6.5 billion merger between Global Crossing and
Exodus, two Web site hosting companies, got a mixed reactions.
Exodus fell $3.38 to $49.88. Global Crossing was up $2.25 at
$32.13.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 15-to-8 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 787.38 million
shares, ahead of the 771.93 million in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was up 9.82 at 517.95.

<HEADLINE> African Leader Accused of Lie  </HEADLINE>
Junta leader accused of circulating forged marriage certificate
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The State Department accused the Ivory Coast
military government of circulating a falsified U.S. marriage
certificate of a prominent politician in an effort to bar him from
challenging Gen. Robert Guei in a presidential election next month.
</P>
<P>
   The department said in a statement Thursday it was ''greatly
concerned but not surprised'' the falsified document was used as a
pretext to disqualify Guei's main rival, Alassane Ouattara, a
former prime minister and executive of the International Monetary
Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Guei says Ouattara is ineligible because his family was
originally from neighboring Burkina Faso. The government claimed
Ouattara listed his father's residence as Upper Volta, which is now
Burkina Faso, in filling out a marriage certificate as a student in
Philadelphia in 1966.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department said the people of Ivory Coast should be
able to choose a president freely, but that it was not surprised
that Guei, who came to power in a military coup, was trying to
manipulate the election with a false marriage certificate.
</P>
<P>
   Guei took power last December. He has accused Ouattara of
plotting to assassinate him.

   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- U.N. Secretary-general Kofi Annan, author
Salman Rushdie and actress Susan Sarandon paid tribute to a
Brazilian photographer who they said had captured the true face of
suffering.
</P>
<P>
   They said Sebastiao Salgado, whose exhibit opened Wednesday at
the United Nations, shows the plight of refugee children forced to
flee war, ethnic cleansing and extreme poverty.
</P>
<P>
   Annan said Salgado's portraits of children from Rwanda, India,
Turkey, Iraq, Vietnam and Angola were a reminder that ''as billions
of our fellow human beings are suffering, we cannot afford to look
the other way.''
</P>
<P>
   Sarandon, a representative for the United Nations Children's
Fund, said the pictures vividly portrayed the poverty and horror
that hundreds of thousands of youngsters faced every day.
</P>
<P>
   Rushdie called Salgado ''the greatest reportage photographer in
the world and a kind of genius.''

<HEADLINE> 18 Million Marooned by Floods  </HEADLINE>
By RAMOLA TALWAR BADAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   AISTHALA, India (AP) -- Steering clear of bloated corpses and
poisonous snakes, flood survivors wade through chest-high water in
eastern India, searching for lost relatives and valuables.
</P>
<P>
   Jackals and vultures move in and there is no place for
cremations or burials in the aftermath of 10 days of torrential
rain that have killed about 1,000 people and marooned millions.
</P>
<P>
   ''We saw many bodies floating. Some people tied stones to the
corpses to sink the bodies because there was no place to bury
them,'' said Basanti Das, 35, who weaves saris by hand in Aisthala
village, 45 miles north of Calcutta. ''There is so much water all
around, where is the place to cremate anyone?''
</P>
<P>
   Ten days after unseasonable monsoon rains forced rivers to
overflow across eastern India and western Bangladesh, people --
joined by their goats and dogs -- are still living on the roofs of
their mud and brick houses to guard against thieves who row up in
boats to loot abandoned homes.
</P>
<P>
   In India, 651 people are known to have died in the floods, and
225 are missing and presumed dead. In Bangladesh, 57 have died. A
total of 18 million in both countries are believed to be marooned.
Millions more have seen their meager homes washed away.
</P>
<P>
   The floods began Sept. 18 when late rains mixed with the melting
snows of the Himalayas, forcing water to overflow the banks of the
Ganges, Hoogly, Bhagirathi and other major rivers. While they wait
for the rain to stop and the water to run off into the Bay of
Bengal, millions are living on small patches of mud or rooftops
that have become islands in a swirling brown sea.
</P>
<P>
   In the village of Nishchintapur, 160 miles north of Calcutta,
vultures hover and then swoop down. Packs of jackals can be seen
feasting on carcasses of animals as the waters begin to recede.
</P>
<P>
   Das, the sari weaver, says she and her husband and three sons
swam from their sinking home, leaving everything behind.
</P>
<P>
   ''What I wear now is given in charity at the relief camps,'' she
said. ''We had to leave our house once snakes started coming in.
There were big snakes on the roof and in the cooking room. They
came looking for shelter the night of the floods.''
</P>
<P>
   Relief workers from World Vision and the Missionaries of
Charity, the religious order of women founded by Mother Teresa,
confirmed that at least 50 of the 200 deaths in the area were due
to snake bites.
</P>
<P>
   Parts of Calcutta, with an official population of 13 million,
have been inundated as well, as the Hoogly River overflowed into
canals running through the city, knocking aside sandbags and
seeping into homes and shops.
</P>
<P>
   Floods are rare in western Bangladesh, but this year, the
tree-lined frontier between the two countries has become a sea of
water overflowing from the Indian rivers. Railroad lines and roads
have been submerged and the main truck hub for transporting goods
between India and Bangladesh was under water.
</P>
<P>
   In Ranaghat, the only relatively dry town in Nadia district
north of Calcutta, those who spend the nights on rooftops wade at
daybreak to the relief camps set up on muddy fields to get food and
water.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've been staying on the roof of our neighbor's home for
eight days. I can't see my house anymore, but I'm waiting for the
water to ebb to see if anything can be recovered,'' said Noni
Gopal, a shopkeeper.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of people crowd around relief workers distributing
rice and brown sugar wrapped in banana leaves and newspapers. The
survivors form huge circles, squatting on the dirt and scooping out
the food with their hands.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are so many people. Who knows if the food will be
enough?'' worries Gita Deb, a farm laborer.
</P>
<P>
   Tube wells have been dug and medicine dispensaries set up near
relief camps in schools and abandoned factories in Ranaghat.
</P>

   ''Human waste is seeping from the submerged homes into the
surrounding water and with so many people swimming back and forth,
there is always the fear of disease,'' said Shakuntala Dias, a nun
in the white and blue robes of the Missionaries of Charity.
</P>
<P>
   More than 100 people pack into each classroom of the schools
turned into relief camps. Clothes hand to dry near the windows. The
corridors are lined with charred wood as women cook rice in
blackened pots.
</P>
<P>
   Others crouch in plastic tents propped up by bamboo sticks
outside the crowded camps.
</P>
<P>
   Some 3,000 people in one camp share 20 makeshift toilets put
together with bamboo and sack cloth.
</P>
<P>
   People move between their sunken homes and the camps by rowing
wooden boats or paddling inflated tyres. Children watched from
rooftops as two young boys perched on a huge iron cooking pot
steered home, ferrying food in cloth bags.
</P>
<P>
   In villages like Aisthala, men swept the rooftops clean of
fallen leaves even as the brown flood water lapped at the lower
levels of their houses. They do not want to leave. All they want is
for the water to ebb so that they can re-enter their homes, find
what is left and rebuild what is broken.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was very scared when the water came rushing in that night,''
said Das' 8-year-old son, Rupa. ''But now I want to go back.''

<HEADLINE> State Senate chairman argues against Chapman release  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - The chairman of the state Senate corrections
committee Thursday urged that parole be denied next week to the
killer of former Beatle John Lennon.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Michael Nozzolio said the slaying of Lennon in 1980
by Mark David Chapman is ''one of the most senseless acts of
violence in New York state history.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The approval of parole for Mr. Chapman would send a chilling
and irreversible message to crime victims that their rights and
safety are unimportant,'' Nozzolio said in a letter to the chairman
of the state Division of Parole, Brion Travis.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Nozzolio said Thursday it is the first time he
has ever lobbied for or against the parole of an inmate.
</P>
<P>
   ''As a fan of John Lennon's music, as a member of the generation
that grew up listening to his great music, I believe that now I am
in a position where I can speak for crime victims,'' he said. ''I
would feel less of myself if I didn't articulate at this time in
our history the anguish that this murder created to an entire
generation.''
</P>
<P>
   Nozzolio, a Republican from Seneca County, is chairman of the
Senate's Crime Victims, Crime and Correction Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Chapman, 45, is serving a 20-year-to-life sentence in Attica
state prison for Lennon's slaying. His first parole hearing will be
held Tuesday or Wednesday. If he is denied parole, Chapman will
probably be ordered held for two more years before he gets another
hearing.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with Court TV to be telecast early next week,
Chapman said he believes Lennon would want him released.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think he would be liberal, I think he would care,'' Chapman
said.
</P>
<P>
   Elliot Mintz, a spokesman for Lennon's widow, Yoko Ono, said it
is impossible to tell what Lennon would have said about Chapman's
parole.
</P>
<P>
   ''John would have loved to have been here to speak for
himself,'' Mintz said.
</P>
<P>
   Ono has written a letter to the Parole Board about Chapman's
impending hearing, but Mintz refused to reveal its contents.

<HEADLINE> Clash Erupts at Jerusalem Shrine  </HEADLINE>
By KARIN LAUB
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Barely visible behind a wall of riot troops,
the leader of Israel's hard-line opposition toured a Jerusalem holy
site hotly contested in Mideast peace talks and sparked clashes
that left police officers and Palestinian protesters injured.
</P>
<P>
   Ariel Sharon, the burly leader of the Likud party, said he
successfully demonstrated that Israel is in charge of the walled
compound revered by Muslims and Jews alike. The Palestinians said
the tour backfired because it underscored Israel's lack of control
over what is known to Jews as the Temple Mount and to Muslims as
Haram as-Sharif, or Noble Sanctuary.
</P>
<P>
   The moment Sharon and six other Likud legislators left the site
-- to shouts of ''Murderer, go home'' -- hundreds of infuriated
Palestinians broke into the compound and hurled rocks, bottles,
chairs and trash cans at helmeted officers who beat back the crowd
with clubs and fired rubber-coated steel pellets.
</P>
<P>
   More than two dozen Israeli officers were injured by stones.
Three Palestinians were struck by rubber bullets, among them a
teen-age boy with his school bag on his back, who slumped to the
ground, pressing his hands to his bloodied mouth. Four protesters
were hit in the head by clubs, including two senior Palestinian
officials.
</P>
<P>
   The clashes -- and West Bank protests later Thursday -- served as
a bleak reminder of what could be in store if peace talks fail, and
exerted new pressure on the negotiators.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a message to the Palestinian delegation not to make
concessions on Jerusalem,'' said university student Palestine
Kamel, 23, as she and dozens of fellow protesters hurled stones at
Israeli soldiers near the West Bank town of Ramallah. Five
Palestinians were injured by rubber bullets fired by Israeli
troops.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli and Palestinian negotiators are in Washington this week,
holding separate talks with U.S. mediators who have been trying to
resolve the key sticking point -- rival claims to the Jerusalem
compound, once the site of the biblical Jewish Temple, the holiest
shrine of Judaism, and now home to two major mosques that mark the
spot where tradition says the Prophet Muhammed ascended to heaven.
</P>
<P>
   Sharon denied he tried to provoke the Palestinians with his
visit to the compound -- the site of bloody clashes in 1990 and
1996.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Temple Mount is in our hands and must stay in our hands as
the holiest place for the Jewish nation,'' the opposition leader
said before donning a skullcap during a visit to the nearby Western
Wall, a remnant of the Jewish Temple.
</P>
<P>
   He was cheered by Jewish worshippers and greeted by the sound of
rams' horns, a part of Jewish ritual. Sharon is not an observant
Jew, though he has forged close ties with ultra-Orthodox religious
parties who back his hawkish agenda.
</P>
<P>
   The former defense minister said Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak made a ''major mistake'' when, during peace talks, he offered
to hand parts of Jerusalem to Palestinian control.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians said Sharon's visit only proved that Israel is
not the real sovereign over the holy site.
</P>
<P>
   ''He (Sharon) thought that this place belongs to the Israelis,
but the way he entered, with thousands of police protecting him,
was clear proof to all the world that the Israelis have no
sovereignty here,'' said Faisal Husseini, a senior Palestinian
official in charge of Jerusalem who was hit in the head during a
scuffle with police.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat said that in light of Sharon's
visit, Arab and Islamic nations should mobilize to protect the
shrine. The visit drew condemnation from the Arab world, including
the 22-member Arab League.
</P>
<P>
   Other Palestinians said Sharon's tour was an attempt to score
points with right-wing voters ahead of an expected battle with
former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for leadership of the
Likud.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu returned to Israel from the United States on Thursday,
a day after the attorney general decided to close a fraud
investigation against him for lack of evidence. Netanyahu has not
said whether he will return to politics.
</P>
<P>
   Barak had no immediate comment on Thursday's events, but
politicians close to him said Sharon's actions were provocative and
did not serve Israel's interests.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's clashes came only hours after assailants believed to
be Islamic militants set off two bombs near an Israeli army convoy
in the Gaza Strip, killing an Israeli soldier and wounding an
officer. No group has claimed responsibility, but Barak demanded
Arafat do more to rein in Islamic militants.

<HEADLINE> Brandenburg Gate Gets a Facelift  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- Decades of grime will soon be stripped from the
Brandenburg Gate, the first cleanup for Berlin's best-known emblem
since before World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Restoration experts will use lasers to get rid of black deposits
and seal cracks on the 211-year-old sandstone arch, which survived
two world wars but has straddled a major traffic axis since the
Berlin Wall dividing east and west came down in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Corporate sponsors will finance the facelift's cost of up to
$5.5 million, the historic monuments foundation in charge of the
project said Thursday. The restoration is due to start next month
and is expected to take at least a year.
</P>
<P>
   The gate, 213 feet wide and 66 feet high, was part of the Berlin
Wall during Germany's Cold War division into capitalist west and
communist east. It became the symbol of reunited Germany after the
wall fell -- and especially after parliament moved back into the
nearby Reichstag building last year as part of the government's
return to Berlin from Bonn, the former West German capital.

<HEADLINE> Lazio backtracks on upstate economy  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) - Rep. Rick Lazio backtracked Thursday on his
earlier suggestions that the struggling western New York economy
had turned the corner.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech to the Rotary Club here, Lazio noted that over the
last 18 months, the region had seen a net job gain of about 11,000
jobs. But he pointedly added, ''I know that the recovery here
hasn't reached every single family.''
</P>
<P>
   When someone in the audience suggested that he might be a
different kind of carpetbagger who would forget western New York
once the election against Democratic opponent Hillary Rodham
Clinton was over, Lazio said: ''I don't think of Long Island as my
home. I think of New York as my home.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio, the Republican Senate candidate, had been criticized by
Clinton's campaign, the Buffalo News editorial page and even some
Republicans for painting a rosy picture of the upstate economy
during the debate in Buffalo two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio also criticized the National Abortion Rights Action League
of New York, which said Thursday that it intends to violate the
soft-money ban reached by Lazio and Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think it's in the spirit of the agreement. I think
Mrs. Clinton should condemn it,'' Lazio said.
</P>
<P>
   Kelli Conlin, head of NARAL-NY, said Thursday that the ban on
television and radio ads paid for by outside groups in the Senate
campaign ''is a violation of our First Amendment rights to free
speech.''
</P>
<P>
   Conlin showed a TV ad the group has produced criticizing Lazio's
stands on abortion rights. NARAL-NY has not yet bought air time for
the ad, but Conlin said eventually it would.
</P>
<P>
   NARAL-NY has endorsed Clinton, and bought air time earlier in
the campaign for a different anti-Lazio ad.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Clinton and Lazio made a deal prohibiting their
respective political parties from using unregulated campaign
donations to purchase TV and radio ads to boost their candidacies.
Both Clinton and Lazio asked other independent groups to abide by
the deal.
</P>
<P>
   But Conlin said her group is ''not beholden to any candidate.
... Our purpose is to preserve abortion rights.''
</P>
<P>
   NARAL-NY is nonpartisan. Before Lazio entered the race, the
group had declined to make an endorsement because the previous
Republican candidate, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, was considered by
NARAL to have as strong a record on abortion rights as Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio has repeatedly said that he supports abortion rights, but
he has voted against Medicaid funding for abortion for low-income
women, and more significantly for abortion-rights supporters, Lazio
has said he would not use Roe v. Wade as a litmus test in approving
Supreme Court justices. Clinton has committed to voting only for
nominees to the high court who vow to uphold abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's campaign manager Bill deBlasio said the campaign sent
NARAL a letter Wednesday asking the group ''to respect the
agreement that we came to, reminding them that it's something
Hillary cares about deeply.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spokeswoman Cathie Levine added that ''NARAL has a lot
at stake in this election and we appreciate that to date they have
abided by Hillary's request.''
</P>
<P>
   Until NARAL buys the air time, it has not technically broken the
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Clinton's campaign unveiled a new statewide ad that
began airing Thursday. The ad touted Clinton's tax-cut initiatives
and bashed Lazio's tax plan as a clone of Republican presidential
candidate George W. Bush's.
</P>
<P>
   The soft-money ban does not apply to ads the campaigns
themselves produce using so-called hard money, which consists of
$1,000 individual donations.

<HEADLINE> Third man pleads in connection with slaying of elderly women  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SCHENECTADY, N.Y. (AP) - A 19-year-old man admitted Wednesday he
was the lookout during a 1998 burglary that ended with the
bludgeoning death of two elderly widows.
</P>
<P>
   Because Terrance T. Townsend is a first-time offender,
prosecutors allowed a plea to a reduced burglary charge that will
mean four years in prison instead of the 15 he had faced in
connection with the murders of Matilda Montenaro, 84, and her
80-year-old sister-in-law Lois DiMaria.
</P>
<P>
   The woman were beaten to death Dec. 16, 1998 after a botched
burglary by Aaron Umber and George Johnson. Umber and Johnson also
tried to burn down the house after the killings, lighting a fire
and turning on the gas stove.
</P>
<P>
   Umber, 22, pleaded guilty to two counts of second-degree murder
and related charges of robbery, burglary and arson in exchange for
40 years to life in prison. Johnson, 20, was sentenced to 80 years
to life following a trial on murder, burglary and other charges.
</P>
<P>
   Police believe a fourth man was involved but have not yet
charged him.
</P>
<P>
   Townsend will be sentenced Nov. 8.

<HEADLINE> Probe Focuses on Sinking Greek Ferry  </HEADLINE>
By LISA ORKIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   PAROS, Greece -- As investigators sought to unravel the reasons
why a ferry sank and killed at least 66 people after hitting a
well-marked rocky islet, questions were raised Thursday about the
age and safety of the coastal fleet that carries tourists to
Greece's popular holiday islands.
</P>
<P>
   The ferry's captain and three crew members were charged with
murder Thursday in the sinking. Investigators focused on reports
that the vessel, loaded with more than 500 passengers, was on
automatic pilot minutes before it struck the rock, bolstering
accounts by survivors that crew members were watching a soccer
match on television when the ship sank.
</P>
<P>
   Sailors' unions, meanwhile, led calls for an investigation into
whether the 34-year-old Express Samina was seaworthy when it went
down.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you check all the ferries, I imagine that only one or two
are above standard. If you report a problem you're in danger of
losing your job,'' said Yannis Manousoyannakis, leader of the Greek
Seamens Union.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, the union said the sunken ferry was ''problematic,
overaged with worn-out sheet metal,'' while the Greek Merchant
Marine Mechanics Union described it as a ''rusting hulk.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the coast guard, the ship was inspected this month
and found seaworthy.
</P>
<P>
   In Greece, ferries must be decommissioned after 35 years and the
Express Samina was to be withdrawn next year.
</P>
<P>
   A Greek member of the European Parliament, Alekos Alavanos, said
Greece should adopt the European Union's more stringent regulations
and decommission ships after 27 years of service.
</P>
<P>
   There are about 18 ships over 29 years of age in Greece's
coastal fleet of about 130 ferries, many of them on the busiest
tourist routes.
</P>
<P>
   Survivors, meanwhile, struggled to cope. Many of the 108 foreign
survivors were stranded without belongings and travel papers, most
wearing clothes donated by islanders.
</P>
<P>
   ''Most people experience trauma after 24 hours... They go back
to their hotels. They sleep and then they come back to the hospital
and they break down,'' said Martien Krouwel, a Dutch nurse who has
lived on Paros for 12 years.
</P>
<P>
   The ship left the Athens' port of Piraeus on Tuesday afternoon
and headed for Paros, the first of six stops on the way to the
Lipsis islands near the Turkish coast. At about 10 p.m., the
345-foot, 4,407-ton ferry rammed into the Portes islets, two rocky
outcroppings listed on navigation charts and lit with a beacon
visible for seven miles.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts by navy divers and rescue crews to find at least eight
missing people were hampered by a fierce gale that stopped all boat
traffic to and from Paros. Rescuers said there could be up to 14
missing.
</P>
<P>
   Survivors have accused the crew of panicking and failing to
organize the evacuation of the ship.
</P>
<P>
   Many attributed their rescue to the proximity of the shore, and
a small fleet of fishing boats that sped to the sinking vessel.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is inconceivable that lives were lost this way,'' said
government spokesman Tilemahos Hitiris.
</P>
<P>
   The ship's captain, Vassilis Yannakis, his deputy, Anastasios
Psychoyos, and two crewmen were charged with five felonies,
regional prosecutor Dimitrios Dadinopoulos said. A fifth crew
member was not charged.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutor said the charges included multiple counts of
homicide with possible malice, causing serious bodily injuries with
possible malice, violating maritime regulations, violating
international regulations on avoiding an accident and sinking a
ship.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign survivors were from Australia, Austria, Albania,
Belgium, Britain, Canada, Egypt, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, New
Zealand, Russia, South Africa, Saudi Arabia, Switzerland, Ukraine
and the United States.

<HEADLINE> U.S. tightens PCB standards for ocean dumping of dredge spoils  </HEADLINE>
By JEFFREY GOLD
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - The federal government on Thursday announced
tighter restrictions on the amount of toxic PCBs in dredge spoils
to be dumped off prime New Jersey beaches, a step environmentalists
said should have come sooner.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've waited over three years. Unfortunately for the ocean,
over a million tons of mud has been dumped out there that shouldn't
have,'' said Cindy Zipf, executive director of Clean Ocean Action,
based on Sandy Hook.
</P>
<P>
   The new standards for cancer-causing PCBs (polychlorinated
biphenyl), apply to a thick, gooey material scraped from the bottom
of New York-New Jersey Harbor's tributaries to ensure sufficient
depth for shipping.
</P>
<P>
   The standards came in an agreement between the Environmental
Protection Agency and the Army Corps of Engineers that set a limit
of 113 parts per billion, down from 400, in worms. The level for
clams remains 100.
</P>
<P>
   Sea life is tested to determine how much contamination is moving
up the food chain, said Mary Mears, spokeswoman for the
Environmental Protection Agency. For example, worms are eaten by
fish, which are later eaten by humans.
</P>
<P>
   The creatures are tested after spending four weeks in a sample
of spoils that is being proposed for ocean dumping, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The deal also provides that the public can comment on what
standards ought to be applied for 60 other chemicals that can be
found in dredge spoils.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is one-third of the solution,'' said Andrew Willner,
baykeeper of New York-New Jersey harbor, an affiliate of the
American Littoral Society.
</P>
<P>
   ''The other two-thirds are pollution prevention and aggressive
prosecution of polluters, and overall port planning. The New
York-New Jersey harbor, which is very shallow, may not be the
appropriate port for very large ships.''
</P>
<P>
   The directive is the latest milestone in the continuing clash of
competing interests: environmentalists seeking to mitigate a
century of offshore toxic dumping, and commercial interests that
contend the shipping channels must be deepened or the ever-larger
vessels that ply the harbor will take their business elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The cheapest method for disposing spoils is ocean dumping.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1997, only sludge largely free of contaminants was to be
placed in an area three to six miles off Sandy Hook, part of which
is called the Mud Dump.
</P>
<P>
   The ''clean'' material was to be used to cover the
15-square-mile Historic Area Remediation Site, the result of nearly
100 years of dumping that has left an underwater pile of muck that
at one point rises seven stories from the ocean floor, Zipf said.
</P>
<P>
   ''EPA was using a definition of uncontaminated that was not
uncontaminated,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've got a huge toxic stain off our coast that we've got to
fix. And the only way to fix it is to put a clean Band-Aid over
it.''
</P>
<P>
   About eight dumping projects in the past two years would not
have met the new standard, including spoils from the Brooklyn
(N.Y.) Marine Terminal and Raritan River in central New Jersey,
said Rep. Frank J. Pallone Jr., D-Long Branch.
</P>
<P>
   Castle Astoria Terminals, an oil shipper in Queens, N.Y., has
already received permits to begin dumping 100,000 tons of spoils
next month, which Pallone conceded can proceed even though the
material would not qualify under the tougher standard.
</P>
<P>
   The congressman, whose district includes Sandy Hook, said he
would seek money so that Castle Astoria can dispose of the dredged
material on land.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Christie Whitman on Thursday said she would make some of
the state's on-land dumping space available for New York spoils.
</P>
<P>
   No permit has been issued for U.S. Gypsum, which is seeking to
dump 107,000 tons of dredged material from the Hudson River in New
York. Those spoils do not meet the new standards and should not be
allowed, Pallone said.

<HEADLINE> Dow Soarss 203; Nasdaq Rises 98  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks shot higher Thursday, buoyed by rebounds
in technology and blue chip issues, as the market apparently
regained its footing despite worries about corporate profits.
</P>
<P>
   The rally, the first consistent advance this week, came as
bargain hunters pushed stocks higher across the board. The gains
were especially strong in the technology sector, which has been
battered for most of the month.
</P>
<P>
   In late afternoon trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones
industrial average was up 202.73 at 10,831.03, its highest level
this week. The Dow fell in each of the first three sessions this
week.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 index was up 31.28 at 1,457.85, and the Nasdaq composite index
rose 97.74 to 3,754.04.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Nie, a technical analyst at First Union Securities, didn't
see any one driving force behind the market's behavior. He said of
the Dow, ''you simply have 23 issues up and only seven down, and
that's better news.''
</P>
<P>
   Stocks have been down for most of September on worries about
corporate profits. And investors have punished stocks of companies
that even hint at disappointing results when third-quarter results
are announced next month.
</P>
<P>
   Compounding the stress are energy prices at decade-high levels
and a weak European currency -- factors that many companies say will
hurt their profits.
</P>
<P>
   A Commerce Department report released Thursday raised new
questions about whether the Federal Reserve's efforts to slow
growth to a more sustainable level have worked.
</P>
<P>
   But the report, which showed the economy expanding at a rate of
5.6 percent between April and June, a faster rate than the 4.8
percent growth in the first three months of 2000, didn't seem to
cause much concern on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the market rallied on a mix of bargain-hunting and
end-of-the-month trading.
</P>
<P>
   Investors again focused on corporate earnings, although their
reactions weren't consistent.
</P>
<P>
   Procter &AMP; Gamble jumped $5.19 to $67.06 after the consumer
products manufacturer said it would meet Wall Street expectations
for the third quarter after several disappointing quarters.
</P>
<P>
   But profit-taking investors unloaded Safeway, trading it down
$4.31 to $49.81, although the grocery store chain reported profits
in line with analysts' estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Investor enthusiasm also appeared to be behind a mild recovery
by Internet and telecom stocks, which have been in a slump.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco Systems, which makes telecom equipment, was up $1.81 at
$59.13, despite a downgrade by a Sanford Bernstein analyst.
Competitor Nortel Networks rose $4.28 to $63.56, halting a decline
that began the previous session. Lucent also moved higher, trading
up $3.25 at $31.81.
</P>
<P>
   Investors pushed Hewlett Packard up $3.94 to $106.75.
</P>
<P>
   And Web portal Yahoo! was up $5.56 at $95.94, gaining back
nearly half of its loss Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''You're getting some good boost of stocks that have been
bludgeoned as of late,'' said Charles White, portfolio manager at
Avatar Associates. ''You may have a little bit of bargain hunting
going on ... and a little bit of relief that we've gone one day
maybe without a company announcing a complete disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   News of a $6.5 billion merger between Global Crossing and
Exodus, two Web site hosting companies, got a mixed reactions.
Exodus fell $3.19 to $50.06. Global Crossing was up $2.06 at
$31.94.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 15-to-8 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 932.46 million
shares, ahead of the 925.16 million in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was up 11.25 at 519.38.

<HEADLINE> Congressman wages ''Save the District'' campaign  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CORNING, N.Y. (AP) - Amo Houghton, looking for an eighth term in
Congress, has been running a second campaign on the side: one to
save his district from being eliminated or rearranged.
</P>
<P>
   With the lagging population likely to cost New York two seats in
Congress in 2002, the Republican has started a petition drive that
aims to send 100,000 signatures to the state Legislature. The
message: when the lines are redrawn, the Southern Tier district
should remain intact.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, Houghton is raising $250,000 to help preserve the
state Senate's Republican majority - a key factor, he says, in
preserving his district.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would be very easy to chop this district up,'' Houghton
said. ''Maybe the Legislature will end up saying that's the way
it's going to be, but if so, we're going to go down with all guns
firing.''
</P>
<P>
   Houghton, whose 31st Congressional District touches 10 counties
from Lake Erie in Chautauqua County to the Finger Lakes, fears
important issues, such as the conversion of Route 17 into
interstate highway I-86, would get lost if his district were
parceled off to congressmen from upstate's big cities.
</P>
<P>
   ''The people in Fredonia think the way people in Ithaca do, and
the people in Jamestown think the way the people in Elmira do - not
the way people in Buffalo and Rochester think,'' Houghton told The
Buffalo News. ''There's a way of life here, and we want to preserve
it and expand the opportunities. But if they divide this district
up, it takes away everything we're trying to do here.''
</P>
<P>
   Census estimates show Houghton's district has lost about 20,000
residents in 10 years and other upstate districts have lost similar
numbers. Such districts are at greatest risk in reapportionment,
though Houghton's is the one frequently mentioned as endangered.
</P>
<P>
   On top of that, some Buffalo-area political players are not
opposed to putting pieces of Houghton's district in one based in
Erie County.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the issues of southern Erie County are very similar to
those in Chautauqua and Cattaraugus counties,'' said Erie County
Republican Chairman Robert Davis. ''Putting them together would not
be a bad thing.''
</P>
<P>
   To preserve his district, Houghton recently established the
Millennium Project, a state political action committee that already
has contributions and pledges totaling $250,000 to help state
Senate Republican candidates this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Houghton said a Republican Senate is key to his district's
survival, believing Democrats would surely favor urban interests in
the reapportionment process.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate and Assembly will share in redrawing the
congressional lines with Gov. George Pataki. Work will begin after
the Census Bureau announces the number of seats for each state in
late December.
</P>
<P>
   By helping Republican Senate candidates, Houghton is expanding
on former Rep. Bill Paxon's 1990 pledge of $100,000. Critics
accused Paxon then - and Houghton now - of trying to buy a safe
Republican seat.
</P>
<P>
   ''This just goes to show how partisan the reapportionment
process is, and we actually think that's indefensible,'' said Blair
Horner of the New York Public Interest Research Group
</P>
<P>
   Houghton said his motives are much different from those of
Paxon, who was a young congressman trying to preserve his political
future. Houghton, the millionaire scion of the family that founded
Corning Inc., stresses he's trying to save the district rather than
his job.
</P>
<P>
   And unlike Paxon, Houghton also has enlisted Democrats in the
cause. Business owners and students have also been out collecting
signatures.

<HEADLINE> Officials to go door-to-door to test for West Nile virus  </HEADLINE>
By JUDIE GLAVE
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - The city is taking its campaign against the West
Nile virus door-to-door in Staten Island in an attempt to determine
how many people have been infected by the potentially deadly
disease.
</P>
<P>
   Staten Island has been the epicenter of the city's battle
against West Nile this year, with nine of the 13 human cases and
the majority of infected birds coming from that borough.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, when northern Queens was hard hit by the virus, a
similar survey was conducted by city and federal health officials.
</P>
<P>
   ''Most human infections have occurred on Staten Island and by
focusing on this borough, we hope to get a better understanding of
West Nile virus and its risk factors for infection,'' health
department commissioner Neal Cohen said in a statement Thursday.
''The understanding will further improve the effectiveness of
mosquito-borne disease prevention and control strategies for the
future.''
</P>
<P>
   During the survey, which will begin Oct. 3, health officials
will go door-to-door collecting blood samples from residents.
Participation is voluntary.
</P>
<P>
   The results will likely take several months to analyze.
</P>
<P>
   During last year's testing in Queens, anonymous donors gave
blood at vans parked throughout the neighborhoods, possibly skewing
the test results since it could not be determined if all of those
tested actually lived in those neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   By going door-to-door in Staten Island, health officials hope to
get a more accurate snapshot of how many may have contracted the
mosquito-borne disease.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, officials announced an 82-year-old New Jersey man
was the first confirmed death from West Nile this year.
</P>
<P>
   The virus, which has flu-like symptoms and can be dangerous to
young children, the elderly and people with weakened immune
systems, has been detected in birds in Maryland, New Jersey,
Connecticut, Massachusetts, Rhode Island and Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   The virus first appearance in the New York metropolitan region
last summer, killing seven and infecting 55 others. It was the
first time it had ever appeared in the Western Hemisphere.

<HEADLINE> Veteran NFL coach to lead New York/New Jersey XFL team  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) - The New York/New Jersey Hitmen
named longtime NFL assistant Rusty Tillman as their first head
coach Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Hitmen are the local entry in the XFL, which begins its
inaugural season in February. The team will play its home games at
Giants Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Tillman most recently served as defensive coordinator for the
Indianapolis Colts in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   A linebacker for eight years with the Washington Redskins,
Tillman has been a coach with the Oakland Raiders, Tampa Bay
Buccaneers and Seattle Seahawks.
</P>
<P>
   ''I couldn't be more excited about the opportunity for me to be
one of only eight head coaches in the XFL,'' Tillman said. ''I'm
truly looking forward to coaching in...New Jersey as I have had
many personal relationships and fond memories from coaching and
playing in the area for so many years. I'm also elated that I will
have a chance to interact with Drew Pearson on a regular basis.''
</P>
<P>
   Pearson, the former Dallas Cowboys receiver, is the general
manager of the Hitmen.
</P>
<P>
   ''Rusty brings a wealth of coaching experience to the XFL and
the Hitmen, but it was his accomplishments as a special teams coach
that enabled him to stand above the crowd,'' Pearson said. He has
the ability excel in the New York-New Jersey market because of his
intensity and his aggressive approach to the game.''

<HEADLINE> Army Will Release No Gun Ri Report  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Army said Thursday it plans to release
findings by the end of the year from its investigation into the
reported killing of South Korean civilians by American soldiers in
the early weeks of the Korean War.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the timetable was not designed to avoid releasing
information before Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   ''The No Gun Ri inquiry is not in any way or shape being driven
by considerations regarding the election,'' Army Secretary Louis
Caldera said in response to a reporter's question at a Pentagon
news conference on another matter.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's been driven by the need to do a very thorough inquiry
where there were millions of pages of documents that had to be
reviewed and individuals that had to be interviewed,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Caldera said ''much of the report'' on the investigation's
findings is being written now, although ''some pieces'' are not yet
completed. He said the goal is to complete the work before the end
of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he thought it would be done before the Nov. 7
election, he said he doubted it.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Bacon, chief spokesman for Defense Secretary William
Cohen, said, ''The report will be released when it's ready to be
released, but it's not done at this stage. ... It's not connected
to the election, it's connected to when we complete the report.''
</P>
<P>
   One year ago Friday, The Associated Press reported that U.S.
Army veterans, corroborating the accounts of Korean villagers, said
their unit killed a large number of civilian refugees at the South
Korean hamlet of No Gun Ri in July 1950. The villagers say about
400 were killed, including 100 in a preceding attack by U.S.
warplanes.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 30, Cohen ordered Caldera to initiate an investigation
into the matter, and he asked that it be done as quickly as
possible. The Army had hoped to finish the inquiry in June, in time
for the 50th anniversary of the start of the Korean War, but it
later estimated it would take until the autumn.
</P>
<P>
   The South Korean government is doing its own investigation.
</P>
<P>
   During meetings last week in Seoul on the U.S.-South Korean
defense relationship, the two sides pledged not to allow the No Gun
Ri investigation to undermine the close ties that developed over
the past five decades. They agreed the investigation should be
''thorough, complete, transparent and should be concluded as
quickly as possible.''

<HEADLINE> Soggy summer could mean a colorful fall in New England  </HEADLINE>
By JUDITH FORMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - New England's summer was a bummer - rainy
and cool. But the silver lining to the lowering clouds may be an
unusually bright fall foliage season.
</P>
<P>
   The wet weather and low temperatures reduced stress on the
region's maples, oaks and birches, and healthy, vigorous trees are
colorful trees, said David Kittredge of the Department of Natural
Resources Conservation at the University of Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Leaves are covered with small holes called stomates that allow
them to exchange carbon dioxide and oxygen through photosynthesis,
Kittredge explained.
</P>
<P>
   During a dry summer, Kittredge said, the leaves close their
holes to avoid losing moisture. Photosynthesis is slowed down, the
trees don't grow as well and produce fewer, less-vibrant leaves.
</P>
<P>
   ''The critical factor is a moisture thing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year a drought affected the ''leaf-peeping'' season. This
year, Donald Smith, Connecticut's state forester, expects leaves
that are bigger, healthier and more plentiful.
</P>
<P>
   Although the northeastern and northwestern corners of
Connecticut are often touted for their trees, Smith said this year
''everything's healthy.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Most of the state should be pretty wonderful viewing,'' he
said. ''This is one of the better years we've seen in the past 10
or 15 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith has predicted that the foliage will peak between Oct.
12-15, but admits ''it really is a gamble when you start telling
people particular dates.''
</P>
<P>
   Brian Stone, the chief of forestry management for the Vermont
Department of Forests and Parks, agreed. Exactly when the trees
will change each year and what their colors will be like is largely
a mystery.
</P>
<P>
   ''All this prediction stuff is BS,'' Stone said. ''No one knows
what it will be like, but it's going to be beautiful. I've lived in
the north country for 59 years and I've never seen a bad foliage
season.''
</P>
<P>
   The soggy summer also means the foliage season is more important
financially for innkeepers, tour guides and other tourism
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Individual and group tour reservations are already ahead of
where they were at this time last year, said Ed Dombroskas,
executive director of the Connecticut Office of Tourism.
</P>
<P>
   With an estimated $1.27 billion and some 4 million anticipated
visitors on the line, Diane Konrady, a spokeswoman for the Vermont
Department of Tourism and Marketing, said: ''It's still a little
early, but what we're seeing in some of the northern areas is very
promising.''
</P>
<P>
   In Pennsylvania, some 28 million people drive 50 miles or more
from home to visit state tourism sites during autumn, said Fritz
Smith, a spokesman for the state's Center for Travel and Tourism.
</P>
<P>
   ''The emphasis on leisure travel used to be solely on the
summer, but we've seen it shift more to fall,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Although average gas prices in New England ranged Tuesday from a
high of $1.72 in Connecticut to a low of $1.58 in Vermont, a
spokeswoman for the AAA in Hartford said the cost of fuel shouldn't
be a ''trip breaker.''
</P>
<P>
   ''If Labor Day is any indication, it should be a good fall
season,'' spokeswoman Kelly Carter said. Despite high gasoline
prices, the summer travel season ''really wound down with a bang,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Nelson Houston, pastor at the White Mountain Chapel in
Conway, N.H., said the fall colors bring out faithful leaf peepers
as well as the plain old faithful.
</P>
<P>
   Attendance at the chapel increases as much as 10 percent during
prime foliage season. But Houston said he doesn't change his
sermons to cater to the leaf-loving crowd.
</P>
<P>
   God is God, after all, and probably doesn't care that people
plan to gawk at trees following the service.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've had them come all the way from California and England,''
he said. ''I thought flying from England to see leaves was
amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   Many fans of fall foliage find the region's natural beauty runs
deeper than the annual turning of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's hard to explain,'' said Bruce Byberg, owner of Brighter
Skies Balloon Co. in Woodstock, Conn., which offers foliage flights
to tourists.
</P>
<P>
   ''The whole experience of going up in the balloon, how quiet it
is ... the color of the leaves is lower on their list than when
they started the ride.''

<HEADLINE> Tensions Mount in Ivory Coast  </HEADLINE>
By AMBA DADSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) -- Fist-pumping young protesters turned
out by the hundreds Thursday in an angry show of support for Ivory
Coast's junta leader, denouncing international pressure on him
ahead of upcoming elections.
</P>
<P>
   The rally signaled growing resistance by Gen. Robert Guei's
regime to outside calls that he let the country's opposition leader
run against him in an Oct. 22 presidential vote. The vote has been
called to return Ivory Coast to civilian control after nine months
of military rule.
</P>
<P>
   The rally -- held despite the junta's own ban on political
gatherings -- came three days after some of Africa's most
influential heads of state intervened to try to resolve Ivory
Coast's tense political situation. The African leaders, under the
auspices of the Organization of African Unity, urged Guei to open
the vote to opposition leaders.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Guei reaffirmed his earlier rejection of the
proposals, telling the demonstrators that Ivorians were capable of
handling their own affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are responsible enough. Our will is what has already been
translated into the constitution,'' Guei said to cheers and
applause.
</P>
<P>
   The 1,500-strong crowd, mostly young men, turned upon
journalists working for foreign organizations, forcing several to
flee under security forces' escort.
</P>
<P>
   ''Foreigners out!'' the Guei supporters shouted, some waving
posters denouncing the Organization of African Unity for its
pressure for fair and open elections.
</P>
<P>
   Ivory Coast's foremost opposition leader, Alassane Dramane
Ouattara, is a northerner in a political arena long dominated by
southerners.
</P>
<P>
   Guei's supporters claim one of Ouattara's parents is
foreign-born, which would disqualify him for the race under a
junta-backed constitution voted in last month.
</P>
<P>
   Ouattara, a former premier and ex-International Monetary Fund
official, insists both his parents were Ivorian-born.
</P>
<P>
   Ouattara's supporters have surrounded his house day and night
for more than a week, fearing a move against him by the junta.
</P>
<P>
   Guei came to power after a Christmas Eve military coup, the
first in the history of the 40-year-old nation. The coup, and two
smaller military uprisings since, have shaken the country's
standing as a valued center of stability in troubled West Africa.

<HEADLINE> One Day Rail Strike Stalls France  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- French transport workers staged a one-day strike
Thursday that brought almost all the country's trains to a halt and
snarled highway traffic for miles outside the capital.
</P>
<P>
   Public transportation within Paris was not affected by the
strike.
</P>
<P>
   Morning traffic around Paris was backed up for miles, and
evening traffic also was stalled, the National Center for Road
Information said. Bad weather aggravated the strike.
</P>
<P>
   All but one of France's 15 rail worker unions took part in the
strike to seek higher pay, better retirement packages, more jobs
and progress on putting the mandatory 35-hour work week into
practice.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a very important day and it shows the determination of
rail workers to get results on salaries and use all necessary
force,'' said Jean-Michel Sgorlol, an official at the CGT trade
union. ''We said at the beginning of September that if things did
not change, there would be action. Now we want real negotiations
with real propositions,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Talks on salaries are to start Oct. 5.
</P>
<P>
   The national rail authority advised passengers to find
alternative means of transportation, as only 30 percent of trains
were operating. Rail service between major French cities, such as
Paris and Marseille, was also disrupted.
</P>
<P>
   The strike, which began Wednesday evening, was to end Friday
morning.

<HEADLINE> Proposed Missile Defense Tested  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon conducted two tests Thursday of
important elements of the proposed national missile defense system
in preparation for another attempt to shoot down a target in space.
</P>
<P>
   In the first test, a Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic
missile launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base, Calif., released
20 objects in flight to test the ability of a prototype
ground-based radar to distinguish among them. In a real missile
intercept mission, the radar's role would be to keep an
intercepting missile on a collision path with its target and not
allow it to be fooled by decoys around the target.
</P>
<P>
   The Ballistic Missile Defense Organization, the Pentagon office
in charge of the program, said preliminary indications are that the
prototype radar successfully distinguished among the 20 objects in
space.
</P>
<P>
   The radar is situated on Kwajalein Atoll in the central Pacific
Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   In the second test, conducted about two hours after the first,
also involved a Minuteman III missile launched from Vandenberg. It
was designed to test elements of the national missile defense
system -- such as an ''in-flight interceptor communication system''
used to send information from the ground radar to the interceptor
missile -- that will be used in the next attempt to shoot down a
mock warhead in space.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said that next test is expected
to be conducted early next year. Until recently that test was
scheduled for November, but the timing has slipped due to technical
problems.
</P>
<P>
   The two previous intercept attempts failed, most recently in
July.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 1, President Clinton announced that more testing was
needed before he could have enough confidence in the technical
feasibility of national missile defense to authorize the start of
construction. Clinton said it would be up to the next president to
decide whether and when to go ahead. His decision effectively ended
missile defense supporters' hope of having a system ready for use
by 2005.
</P>
<P>
   Bacon said Thursday's tests show that the Pentagon is moving
ahead with development work even though deployment has been put
off.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're on our normal schedule to continue development of a
national missile defense system,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Indians, Gov't Fight Over Mountain  </HEADLINE>
By MATT KELLEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A 252-year-old land grant from the king of
Spain is at the heart of a court case pitting a New Mexico Indian
tribe against the federal government over ownership of a mountain.
</P>
<P>
   The Sandia Pueblo consider Sandia Mountain their holiest place,
while the federal government wants to maintain control of one of
the state's most popular recreation areas. Included in the mix are
the non-Indians who live on the mountain's slopes, which provide a
spectacular backdrop for some homes on the outskirts of
Albuquerque.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit
will hear arguments in the case Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''That mountain is our church, and for it to be developed, for
it to be destroyed with the amount of traffic, litter and so forth
that's being done up there ... it's like desecrating a church,''
tribal Gov. Stuwart Paisano said. ''Our main goal is to protect it
and preserve it from any future development and any future
destruction.''
</P>
<P>
   The mountain, which borders the Pueblo reservation, is part of
the Cibola National Forest and is home to an aerial tramway and
popular trail to the 10,600-foot summit that is crowded with hikers
most days.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians say a 1748 land grant from the Spanish king extends
the tribal border to the summit. Federal officials say the Indians'
land stops at the top of the mountain's first foothill, meaning the
federal government owns most of the mountain.
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge sided with the tribe in 1998, saying Sandia
Pueblo is the rightful owner of 9,890 acres on Sandia Mountain's
west face. The federal government and private landowners challenged
the ruling, setting up Friday's hearing.
</P>
<P>
   For centuries, members of the Sandia Pueblo have gone to the
mountain to pray, visit religious shrines and collect plants and
other items for religious ceremonies. Tribal council member Frank
Paisano, 55, remembers going on mountain pilgrimages with his
grandfather during the 1950s, before Albuquerque had grown to the
edge of their reservation.
</P>
<P>
   ''Because of the influx and the intrusion from the outside
world, it has made it very difficult for us to continue (to
worship) in our private way,'' said Paisano, father of the current
tribal governor.
</P>
<P>
   The 500-member tribe worries about damage from the heavy use of
the national forest and is upset the Forest Service requires
permits for tribal members to collect plants.
</P>
<P>
   The governor and other Pueblo officials say they don't want to
close the mountain to non-Indians, but they oppose any new
recreation or development.
</P>
<P>
   Tribal officials also are concerned about development of private
parcels within the national forest. Two private tracts on the
mountainside have been turned into neighborhoods with pricey homes.
</P>
<P>
   The tribe's lawsuit, however, seeks to reclaim only the federal
land on the mountainside.
</P>
<P>
   The homeowners do not want to be surrounded by Indian land
because that could mean they would be taxed by the tribe and live
under the jurisdiction of tribal courts, said Tom Bartman, their
lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Pueblo officials note that courts repeatedly have ruled tribes
have no authority to tax land owned by non-Indians, even if the
land is inside reservation boundaries.

<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) - Republican Rick Lazio, facing Hillary
Rodham Clinton in the nation's highest profile U.S. Senate race,
has found himself in a late-in-the-campaign dogfight for
traditionally more conservative upstate New York.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio kicked off a three-day bus tour through the upstate area
on Thursday, beginning with a speech to a Rotary Club luncheon in
Buffalo. A day earlier, the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute
had come out with a poll showing the first lady leading the
congressman from Long Island, 50 percent to 43 percent, among
likely voters.
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton hitting the magic 50 percent mark for the first
time this year in a major statewide independent poll dominated the
news coverage, there was an ominous message in the poll for Lazio -
the mood of the upstate electorate. The poll found Lazio supported
by 46 percent of upstate voters while Clinton was backed by 44
percent, a statistical tie given the poll's margin of error of plus
or minus 3 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   ''The upstate stuff shouldn't be that close'' if Lazio is to
win, said Maurice Carroll, director of the polling institute.
</P>
<P>
   Buried inside the poll was the evidence of Lazio's upstate
problem.
</P>
<P>
   -Thirty-eight percent of upstate voters said they had a
favorable opinion of Clinton to 35 percent for Lazio.
</P>
<P>
   -When asked if the candidates share their views on the issues,
58 percent of upstate voters said Clinton did, the same number that
said Lazio did.
</P>
<P>
   -Asked if the candidates had ''the stature to be a distinguished
United States senator,'' 65 percent of upstate voters said Clinton
did. Lazio hit 67 percent.
</P>
<P>
   -Asked if the candidates were too liberal, too conservative or
just about right, 53 percent of upstate voters said Lazio was just
about right while 47 percent of them said Clinton was just about
right, a very small edge for Lazio.
</P>
<P>
   -Lazio did have the edge, 74 percent to 45 percent, when it came
to which candidate upstate voters felt had ''the right kind of
experience'' to be a senator from New York. He has made much of the
fact that she only moved to New York in January.
</P>
<P>
   -On the issues, upstate voters gave the edge to Clinton on
health care, education and abortion. Lazio had the edge on taxes.
</P>
<P>
   -By a 67 percent to 29 percent margin, upstate voters said a
candidate's position on issues was more important than their
experience or personal qualities.
</P>
<P>
   That last could be a major problem for Lazio given that his
advertising campaign has been geared to telling voters that they
can't trust Clinton. The poll found that upstate voters, like those
elsewhere in the state, care more about where she and he stand on
the issues.
</P>
<P>
   The upstate region, less of a sure thing for Republican
candidates running statewide than it used to be, has become
critical in this year's Senate race. In general elections, the
region normally provides about 45 percent of the statewide vote.
</P>
<P>
   Asked Thursday in Buffalo why he wasn't doing better in upstate
New York, Lazio said he thought he was doing just fine.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't pay attention to polls,'' he told reporters. ''If you
travel with us and you see the crowds and the enthusiasm ... I
think we're doing very well.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Clinton is generally greeted by larger crowds across
upstate New York, certainly a reflection in part of her celebrity,
but they also often seem more enthusiastic than those who come out
to see Lazio. She has been spending a good portion of her time in
upstate New York.
</P>
<P>
   Most polls have shown Clinton well ahead of Lazio in heavily
Democratic New York City, which traditionally provides about 30
percent of the statewide vote, with him having the edge in the
suburban counties, which usually account for about a quarter of the
vote.
</P>
<P>
   That has been the pattern for months, explaining why there is
the heavy interest in upstate New York.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, then-Republican Sen. Alfonse D'Amato captured 55
percent of the upstate vote to Democrat Charles Schumer's 45
percent. Schumer won the election.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Vague on Political Future  </HEADLINE>
By MARK LAVIE
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
returned home from the United States Thursday, a day after a
corruption case against him was closed, but he was vague about a
political comeback.
</P>
<P>
   While supporters urged him to challenge Prime Minister Ehud
Barak, who trounced him in an election in May 1999, Netanyahu put
off questions about his future.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to reporters in front of his father's house in a quiet
Jerusalem neighborhood, Netanyahu indicated that if he re-enters
politics, he will adopt a conciliatory tone. ''To the extent it
depends on me,'' said Netanyahu, political discussions ''will
always be done with mutual respect.''
</P>
<P>
   While he was prime minister from 1996 to 1999, Netanyahu's
opponents vilified him as a divisive leader who incited segments of
the society against each other.
</P>
<P>
   ''The lesson I learned'' over the past year, he said, is that
''we are all brothers living in the same country, that we have the
same future.''
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu looked relaxed and fit as he gave a statement to
reporters, but refused to answer questions. He had been in the
United States working as an adviser to start-up companies and
keeping largely out of the public eye.
</P>
<P>
   As premier, Netanyahu opposed concessions to the Palestinians,
but under heavy American pressure, he signed two interim peace
agreements. Barak was elected on a moderate platform that included
trading West Bank territory for peace.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Attorney General Elyakim Rubinstein rejected a
police recommendation to put Netanyahu on trial for allegedly
conspiring with a government contractor in a kickback scheme,
illegally keeping gifts and obstructing justice.
</P>
<P>
   Rubinstein ruled that there was insufficient evidence to assure
a conviction, but he sharply criticized Netanyahu's behavior in
office, saying that it ''had an element of ugliness.''
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu expressed relief over Rubinstein's ruling, which would
clear the way for him to return to politics. It comes at a time
when Barak is vulnerable to a challenge. Though he trounced
Netanyahu by 56 percent to 44, Barak has been losing ground ever
since.
</P>
<P>
   Public opinion polls show that Barak and Netanyahu are running
even, though significant numbers of voters say they are undecided.
</P>
<P>
   The parliament elected along with Barak is more favorable to his
hard-line predecessor, Netanyahu. Barak built a coalition dominated
by Netanyahu's ex-partners, all of whom deserted him as he prepared
to offer concessions to the Palestinians for peace.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu maintained throughout that the police investigation,
which included long hours of interrogation, leaks to the local news
media and searches of his home and belongings, was politically
motivated.

<HEADLINE> Official Sees Fewer Airline Delays  </HEADLINE>
By JESSE J. HOLLAND
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater said
Thursday he hopes that the lessons of a frustrating summer travel
season should help to ensure that the public will not suffer
through similar delays next year.
</P>
<P>
   It'll be better ''because of the lessons we've learned, because
of the resources we're going to expend to expand the capacity of
the system and also because of the attention that's being brought
to the matter,'' he said after the latest in a series of
congressional hearings on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Delayed and canceled flights caused by weather and air traffic
control problems, as well as a pilot dispute at United Airlines,
made this summer the worst in five years, according to Federal
Aviation Administration statistics.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA reported 47,893 delayed flights in August, up from
44,430 in July but below the record 50,114 recorded in June.
</P>
<P>
   However, FAA Administrator Jane Garvey told the House
Transportation subcommittee that bad weather accounted for 70
percent of the flight delays and cancellations this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Without the unpredictable weather and the United Airlines
problem, ''it would have been actually a better traveling summer
than the year before,'' Slater said. ''On the whole, you look at
all of the airlines, you see significant improvements over the last
year, and even this year.''
</P>
<P>
   And ''we're going to have some more improvements, and let's hope
the weather won't be as bad next summer,'' Slater said.
</P>
<P>
   Many lawmakers, who have to fly between Washington and their
home districts every week, had their own stories about being stuck
on airplanes waiting for takeoff and hearing from angry
constituents.
</P>
<P>
   ''The anger I see in the American public is not being accurately
reflected in this hearing,'' said Rep. Peter DeFazio, D-Ore.
</P>
<P>
   Slater and Garvey said an aviation bill passed in April will
help in the future. That law will allow the purchase of new air
traffic controller equipment and help pay for new airport
construction. The law also includes FAA management reform
provisions to ensure that the money is used effectively.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's clearly a major step forward but many of the
modernizations will take years,'' Garvey said.
</P>
<P>
   But airlines think more should be done. ''Its clear that in the
long term, we need fundamental reform of the air traffic control
system,'' said Donald Carty, American Airlines CEO and chairman of
the Executive Committee of the Air Transport Association. ''We need
to find ways to bring private sector disciplines to bear on the
delivery of air traffic control.''
</P>
<P>
   Air traffic controllers say that won't do any good.
''Privatization will not speed up the process of building new
runways and airports,'' said John Carr, president of the National
Air Traffic Controllers Association. ''Safe, reliable, user
accepted equipment will not be developed and installed any faster.
Privatization would, instead, fracture the delicate balance of a
work force that holds the system together.''
</P>
<P>
   Carr blamed airlines for scheduling too many flights at crowded
airports during the peak flying hours.
</P>
<P>
   ''Schedules are blindly made to reduce operating costs and
maximize revenue without regard for other airlines, terminal
airspace or airport capacity,'' he said. ''At peak times, dozens of
planes are simultaneously taxiing for take off or queuing above the
airport in a finite amount of terminal airspace.''

<HEADLINE> New Contract for Transplant Network  </HEADLINE>
By LAURA MECKLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Renewing its federal contract, the private
network that runs the nation's transplant system has agreed to
direct more organs to the sickest patients and to give the
government final say over policy for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   There was some question whether the United Network for Organ
Sharing, which has run the transplant system since 1987, would get
a new contract at all after a bitter fight with the Department of
Health and Human Services over policies over distribution of scarce
organs and who should set them.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new, three-year deal announced Thursday, UNOS will
continue to maintain the list of people waiting for new organs and
run the computers that match waiting patients with donated organs.
And with another bidder looking to take over, the Richmond,
Va.-based firm acceded to HHS's long-standing demands, which are
now written into their agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can effect the policies the best by remaining the
contractor,'' said UNOS spokesman Mark Rosenker. ''It would have
been a tremendous loss for the community,'' he added, if it had
gone to another company.
</P>
<P>
   But UNOS was not the unequivocal victor.
</P>
<P>
   The University Renal Research and Education Association of Ann
Arbor, Mich., was picked to run the Scientific Registry of
Transplant Recipients, which crunches data on how transplant
patients fare and examines the ramifications of changes to
distribution policy. UNOS had done this since 1987.
</P>
<P>
   HHS hopes the Michigan contractor will provide a check on UNOS
by allowing outside analysts to examine policies that UNOS
proposes.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no vested interest to have it come out one way or
another,'' said Dr. Claude Earl Fox, administrator of the Health
Resources and Services Administration, the HHS branch that oversees
the transplant system.
</P>
<P>
   The Michigan firm will also be responsible for producing reports
to HHS and the public about the transplant system. UNOS has come
under fire in the past for failing to produce timely and specific
data.
</P>
<P>
   Tensions between HHS and UNOS grew in 1998, after HHS directed
that UNOS break down geographic barriers that govern the system,
direct more organs to the sickest patients and get HHS approval for
its policies.
</P>
<P>
   UNOS and its allies bitterly fought those rules. Congress put
them on hold several times before they finally took effect early
this year. Then the House voted to strip HHS of its power over
transplant policy, effectively overturning the regulations. The
Senate has worked hard on compromise legislation, but no bill has
passed both houses.
</P>
<P>
   The new contract nullifies much of the debate by requiring UNOS
to abide by each of the regulation's provisions. So even if the
regulation were overturned, the transplant network is bound by
contract to break down geographic barriers and get more organs to
the sickest patients.
</P>
<P>
   The decision over the transplant contract was widely
anticipated. The only other bidder was the Pittsburgh-based Center
for the Support of the Transplant Community.
</P>
<P>
   Fox said that bid was ''competitive,'' but ''not extremely
close'' based on objective criteria. Still, by having another
bidder, HHS had additional leverage in its negotiations with UNOS.
</P>
<P>
   The contract gives UNOS $1.5 million in taxpayer money in its
first year and authorizes a patient registration fee of $404, paid
by patients on the waiting list. That's up from $379 now. The first
year of the three-year contract should total nearly $16.5 million
for UNOS.
</P>
<P>
   University Renal Research will get just over $2.6 million in the
first year of its three-year contract. Both contracts include
options to extend them for an additional two years.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, UNOS is considering new plans that would distribute
livers across larger geographic areas and developing more detailed
medical criteria to rank waiting patients.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, some 200 experts were meeting in Dallas to refine
the medical criteria. Without uniform criteria, doctors are wary of
trusting one another with broader sharing of donated livers for
fear the patient in another area is not really as sick as his or
her doctors say.

<HEADLINE> Police lieutenant admits to evidence room theft  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SOMERVILLE, N.J. (AP) - A former Somerville police lieutenant in
charge of the department's evidence room has pleaded guilty to
taking cash and a watch from the room.
</P>
<P>
   Vincent Metzler, 48, who was dismissed from the department last
spring, pleaded guilty to theft of property, a third-degree
offense, according to Somerset County Prosecutor Wayne J. Forrest.
</P>
<P>
   Metzler admitted taking $289 in cash and a Tag Heuer watch
valued at $495 in February.
</P>
<P>
   Officials began investigating the theft in late April. The
investigation began after Metzler learned the prosecutor's office
was conducting an audit of the evidence room and asked another
police officer to return the cash and watch for him, suggesting he
had inadvertently kept both.
</P>
<P>
   The other officer informed officials of the attempt, and a
further investigation of Metzler began, according to the
prosecutor. He was fired April 18 after admitting he filed a false
police report.
</P>
<P>
   Metzler, who entered his plea before Superior Court Judge Victor
Ashrafi, faces probation and a fine.

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends Up 196; Nasdaq Adds 105  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks shot higher Thursday, buoyed by rebounds
in technology and blue chip issues as the market apparently
regained its footing amid uncertainty about corporate profits.
</P>
<P>
   The upturn was a dramatic comeback for a market that has taken a
beating all week on concerns about third-quarter earnings, higher
oil prices and the weak European currency.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 195.70 at 10,824.06,
according to preliminary calculations, its highest close this week.
The Dow fell in each of the previous three sessions.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 index was up 29.04 at 1,455.61, and the Nasdaq composite index
rose 105.19 to 3,3761.49.
</P>
<P>
   The market advanced on a mix of bargain-hunting and
end-of-the-quarter trading.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a pretty broad-based rally. I'm look at technology,
banking, and several other sectors all up,'' said Dan Ascani,
president and research director at Global Market Strategists in
Gainesville, Ga. ''You've got a situation where you've had a lot of
earnings warnings and a washout in some stocks, so some of these
stocks are going to picked up at real bargains,''
</P>
<P>
   Stocks have been down for most of September on worries about
corporate profits. And investors have punished stocks of companies
that even hint at disappointing results when third-quarter results
are announced next month.
</P>
<P>
   The market's unease has been compounded by energy prices that
are at decade-high levels and a weak European currency -- factors
that many companies say will hurt their profits.
</P>
<P>
   Investors appeared unfazed by a Commerce Department report
Thursday that showed the economy expanded at an annual rate of 5.6
percent between April and June, a faster rate than the 4.8 percent
growth in the first three months of 2000. The report also showed
inflation, which has been the primary concern of the Federal
Reserve as it raised interest rates over the past 15 months, was
moderating even as the economy surged.
</P>
<P>
   Investors again focused on corporate earnings. Procter &AMP; Gamble
jumped $5.13 to $67 after the consumer products maker said it would
meet Wall Street expectations for the third quarter after several
disappointing quarters.
</P>
<P>
   But profit-taking investors unloaded Safeway, trading it down
$3.75 to $50.38 after the grocery company reported profits in line
with analysts' estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Internet and telecom stocks also emerged from a slump.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco Systems was up $2 at $59.31, despite a downgrade by a
Sanford Bernstein analyst. Nortel Networks rose $4.09 to $63.38,
halting a decline that began the previous session. Lucent also
moved higher, trading up $2.75 at $31.31.
</P>
<P>
   Investors pushed Hewlett Packard up $4.06 to $106.88.
</P>
<P>
   And Web portal Yahoo! was up $5.31 at $95.69, gaining back
nearly half of its loss Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''You're getting some good boost of stocks that have been
bludgeoned as of late,'' said Charles White, portfolio manager at
Avatar Associates. ''You may have a little bit of bargain hunting
going on ... and a little bit of relief that we've gone one day
maybe without a company announcing a complete disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   Financial services stocks moved higher as well. Citigroup
climbed $1.50 to $53.88 and J.P. Morgan was up $5.25 at $166.44.
Dain Rauscher, a regional brokerage firm, rose $13 to $92.88 after
announcing it was being acquired by the Royal Bank of Canada in a
$1.5 billion deal.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a more than 2-to-1
margin on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 1.19
billion shares, ahead of the 1.16 billion in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was up 13.20 at 521.33.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 0.08 percent.
Germany's DAX index was up .27 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 dropped
0.08 percent, and France's CAC-40 fell 0.13 percent.

<HEADLINE> Opponents to natural gas pipeline plan to file lawsuit  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DEFIANCE, Ohio (AP) - Opponents say they will sue to stop a
natural gas pipeline that would cross northern Ohio into central
Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission approved the 400-mile
pipeline Wednesday. Landowners and farmers object to the project
because of concerns about safety and disruption to farmland.
</P>
<P>
   ''We knew this would happen,'' said Phil Bresler, a pipeline
opponent from Wood County in northwest Ohio. ''But we had to do
this to get to the federal courts. That's next.''
</P>
<P>
   A partnership of natural gas sellers wants to build the
Independence Pipeline to move gas from Chicago to New York. They
hope to have it operational by November 2002.
</P>
<P>
   The $670 million pipeline would begin in Defiance and go through
18 counties in Ohio and Pennsylvania. A second stretch of pipeline
would extend 90 miles through parts of 10 New Jersey counties.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents are worried the pipeline will come close to their
homes and that it would disrupt costly drainage systems in northern
Ohio's farm fields.
</P>
<P>
   They also are angry that they could lose their land through
eminent domain.
</P>
<P>
   ''The main thing we hate the worst is the eminent domain part,''
Bresler said. ''They have the power to come in and take over our
land and we can't do anything about it.''
</P>
<P>
   He wouldn't say what arguments opponents will make in the suit,
which is expected to be filed in the coming months.
</P>
<P>
   Federal regulators have the power to approve the use of eminent
domain. However, a Pickaway County judge in July ruled that Ohio
law did not allow Marathon Ashland Petroleum to use that means to
get access to land in central and southern Ohio for a proposed
pipeline.
</P>
<P>
   Federal regulators in December had voted to delay the project,
after residents of Butler and Lawrence counties in Pennsylvania
raised environmental concerns. The authorities said the
Independence Pipeline Co. had to meet some 90 requirements before
receiving approval.
</P>
<P>
   The commission in July ruled that the requirements had been met
and that the pipeline would have ''limited adverse environmental
effect.''
</P>
<P>
   The pipeline is proposed by a partnership of natural gas
sellers, including Coastal Corp.'s ANR Pipeline Co.,
Transcontinental Gas Pipeline Corp. and National Fuel Gas Supply.

<HEADLINE> Students Ask For Help To End Slavery  </HEADLINE>
By PAULINE JELINEK
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Five children sat patiently Thursday as their
teacher wept in a Senate hearing room.
</P>
<P>
   The youngsters had asked the Senate Foreign Relations Committee
to help them in their 3-year-old campaign to end slavery in Sudan
and around the world. And teacher Barbara Vogel cried at the
thought that the senators would not.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado sixth-grader Dong Cho spoke first.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have to do homework, chores, and go to school -- and I still
have time to help,'' said Cho, who has raised money to buy back
slaves. ''Is Congress too busy?''
</P>
<P>
   But a more disheartened Vogel noted that only two of 18 senators
on the committee had come to the hearing. And she charged the
government had largely remained ''deaf'' to their campaign and to
the plight of the enslaved.
</P>
<P>
   ''Senators, please support these students. If you do not,'' she
said choking back tears, ''what can I possibly teach them?
</P>
<P>
   ''Can I still teach them that our government stands for right
... our country stands for principles ... that we are the home of
the brave?''
</P>
<P>
   The group came from Highland School in Aurora, Colo., where
Vogel founded S.T.O.P.(Slavery that Oppresses People). It has
raised money to buy back hundreds of slaves in Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   Along with freed slaves from Haiti, Mauritania and Sudan, they
spoke at a hearing that the committee chairman, Sen. Jesse Helms,
R-N.C., said was to draw attention to the ''vicious inhumanity'' of
slavery, ''particularly in the Sudan.''
</P>
<P>
   Francis Bok, a southern Sudanese of the Dinka tribe, said he was
captured by Arab militia in Sudan at the age of 7 and enslaved to
work for an Arab family for 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   ''Today in Sudan and around the world, there are children who
cannot sleep at night -- they lie on the ground and they wait for
strong people to come and free them,'' he said. ''Senators, you are
strong people. ... You can free the slaves.''
</P>
<P>
   Sudan denies its army has enslaved captives taken during the
civil war.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department this year for the first time included data
on trafficking of human beings in its annual human rights report to
try to highlight the problem.
</P>
<P>
   But the government has not implemented a recommendation from a
national commission on religous freedom, which suggested tougher
sanctions and other pressure on Sudan for alleged atrocities in the
Arab government's 17-year war against the country's animist and
Christian southerners.

<HEADLINE> Abortion Pill Sales Face Challenge  </HEADLINE>
By PHIL GALEWITZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   Despite years of anticipation, don't expect overwhelming demand
for the abortion pill RU-486, say doctors and women's health
advocates.
</P>
<P>
   Surgical abortion will remain the predominant method of
terminating a pregnancy because it can be done in a day rather than
the two to three days for RU-486, which won U.S. approval Thursday.
Other factors that may block acceptance of the pill is that only a
limited number of doctors will prescribe it and women may hesitate
to take it once they learn about the pain and discomfort it causes,
doctors say.
</P>
<P>
   ''Most people think you take the pill and the pregnancy is gone,
and nothing else is involved,'' said Dr. Deborah Oyer, a family
doctor with Aurora Medical Services in Seattle who was involved in
the clinical trials of RU-486. ''Women who have gone through a
spontaneous miscarriage know it does not feel good.''
</P>
<P>
   The pill-induced abortion can be painful, causing bleeding and
nausea for days. Heavy bleeding is a potentially serious but rare
side effect.
</P>
<P>
   RU-486 can be used only within 49 days of the beginning of the
woman's last menstrual period. The woman takes three mifepristone
pills. Two days later, she returns to the doctor to swallow a
second drug, misoprostol, that causes uterine contractions to expel
the embryo. She returns for a follow-up visit within two weeks to
make sure the abortion is complete.
</P>
<P>
   Oyer said she expect only about 10 percent of the 1.3 million
annual abortions in the United States to be done with the pill,
which will become available for American women in about a month.
</P>
<P>
   Danco Laboratories LLC, a small, privately owned New York based
company that was formed in the late 1990s for the sole purpose of
introducing the abortion pill, will sell RU-486 in the United
States under the brand name Mifeprex. Danco has revealed little
about its business strategies, though it's expected to soon launch
a massive consumer advertising campaign about the drug.
</P>
<P>
   Backers of the drug say they expect critics to try to scare
women, by focusing on the possibility of heavy bleeding after
taking the pills. But they say that such bleeding is rare.
</P>
<P>
   ''Is if safe? Yes! Up to 49 days, the safety margin is
wonderful,'' said Dr. Richard Hausknecht, medical director for
Danco. ''This is a very, very safe drug,'' Hausknecht said. ''The
FDA would not have approved it if they didn't think so.''
</P>
<P>
   After a decade of use in France, about 40 percent of abortions
in the country are completed with RU-486. But doctors involved in
the drug's clinical trials in the U.S. say demand will be less
among U.S. women.
</P>
<P>
   RU-486 was more popular in Europe because abortions are
generally not done there until at least eight weeks into the
pregancy-- and thus the pill gave women the chance to abort their
pregnancy earlier. In contrast in the United States, doctors
routinely perform abortions as early as five weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Gloria Feldt, president of Planned Parenthood Federation of
America, estimated about 20 percent to 30 percent of women seeking
abortions will use the pill. ''The process will be less prolonged
with the surgical procedure,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Women's access to the pill will be determined largely by how
many doctors choose to prescribe it. Many doctors are willing to
prescribe RU-486 because of risk possible harassment from
anti-abortion advocates.
</P>
<P>
   About one-third of family physicians and gynecologists who don't
currently provide elective surgical abortions said they would
consider prescribing RU-486, according to a recent survey of 767
physicians by the Kaiser Family Foundation.

<HEADLINE> Abortion by Pill Not That Simple  </HEADLINE>
By LAURAN NEERGAARD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Getting an abortion with the drug RU-486 isn't
quite as simple as taking a pill.
</P>
<P>
   So the Food and Drug Administration issued detailed requirements
Thursday to ensure that women fully understand the process and that
properly trained doctors use the drug accurately.
</P>
<P>
   The abortion pill, which doctors call by its chemical name
mifepristone, is only for use very early in pregnancy -- 49 days
from the beginning of a woman's last menstrual period; it requires
three doctor visits to complete.
</P>
<P>
   First, a woman swallows three mifepristone pills. Mifepristone
blocks action of a hormone essential for maintaining pregnancy.
Without that hormone, progesterone, the uterine lining thins so the
embryo cannot remain implanted and grow.
</P>
<P>
   To fully detach the embryo from the uterus and expel it, two
days later a woman must swallow a second drug, misoprostol, that
causes uterine contractions -- miscarriage-like cramping and
bleeding.
</P>
<P>
   Then, she must return for a follow-up visit within two weeks to
make sure the abortion is complete. While studies show mifepristone
is 92 percent to 95 percent effective in causing early abortion,
some women need surgical abortion to finish the job.
</P>
<P>
   If the fetus survived either the mifepristone or misoprostol
steps and surgical abortion is not done, a woman could have a
malformed child, something that has occasionally happened overseas.
If the fetus died but was not completely expelled, a woman could
suffer infection or other problems, the FDA warned.
</P>
<P>
   In studies where women had the necessary doctor visits,
complications were rare. The FDA said 1 percent of women suffer
serious bleeding that requires a surgical abortion-like procedure
to staunch, and a handful needed a transfusion.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA mandated that women be given a special brochure fully
explaining the procedure and side effects, and that they sign a
form agreeing to the necessary visits.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA ruled that mifepristone can be distributed only to
doctors trained to accurately diagnose duration of pregnancy and
detect ectopic, or tubal, pregnancies, because those women cannot
receive mifepristone.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the FDA restricted mifepristone's use to doctors who can
operate in case of bleeding or a surgical abortion is needed, or to
doctors who have made advance arrangements for a surgeon to be on
call for such care.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike with surgical abortions, mifepristone does not require
anesthesia. Planned Parenthood's Dr. Paul Blumenthal, who helped
test the drug, said most women take over-the-counter ibuprofen for
the pain, but some need a prescription-strength painkiller.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA also demanded that the Population Council, which owns
U.S. rights to the abortion pill, track any post-mifepristone
pregnancies in the United States to see if further safeguards are
needed.

<HEADLINE> Five Buildings Department employees, three others indicted  </HEADLINE>
By SAMUEL MAULL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Five high-ranking employees of the Department of
Buildings and three other people have been indicted on charges of
accepting bribes or gratuities to influence the performance of
their duties.
</P>
<P>
   The defendants, including the department's second
highest-ranking official, allegedly took cash, meals, wine,
vacation trips, and tickets to sports and theater events in
exchange for favors that included expedited or invalid approvals of
construction permits and plans.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors would not say who gave the city officials the bribes
and gifts, but Manhattan District Attorney Robert Morgenthau said
many of them have pleaded guilty and are cooperating with the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The probe was conducted by Morgenthau's office and the
Department of Investigations. Edward Kuriansky, DOI's commissioner,
called the buildings department ''the most corruption-prone agency
in the city.''
</P>
<P>
   ''This case represents the fourth major corruption scandal in
the New York City Buildings Department in the past decade alone,''
Kuriansky said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This two-year joint investigation has yielded disturbing
evidence of a pervasive culture of corruption within and without
the department and extends to licensed professionals and the
commissioner level,'' Kuriansky said.
</P>
<P>
   The highest-ranking defendant is Barry Cox, DOB's deputy
commissioner for operations and the agency's second highest-ranking
officer. He is accused of violating the law that requires him to
disclose certain gifts he receives.
</P>
<P>
   High-ranking city officials are required to tell DOI about all
gifts worth more than $50 that they receive from people who do
business with the city. They also must tell the city's Conflict of
Interest Board about any gift they receive that is valued at more
than $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   The six-count indictment charged Cox, 52, of Nutley, N.J., with
two felony counts of filing a false instrument and four misdemeanor
counts of receiving unlawful gratuities.
</P>
<P>
   Cox allegedly failed to report receipt of a family trip to
Florida, tickets to hockey games, and wine. It is not alleged that
he did anything in exchange for the gifts.
</P>
<P>
   Kuriansky said the Buildings Department has been the agency most
''stubbornly resistant'' to reform, and ''utterly undeterred by
repeated arrests, prosecutions and disciplinary proceedings.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Over 100 building inspectors (out of 250) have been arrested
in the past two years,'' Kuriansky said. ''Many others have been
disciplined.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the Buildings Department has to be completely
overhauled,'' Kuriansky said. He said the answer might be to have a
shake-up and put in ''a real manager'' and maybe remove some of the
agency's responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   The other four DOB employees are:
</P>
<P>
   James Leonard, 40, Belle Harbor, N.Y., the Queens Borough
commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Mineo, 58, Danbury, Conn., DOB's executive chief
inspector.
</P>
<P>
   Darral Hilton, 46, Queens, administrative chief inspector for
Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   Siegfried Wyner, 44, Rego Park, Queens; a DOB plans examiner.
</P>
<P>
   The other three indicted defendants are:
</P>
<P>
   Edmund Cunningham, 54, Long Beach, N.Y., retired chief of the
Bureau of Fire Prevention of the New York City Fire Department.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Yagasits, 49, Yonkers, N.Y., former Department of
Transportation employee.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Defronzo, 51, Voorheesville, N.Y., employee of the state
Canal Authority, which is a subsidiary of the state Thruway
Authority.

<HEADLINE> Ambassador to Turkey Cautions U.S.  </HEADLINE>
By SHANNON McCAFFREY
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The U.S. ambassador to Turkey cautioned
members of Congress Thursday that a resolution labeling the killing
of Armenians in Turkey as genocide could cause significant harm to
relations with a key military ally.
</P>
<P>
   Turkey is a NATO member and the United States uses the Incirlik
air base in southern Turkey to patrol the no-fly zone in northern
Iraq. There is concern that adoption of the resolution could
endanger American use of the base.
</P>
<P>
   ''There will be a strong Turkish reaction,'' Ambassador Robert
Pearson told the House International Relations Committee. ''This is
designed to make Turkish-American relations and the issues we are
trying to deal with more difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   The committee delayed a vote until next week.
</P>
<P>
   The nonbinding resolution would place the U.S. government on
record as confirming that 1.5 million Armenians were killed or
displaced between 1915 and 1923 at the hands of the Ottoman Empire
government.
</P>
<P>
   Armenians maintain their people were slaughtered as part of an
Ottoman campaign to force Armenians out of eastern Turkey. The
Turks deny they ever engaged in genocide. They acknowledge some
300,000 Armenians were killed, but say the deaths occurred as the
Ottoman Empire tried to quell civil unrest. The Ottoman Empire
became Turkey in 1923.
</P>
<P>
   ''Silence in the face of genocide, as we have learned, can only
embolden those who would again seek the systematic destruction of
an entire people,'' said Rep. George Radanovich, R-Calif., the
resolution's prime sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   In Turkey, Foreign Minister Ismail Cem described the committee
hearing as a ''tasteless development.'' ''Turkey is a strong
country, a strong society and we will do anything we can do to make
sure that a wrong decision will not be taken in a foreign
parliament,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. defense contractors, which either have deals or are
negotiating deals with Turkey, have been lobbying heavily against
the resolution.
</P>
<P>
   The Turkish government has hired a stable of high-powered
lobbyists. Former Reps. Bob Livingston, R-La., Gerald Solomon,
R-N.Y., and Steven Solarz, D-N.Y., are being paid $1.8 million to
make the Turkish case on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Armenian groups have hired former Rep. Susan Molinari, R-N.Y.,
to lobby for them.
</P>
<P>
   Some members of the committee expressed reservations about
angering the Turkish government for actions that occurred long ago
by a government no longer in power. Rep. Tom Lantos, D-Calif., the
only Holocaust survivor in Congress, said consequences of
deliberately insulting a NATO ally could be devastating.
</P>
<P>
   He proposed a more sweeping resolution that would recognize
human rights crimes of the 20th century. It would include the
killings of Armenians but would not single out Turkey as the
perpetrator.
</P>
<P>
   That was rejected by the committee chairman, Rep. Benjamin
Gilman, R-N.Y.,
</P>
<P>
   Other lawmakers said Congress has a moral obligation to do
something.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is genocide denial in Turkey. That is what this is all
about,'' said Rep. Edward Royce, R-Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The resolution is H.Res. 596.

<HEADLINE> Ambassador issues harsh warning on genocide resolution  </HEADLINE>
By SHANNON McCAFFREY
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) - The U.S. ambassador to Turkey warned lawmakers
Thursday that approving a resolution recognizing the killing of
Armenians in Turkey as a genocide could cause significant harm to
relations with a key military ally.
</P>
<P>
   Turkey is a NATO member and the United States uses the Incirlik
air base in southern Turkey to patrol the no-fly zone in northern

endanger American use of the base.
</P>
<P>
   ''There will be a strong Turkish reaction,'' Ambassador Robert

This is designed to make Turkish-American relations and the issues
we are trying to deal with more difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   The resolution before the Committee on International Relations
is nonbinding but would place the U.S. government on record as
confirming that 1.5 million Armenians were killed or displaced
between 1915 and 1923 at the hands of the Ottoman Empire
government.
</P>
<P>
   The committee postponed a vote until next week.
</P>
<P>
   Armenians maintain their people were slaughtered as part of an
Ottoman campaign to force Armenians out of eastern Turkey. The
Turks deny they ever engaged in genocide. They acknowledge some
300,000 Armenians were killed, but say the deaths occurred as the
Ottoman Empire tried to quell civil unrest. The Ottoman Empire
became Turkey in 1923.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the scenes, it's a battle between New Yorkers.
</P>
<P>
   Former New York Reps. Gerald Solomon, a Republican, and Steve
Solarz, Democrat, are being paid $1.1 million to lobby for the
Turkish government against the genocide resolution. And former Rep.
Susan Molinari signed on this week to work for pro-Armenian
activists.
</P>
<P>
   Solomon, whose firm is being paid $700,000, said it is wrong for
the American government to insult Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   ''When we were getting our butts shot off in Korea the Turks
were right there on the front lines with us,'' Solomon said. ''They
have been one of our strongest allies.''
</P>
<P>
   But others said the killing of Armenians needed to be addressed.
</P>
<P>
   ''Silence in the face of genocide, as we have learned, can only
embolden those who would again seek the systematic destruction of
an entire people,'' said Rep. George Radanovich, R-Calif. and the
resolution's prime sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   Radanovich dropped one controversial portion of the resolution
that would have mandated the Clinton administration provide
training on the Armenian deaths for executive branch employees.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem described the
committee hearing as a ''tasteless development.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Turkey is a strong country, a strong society and we will do
anything we can do to make sure that a wrong decision will not be
taken in a foreign parliament,'' Cem said.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration opposes the resolution. U.S. defense
contractors, who either have deals or are negotiating deals with
Turkey, have been lobbying heavily against the resolution.
</P>
<P>
   Some lawmakers on the committee expressed reservations about
angering such a powerful ally for actions that occurred long ago by
a government no longer in power. Others pointed out that other
atrocities, such as slavery and the mistreatment of American
Indians, have not been the subject of critical resolutions in
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Notable among the critics was Rep. Tom Lantos, the only
Holocaust survivor in Congress. Lantos, D-Calif., said the
consequences of deliberately insulting a NATO ally could be
''devastating.''
</P>
<P>
   He proposed a more sweeping resolution that would recognize
human rights crimes of the 20th century. It would include the
killings of Armenians but would not single out Turkey as the
perpetrator. That was rejected by committee Chairman Benjamin

<HEADLINE> Wife of Prisoner Pleads With Russia  </HEADLINE>
By CLAUDE R. MARX
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The tearful wife of an American businessman
imprisoned in Moscow on spying charges on Thursday pleaded for the
Russian government to allow her husband to be tested to see if his
cancer has returned.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have a lot of faith that we are going to get him home
eventually but realistically he needs a doctor now, or yesterday.
He needs medical testing. My fear ratio is sky high,'' said Cheryl
Pope of her husband Edmond, who has been imprisoned since April.
</P>
<P>
   She said she had not spoken to her husband since she visited him
in August but fears for his health because the Russians have denied
him medical treatment. She said she wants the Russian government to
give her husband access to advanced X-ray equipment so physicians
can determine if his bone cancer, which is in remission, has
returned.
</P>
<P>
   Edmond Pope, 54, has been held in Moscow's Lefortovo prison
since April 5, when Russia's Federal Security Service arrested him
and said he had illegally bought plans for a high-speed torpedo. On
Wednesday, Russian prosecutors said they have officially charged
him with spying, clearing the way for a trial expected to begin
next month. Pope, who lives in State College, Pa., faces 20 years
in prison if convicted.
</P>
<P>
   Cheryl Pope said her husband looked ''terrible'' when she saw
him on CNN earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was pale and had lost weight and looked like he did when he
originally had the bone cancer, that is why I am concerned,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Peterson, R-Pa., who represents Pope's district, wrote
President Clinton on Thursday urging Clinton to encourage Russian
President Vladimir Putin to give Pope access to medical care.
Peterson said Marconi PLC, a London-based high technology firm
which has a manufacturing plant in Pennsylvania, has offered to pay
for the medical tests.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian Embassy in Washington did not return phone calls
seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   Undersecretary of State Thomas Pickering met with Peterson and
Cheryl Pope on Thursday and said the administration was working
hard to free Edmund Pope.
</P>
<P>
   Peterson said Pickering told them that the administration is
''developing a game plan to keep the pressure on Russia.'
</P>
<P>
   Peterson has introduced a nonbinding resolution urging the
Clinton administration to cut all aid to Russia if Pope is not
released. The House International Relations Committee had been
scheduled to discuss the measure on Thursday but postponed it until
next week because it did not complete other business.
</P>
<P>
   Pope, a retired naval intelligence officer, runs CERF
Technologies International, a consulting firm in State College,
Pa., that developed commercial contacts with Russian organizations.

<HEADLINE> Play Proves Everyone Has a Story  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL KUCHWARA
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Only 15 minutes of fame? Not at off-Broadway's
Jane Street Theatre.
</P>
<P>
   The ''onstage guests'' in ''Lifegame'' get nearly two hours'
worth of celebrity, proving that sometimes theater has it all over
real life.
</P>
<P>
   That's because everyone has a story to tell, or so say members
of the Improbable Theatre, a British troupe that improvises on its
guests' lives with surprising, often very funny results. The trick
is in the telling, which these ingratiating performers do with
zest, wit and even compassion for their source material.
</P>
<P>
   ''Lifegame'' is a genial show, not mean-spirited or competitive
like those so-called reality shows on television, ''Survivor'' and
''Big Brother.'' It isn't judgmental about its subject's
peculiarities. In fact, ''Lifegame'' revels in them.
</P>
<P>
   The subjects -- who are not members of the audience -- are
preselected and are willing participants in these theatrical
biographies. Most have found their way to ''Lifegame'' through
advertisements for the show, word-of-mouth or through its Web site
(http://www.lifegamenyc.com).
</P>
<P>
   On the night caught by this critic, the star was a Brooklyn
housewife named Nancy Rosenthal, who described herself as ''a
stay-at-home mom.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosenthal was ''interviewed'' by Lee Simpson, the Improbable's
co-artistic director. Simpson, a cross between David Frost and
Barbara Walters (but with less hair), dug skillfully into his
subject's life. He displayed a deftness that made the questioning
sound casual, even though it was part psychiatric probing and part
gossipy intrusion.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenthal selected performer Angela Clerkin to play her. The
others -- Stella Duffy, Niall Ashdown, Phelim McDermott and musician
Toby Park -- sat on the sidelines and listened closely as Rosenthal
spun her story. They portrayed the other characters in her life.
</P>
<P>
   Good improvisation needs structure, a framework in which the
performers can be as freewheeling as possible. Simpson provided
that framework. He took his subject down an obvious chronological
path -- childhood, grade school, relationship with best friend,
first date and, in the show's second half, meeting, bedding and
then wedding her future husband.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenthal talked of dinner times with her dysfunctional family:
a loud, overbearing father; an acquiescent, yet glamorous mother; a
combative older brother. Immediately, several chairs and a table
were produced, and the actors acted out what happened during a
meal. Ashdown gloriously personified the macho head of the
household, fine-tuning his obscenity-laced bellowing after
suggestions from Rosenthal.
</P>
<P>
   The evening's show-stopping moments were provided by the subject
herself. One occurred in the first act, when Rosenthal was
encouraged to reminisce about two nuns who taught her in grade
school. Some lessons are not forgotten -- particularly one that
Rosenthal repeated to wild applause. In a hilarious parochial
school memory, she sang a laundry list of prepositions -- above,
around, about, in, out, etc. -- that turned into the grammatical
equivalent of ''Rose's Turn'' from ''Gypsy.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the evening was over, Rosenthal revealed her dream job
would be a talk show host. Of course, it's the perfect profession
for her. The woman has remarkable poise. She held her own with the
professional performers, even when she joined them in an imaginary
talk show centered on her.
</P>
<P>
   There is an element of risk in ''Lifegame.'' Who knows if
another ''guest'' will be as right-on as Nancy Rosenthal? Still,
you are advised to take a chance on ''Lifegame.'' Ordinary folk
have never seemed like so much fun.

<HEADLINE> Abortion Pill May Face Competition  </HEADLINE>
By PHIL GALEWITZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   Despite years of anticipation, don't expect overwhelming demand
for the abortion pill RU-486, say doctors and women's health
advocates.
</P>
<P>
   Surgical abortion will remain the predominant method of
terminating a pregnancy because it can be done in a day rather than
the two to three days for RU-486, which won U.S. approval Thursday.
Other factors that may block acceptance of the pill is that only a
limited number of doctors will prescribe it and women may hesitate
to take it once they learn about the pain and discomfort it causes,
doctors say.
</P>
<P>
   ''Most people think you take the pill and the pregnancy is gone,
and nothing else is involved,'' said Dr. Deborah Oyer, a family
doctor with Aurora Medical Services in Seattle who was involved in
the clinical trials of RU-486. ''Women who have gone through a
spontaneous miscarriage know it does not feel good.''
</P>
<P>
   The pill-induced abortion can be painful, causing bleeding and
nausea for days. Heavy bleeding is a potentially serious but rare
side effect.
</P>
<P>
   RU-486 can be used only within 49 days of the beginning of the
woman's last menstrual period. The woman takes three mifepristone
pills. Two days later, she returns to the doctor to swallow a
second drug, misoprostol, that causes uterine contractions to expel
the embryo. She returns for a follow-up visit within two weeks to
make sure the abortion is complete.
</P>
<P>
   Oyer said she expect only about 10 percent of the 1.3 million
annual abortions in the United States to be done with the pill,
which will become available for American women in about a month.
</P>
<P>
   Danco Laboratories LLC, a small, privately owned New York based
company that was formed in the late 1990s for the sole purpose of
introducing the abortion pill, will sell RU-486 in the United
States under the brand name Mifeprex. Danco has revealed little
about its business strategies, though it's expected to soon launch
a massive consumer advertising campaign about the drug.
</P>
<P>
   Backers of the drug say they expect critics to try to scare
women, by focusing on the possibility of heavy bleeding after
taking the pills. But they say that such bleeding is rare.
</P>
<P>
   ''Is if safe? Yes! Up to 49 days, the safety margin is
wonderful,'' said Dr. Richard Hausknecht, medical director for
Danco. ''This is a very, very safe drug,'' Hausknecht said. ''The
FDA would not have approved it if they didn't think so.''
</P>
<P>
   After a decade of use in France, about 40 percent of abortions
in the country are completed with RU-486. But doctors involved in
the drug's clinical trials in the U.S. say demand will be less
among U.S. women.
</P>
<P>
   RU-486 was more popular in Europe because abortions are
generally not done there until at least eight weeks into the
pregancy-- and thus the pill gave women the chance to abort their
pregnancy earlier. In contrast in the United States, doctors
routinely perform abortions as early as five weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Gloria Feldt, president of Planned Parenthood Federation of
America, estimated about 20 percent to 30 percent of women seeking
abortions will use the pill. ''The process will be less prolonged
with the surgical procedure,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Women's access to the pill will be determined largely by how
many doctors choose to prescribe it. Many doctors are unwilling to
prescribe RU-486 because of the risk of possible harassment from
anti-abortion advocates.
</P>
<P>
   About one-third of family physicians and gynecologists who don't
currently provide elective surgical abortions said they would
consider prescribing RU-486, according to a recent survey of 767
physicians by the Kaiser Family Foundation.

<HEADLINE> Hoboken, Oakland developments deemed state's best, worst  </HEADLINE>
By KATHLEEN CANNON
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - A New Jersey environmental group has
weighed in on the state's best and worst development projects.
</P>
<P>
   The Metuchen Square development in Hoboken combines all the best
elements of planning - mixed housing and retail uses, green spaces,
and access to public transportation, according to the New Jersey
Sierra Club.
</P>
<P>
   The Ramapo River Reserve development in Oakland, Bergen County,
on the other hand, damaged area mountains, pollutes local water
supply and opens up a previously pristine environment to more
sprawl, according to the club.
</P>
<P>
   The club reviewed more than 50 development projects in the state
before narrowing the list for inclusion in the ''Smart Choices or
Sprawling Growth'' 50-state survey.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Tittel, director of the New Jersey Sierra Club, said the
report is aimed at raising awareness about and ultimately stemming
suburban sprawl. It is also designed to applaud developers who do
it right, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Right now, New Jersey is seeing its largest building boom in a
generation,'' he said. ''We're losing 50,000 acres of year to
development and that's having consequences on water quality ... and
air quality.''
</P>
<P>
   Sierra staffers used about 30 criteria to judge which were the
best and worst among the state's largest developments.
</P>
<P>
   The 450-unit Oakland development topped the worst offenders,
according to Tittel.
</P>
<P>
   ''In exchange for a few luxury homes in an isolated and
car-dependent community, the developers destroyed greenways, turned
trout streams into steel pipes, carved away parts of the Ramapo
Mountains and caused other severe environmental damage,'' according
to the report.
</P>
<P>
   But the president of the development company that built Ramapo
River Reserve disputed the Sierra Club's characterization.
</P>
<P>
   Baker Residential president Marc Baker said the report failed to
note that the 400 houses are clustered to preserve 200 contiguous
acres of the total 300-acre parcel as open space, and that builders
abided by state environmental regulations to protect the Ramapo
River.
</P>
<P>
   ''They say we've been hostile to wildlife, and we erected 300
birdhouses on the property,'' he said. ''We have tried to be as
friendly to the environment as we can because environmentally
friendly features add value to a project.''
</P>
<P>
   No one from the Hoboken project could be reached for comment by
The Associated Press on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Tittel said Metuchen Square is a model of how to redevelop an
urban, waterfront parcel to make it attractive enough to entice
residents and businesses away from open space-destroying
subdivisions or office parks in the suburbs.

<HEADLINE> Brooklyn judge agrees to release mob turncoat  </HEADLINE>
By TOM HAYS
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - The Brooklyn kid started out the old-school way,
shining shoes in a mob social club.
</P>
<P>
   By his own account, he soon began stealing to please wiseguys.
Then running card games. Then killing, and killing again.
</P>
<P>
   ''The movie ''Goodfellas'' explains it well,'' recalled mob
turncoat Carmine Sessa. ''Everybody gets killed by a bunch of
animals or so-called 'friends.' ... This thing I thought I
respected as a young man has no respect.''
</P>
<P>
   Sessa offered his somber insights in Brooklyn federal court
Thursday before a judge released him from jail.
</P>
<P>
   ''All the families hate each other, and within the families they
hate one another,'' said Sessa, who rose to consigliere, or
third-in-command, of the Colombo organized crime family at a time
the family was torn by a bloody civil war.
</P>
<P>
   Sessa, 49, pleaded guilty in 1993 to being part of a murderous
Bensonhurst-based crew which operated out of the Wimpy Boys Social
Club. He admitted he was the triggerman in the slayings of three
men and one woman in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to avoid a life sentence, Sessa also became one of the
highest ranking cooperators in the government's war on La Cosa
Nostra. At his long-delayed sentencing Thursday, prosecutors said
he deserved credit for having the courage to testify against
reputed members of the Colombo and Genovese families in eight
federal trials.
</P>
<P>
   ''His cooperation was extraordinary,'' prosecutor George
Stamboulidis told U.S. District Judge Jack B. Weinstein.
</P>
<P>
   Weinstein agreed, sentencing Sessa to time served - he has spent
much of the past seven years in federal custody - and five years
probation. He is expected to go free in 30 days.
</P>
<P>
   Before he was sentenced, Sessa apologized to his ''victims and
their families, who still suffer their loss every day.''
</P>
<P>
   The mobster claimed that he now looks back on his career with
shame and sorrow.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wound up growing up and around a life that was and is a
disease,'' he said, reading from a handwritten statement.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hate everything about the life I led, and I hope that it
ends soon, because it keeps destroying families and kids who are
infatuated with it and can't wait to be 'goodfellas''' he added.
''I wish I could tell them what it really is.''

<HEADLINE> Driver pleads guilty in hit-and-run accident that killed lawyer  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) - A hit-and-run driver who said he was high
on heroin when he fatally struck an attorney in August has pleaded
guilty to felony charges.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Hopkins, 46, of Buffalo told Erie County Judge Michael
D'Amico Wednesday that he knew he hit something Aug. 15, but was
under the influence of drugs at the time. He said he ''should have
known'' it was a person.
</P>
<P>
   Nino Sciolino, 79, died of head injuries after being struck
while getting out of his parked car about 10:30 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Hopkins was arrested the next day after eyewitnesses reported
part of the license plate number of Hopkins' fleeing car.
</P>
<P>
   During what was to be a routine pretrial court session, Hopkins
pleaded guilty to single counts of felony leaving the scene of a
fatal accident and drug and hypodermic needle possession charges.
</P>
<P>
   Court officials said Hopkins' criminal record contains at least
29 earlier misdemeanor and felony arrests since the early 1970s in
his native Orleans County.

<HEADLINE> RU-486 Approval Sparks Fresh Debate  </HEADLINE>
By REBECCA SINDERBRAND
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government's approval of an abortion pill
reignited a long, fiery debate that has been aired frequently in
the halls of Congress, outside the Supreme Court and across the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents say RU-486, which has been used by millions of
European women since it was approved nearly a decade ago, could
fundamentally alter the abortion debate by making the procedure
less difficult and more private.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-abortion advocates, who have fought hard to keep the drug
out of the United States since it first appeared in France, said
the fight was far from over.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton hailed the decision, saying the administration
''treated that issue as purely one of science and medicine.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I think that they (FDA) have bent over backward to do a lot of
serious inquiries,'' he said, ''but FDA is basically doing its
job.''
</P>
<P>
   The volatile issue has been pervasive in the national policy
debates, particularly since the Supreme Court ruled it
constitutional in 1973. The issue often surfaces in Congress as
anti-abortion lawmakers seek to place abortion restrictions on
appropriations bills.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, much of the congressional Republican leadership,
including House Majority Whip Rep. Tom DeLay and House Majority
Leader Dick Armey, both Texans, blamed the administration for the
drug's approval.
</P>
<P>
   ''Bill Clinton got the legacy he was looking for,'' said House
Republican Conference chairman Rep. J.C. Watts, R-Okla.
</P>
<P>
   ''The FDA's approval of RU-486 appears to be motivated by
election-year politics rather than a thorough review of the
facts,'' said Sen. Sam Brownback, R-Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats praised the FDA's decision, calling it a step forward
in women's reproductive medicine, and aimed their rhetorical fire
at GOP lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn., called the decision a ''true victory
of medicine over politics.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The anti-choice lawmakers sought to tell the scientists and
researchers at the FDA what was best for the health of the American
public,'' she said. ''But this year they did not succeed.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Tim Hutchinson, R-Ark., said: ''It is highly offensive
that the Clinton Administration accelerated the drug approval
process for RU-486 ... This process has been tainted by politics in
an unprecedented manner.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., pushed futilely to block FDA approval
of RU-486 in 1998 and 1999. He vowed to introduce legislation that
would require physicians who prescribe the drug, also called
mifepristone, to be trained and licensed in surgical abortion,
among other procedures.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am appalled that the FDA appears to have bowed to the
political pressure from the abortion lobby and White House and
approved the drug with inadequate patient protections,'' Coburn
said.
</P>
<P>
   Said Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y.: ''This is a victory for
science, the pro-choice movement, and for women in this country. My
only regret is that politics delayed the importation of this drug
for far too long.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Lynn Woolsey, D-Calif., said that making RU-486 available
for women and doctors ''will offer women in the United States a
safe alternative to a surgical abortion.'' She added that her first
act eight years ago as a newly-elected congresswoman had been to
sign a letter to the Food and Drug Administration urging the drug's
approval.
</P>
<P>
   Some pro-choice groups sounded a less than laudatory tone,
however, saying the effect of the ruling was being overstated.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is not a magic pill'' that will lessen abortion
restrictions already in place or prevent new ones, said Janet
Benshoof, president of the Center for Reproductive Law and Policy.
</P>
<P>
   That sentiment was echoed by anti-abortion advocates. ''A new
administration, I am certain... will reverse this Clinton-Gore
decision,'' Watts said.

<HEADLINE> Maximum Age at Death Trending Higher  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL RECER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In the 1860s, the oldest person to die each
year in Sweden was about 100. Last year, that age had risen to 108.
Researchers are finding this trend in all industrialized countries
and say the very old may get even older.
</P>
<P>
   Plotting the increasing maximum age of death among the Swedes,
says researcher John R. Wilmoth, suggests the life span of humans
is expanding and that there is no clear upper limit.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't expect modern medical breakthroughs that will allow
people to live to 200 or something,'' said Wilmoth, a researcher at
the University of California, Berkeley. ''But there is no evidence
that we are bumping up against some absolute limit yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilmoth is first author of a study appearing Friday in the
journal Science.
</P>
<P>
   He said the research shows a clear trend that the oldest at
death will die at a later and later age. It also supports other
studies that show more and more people are living to extreme ages.
</P>
<P>
   ''This means the 10 percent of the kids born today who live to
be the oldest will die at an older age than do the 10 percent that
was born 20 years ago,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Wilmoth said his study was the first to show that the maximum
age at death was being pushed back and that there is a clear
lengthening of the human life span.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce A. Carnes, a researcher at the Center on Aging in the
National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago, said
Wilmoth's finding of a trend in the maximum age of death is not
surprising.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are getting unprecedented numbers of people surviving into
extreme ages,'' said Carnes. ''We have more people living beyond 60
and 70 than ever before.''
</P>
<P>
   But Carnes said that measuring the maximum age at death of a
population has little to do with the life expectancy of most
people.
</P>
<P>
   ''These are exceptional people,'' said Carnes. ''These are
achievements in extreme longevity that really isn't anything that
the rest of us will reach.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Carnes said he expects eventually the longevity
record will be broken. A Frenchwoman, Jeanne Calment, died in 1997
at the oldest documented age of 122.45 years.
</P>
<P>
   In his research, Wilmoth and his colleagues used the Swedish
population records because they are known to be the most nearly
accurate in the world extending across so many years. Sweden began
a systematic recording of births and deaths in 1749.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sweden is a unique population laboratory,'' said Wilmoth.
''There is no other country in the world that has records of births
and deaths over that long a period of time.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the population trends recorded in Sweden generally apply
to countries in Western Europe and North America.
</P>
<P>
   Starting in the population records of 1861, Wilmoth and his team
plotted the age of the oldest person to die in Sweden that year and
in every year up through 1999.
</P>
<P>
   At first, the maximum age of death was about 100. That rose at
the rate of .44 years per decade until 1969, when suddenly the
trend spurted upward. From 1970 to 1999, said Wilmoth, the maximum
age of death advanced by 1.11 years per decade. The oldest person
to die in 1999 was 108.
</P>
<P>
   An analysis of that rapid rise in the trend, he said, shows it
was caused by an improvement in the survival of the old -- people in
their 70s and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   ''We now have a large number of centenarians and people who live
to extreme old age,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One reason is that medicine in recent years has substantially
improved the treatment of diseases of aging, said Wilmoth. But he
said the elderly alive today also are benefiting from the public
health improvements started 80 to 100 years ago. These included
such things as rat control, good food supply, clean water and
inoculations against disease.
</P>
<P>
   ''The elderly today were not as sick as children as those in
past generations,'' he said. ''Because they were not exposed to
disease when they were younger, they developed stronger bodies and
start the aging process at a higher base line.''

<HEADLINE> Cop-killer resentenced to life in prison  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DANIELSON, Conn. (AP) - Terry Johnson, convicted in the 1991
fatal shooting of a state trooper, was re-sentenced Thursday to
life in prison without chance of parole.
</P>
<P>
   The re-sentencing comes five months after the state Supreme
Court overturned Johnson's death sentence, ruling the state didn't
prove Johnson inflicted extreme physical pain or mental torture
when he fired upon Trooper Russell Bagshaw outside a North Windham
gun shop in June, 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Bagshaw was shot and killed while on routine patrol when he
interrupted an early morning burglary.
</P>
<P>
   The trial jury ruled that Johnson should be executed because
Bagshaw, 28, of Columbia, had been terrorized when he was ambushed.
The high court said Bagshaw died only a few seconds after being
shot and that there was no evidence Johnson tried to prolong his
suffering.
</P>
<P>
   Windham States Attorney Mark Solak, who had originally obtained
the death penalty for Johnson, said the court decision should drive
the state Legislature to change the law so that killing a police
officer automatically results in the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   ''With the increase in violence that police officers have
suffered, the law needs to be changed to protect the officers,''
Solak said.
</P>
<P>
   Bagshaw's widow, Carol spoke at the sentencing hearing, calling
Johnson a coward.
</P>
<P>
   ''The way you killed Russell was as cowardly as killing a
2-year-old in a sandbox,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She also called the Supreme Court's decision to overturn
Johnson's death sentence ''cowardly,'' but called on Johnson not to
waste his time in prison.
</P>
<P>
   ''I ask you to make the best of your second chance at life,and
be the person who would make his father proud,'' she said.

<P>
	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Gov. Christie Whitman heads West on Friday
seeking to strike some California gold for Republican U.S. Senate
candidate Bob Franks and to help four western Republicans raise
funds for their races.
</P>
<P>
   The governor is scheduled to be in Utah on Friday and Saturday
to attend fund-raising events for incumbent Gov. Mike Leavitt, who
is heavily favored to win re-election.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Whitman is scheduled to divide her day at California
fund-raisers for Franks and two other GOP candidates seeking
congressional seats there. On Tuesday she will be in Nevada to help
U.S. Senate candidate John Ensign.
</P>
<P>
   Franks is badly overmatched in the race for money by millionaire
Democrat Jon Corzine, who has spent more than $6 million just to
air TV commercials over the past four weeks.

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends Up 196 Nasdaq Adds 105  </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks shot higher Thursday, buoyed by rebounds
in technology and blue chip issues as Wall Street regained a
tentative footing amid uncertainty about corporate profits. But an
earnings warning from Apple Computer after the close of trading
threatened to send Wall Street back on its downward trek.
</P>
<P>
   Apple's stock tumbled nearly 44 percent in extended-hours
trading, and also brought other high-tech issues lower, making it
quite possible that Thursday's dramatic upturn would be
short-lived. The market already took a beating the first three
sessions this week on concerns about third-quarter profits.
</P>
<P>
   ''We should see a generally mixed market Friday and a downward
bias in tech stocks and the averages,'' said Dan Ascani, president
and research director at Global Market Strategists in Gainesville,
Ga. ''The earnings warning illustrates we're still not out of the
woods yet.''
</P>
<P>
   In the regular session, the Dow Jones industrial average closed
up 195.70 at 10,824.06, its highest close this week and the blue
chips' biggest advance since it rose 198.41 on May 15.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators also had big gains. The Nasdaq
composite index rose 122.02 to 3,778.32 and the Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 index was up 31.72 at 1,458.29.
</P>
<P>
   Apple rose $4.56 to $53.50 in regular trading, but after the
computer maker warned late Thursday that its quarterly profits
would be ''substantially below expectations,'' it dropped nearly 44
percent to $23.48 in after-hours trading.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks have been down for most of September on worries about
corporate profits -- in particular when high-profile technology
companies including Intel have warned of disappointing results.
Apple, also considered an indicator of the high-tech sector's
health, could have a similar effect on the market.
</P>
<P>
   The market's unease has been compounded by energy prices that
are at decade-high levels and a weak European currency -- factors
that many companies say will hurt their profits.
</P>
<P>
   In regular trading Thursday, the market advanced on a mix of
bargain-hunting and end-of-the-quarter trading.
</P>
<P>
   Investors appeared unfazed by a Commerce Department report
Thursday that showed the economy expanded at an annual rate of 5.6
percent between April and June, a faster rate than the 4.8 percent
growth in the first three months of 2000. The report also showed
inflation, which has been the primary concern of the Federal
Reserve as it raised interest rates over the past 15 months, was
moderating even as the economy surged.
</P>
<P>
   The market remained focused on corporate earnings. Procter &AMP;
Gamble jumped $5.13 to $67 after the consumer products maker said
it would meet Wall Street expectations for the third quarter. P&AMP;G
has suffered disappointing results in recent quarters.
</P>
<P>
   But profit-taking investors unloaded Safeway, trading it down
$3.75 to $50.38 after the grocery company reported profits in line
with analysts' estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Internet and telecom stocks also emerged from a slump.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco Systems was up $2 at $59.31 in the regular session,
despite a downgrade by a Sanford Bernstein analyst. It dropped
$1.25 in extended-hours trading.
</P>
<P>
   Lucent also moved higher, trading up $2.75 at $31.31, but
slipped 50 cents in the extended session.
</P>
<P>
   Web portal Yahoo! was up $5.31 at $95.69, gaining back nearly
half of its loss Wednesday, but then retreated 94 cents
after-hours.
</P>
<P>
   Financial services stocks moved higher as well. Citigroup
climbed $1.50 to $53.88, but gave back most of that gain in
after-hours trading, falling $1.13. Dain Rauscher, a regional
brokerage firm, rose $13 to $92.88 after announcing it was being
acquired by the Royal Bank of Canada in a $1.5 billion deal. It was
unchanged after-hours.
</P>
<P>
   ''You're getting some good boost of stocks that have been
bludgeoned as of late,'' said Charles White, portfolio manager at
Avatar Associates, said of the regular session. ''You may have a
little bit of bargain hunting going on ... and a little bit of
relief that we've gone one day maybe without a company announcing a
complete disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   Portfolio managers were also buying in advance of the end of the
third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a more than 2-to-1
margin on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 1.19
billion shares, ahead of the 1.16 billion in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was up 15.68 at 523.81.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 0.08 percent.
Germany's DAX index was up .27 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 dropped
0.08 percent, and France's CAC-40 fell 0.13 percent.

<HEADLINE> House Panel OKs Privacy Measure  </HEADLINE>
By MARCY GORDON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A privacy measure that would prohibit federal,
state and local government agencies from selling or displaying
Social Security numbers was quickly approved Thursday by the House
Ways and Means Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation still faces other obstacles, however, and its
prospects for congressional passage are cloudy as time runs out on
this year's session.
</P>
<P>
   Propelling the legislation is concern about identity theft, one
of the fastest-growing crimes in the United States, which
victimizes an estimated 750,000 people a year. The key is a Social
Security number, which experts say it is easier than ever to get,
usually by buying it on the Internet. Across the country, an army
of information brokers and private investigators are said to be
stealing personal financial data and selling it.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every day in America, con artists find ways to use those
numbers to steal identities -- turning Social Security cards into
credit cards for their illegal activity,'' Rep. E. Clay Shaw,
R-Fla., told reporters before the committee's voice vote approving
the bill.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, authored by Shaw and Rep. Gerald Kleczka, D-Wis.,
would bar governments at all levels from selling Social Security
numbers, displaying them to the public or using them in checks they
issue. Social Security numbers would not be able to appear on
driver's licenses (only a few states still use them there), vehicle
registrations or related records.
</P>
<P>
   Businesses also would be prohibited from buying or selling
Social Security numbers, but there are exceptions for credit
reporting agencies and for insurance companies buying numbers from
state motor vehicle departments for writing policies.
</P>
<P>
   Companies would not be allowed to deny service to consumers who
refuse to provide their Social Security number, and prisoners would
be barred from working in jobs in which they would have access to
people's numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Violators of the new rules could face criminal penalties of up
to five years in jail and fines of as much as $250,000.
</P>
<P>
   The Social Security number ''was never meant to be a national
identifier for the citizens of this country,'' Kleczka said.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the bill has cleared the Ways and Means Committee, it
also must be approved by the House Banking and Commerce committees
before reaching the House floor for a final vote. A narrower
measure related to identity theft using the Internet has been
attached to a government spending bill pending in the Senate.
Congress is rushing toward adjournment for the year, expected early
next month.
----
</P>
<P>
   The bill is H.R. 4857.

<HEADLINE> Number of New Yorkers uninsured drops, still above national average </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL GORMLEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - More New Yorkers have health insurance than
in 1997, mirroring a national trend, but the percentage of state
residents without coverage is still higher than the national level.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Census Bureau records released Thursday show that 16.4
percent of New Yorkers were without health insurance in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   More than a half-dozen states had a statistically better showing
and, nationally, a smaller percentage of the population is without
health insurance. By comparison, 15.5 percent of people nationwide
lacked coverage in 1999, a level that a government watchdog group
described as immoral during a booming national economy.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, New York was at about the same spot among states, with
17.5 percent of the population lacking insurance.
</P>
<P>
   The figures show New York's rate improved slightly from 1997-98,
but improved by nearly a full percentage point from 1998 to 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ''The rapidly declining number of uninsured people in New York
reflects the growing strength of the state's economy, as well as
Governor Pataki's aggressive efforts through Child Health Plus to
expand access to affordable, quality health care coverage,'' said
Pataki spokesman Joseph Conway.
</P>
<P>
   He said that 538,000 people have enrolled in the children's
health insurance plan.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not surprised there's this slight improvement in the
number of uninsured,'' said Blair Horner of the New York Public
Interest Research Group. He credited the economy for providing more
jobs with employer-provided insurance. But he also credited Pataki
with twice expanding state health care efforts begun under former
Democratic Gov. Mario Cuomo, while little was done federally.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's scandalous that in the United States 15 percent of the
people have no health insurance, and that doesn't even count those
inadequately insured,'' Horner said. ''It's the failure of the
Clinton administration to deliver on its promise in '92 and the
failure of the president and Congress to come up with a plan.''
</P>
<P>
   In New York state, Pataki two weeks ago expanded the state's
health insurance coverage to the self-employed and actors. The
measure amended the Health Care Reform Act 2000 by expanding its
Healthy NY program to include those who are employed in
nontraditional fields or on a project-by-project basis.
</P>
<P>
   The Healthy NY Program that begins Jan. 1 will provide
state-sponsored health insurance coverage for businesses with 50 or
fewer employees.
</P>
<P>
   Under the law, eligible uninsured workers may purchase the same
benefits available to small business employees.
</P>
<P>
   Comparison between states is difficult because of fluctuations
in population, according to the Census, which won't rank states'
performance.
</P>
<P>
   ''A critical factor that needs to be taken into account is that
New York is traditionally the nation's front door,'' Conway said.
''Our proportionately higher number of new immigrants inflates our
overall number of uninsured. But the fact of the matter is New York
is still far more aggressive than the rest of the nation when it
comes to expanding access to health care.''

<HEADLINE> Peru's Fujimori Arrives in D.C.  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE GEDDA
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP)-- As Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori arrived
for talks on easing his country's political crisis Thursday, the
State Department called for a ''peaceful, democratic and
constitutional transition of power'' in Peru.
</P>
<P>
   With rumors of a military coup rampant back home, Fujimori met
Thursday evening with Organization of American States Secretary
General Cesar Gaviria. The OAS has assumed a central role in
attempting to forge a consensus among Peru's political groups on
how to restore political stability in the South American nation.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts also were being made for Fujimori to meet with senior
State Department officials.
</P>
<P>
   Department spokesman Philip Reeker said the administration will
emphasize during the discussions ''our support for a peaceful,
democratic and constitutional transition of power, and for the
continuation of OAS dialogue that has been going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori was inaugurated for a third term just two months ago,
but political developments since then have weakened him to the
point where he plans to arrange for new elections next year, four
years ahead of schedule. He has said he will not be a candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Hours before Fujimori's 2 a.m. departure Thursday from Lima, an
opposition congressman who had defected to Fujimori's ranks,
charged that the army high command was pressuring lawmakers to
provoke a coup within 20 days.
</P>
<P>
   The congressman, Miguel Mendoza, warned that the army was
plotting to restore power to Fujimori's deposed spy chief,
Vladimiro Montesinos. The comment put Peruvians on edge just when
it appeared that the OAS-sponsored political dialogue was helping
to repair the country's damaged democracy.
</P>
<P>
   The purpose, Mendoza said, ''would be to promote disorder within
Congress and throughout the country to unleash generalized chaos
and carry out a coup d'etat within 20 days, which would allow the
return of ... Montesinos.''
</P>
<P>
   The army's information office dismissed the allegations of
Mendoza, as ''absolutely false.''
</P>
<P>
   Eduardo LaTorre, the OAS' permanent secretary in Peru, met with
Fujimori for nearly two hours in the government palace shortly
after the congressman's announcement. LaTorre downplayed the
congressman's charge, saying it had been mentioned in passing
during the meeting with Fujimori. LaTorre said Fujimori planned to
discuss with Gaviria ''the fortification of the democratic process
here in Peru.''
</P>
<P>
   A meeting between government and opposition representatives was
suspended soon after Mendoza made his allegation.
</P>
<P>
   Montesinos, who fled the country for Panama on Sunday amid a
corruption scandal, hand-picked the top commanders of the army, who
are believed to be loyal to him. Montesinos had been caught on
videotape apparently bribing an opposition congressman to defect to
Fujimori's ranks.
</P>
<P>
   At least 10 lawmakers from Fujimori's Peru 2000 political
alliance have abandoned the party since the scandal broke. As of
Wednesday, Fujimori's legislative bloc held only 54 seats in the
120-member Congress, eliminating the control he maintained during
the last eight years of his 10-year presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Congressman Moises Wolfenson, one of the lawmakers who quit Peru
2000 on Monday, said his decision was not influenced by any outside
forces. ''There was no type of pressure, as (Mendoza) has
alleged,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Health care workers' union officials convicted of embezzling funds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - A federal jury convicted the president of a
health care workers' union and his son Thursday of conspiring to
take $200,000 from the union's pension fund.
</P>
<P>
   The jury deliberated 12 hours over three days before returning a
verdict against Victor Garcia, 62, of New Hope, Pa., and his son
Victor Garcia Jr., 37, of Warren.
</P>
<P>
   The elder Garcia is former president of District 1199J, part of
the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees,
which represents about 10,000 health care workers in state nursing
homes and hospitals. Garcia Jr. was the union pension fund's
assistant executive director.
</P>
<P>
   The men were convicted of taking the $200,000 in kickbacks from
a contractor who performed $6 million of renovations at the pension
fund's Newark building between 1994-1997. The contractor also paid
for the repair of the elder Garcia's car, prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   The elder Garcia faces up to 11 years in prison and $750,000 in
fines for his convictions on charges of conspiracy and soliciting
and receiving kickbacks. The younger Garcia faces up to five years
in prison and a $250,000 fine for a conspiracy conviction.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Gluck, the attorney for Garcia Jr., said Thursday he may
appeal on issues that include the court's denial of holding two
separate trials for the men. He said jurors may have considered
Garcia Jr., who was acquitted on three other counts, guilty because
of his relationship to his father.
</P>
<P>
   ''The jury must have found that somehow he facilitated his
father taking money,'' Gluck said conviction.
</P>
<P>
   George Schneider, the elder Garcia's attorney, did not return a
message seeking comment Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Quotes About Abortion Pill Approval  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   Quotes about FDA approval of the RU486 pill.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   ''For the first time, American women who choose abortion will
have the option of taking a pill to end a very early pregnancy.
They will now have access to a method that has been used safely and
effectively by more than 500,000 women in Europe for over a
decade.'' -- Vicki Saporta, executive director, National Abortion
Federation.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   ''RU-486 is dangerous to women. Unlike medicine, which heals, it
has no purpose other than to kill a human life. After years of
research, there are still too many questions left unanswered. There
are no studies on the long-term affects on women and their future
pregnancies.''-- Wendy Wright, Dir. of Communications, Concerned
Women of America.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   ''President Clinton and Vice-President Gore Administration used
to say they wanted abortion to be 'rare,' but everything they've
done is to make abortion more common.''-- House Majority Leader Dick
Armey.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   ''Approving mifepristone goes a long way in providing real
reproductive health care choices for women. FDA did the right thing
by ensuring that good science and the health of women prevailed,
despite the enormous obstacles erected by opponents of choice.'' --
Marcia Greenberger, co-president, National Women's Law Center.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   ''This administration treated that issue as purely one of
science and medicine. I think that they (FDA) have bent over
backward to do a lot of serious inquiries .. but the FDA is
basically doing its job.'' -- President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   ''It is about time that American women have the same access as
millions of other women around the world to this safe, effective,
and private option for early abortion. Conditions of this approval
also safeguard the privacy of physicians who provide this important
service.'' -- Wayne C. Shields, president and CEO, Association of
Reproductive Health Professionals.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   ''The Clinton-Gore administration, which claimed it wanted to
make abortion rare, has embraced an abortion pill that will result
in more abortions and new risks to women.'' -- Laura Echevaria,
spokeswoman for the National Right to Life Committee (NRLC).
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   ''Bill Clinton got the legacy he was looking for. On his third
day in office, he issued an executive order to get the ball rolling
on the approval of the abortion pill. Nearly eight years later,
President Clinton got what he wanted, and the losers in his victory
are women and children across the country. This is a sad day for
America.'' -- J.C. Watts Jr. of Oklahoma, House Republican
Conference chairman.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   ''Mifepristone's approval is one of the most significant
advances in women's reproductive health that we have seen in
decades. Its approval today is yet another milestone on the long
road to women's reproductive freedom and equality in this
country.'' -- Kate Michelman, president of NARAL.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   ''The FDA's approval of RU-486 appears to be motivated by
election-year politics rather than a thorough review of the facts.
This administration seems to be seeking a political coup at the
expense of our nation's women and children.'' -- Sen. Sam Brownback,
R-Kan.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   ''This decision is unprecedented. Never before has the FDA
approved a drug intended to kill people. The FDA's mission is to
promote health, not facilitate the taking of life. Sadly, the FDA
has approved a drug that will kill an unborn child and put mothers
at grave risk.'' -- Rep. Tom Coburn, R-Okla.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   ''This decision will help ensure that women in the United States
will have access to a safe and effective option that women in other
countries have had for years.'' -- First lady and Democratic Senate
candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   ''It is highly offensive that the Clinton Administration
accelerated the drug approval process for RU-486, evn faster than
the average time for 'fast-tracked' drugs. Fast-track timetables
are supposed to be reserved for drugs that will combat
life-threatening diseases like cancer or AIDS. In this case, the
Administration rushed a drug through that will take lives instead
of saving them.'' -- Sen. Tim Hutchinson, R-Ark.

<HEADLINE> GOP Drug Import Proposal Denounced  </HEADLINE>
By JANELLE CARTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A proposal to allow wholesale drug
distributors to import American-made drugs sold cheaper abroad hit
a snag Thursday after one of its original authors denounced a
version written by House Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers and President Clinton earlier this week agreed to pass
a proposal to import American drugs. The agreement was an attempt
to pass a health proposal after both sides gridlocked on a
prescription drug benefit for seniors.
</P>
<P>
   But Thursday, Rep. Bernie Sanders, the independent Vermont
lawmaker who has lobbied hard for the plan, complained that the
version written by House Republican leaders ''will substantially
weaken this legislation and weaken our efforts to lower the costs
of prescription drugs through reimportation.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I fear the pharmaceutical industry played a role in crafting
some of these provisions,'' Sanders said.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. James Jeffords, the Vermont Republican who helped draft the
original Senate version, had not seen the new language as of
Thursday afternoon, said spokesman Joe Karpinski.
</P>
<P>
   But Karpinski said Jeffords ''would be concerned if that
language undermines the goal of reducing the cost of drugs for
Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for House Speaker Dennis Hastert said the language
was not final. The newly drafted version had merely been sent to
the White House for comment, said spokesman John Feehery.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have not closed out the language,'' Feehery said. ''We're
not trying to weaken this at all. We're just tying to ensure it
provides safety for American consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanders complained that under the rewritten version, the law
would expire after three years and the program would be terminated
upon discovery of a pattern or an attempted pattern or practice to
import counterfeit drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Such provisions will discourage businesses from even wanting to
participate, Sanders complained. The newly drafted version would
also require the imported drugs to carry country-of-origin labels.
</P>
<P>
   ''If there is some group, some place, trying to send into this
country a counterfeit drug, then the whole program is suspended,''
Sanders said. ''That just would seem to me a very difficult way to
do business ... to suddenly one day find the whole process has been
suspended.''
</P>
<P>
   ''This will be a major disincentive to any business,'' Sanders
said.

<HEADLINE> Peace Talks End Without Progress  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Another round of talks between Israeli and
Palestinian negotiators ended Thursday with no word of progress
toward a peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   A Palestinian official, Hassan Abdel Rahman, called the
sessions, held at a northern Virginia hotel, ''very useful.''
</P>
<P>
   Rahman, the Palestine Liberation Organization's chief
representative in Washington, said ''no proposals were made. This
was consultation and exploration of the positions of the parties.''
</P>
<P>
   He told The Associated Press the next step was up to the
American mediators.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department declined to say whether the sessions dealt
with the future of Jerusalem and other issues that must be resolved
to conclude a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesman Philip Reeker said he did not have ''any specific
information'' and that the talks would be resumed. He gave no date.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if U.S. mediator Dennis B. Ross had made any proposals to
bridge differences between the two sides, Reeker replied, ''No.''
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli delegation, headed by Foreign Minister Shlomo
Ben-Ami, flew home in mid-afternoon, in time for the beginning of
the Jewish New Year Friday evening.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinian delegation, headed by senior negotiator Saeb
Erekat, was due to depart Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department, meanwhile, criticized the House for voting
this week to cut off all except humanitarian aid to the
Palestinians if Yasser Arafat declares statehood.
</P>
<P>
   The measure virtually restated the policy of the Clinton
administration that statehood was an issue to be negotiated with
Israel, not decided unilaterally, and that most U.S. aid would be
cut off if Arafat acted on his own.
</P>
<P>
   But Reeker said ''while we try to take steps to help the parties
and not hamper their efforts, we think that legislation just
complicates the process.''
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak has offered the Palestinians a
state on virtually the entire West Bank and Gaza. Arafat is holding
out for east Jerusalem, which would be the Palestinians' capital.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of the legislation said they were trying to promote a
settlement, not place obstacles in its path.
</P>
<P>
   The measure is ''meant to send a very clear signal to Chairman
Arafat and the Palestinian Authority: Do not destroy the peace
process. Do not condemn the Middle East to another round of
violence and war by unilaterally declaring a Palestinian state,''
Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., a co-sponsor of the measure, said this
week.
</P>
<P>
   On another front, Reeker called on ''all sides'' to exercise
careful judgment and try to avoid tensions over a Jerusalem holy
site.
</P>
<P>
   The statement was a response to clashes between Palestinian
rock-throwers and Israeli police at the site known to Jews as the
Temple Mount and to Muslims as Haram as-Sharif, or Noble Sanctuary.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinian demonstrators broke out after Ariel Sharon,
leader of Israel's opposition Likud, toured the site.
</P>
<P>
   In another development, leaders of The American Jewish Committee
told Secretary of State Madeleine Albright they were distressed
that Ambassador Martin Indyk's security clearance had been
suspended.
</P>
<P>
   They said in a letter that admired his commitment to Middle East
peace, his professionalism, discretion and devotion to the
protection of America's national interest.
</P>
<P>
   Without a security clearance, the ambassador to Israel is unable
to participate in U.S. peace efforts. Albright praised Indyk's
contributions in testimony to Congress this week but said security
rules must be enforced.
</P>
<P>
   She and other State Department officials have not said what
alleged violations were under investigation, but they have ruled
out espionage.

<HEADLINE> Republicans say first lady's travel records contain errors  </HEADLINE>
By SHANNON McCAFFREY
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) - A House Republican charged Thursday that the
White House had provided his committee with erroneous information
on Hillary Rodham Clinton's travel on government aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. James Kolbe, R-Ariz., said a new report he received from
the White House late Wednesday contained 28 changes to flight
hours, five revisions to destinations and showed earlier expense
reports had failed to account for seven trips.
</P>
<P>
   Lissa Muscatine, a spokeswoman for the first lady, chalked up
the discrepancies to clerical errors ''which inevitably resulted
from trying to assemble a huge amount of data in an unreasonably
short time frame.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We reimbursed precisely as the law requires and if they don't
like the law they ought to change it,'' Muscatine said.
</P>
<P>
   But Kolbe, whose committee oversees White House spending, said
he has lost confidence that the information he is receiving is
accurate.
</P>
<P>
   ''The White House is providing my committee with incomplete,
inaccurate and sloppy data,'' Kolbe said.
</P>
<P>
   ''At best this is an example of bureaucratic incompetence. At
worst it's an attempt to cover up the true cost to taxpayers.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton flies on government aircraft on the request of the
Secret Service. She reimburses the government the same way
presidential candidates do: at the rate of a first-class commercial
ticket. That is well below the actual cost of her travel.
</P>
<P>
   The practice is legal but has been criticized by Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Kolbe estimates that the first lady's campaign travel during the
U.S. Senate race has cost taxpayers just over $1 million so far.
She has reimbursed a total of $203,700.
</P>
<P>
   Kolbe's committee held a hearing on the travel arrangements in
March and directed the White House to provide monthly expense
reports.
</P>
<P>
   He requested additional information earlier this month after
news reports noted that state Assemblyman Michael Bragman and his
family had traveled on the first lady's plane from Syracuse to
Washington Dec. 22.
</P>
<P>
   The earlier data provided to Kolbe did not include the Syracuse
stop and listed only one political passenger on the trip.
</P>
<P>
   The new report includes Syracuse in the itinerary and now
includes seven political passengers on the trip. The campaign must
reimburse taxpayers for political passengers on board the aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   The new information also showed that Clinton is not only flying
on C-20s, but on at least one occasion flew on a C-32, a larger
aircraft which is comparable in size to a commercial 757. On that
Nov. 4 trip she flew to California and Las Vegas accompanied only
by White House photographer and a trip coordinator. The cost of
operating that C-32 is even higher than the C-20, which costs
$3,705 per hour to fly. Kolbe estimates that West Coast trip at
$123,000. Clinton's campaign reimbursed $3,723.

<HEADLINE> Motorist admits he made false charges after vehicle stop caught on tape </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - An East Orange man has admitted he lied
when he filed formal charges that state troopers were abusive and
threatening during a motor vehicle stop.
</P>
<P>
   An internal affairs investigation used tape from the patrol
car's video camera as evidence against the motorist.
</P>
<P>
   Cameras were installed in State Police vehicles after reports
from motorists that troopers who targeted minority drivers were
sometimes abusive.
</P>
<P>
   Moses E. Cobb, 65, pleaded guilty to filing a false report,
state police Col. Carson Dunbar said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Municipal Court Judge Richard W. Krater sentenced Cobb to 30
days community service and a 60-day suspended jail sentence. Cobb
was also told the pay $555 in fines and court costs.
</P>
<P>
   Cobb first complained of the alleged abuse on May 10 of last
year in a letter to State Police supervisors, according to a
statement from Dunbar.
</P>
<P>
   A month earlier, he had been stopped on the New Jersey Turnpike
near Exit 9 for speeding by two troopers, Dunbar's statement said.
</P>
<P>
   Cobb complained that the troopers stopped him for no reason.
Cobb also said one officer approached him with his hand on his
weapon, leaned in the car and then spit on a female passenger,
according to Dunbar.
</P>
<P>
   The video tape did not back Cobb's statements, according to the
superintendent.
</P>
<P>
   Cameras are now installed in 785 cars assigned to the turnpike,
the Garden State Parkway and the Atlantic City Expressway.

<HEADLINE> US Plans $1.3B Arms Sale to Taiwan  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon said Thursday it plans a series
of arms sales to Taiwan valued at $1.3 billion, including 200
supersonic air-to-air missiles and advanced military communications
systems.
</P>
<P>
   China, which regards Taiwan as part of the motherland, strongly
opposes U.S. arms sales to the island. Under the Taiwan Relations
Act, the United States is committed to providing Taiwan with
defensive arms.
</P>
<P>
   Like most nations, the United States has diplomatic relations
with China and has promised Beijing that it will not have formal
ties with Taiwan, which split with the mainland amid the communist
revolution in 1949.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon said it plans to sell to Taiwan 200 AIM-120C medium
range air-to-air missiles to enhance the defensive capabilities of
Taiwan's F-16 fighters. Although Taiwan has previously requested to
buy this type of missile, this is the first time the Pentagon has
approved it. That portion of the deal is valued at $150 million.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has the authority to block any Pentagon arms sale,
although such action is rare.
</P>
<P>
   In written statements announcing each part of Thursday's arms
sale, the Pentagon said the additional weaponry in Taiwan would
''not affect the basic military balance in the region.'' China
argues that U.S. arms sales amount to interference in internal
Chinese affairs and could embolden Taiwan to seek independence.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon said it also would sell Taiwan a military
communications system, known as the Improved Mobile Subscriber
Equipment system, for $513 million. It will provide secure voice
and data communications service to all levels of Taiwan's field
military forces.
</P>
<P>
   A separate package, valued at $405 million, includes 146 of the
U.S.-made 155mm self-propelled howitzers, 79 M2 machine guns, 160
night vision goggles and other equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan also would get 71 Harpoon anti-ship missiles and related
equipment valued at $240 million.
</P>
<P>
   In June, the Pentagon announced arms sales to Taiwan valued at
$356 million.

<HEADLINE> Euro Drops After Denmark Referendum  </HEADLINE>
By MIRANDA S. LEITSINGER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The euro dropped slightly against most foreign
currencies Thursday as Danish voters decided not to adopt the
European single currency in a closely-contested referendum.
</P>
<P>
   With nearly 90 percent of the votes counted, 53 percent opposed
making the euro Denmark's currency, while 47 percent favored the
switch, according to the Interior Ministry.
</P>
<P>
   The euro dropped below the key technical level of 88 cents, but
was able to recover in late New York trading, quoted at 88.13
cents, down from 88.30 cents late Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The euro has come under a little bit of pressure as a result.
The market is selling the euro off modestly,'' said Ron Simpson,
senior currency analyst at MCM Currencywatch.
</P>
<P>
   The long-term economic impact of Denmark's decision not to join
the euro will not be significant, Simpson said, but could alter the
entry of Sweden and Britain, two other EU countries where voters
have also opted to retain their individual currencies.
</P>
<P>
   ''It may turn into a case where the EU may attract poorer
countries,'' Simpson said, citing the entry of Greece -- which was
initially barred from membership because of high inflation and a
budget deficit -- into the single currency next Jan. 1. ''We will
have to wait and see whether that translates into a weaker
currency.''
</P>
<P>
   The euro plunged to record lows, trading at 84.38 just over a
week ago, in a free fall sparked earlier this month by comments
from German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder.
</P>
<P>
   The European currency was propped up last Friday after the U.S.
Federal Reserve unexpectedly joined the European Central Bank and
the Bank of Japan to intervene in the currency market.
</P>
<P>
   Currency traders said that although the intervention has been
scaring them from trying to sell the euro too aggressively, they
will continue to test the market on the downside.
</P>
<P>
   ''If it goes below 87 cents we might see some concerted action
on behalf of the ECB,'' Simpson said, adding that the ECB may want
to intervene at current levels to show continued support for the
flagging currency.
</P>
<P>
   Currency traders will continue to judge the euro based on the
fundamentals of the region, Simpson said.
</P>
<P>
   In other trading, the dollar was quoted at 107.52 Japanese yen,
up from 107.29 yen.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar also was quoted at 1.7299 Swiss francs, up from
1.7253, and 1.5009 Canadian dollars, up from 1.4968. The British
pound rose to $1.4637 from $1.4620.
</P>
<P>
   Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate.
Based on Thursday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 2.2195 German
marks, up from 2.2153; 7.4431 French francs, up from 7.4301; and
2197.06 Italian lire, up from 2193.20.

<HEADLINE> Heating Oil Reserve Plan Stripped  </HEADLINE>
By ADAM GORLICK
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A plan to create a permanent emergency home
heating oil reserve for Northeast states suffered a blow Thursday
when it was stripped from a funding bill.
</P>
<P>
   The provision that was removed from the energy and water
projects bill also would have reauthorized the president's power to
withdraw oil from the 600 million-barrel national Strategic
Petroleum Reserve.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said last week he would tap the reserve to
drive down oil prices. Many Republicans, including presidential
candidate George W. Bush, opposed the move, saying the reserve only
should be tapped in a national emergency.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats said House Republicans were retaliating against
Clinton by stripping the provision.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Republicans in Congress are fiddling around while people
are about to freeze,'' said Rep. Michael Capuano, D-Mass. ''This
underscores the problem in the GOP leadership that they don't
understand the heating oil crisis. To throw this provision out is a
slap in the face to everyone from a state that relies on heating
oil.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Ron Packard, R-Calif., chairman of the House Appropriations
energy and water subcommittee, said the reserve provision was
removed because matters dealing with fossil fuels were the
jurisdiction of a different panel handling Interior Department
spending.
</P>
<P>
   And because Clinton has said he plans to establish a Northeast
reserve on his own, Republicans said it's unnecessary for Congress
to do it.
</P>
<P>
   ''This doesn't prevent anything from happening,'' said Melissa
Carlson, a Packard spokeswoman. ''There will still be a reserve in
the Northeast.''
</P>
<P>
   New England currently has five million barrels of oil available,
a 60 percent drop from last year's inventory. The provision called
for establishing a permanent reserve of two million gallons for New
England, New York and New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   The American Petroleum Institute, which opposes a reserve, says
it will further reduce supplies elsewhere, driving up prices.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has said he will use his authority set up a temporary
reserve. But supporters of the permanent reserve say that won't
ensure heating oil is quickly made available to the Northeast
because it would require a national emergency to be tapped.
</P>
<P>
   ''Current law says you can release reserve oil when you have an
energy supply disruption,'' White House spokesman Elliot Diringer
said. ''What we would like is a trigger that's better suited to a
regional supply shortage.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the permanent reserve say they will continue
pressing the issue in Congress. Another bill now in the Senate has
a Northeast reserve provision.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates for the poor say they want assurances a heating
reserve will be in place this winter.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need a reserve, and we need to know that people will have
oil to heat their homes,'' said Marcial Cuevas, executive director
of the Community Action Agency of New Haven, Conn.
------
</P>
<P>
   The bill number is H.R. 4733.

<HEADLINE> Senators Seek Cuba Trade Compromise  </HEADLINE>
By PHILIP BRASHER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP)-- Lawmakers are trying to close a deal to allow
food sales to Cuba under terms that would satisfy farm and business
groups without upsetting anti-Castro interests in Florida, a key
state in the presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   House leaders announced an agreement late Wednesday that would
bar both the federal government and U.S. banks from financing the
sales and also would prevent any easing of restrictions on travel
to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   But some senators said Thursday they would work to ease the
restrictive terms when House and Senate negotiators take up an
agricultural spending bill next week.
</P>
<P>
   ''There will be a compromise between the House and the Senate,''
said Sen. Thad Cochran, a Mississippi Republican who is chairman of
the Senate agricultural appropriations subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
   Farm and business groups favor Senate-passed legislation that
would permit financing from private sources. But anti-Castro
members of the House, led by Cuban-American Rep. Lincoln
Diaz-Balart, R-Fla., and House Republican Whip Tom DeLay of Texas,
have refused to budge.
</P>
<P>
   The Cuban-American community is an important voting bloc in
Florida, a toss-up state in the presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   ''Legislation that would be considered expansive would have
already been passed and signed into law had this not been an
election year,'' said John Kavulich, president of the U.S.-Cuba
Trade and Economic Council, a business-funded group.
</P>
<P>
   Republican presidential nominee George W. Bush has said he
opposes lifting sanctions. Democratic nominee Vice President Al
Gore has said he favors more contacts with Cubans ''without helping
the Castro government.''
</P>
<P>
   Kavulich's group estimates that the House agreement would result
in relatively modest sales, about $28 million to $45 million, in
the first year.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is essentially the same as an agreement that
Diaz-Balart reached with some farm-state House members in June
except that it clarifies that financing from non-U.S. sources would
be permitted.
</P>
<P>
   Direct sales of medicine to Cuba have been allowed since 1992
under restrictions similar to those that would be imposed on food
shipments under the House agreement: Cuba must pay cash for the
goods or else obtain credit from a third country.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba buys about $2 million worth of U.S. medicine and health
products annually.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Larry Craig, R-Idaho, said there was ''general consensus''
in the Senate to support the House deal.
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., said he would press for changes
when a House-Senate conference committee meets next week to work
out the final version of the agricultural spending bill.
</P>
<P>
   ''This really doesn't amount to very much,'' said Dorgan.
</P>
<P>
   But supporters of the deal predicted that it would result in
some significant sales of wheat, rice and other commodities because
Cuba will save so much on shipping costs by buying U.S. products.
</P>
<P>
   ''They want our product,'' said Barbara Spangler, who directs
trade policy for the U.S. wheat industry.

<HEADLINE> U.S.-Dutch Talks at White House  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton and Dutch Prime Minister Wim
Kok held a White House meeting Thursday on issues ranging from the
elections in Serbia to the illicit import of the drug ecstasy into
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ''The president indicated that for a relatively small country
the Netherlands has a tremendous footprint in terms of its impact
within NATO and around the world,'' said P.J. Crowley, spokesman
for the National Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   First in the Oval Office, then over lunch in the White House,
the two leaders discussed an array of issues, problems and sources
of concern around the globe.
</P>
<P>
   Both agreed that the opposition political party in Yugoslavia
was the clear victor in this week's elections and that it is time
for Serbian president Slobodan Milosevic to concede defeat and step
aside, Crowley said.
</P>
<P>
   International sanctions against Serbia will be lifted once a
democratically elected government is in place, Kok and Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Netherlands will take its turn as president of the United
Nations Security Council in November and Kok told Clinton that he
wishes to focus on Africa, including the situation in Sierra Leone,
Ethiopia and Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
   Describing the discussions, Crowley said the two leaders agreed
it would be best that lingering trade disputes with the European
Union be settled before they poison relations with the EU.
</P>
<P>
   And Crowley said Kok and Clinton also noted that 60 percent to
80 percent of the illegal drug ecstasy reaching the United States
originates in the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   The two said the issue would be discussed further in November at
a conference between representatives of the two country's Justice
ministries.

<HEADLINE> Canada TV: Former PM Trudeau Dies  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL (AP) -- Former Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau, a
flamboyant and charismatic political giant who led the country
through some of its most tumultuous events, died Thursday. He was
80.
</P>
<P>
   Trudeau died of prostate cancer, said Roy Heenan, senior partner
of the Montreal law firm Heenan Blaikie, where Trudeau worked.
</P>
<P>
   He said the Trudeau's health had been declining ''very
steadily'' in the last few days. Trudeau's sons Justin and Sacha
Trudeau also confirmed their father's death.
</P>
<P>
   Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien praised Trudeau as a force
for change that continues to ''shape the soul of his people.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Trudeau ''dreamed of a society that afforded all of its
citizens an equal opportunity to succeed in life.''
</P>
<P>
   Heenan described Trudeau as ''a great man, not only in his
public life but from our point view, from his private life as
well.''
</P>
<P>
   Trudeau was hospitalized for 10 days with pneumonia at the
beginning of the year, and associates say he never fully regained
his strength. He also was believed to be suffering from Parkinson's
disease.
</P>
<P>
   During 16 years as prime minister, briefly interrupted by a 1979
election defeat, Trudeau seemed to personify the dynamic political
and social changes in North America with a sophisticated, sometimes
irreverent style that fascinated and captivated his country.
</P>
<P>
   Cosmopolitan and witty with a flair for celebrity, he
represented a sharp departure from the generally dry, provincial
politicians of Canada's past.
</P>
<P>
   So strong was his personality and influence, Trudeau was chosen
Canada's newsmaker of the century in a Canadian Press-Broadcast
News poll of editors and broadcasters in December 1999.
</P>
<P>
   In typical Trudeau style, he described himself as ''surprised
and quite pleased'' at learning of the honor, but refused to be
swayed from his personal desire for privacy in his post-political
life.
</P>
<P>
   A sharp, energetic figure, he wore sandals to Parliament, dated
celebrities such as Barbra Streisand and actress Margo Kidder,
flashed an obscene hand signal to protesters and once did a
pirouette behind the back of Britain's Queen Elizabeth.
</P>
<P>
   Politically, Trudeau came to prominence at the height of the 60s
revolution and his policies reflected changing attitudes. As
justice minister in 1967, he liberalized laws on abortion and
homosexuality, then continued to introduce new direction upon
becoming Canada's 15th prime minister a year later.
</P>
<P>
   A Montreal native, he made French an official language with
English, promoted the metric system, led the fight against Quebec
separatists, and in what was his most profound legacy, enshrined
the Charter of Rights in a new Canadian Constitution in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   He married Margaret Sinclair, a ''flower child'' half his age,
in 1971 and they had three sons before their 1977 separation and
eventual divorce, which received the kind of media attention
normally given film stars.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by two adult sons. His grief over the death of
his youngest son, Michel, in an avalanche in 1998 at age 23, was
considered a factor in his hospitalization for pneumonia during the
new millennium celebrations.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Trudeau's celebrity, the changes he inspired brought
inevitable opposition from some segments of Canadian society. The
Quebec separatist movement gained strength in battling Trudeau's
efforts toward federalism, and the Western-based Reform Party was
created in part from lingering resentment in oil-rich Alberta over
the National Energy Program imposed by the Trudeau government in
1980 that increased federal control over energy resources.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he decided to resign -- while taking ''a walk in the
snow'' on Feb. 29, 1984 -- Trudeau's popularity had dissipated,
leading to a decline in the Liberal Party and rise in the
successive Conservative Party governments.
</P>
<P>
   Born Oct. 18, 1919, into a wealthy Montreal family, Trudeau was
the middle of three children, educated at a Jesuit school.
</P>
<P>
   He graduated with honors in law from the University of Montreal
in 1943 and joined the bar the next year. He received a master's
degree in political economy from Harvard in 1945.
</P>
<P>
   He studied in Paris and at the London School of Economics, then
traveled the world before returning to Canada to work on civil
liberties cases, write for a left-wing journal and manage his
father's estate.
</P>
<P>
   Trudeau become a professor of constitutional law at the
University of Montreal in 1961, and his leftist writings and
association with Quebec intellectuals positioned him for entry into
federal politics.
</P>
<P>
   He won election to Parliament in 1965 from Montreal, and became
justice minister two years later, positioning him to assume the
Liberal Party leadership in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   As he pushed through bills that made divorce easier and relaxed
laws on abortion and homosexuality -- unpopular positions in mostly
Catholic Quebec -- Trudeau came up with one of his most famous
phrases: ''The state has no place in the bedrooms of the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   He became prime minister on April 20, 1968, succeeding the
retired Lester Pearson, and immediately dissolved Parliament to
call an election that showed his wide personal popularity.
</P>
<P>
   Huge crowds gathered at his rallies and women pushed to kiss the
trendy new leader. When Quebec separatist protesters hurled bottles
at the stage at a Montreal rally, Trudeau refused to take cover,
further enhancing his swaggering reputation.
</P>
<P>
   In 1970 he became the first prime minister to invoke the War
Measures Act at home, sending troops into Montreal and Ottawa after
Quebec liberation movement cells kidnapped British Trade
Commissioner James Cross and Quebec Labor Minister Pierre Laporte.
</P>
<P>
   Cross was released, but Laporte was found dead. Trudeau was
criticized for widespread detentions of alleged separatists during
the so-called October crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Forced to form a minority government after the 1972 election,
Trudeau's Liberals regained majority control in another vote in
1974. But in 1979, voters put the Conservatives in power and
Trudeau was relegated to opposition leader. Seemingly dispirited,
he said he would resign.
</P>
<P>
   He was convinced to stay on when the Liberals engineered a
parliamentary coup on Dec. 13, 1979, forcing a new election.
</P>
<P>
   Trudeau and the Liberals won a Parliament majority. Along with
the energy program that increased Canadian control of the gas and
oil industries, Trudeau also worked to defeat the Quebec
sovereignty referendum of 1980 and continued pushing for
constitutional reform.
</P>
<P>
   In 1981, after the Supreme Court ruled his plan to entrench the
Charter of Rights in a new Constitution was legal, Trudeau
convinced all the provinces except Quebec to sign on. Queen
Elizabeth proclaimed the new Constitution on April 17, 1982. He
retired two years later, leaving a weakened party.
</P>
<P>
   Funeral arrangements had not yet been announced.

<HEADLINE> Parents Won't Appeal Twins Ruling  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- The parents of Siamese twin girls have decided not
to appeal a court ruling permitting surgery to separate the two,
lawyers for the family said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors said surgery could allow one twin, known as Jodie, to
have a normal life, but that her sister, Mary, would not survive
the surgery. If the girls were not separated, doctors said, they
would both die within months.
</P>
<P>
   ''The parents, having taken this case to two courts before four
judges -- whose decision was unanimous -- feel they have done the
best they can for both daughters and are unable to take this any
further,'' said John Kitchingman, lawyer for the parents.
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate indication when the surgery might be
done.
</P>
<P>
   The parents, identified only as Roman Catholics from the Maltese
island of Gozo in the Mediterranean, came to Manchester for the
Aug. 8 birth of the twins, who were joined at the lower abdomen.
</P>
<P>
   Official Solicitor Laurence Oates, who represented Mary before
the Court of Appeal, said he had decided against an appeal to the
House of Lords after being notified that the parents did not want
to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ''As the judgments repeatedly emphasize, (the Court of Appeal's)
decision is specific to the unique and tragic facts of this case,''
Oates said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am satisfied that the decision will not set a precedent
which would undermine the principles of law deriving from and
supporting the respect for the sanctity of life and the belief that
all life has equal value, which I have been most concerned to
uphold,'' Oates said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The Official Solicitor represents minors in court cases.
</P>
<P>
   Three judges of the Court of Appeal ruled Sept. 22 that the case
came down to an issue of self-defense -- the right of the stronger
twin to be released from a sister who would eventually kill them
both.
</P>
<P>
   ''The sad fact is that Mary lives on borrowed time, all of it
borrowed from her sister,'' said Lord Justice Alan Ward. ''She is
incapable of independent existence. She is designated for death.''
</P>
<P>
   The health service that runs St. Mary's Hospital, where the
twins were born, said there were no immediate plans to undertake
the surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ''Both the medical team and hospital management team will
continue to liaise very closely with the parents and no further
action will be taken without their explicit knowledge,'' a
spokeswoman said on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The Roman Catholic Archbishop of Westminster, Cormac
Murphy-O'Connor, who had supported the parents' wish to leave the
twins joined, said Thursday he understood they felt ''unable to
continue what has become an arduous and protracted legal process,
and one which they did not initiate.
</P>
<P>
   ''My thoughts and prayers are with them and their two children
at this difficult time,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Negotiator Pushes for Climate Treaty  </HEADLINE>
By H. JOSEF HEBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The top U.S. negotiator in upcoming talks on
the Kyoto climate treaty said Thursday the administration ''is
determined to make this a cost effective agreement'' and rejected
suggestions the accord be abandoned.
</P>
<P>
   Undersecretary of State Frank Loy told a Senate hearing it
''would be a big step backward'' to walk away from the 1997 climate
treaty which has been signed, but not yet ratified by the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ''We would lose many years of effort and we don't think that's
the right way to go,'' said Loy, who will head the U.S.
negotiations in pivotal climate talks scheduled for mid-November in
the Netherlands. The talks are aimed at fleshing out critical
mechanisms for implementing the treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Chuck Hagel, R-Neb., said it was ''time for us to move
beyond the Kyoto protocol'' and adopt a ''commonsense'' long-range
approach to dealing with the climate issue since the industrial
countries are unlikely to meet their emission reduction targets
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Another Kyoto critic, Sen. Larry Craig, R-Idaho, said the treaty
was ''obsolete'' especially at a time of soaring energy costs.
Critics of the treaty argue the targets set at talks in Kyoto,
Japan, can't be met without sharply higher energy prices, a view
disputed by the administration and most environmentalists.
</P>
<P>
   Loy told the hearing that the treaty's implementation can be
designed to dramatically reduce the cost of compliance.
</P>
<P>
   He said the administration will seek approval at the upcoming
talks of a series of cost-reduction measures: unrestricted trading
of pollution credits among nations, broad use of forests and
agricultural lands that absorb carbon in calculating pollution
reductions, and an unencumbered mechanism to help provide
clean-energy technology for developing nations to help them reduce
greenhouse gases.
</P>
<P>
   ''The final agreement must ensure that overall costs of
compliance will be reasonable and no higher than necessary,'' Loy
told a joint hearing by the Senate Energy Committee and
International Relations Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The Kyoto treaty requires major industrial nations to roll back
emissions of so-called greenhouse gases -- principally carbon
dioxide from burning fossil fuels -- to below 1990 levels. For the
United States that would mean reductions of about a third below
where emissions are expected to be by 2008-2012 without any action.
</P>
<P>
   Many environmentalists, who have closely followed the climate
discussions, have expressed concern about U.S. plans to press for
broad use of emissions trading and so-called ''sinks'' -- forests
and agricultural lands that absorb carbon. They maintain too much
flexibility would all the United States to meet its emission
reduction targets without having to actually reducing significant
amounts of pollution.
</P>
<P>
   At the negotiations, beginning Nov. 13, the Europeans are
expected to press for limits on the use of pollution trading and
how ''sinks'' are used in determining treaty compliance.
</P>
<P>
   Loy said without the flexibility and cost-reduction mechanisms,
the United States and other industrial countries may have 'very
difficult time'' achieving the reductions committed to in 1997 in
Kyoto, Japan.

<HEADLINE> Joyce weakens slightly, Isaac regains major hurricane status  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MIAMI (AP) - Hurricane Joyce kept marching westward across the
Atlantic Thursday with top sustained winds of 85 mph, but wasn't
expected to get any stronger through most of Friday, forecasters
said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Hurricane Isaac's top sustained winds jumped from 120
mph to 140 mph late Thursday as the system swirled across the open
sea about 1,250 miles north-northwest of Joyce, forecasters said.
</P>
<P>
   Neither system posed any immediate threat to land.
</P>
<P>
   ''Isaac is no threat to any land in the foreseeable future,''
said Jack Beven, a hurricane specialist at the National Hurricane
Center in Miami. ''Joyce could be a threat to the Caribbean islands
several days away, but it's too early to say with any certainty
yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Joyce, which became a tropical storm Monday and a hurricane
Wednesday, was expected to start turning north in several days,
said hurricane specialist James Franklin.
</P>
<P>
   ''What we don't know is how sharp that turn will be,'' he said.
Sharp enough, and it could miss the Caribbean altogether and stay
over open waters.
</P>
<P>
   At 5 p.m. EDT, Joyce was centered near 11.1 north latitude, 45.8
west longitude or about 920 miles east of the Windward Islands. It
was moving west-southwest at about 14 mph.
</P>
<P>
   After reaching top winds of 120 mph Saturday, Isaac lost power
for several days as other weather systems began affecting it. It
cleared those systems and rebuilding began Wednesday as a major
storm.
</P>
<P>
   At 5 p.m. EDT, Isaac was near 27.4 north latitude, 54.7 west
longitude, or about 690 miles east-southeast of Bermuda. It was
moving northwest at near 20 mph, with a turn northward forecast
during the coming 24 hours. Forecasters said it should pass well
east of Bermuda.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Extends Liberians' Stay  </HEADLINE>
By ADAM GORLICK
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton on Thursday granted about
15,000 Liberians a last-minute extension to stay in America, but
their long-term future remains uncertain until Congress acts on a
measure to make them permanent residents.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton extended the Liberians' stay for one year, just hours
before a midnight deadline that would send them back.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he was worried that deportations could spur
countries in West Africa to also expel the thousands of Liberians
who fled there because of civil war. Forcing them to return would
''severely burden Liberia and cause instability in Liberia and in
the region,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a time for relief, not celebration,'' said Sen. Jack
Reed, D-R.I. ''We still confront the issue of letting them become
permanent members of our communities.''
</P>
<P>
   Reed is pushing for a bill that would grant the Liberians
permanent residency. Without it, they must apply for annual work
permits. Many Liberians have said it's difficult to land a
well-paying job because employers don't want to hire people who may
run the risk of being deported.
</P>
<P>
   ''Each time we make an extension, we add to the logic of letting
them become residents,'' Reed said. ''It's time we made it
permanent.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Liberians fled civil war in their country for the
United States in 1991, the government allowed them to stay for 12
months.
</P>
<P>
   They received extensions as the civil war continued. The
fighting ended in 1997 and U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno decided
last year that another extension would not be made. But the
administration concluded the Liberians would be in danger if they
returned home, and Clinton allowed them to stay in the United
States until Sept. 28, requiring the latest extension.
</P>
<P>
   About 4,000 Liberians live in Rhode Island. Many others settled
in Massachusetts and Illinois.

<HEADLINE> Census Gets Final Say Over Release  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Commerce Secretary Norman Mineta on Thursday
gave the Census Bureau the authority to decide whether to release
sampled Census 2000 data that could drastically affect how states
redraw political lines next year.
</P>
<P>
   The decision whether to issue raw population counts adjusted
using the statistical method known as sampling should be made ''by
the experts at the bureau,'' Mineta said in a statement. ''This
regulation is designed to ensure that politics are not a part of
this important decision.''
</P>
<P>
   The rule takes effect 30 days after its publication in the
Federal Register. The authority had previously been with the
Commerce Department.
</P>
<P>
   By Dec. 31, the Census Bureau must release its first population
count, which the Supreme Court said last year must be used for
reapportioning the 435 House seats among states. The first count is
based on forms households mailed back to the bureau, and visits
that census-takers made to homes that did not return a form.
</P>
<P>
   The same court decision left it up to states to decide whether
to use sampled data when redistricting. Supporters say sampling
will help account for parts of the population missed in prior
counts, including minorities, the poor and inner-city residents
that traditionally vote Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, in general, say the agency's plan is flawed, and
fear using the sampled numbers could skew redrawn districts in
Democrats' favor.
</P>
<P>
   Chip Walker, spokesman for Rep. Dan Miller, R-Fla., chairman of
the House Government Reform Committee's census panel, called the
decision Thursday ''purely a political move that does nothing than
to remove the decision from one Clinton appointee in place with
another.''
</P>
<P>
   The Census director's position and the Commerce Department
secretary are politically appointed positions.

<HEADLINE> Subpoena seeking acid report issued  </HEADLINE>
By SHANNON McCAFFREY
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) - A leading House Republican subpoenaed the
Environmental Protection Agency on Thursday to obtain a long sought
report on acid rain.
</P>
<P>
   EPA officials said they would provide the report but were
working out the details of how to do so.
</P>
<P>
   A coalition of New York lawmakers have been seeking the report -
a cost benefit analysis of acid rain reduction bills - for six
months. Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan first requested the cost
review in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   EPA completed it in March but it has been sitting in the Office
of Management and Budget.
</P>
<P>
   Moynihan along with Republican Reps. Sherwood Boehlert and John
Sweeney are the main sponsors of legislation to reduce emissions of
the acid rain-causing pollutants nitrogen and sulfur.
</P>
<P>
   The New York lawmakers are hopeful the report will provide them
with ammunition to push legislation unpopular with Midwestern
lawmakers through Congress. Much of the nitrogen and sulfur
pollution originates at Midwestern coal burning plants and is then
carried east on prevailing winds.
</P>
<P>
   Letters asking that the report be made public were ignored by
OMB, the New York lawmakers said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John McHugh asked Rep. Dan Burton, chairman of the
Committee on Government Reform, to issue a subpoena for the report.
The Indiana Republican agreed. Burton's committee includes
oversight of the EPA.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are issuing this subpoena because we need to bring acid
rain under control. Apparently, it's going to take a subpoena to
get the administration to do its part,'' McHugh said.
</P>
<P>
   EPA officials said they were always intent on cooperating.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want to move this through as soon as possible,'' EPA
Associate Deputy Administrator Dawn Martin said. ''We're feeling
the need to be responsive.''
</P>
<P>
   New York's once-pristine Adirondack Mountains have been hit
particularly hard by acid rain, which is caused when nitrogen and
sulfur in the smog mix with airborne moisture and fall as rain or
snow.
</P>
<P>
   A recent report from the U.S. General Accounting Office found
that mountain soil in the Adirondack State Park isn't absorbing
nitrogen oxide, so it is flowing directly into waterways and ponds
and causing them to die at a quicker rate.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have a wide body of evidence that the effects of acid rain
are worsening,'' Sweeney said.
</P>
<P>
   New York State has sued 14 out-of-state utilities demanding that
they modify their facilities to operate in compliance with the
federal Clean Air Act.

<HEADLINE> Big Decline in Uninsured Americans  </HEADLINE>
By GENARO C. ARMAS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The number of Americans without health
insurance declined last year for the first time since the Census
Bureau began collecting data in 1987. Health care advocates and
analysts cited the robust economy as the main reason.
</P>
<P>
   About 42.5 million people, or 15.5 percent of the population,
lacked insurance in 1999, compared with 44.2 million, or 16.3
percent, in 1998, according to data released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The number of uninsured children fell by 1.5 percentage points
to 13.9 million, according to the Census Bureau's annual report on
health insurance coverage in America.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts attributed the overall drop, in large part, to two
factors: more employers offering health coverage as a way to lure
or keep workers in a tight labor market and healthy economy, and
the Child Health Insurance Program, enacted by Congress in 1997 to
assist low-income families.
</P>
<P>
   The report showed that 62.8 percent of Americans had coverage
through an employment-related health insurance plan, compared with
62 percent in 1998. The percentage of those covered under Medicare
remain constant at 13.2. There was a 0.1 percentage point decline
in Medicaid coverage, to 10.2 percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ''Although I am pleased with today's development, there is much
work to be done,'' President Clinton said in a statement. ''We need
to encourage states that are not doing as well to accelerate their
activities in reaching out to uninsured children. And we need to
provide targeted programs to build on their success.''
</P>
<P>
   The report is ''a good news-bad news situation,'' said Diane
Rowland, executive director for the Kaiser Commission on Medicaid
and the Uninsured. ''There's a decline in the kinds of increases
we've seen. The worst news is we still have 42 million uninsured.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Census Bureau analyst Robert Mills: ''The driving force
behind this improvement was an increase in the likelihood of people
having employment-based health insurance.''
</P>
<P>
   Both health care reform advocates and industry supporters used
the report to promote their positions on an issue that has drawn
attention on Capitol Hill and the presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Chip Kahn, president of the Health Insurance Association of
America said that the data proved that ''a private, employer-based
system works.''
</P>
<P>
   He cited figures showing that since 1993, the number of people
covered under employment-based policies increased from 148 million
to 172 million.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a function of more jobs being created and a tight labor
market which is encouraging more employers to offer more
coverage,'' said Kahn, placing the onus on Congress ''to reduce
that number by tens of millions.''
</P>
<P>
   The report was not entirely encouraging, said Ron Pollack,
executive director of the Washington-based consumer group, Families
USA.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, he said, 32.4 percent of people living below the
poverty line remained uninsured, along with 47.5 percent of
low-income, full-time workers.
</P>
<P>
   ''Many people lost health coverage when they moved from welfare
into entry-level jobs that have no health benefits,'' Pollack said.
''The most sobering part ... is that these very high numbers come
at a time when the economy is doing very well.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the states, 25.6 percent of the residents in New Mexico
were uninsured in 1999, the highest in the country. Texas ranked
next-to-last, with 23.3 percent; in 1998, it was 50th at 24.5
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Rhode Island had the smallest percentage of uninsured in 1999,
6.9 percent, followed by Minnesota at 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the Republican presidential nominee,
has proposed a number of health insurance initiatives, including a
tax credit of up to $2,000 per family to help low-income working
Americans buy health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic candidate Al Gore has proposed expanding the
federal-state health plan for children to enroll more children and
allow parents to join.
</P>
<P>
   Among the report's other findings:
</P>
<P>
   --More Hispanics (33.4 percent) were likely to be uninsured than
any other of the major racial or ethnic group. Still, the
percentage fell from 35.3 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   --Adults age 18 to 24 remained the least likely to be uninsured
(29 percent), but the figure was 30 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   --The percentage of uninsured foreign-born residents declined
from 34.1 percent to 33.4 percent. The percentage for U.S.-born
residents fell nine-tenths of a percentage point, to 13.5 percent.

<HEADLINE> Senate To Vote on High-Tech Visas  </HEADLINE>
By JESSE J. HOLLAND
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senators probably will make a final decision
next week on increasing the number of immigrant high-tech workers
for technology companies, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott said.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Democrats on Wednesday lost their final attempt to attach
other immigration legislation to the bill that would have mainly
affected Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   Following that victory, and procedural votes on Wednesday and
Thursday, Lott, R-Miss., announced that a final vote on the bill
would likely come as early as Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The bill to provide more six-year visas is sought by software
and other high-tech companies.
</P>
<P>
   Under present law, the government issued 115,000 of the ''H1B''
visas this year for skilled workers from abroad. Under the
legislation, that ceiling would fall to 107,500 beginning Oct. 1,
and to 65,000 in the fiscal year after that. The legislation would
grant about 200,000 high-tech visas for each of the next three
years.
</P>
<P>
   Technology companies contend that 300,000 jobs are going
unfilled for lack of qualified workers; labor unions argue the
companies want more immigrants to put downward pressure on the
wages of Americans holding the same jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats have pledged to sustain a presidential veto of one of
the must-pass spending bills if it does not include grants of
amnesty to more illegal immigrants and offer permanent residency to
more political refugees from Central America and the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The bill is S.2045.

<HEADLINE> Cuban Mom Losing Hope for Funeral  </HEADLINE>
By ANITA SNOW
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA (AP) -- Aleida Martinez Paredes said Thursday that it was
painful enough to lose her eldest son, killed last week when a
stolen crop-duster full of Cubans crashed in the ocean as they fled
the island.
</P>
<P>
   Now she cannot even bury him.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. government this week refused to grant the divorced,
unemployed woman a visa to visit Miami for the funeral of her
23-year-old son, because officials feared she would not want to
return home.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez insisted she doesn't want to live in the United States,
she only wants to say goodbye to her son, Yudel Puig.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is absurd to say that I am going to stay there,'' said
Martinez, 40, as she smoked unfiltered black tobacco cigarettes and
wiped her tears with a handkerchief. ''I have another child here, a
10-year-old boy. I have Yudel's son, my only grandchild.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know very much about politics,'' she said. ''But in a
case like this, politics should be set aside. They should not mix
politics with human sentiment and a mother's suffering.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the State Department's decision, Martinez said she would
not give up hope, at least until Friday, because U.S. Rep. Ileana
Ros-Lehtinen continues to argue her case in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Ros-Lehtinen, a Cuban-American lawmaker from Miami, said she is
asking the State Department to grant Paredes a humanitarian parole
visa, instead of the standard tourist visa she sought.
</P>
<P>
   Yudel Puig's father, Isidro Puig of Miami, said funeral
arrangements remain on hold.
</P>
<P>
   Puig, who could not swim, drowned after the plane crashed in the
Gulf of Mexico on Sept. 19. Nine others survived and were rescued
by a passing Panamanian freighter. They received medical treatment
in Florida and were granted parole.
</P>
<P>
   Among them was Puig's older half-brother, Jovel Puig.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot, Angel Lenin Iglesias, was Martinez's brother-in-law.
He was accompanied by his wife, Mercedes, who is Martinez's sister,
and their two small sons.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in a rattan rocker, in her crowded Old Havana apartment,
Martinez recalled how she screamed when civil aviation officials
told her that her sister, her brother-in-law and her little nephews
had abandoned the country aboard the old single-engine Russian
craft that Iglesias flew to fumigate and fertilize crops.
</P>
<P>
   She said she cried again later in the day when she learned that
Yudel had also gone, but assumed he was safe and would make it to
Miami.
</P>
<P>
   When Cuban state television reported the next day that one of
the passengers had died, Martinez thought it was the pilot.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was crying for my brother-in-law, and when I realized I was
really crying for the death of my son ... well, I don't know any
more if I am all right in the head.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez said she has been living in a fog since her ex-husband
called to tell her their son was dead.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the phone she shares with her neighbors in the old
apartment house has hardly stopped ringing. She has gotten calls
from the South Florida congresswoman's office, exile groups in
Miami, journalists, and Cuban immigration officials saying that if
and when she gets her U.S. visa her Cuban passport and exit visa
are ready.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez said she spoke by telephone with her sister, Mercedes,
but did not ask about her motives for leaving. She also talked with
her brother-in-law, whom she said seems particularly conflicted
about what they did.
</P>
<P>
   Iglesias was a Communist Party member, son of a man who fought
in the revolution that brought Fidel Castro to power in 1959. His
uncle, Joel Iglesias, is well known in Cuba as the revolution's
youngest commander, a former adolescent aide-de-camp to Ernesto
''Che'' Guevara.
</P>
<P>
   Iglesias' family was shocked by the flight, and remain ''very

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends Up 196; Nasdaq Adds 122  </HEADLINE>
By LISA SINGHANIA
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks shot higher Thursday, buoyed by rebounds
in technology and blue chip issues as Wall Street regained a
tentative footing amid uncertainty about corporate profits. But an
earnings warning from Apple Computer after the close of trading
threatened to send Wall Street back on its downward trek.
</P>
<P>
   Apple's stock tumbled more than 45 percent percent in
extended-hours trading, and also brought other high-tech issues
lower, making it quite possible that Thursday's dramatic upturn
would be short-lived. The market already took a beating the first
three sessions this week on concerns about third-quarter profits.
</P>
<P>
   ''We should see a generally mixed market Friday and a downward
bias in tech stocks and the averages,'' said Dan Ascani, president
and research director at Global Market Strategists in Gainesville,
Ga. ''The earnings warning illustrates we're still not out of the
woods yet.''
</P>
<P>
   In the regular session, the Dow Jones industrial average closed
up 195.70 at 10,824.06, its highest close this week and the blue
chips' biggest advance since it rose 198.41 on May 15.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators also had big gains. The Nasdaq
composite index rose 122.02 to 3,778.32 and the Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 index was up 31.72 at 1,458.29.
</P>
<P>
   Apple rose $4.56 to $53.50 in regular trading, but after the
computer maker warned late Thursday that its quarterly profits
would be ''substantially below expectations,'' it dropped more than
45 percent to $29.19 in after-hours trading. Volume was heavy, with
more than 11 million shares changing hands.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks have been down for most of September on worries about
corporate profits -- in particular when high-profile technology
companies including Intel have warned of disappointing results.
Apple, also considered an indicator of the high-tech sector's
health, could have a similar effect on the market.
</P>
<P>
   The market's unease has been compounded by energy prices that
are at decade-high levels and a weak European currency -- factors
that many companies say will hurt their profits.
</P>
<P>
   In regular trading Thursday, the market advanced on a mix of
bargain-hunting and end-of-the-quarter trading.
</P>
<P>
   Investors appeared unfazed by a Commerce Department report
Thursday that showed the economy expanded at an annual rate of 5.6
percent between April and June, a faster rate than the 4.8 percent
growth in the first three months of 2000. The report also showed
inflation, which has been the primary concern of the Federal
Reserve as it raised interest rates over the past 15 months, was
moderating even as the economy surged.
</P>
<P>
   The market remained focused on corporate earnings. Procter &AMP;
Gamble jumped $5.13 to $67 after the consumer products maker said
it would meet Wall Street expectations for the third quarter. P&AMP;G
has suffered disappointing results in recent quarters.
</P>
<P>
   But profit-taking investors unloaded Safeway, trading it down
$4.75 to $49.38 after the grocery company reported profits in line
with analysts' estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Internet and telecom stocks also emerged from a slump.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco Systems was up $2 at $59.31 in the regular session,
despite a downgrade by a Sanford Bernstein analyst. It dropped
$1.25 in extended-hours trading.
</P>
<P>
   Lucent also moved higher, trading up $2.75 at $31.31, but
slipped 50 cents in the extended session.
</P>
<P>
   Web portal Yahoo! was up $5.31 at $95.69, gaining back nearly
half of its loss Wednesday, but then retreated 94 cents
after-hours.
</P>
<P>
   Financial services stocks moved higher as well. Citigroup
climbed $1.50 to $53.88, but gave back most of that gain in
after-hours trading, falling $1.13. Dain Rauscher, a regional
brokerage firm, rose $13 to $92.88 after announcing it was being
acquired by the Royal Bank of Canada in a $1.5 billion deal. It was
unchanged after-hours.
</P>
<P>
   ''You're getting some good boost of stocks that have been
bludgeoned as of late,'' said Charles White, portfolio manager at
Avatar Associates, said of the regular session. ''You may have a
little bit of bargain hunting going on ... and a little bit of
relief that we've gone one day maybe without a company announcing a
complete disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   Portfolio managers were also buying in advance of the end of the
third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a more than 2-to-1
margin on the New York Stock Exchange. Consolidated volume came to
1.43 billion shares, ahead of the 1.39 billion in the previous
session.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was up 15.68 at 523.81.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 0.08 percent.
Germany's DAX index was up .27 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 dropped
0.08 percent, and France's CAC-40 fell 0.13 percent.

<HEADLINE> Senate Panel Approves Rail Bill  </HEADLINE>
By CURT ANDERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Senate committee approved a bill Thursday
that would raise benefits for retired rail workers and cut taxes
for railroads while also draining $15 billion from the budget
surplus.
</P>
<P>
   The move came after senators rejected an attempt to attach an
unrelated measure expanding Medicaid coverage for severely disabled
children.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, an avalanche of amendments forced the Senate Finance
Committee to give up on a 10-year, $38.7 billion bill using tax
breaks and regulatory relief to spur investment in impoverished
inner cities and rural areas. A slimmed-down version of that bill,
the outgrowth of a deal between President Clinton and House Speaker
Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., is still likely to emerge before Congress
adjourns for the year.
</P>
<P>
   Later Thursday, Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers met for
nearly two hours with House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, to
begin work toward a compromise tax relief package likely to include
the anti-poverty measures.
</P>
<P>
   No decisions were made, but aides said other items likely to be
included in the 10-year, roughly $300 billion package include
repeal of the federal telephone excise tax, a pension bill that
expands contributions to IRAs and 401(k) plans and a series of tax
breaks for business to offset the cost of a potential $1 increase
in the $5.15-an-hour minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
   With the congressional session winding down, senators on the
Finance Committee were looking Thursday to attach their priority
bills to any legislation with a decent chance of becoming law. The
railroad retirement bill, which passed the House earlier this month
on a 391-25 vote, is one of those measures.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's probably the last train out of the station,'' said Sen.
John Breaux, D-La.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, said thousands of children with
severe disabilities and their parents could be helped by his
legislation ensuring that they could continue government Medicaid
health coverage even if their incomes rose above the program's
limits.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's wrong for families to have to impoverish themselves
because they love their kids and want to take care of their health
needs,'' Grassley said.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the bill has 77 Senate co-sponsors -- and senators
were extremely reluctant to vote against such an emotional issue --
opponents pointed out that it could benefit families earning up to
$84,000 a year and consume $11 billion of the projected budget
surplus over the next decade. Grassley's effort to attach it to the
railroad bill failed on a 10-7 vote.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have let this surplus burn a hole in our pocket and turn
out the lights in our heads,'' said Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas. ''I
just think this is completely out of bounds.''
</P>
<P>
   The railroad retirement overhaul, which cleared the Finance
Committee on a voice vote, arose from two years of negotiations
between railroads and 13 unions representing about 250,000 workers
and 650,000 retirees, widows and dependents. Among other things,
the legislation would permit the transfer of $15 billion from a
Depression-era government pension fund into a new privately
administered account that would be invested in stocks, bonds and
other securities.
</P>
<P>
   The estimated 8 percent return on investment, sponsors say,
would finance an increase in benefits for rail retirees, including
reduction of retirement age from 62 to 60, and cut payroll taxes
for railroads by $400 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   The transfer would consume more than half the $28 billion in
fiscal 2001 surplus dollars that Republicans want to use for tax
reduction or more spending, said Sen. Don Nickles, R-Okla. But the
committee rebuffed his effort to delay the effective date until
2002; sponsors say the hit on the surplus is a one-time cost
associated with the redeeming of Treasury bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Nickles expressed concern that Congress was setting the
federal government up for a huge bailout, or a massive payroll tax
increase on the railroads, if the pension investments failed to
meet expectations. The White House has also raised concerns about
the precedent for Social Security, where there are several
proposals to shift funds into private investments.
</P>
<P>
   ''Expanding benefits and cutting taxes is not financially
sound,'' Nickles said. ''I think it's irresponsible.''

Gore, Bush Spar Over Fiscal Prudence
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- As if reading from the same text with the names reversed,
Democrat Al Gore and Republican George W. Bush swapped charges today of
squandering the nation's hard-won budget surpluses and putting prosperity at
risk. ''Forty days from now, prosperity itself will be on the ballot,'' Gore
said. He pitched debt reduction as his economic priority and characterized
Bush's plans as a ''massive tax on America's potential.'' Bush answered from
Wisconsin, challenging Gore to forswear tax increases to shore up Social
Security and describing him as a man no longer in touch with the ''vital
center.''

   MIAMI (AP) -- Elian Gonzalez's Miami relatives filed a lawsuit today against
Attorney General Janet Reno, alleging the armed raid that took the Cuban boy
from their home and reunited him with his father was illegal. ''The last time I
saw anything like that was in films from postwar Germany when the Nazis were
invading people's homes without cause,'' said the family's lawyer, Ron
Guralnick. The lawsuit filed in federal court claims Reno and the Immigration
and Naturalization Service used false statements to obtain the arrest and search
warrants used in the pre-dawn April 22 raid to seize the 6-year-old boy.

   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) -- In the latest blow to the beleaguered euro,
Danish voters on Thursday rejected the European Union's common currency in favor
of keeping the 125-year-old krone. The referendum -- closely watched because
Britain, Sweden and Greece also plan votes on euro adoption -- was an
embarrassment to the European Union which has pressed for a common currency.
With nearly 90 percent of referendum votes counted, 53 percent opposed making
the euro Denmark's currency, while 47 percent favored the switch from the krone,

approved use of the abortion pill RU-486, a major victory for abortion-rights
advocates that could dramatically alter abortion in this country. The
long-expected decision by the Food and Drug Administration allows Americans an
early-abortion method already used in France, Britain, China and 10 other

<HEADLINE> Nader Candidate Does Letterman  </HEADLINE>
By DEEPTI HAJELA
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Ralph Nader may not have been invited to next
week's presidential debate, but at least he made it to Letterman.
</P>
<P>
   The Green Party presidential candidate took his spot in the hot
seat on ''Late Night with David Letterman'' on Thursday, talking
about what his party stands for, the environment and his take on
the two main party candidates, Republican George W. Bush and
Democrat Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   On Bush: ''George W. Bush is really a big corporation running
for president disguised as a human being.''
</P>
<P>
   On Gore: ''Al Gore's dilemma every day on the campaign trail is
to figure out whether he's the 'Great Impostor' or the 'Great
Pretender.'''
</P>
<P>
   Both Bush and Gore have appeared on the show.
</P>
<P>
   Nader criticized Gore's environmental record as vice president
and said he didn't believe Gore would do any better as president.
</P>
<P>
   Letterman asked whether voting for the Green Party would be
wasting a vote.
</P>
<P>
   ''Throwing away your vote is throwing away your vote in the
direction of the two major parties that have wasted our democracy,
that are excluding competitors in the presidential debates,'' Nader
replied.
</P>
<P>
   Nader will not participate in Tuesday's debate in Boston because
he failed to meet the criteria for inclusion set by the bipartisan
Commission on Presidential Debates.
</P>
<P>
   Candidates must appear on enough state ballots to have a chance
of winning the election and must have an average of 15 percent
support in five major national polls, according to commission.
Nader has been in the low single digits in these surveys.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters have protested his exclusion. About 50 people
gathered outside the theater before Thursday's taping, carrying
signs that said ''Let Ralph Debate'' and ''Be a genius. Think for
yourself. Vote Nader.'' They also plan to rally in Boston two days
before the debate.
</P>
<P>
   The pull-no-punches Letterman was even blunter in his last
question for Nader.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can't win,'' he said. ''What is your goal?''
</P>
<P>
   ''We're going to get millions of votes, and after November, the
Green Party will be building,'' Nader said. ''It will be a watchdog
on the two parties.''

<HEADLINE> Gore, Bush Quotes on Abortion Pill  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   Presidential candidates George W. Bush and Al Gore on
the Food
and Drug Administration's decision Thursday to approve use of the
RU-486 abortion pill.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the FDA's decision to approve the abortion pill RU-486
is wrong. People on both sides of the abortion issue can agree that
we should do everything we can to reduce the number of abortions,
and I fear that making this abortion pill widespread will make
abortions more and more common, rather than more and more rare. As
president, I will work to build a culture that respects life.'' --
Bush, Republican.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   ''I am pleased with the Food and Drug Administration's decision
to approve mifepristone. After careful review and clinical tests,
the Food and Drug Administration has determined that its use is
safe and effective. The review and approval of this drug is
consistent with the Food and Drug Administration's mission as a
science-based public health regulatory agency. Today's decision is
not about politics, but the health and safety of American women and
a woman's fundamental right to choose.'' -- Gore, Democrat.

<HEADLINE> Giuliani: City would pay one-third cost of new Mets' ballpark  </HEADLINE>
By RONALD BLUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - New York City is willing to pay a third of the
cost of new ballparks for the Mets and Yankees if the teams and New
York State also pay one-third each.
</P>
<P>
   Mets co-owner Nelson Doubleday said Wednesday he didn't see
government money forthcoming for a new ballpark and said
refurbishing Shea Stadium might be an alternative.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Wilpon, the Mets' other co-owner, announced in April 1998
plans to build a $500 million ballpark resembling Ebbets Field, the
former home of the Brooklyn Dodgers, in the parking lot adjacent to
Shea Stadium. The ballpark would have a retractable roof, 78 luxury
suites and a capacity of 45,000.
</P>
<P>
   ''The city has the money to do it, but the city needs a
substantial contribution from the private baseball organization,
and the same is true of the Yankees,'' New York City Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''So it's not a matter of the city not having the money to do
it. It's a matter of if the private baseball organization wants to
donate or put in or pay for about a third of the cost in real
dollars. ... That would roughly be the same thing with the
Yankees.''
</P>
<P>
   In October 1998, Wilpon said he hoped the Mets could move into a
new ballpark in 2003, but no progress has been announced since then
and there is no evidence of a desire to contribute money from
either New York state's Legislature or New York's City Council.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Gargano, the state's economic development director, said
the state has made no such pledge as the one Giuliani mentioned.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know of any formula as such exists,'' said Gargano,
who is close to Gov. George Pataki, said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Gargano said the state's position for six years has been that it
is ''willing to look into any infrastructure improvements.''
</P>
<P>
   Gargano said the Pataki administration has had no contact with
the Mets about improvements at Shea Stadium or a new ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani has talked about a West Side stadium in Manhattan
either for the Yankees or the NFL's New York Jets. The Yankees,
whose lease at Yankee Stadium expires in 2002, also are considering
refurbishing Yankee Stadium or building a ballpark in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   In the state's talks with the Yankees about renovations at
Yankee Stadium, Gargano said some of the things discussed were
state-funded improvements to highways and access roads around the
stadium and perhaps a new Metro North mass transit stop at the
stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki has said he wants the Yankees to stay in the Bronx and
has not discussed what the state would do if the team tries to
build a new stadium in Manhattan, according to Gargano.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, a new ballpark adjacent to Shea Stadium has been the
only alternative mentioned by the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   ''I kind of like this place and I don't see a ballpark in
downtown New York City,'' Doubleday said Wednesday before the Mets
clinched a playoff spot by beating Atlanta 6-2. ''I don't see a
great deal of taxpayer money to build the New York Mets a stadium.
I think this place can be refurbished and made up to date.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said that was news to him.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Mets have not said this to me, so I don't know if this
accurately represents their viewpoint. But they know my offer,''
the mayor said. ''From the city's point of view, it would be better
to build a new stadium. ... All you have to do is look at the
attendance figures in Cleveland, in Baltimore. ... The new stadiums
bring you a big big boost in terms of economic development and
attendance.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilpon and Doubleday are not close, according to owners of other
teams, and Wilpon has a larger role in the team's day-to-day
operation. Still, each owns 50 percent of the team.
</P>
<P>
   Wilpon did not want to respond, Mets spokesman Jay Horwitz said
Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Tenn. Rights Commission Accused  </HEADLINE>
By WOODY BAIRD
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) -- Tennessee's Human Rights Commission and
its black executive director have been accused by federal
regulators of paying female and black employees less than they pay
white men.
</P>
<P>
   The commission, which investigates discrimination in jobs and
housing, was cited in a preliminary report by the federal Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Julius Sloss, the state commission's director, said the EEOC
findings are based on incomplete information. He has asked for a
second review.
</P>
<P>
   ''They looked at some examples of some people who were hired at
salaries above the entry level and they simply stopped there,'' he
said Thursday from his Nashville office.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you're going to look at a few people, you've got to look at
the whole picture,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation stems from a complaint by Patricia Batts of
Memphis, a commission case investigator.
</P>
<P>
   Batts, who is black, complained that two white men who do the
same kind of work are paid several thousand dollars a year more.
She demanded equal pay.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're supposed to be helping everyone else not be
discriminated against and we're being discriminated against,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   The EEOC found on Aug. 31 that ''black males and females in
general were treated less favorably than the white male
employees.''
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin Bradley, regional director of the EEOC in Jackson,
Miss., refused to discuss the investigation, pending the second
review. He said the Mississippi office is handling the case to
avoid the appearance of conflict of interest.
</P>
<P>
   Sloss said the salaries he set for commission employees were
based solely on how much money he had in his operating budget when
they were hired.
</P>
<P>
   Two white men were hired in 1998 at salaries of $30,000 and
$27,000, above the standard entry-level wage of $20,000 to $22,000,
because they were well qualified and the commission's budget could
support that pay, Sloss said.
</P>
<P>
   But Sloss said he ran into budget problems in December 1998,
because of a required increase in funds set aside for retirement
benefits. That meant restricting all new hires to entry-level
salaries, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the commission has hired four investigators -- a
white female, two black males and Batts at entry-level salaries.
Sloss said Batts knew she would receive entry-level pay because
that is what the budget could support.
</P>
<P>
   If the EEOC agrees with Batts in a final report, she will be
cleared to file a discrimination suit in federal court seeking a
higher salary and back pay. A final report could take months.

<HEADLINE> Green Party candidate does Letterman  </HEADLINE>
By DEEPTI HAJELA
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Ralph Nader may not have been invited to next
week's presidential debate, but at least he made it to Letterman.
</P>
<P>
   The Green Party presidential candidate took his spot in the hot
seat on ''The Late Show with David Letterman'' on Thursday, talking
about what his party stands for, the environment and his take on
the two main party candidates, Republican George W. Bush and
Democrat Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   On Bush: ''George W. Bush is really a big corporation running
for president disguised as a human being.''
</P>
<P>
   On Gore: ''Al Gore's dilemma every day on the campaign trail is
to figure out whether he's the 'Great Impostor' or the 'Great
Pretender.'''
</P>
<P>
   Both Bush and Gore have appeared on the show.
</P>
<P>
   Nader criticized Gore's environmental record as vice president
and said he didn't believe Gore would do any better as president.
</P>
<P>
   Letterman asked whether voting for the Green Party would be
wasting a vote.
</P>
<P>
   ''Throwing away your vote is throwing away your vote in the
direction of the two major parties that have wasted our democracy,
that are excluding competitors in the presidential debates,'' Nader
replied.
</P>
<P>
   Nader will not participate in Tuesday's debate in Boston because
he failed to meet the criteria for inclusion set by the bipartisan
Commission on Presidential Debates.
</P>
<P>
   Candidates must appear on enough state ballots to have a chance
of winning the election and must have an average of 15 percent
support in five major national polls, according to commission.
Nader has been in the low single digits in these surveys.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters have protested his exclusion. About 50 people
gathered outside the theater before Thursday's taping, carrying
signs that said ''Let Ralph Debate'' and ''Be a genius. Think for
yourself. Vote Nader.'' They also plan to rally in Boston two days
before the debate.
</P>
<P>
   The pull-no-punches Letterman was even blunter in his last
question for Nader.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can't win,'' he said. ''What is your goal?''
</P>
<P>
   ''We're going to get millions of votes, and after November, the
Green Party will be building,'' Nader said. ''It will be a watchdog
on the two parties.''

<HEADLINE> Air Force Probes Nev. Missile Crash  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ELY, Nev. (AP) -- The Air Force is investigating what caused a
cruise missile with a dummy warhead to veer off course and crash
during a test in the eastern Nevada desert, a military spokeswoman
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The missile launched from a B-52 bomber based in Minot, N.D.,
carried no explosives, said Lt. Col. Lisa Bogdanski, a public
affairs official for the 388th Fighter Wing at Hill Air Force Base
in Utah.
</P>
<P>
   No one was hurt when it hit the ground Wednesday morning about
50 miles south of Wendover, Nev., she told the Ely Times.
</P>
<P>
   Air Force officials in Utah did not immediately return telephone
messages left by The Associated Press on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The missile was launched ''as part of a routine weapons
evaluation program'' and was on a preplanned flight path, Bogdanski
said. It crashed shortly after the launch in a buffer zone
separating the Defense Department bombing range from other federal
land, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The area is near the Goshute Indian Reservation along the
Nevada-Utah border about 350 miles east of Reno. Most of the rest
of the land in the area is high desert rangeland managed by the
Bureau of Land Management.
</P>
<P>
   The missile was recovered and transported to Hill Air Force
Base, Bogdanski said.

<HEADLINE> House: Reject China 2008 Olympic Bid  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A House resolution was introduced Thursday
urging that Beijing not be selected as host of the 2008 Olympics
unless human rights conditions improve in China.
</P>
<P>
   ''The human rights record of the People's Republic of China is
abominable -- and it is getting worse, not better,'' said Rep. Tom
Lantos, D-Calif., who introduced the bill. ''It is completely
inconsistent with the Olympic ideal to hold the games in Beijing.''
</P>
<P>
   Beijing is one of five cities being considered by the
International Olympic Committee, which is to decide in July on a
venue for the 2008 games.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution sites ''deplorable'' human rights abuses such as
censorship, torture and mistreatment of prisoners, violence against
women, child abuse and denial of freedom of religion and assembly.
</P>
<P>
   But the resolution praises Chinese Olympic athletes now
participating in Sydney, Australia, noting they have placed third
in the number of metals earned.
</P>
<P>
   ''Thousands of Chinese athletes have shown their strong support
for the Olympic spirit through their commitment to excellence,
energy, skill sportsmanship and good will towards their fellow
athletes,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear whether the House would have time to vote on the
measure before it adjourns, probably in mid-October.

<HEADLINE> Christian Coalition Aims For GOP Win  </HEADLINE>
By EUN-KYUNG KIM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Don't discount the impact the once-mighty
Christian Coalition could play on the elections. While the
organization of conservatives may have faded from public view,
their tenacious core of ground troops could help deliver states to
Republican George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The organization's source of power lies in its 70 million voter
guides. Coalition members also have been key in establishing voter
registration drives and mobilizing churches to get involved.
</P>
<P>
   ''We plan to play a big role this year,'' Roberta Combs, the
executive director of the Christian Coalition, said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   While Democratic presidential nominee Al Gore relies on a vast
network of union workers to help get out the vote across the
country, Republicans in recent years have counted on the Christian
Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Texas Gov. Bush, who has focused on appealing to moderate
Republicans, hasn't aggressively wooed the organization, which was
pushed into the background at the Republican National Convention
this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also turned down a chance to address several thousand
Christian Coalition members at the group's annual convention this
weekend. Lynne Cheney, wife of Bush running mate Dick Cheney, was
scheduled to address the gathering Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, Christian Coalition founder Pat Robertson
called Bush's decision to skip the convention ''very risky,'' but
Combs said she's confident ''our people really know where he (Bush)
stands on the issues. He's very conservative.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush aides said he would be too busy preparing for the first
presidential debate Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Political analysts figure he doesn't need to attend.
</P>
<P>
   ''Where else are these people going to go?'' said John Kenneth
White, a politics professor at Catholic University of America.
</P>
<P>
   ''If there are to be three straight presidential losses, that
would be very frustrating for the Christian Coalition,'' he said.
''They (Republicans) lost two to Clinton and they want the
presidency back.''
</P>
<P>
   The Christian Coalition has been plagued in recent years by
leadership changes and internal strife that has hurt the group's
ability to raise money.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its lower profile, it would be a mistake to write off
the Christian Coalition, said John Green, a specialist in religion
and politics and director of the University of Akron's Bliss
Institute. The group's membership -- estimated at more than 1.2
million -- could generate enough votes in Florida and other
battleground states to deliver Bush the presidency, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the election ends up being as close as people think it
will, the Christian Coalition, even in its weakened state, can
probably have some influence,'' Green said. ''I would caution
people to not write the Christian Coalition off just because they
haven't been making headlines.''
</P>
<P>
   A recent Pew poll taken earlier this month found that about 22
percent of registered voters consider themselves ''evangelical
Christians.'' The same survey reported about 63 percent of voters
said they had a favorable view of evangelical Christians. That's up
from 41 percent who had a favorable view in 1996. Six in 10
Democrats and independents had a favorable view, while
three-fourths of Republicans had a favorable view.

<HEADLINE> CDC Expects Enough Flu Vaccine  </HEADLINE>
By RUSS NUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Federal health officials said Thursday they don't
expect a flu vaccine shortage this year, but recommend healthy
Americans postpone getting shots while manufacturers overcome a lag
in production.
</P>
<P>
   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention wants doctors and
clinics to give first priority for flu shots to the elderly and the
chronically ill, groups at highest risk of dying from the flu.
</P>
<P>
   A CDC advisory panel recommended healthy people wait until at
least November for vaccinations.
</P>
<P>
   ''The best information available is that the problem will be
largely one of delay in distribution rather than a severe
shortage,'' said Dr. John Modlin, chairman of the CDC panel.
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturers are behind in filling orders because of problems
growing the flu strain needed to make this year's vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, 74 million doses of vaccine were needed. The
government predicts the same number will be available this year,
but less than half will be shipped before flu season starts in
November.
</P>
<P>
   Most people who aren't considered high-risk should be able to
wait, since flu season usually peaks between January and March,
said Dr. Walter Orenstein, director of the CDC's National
Immunization Program.
</P>
<P>
   The flu kills about 20,000 people a year. Those considered most
at risk are people 65 and older or those suffering from chronic
illnesses such as heart and lung disease, asthma or diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   The CDC also recommends giving priority to health care workers,
pregnant women in their second and third trimesters and people
living with the chronically ill.
</P>
<P>
   The National Institutes of Health is studying whether healthy
people might get by with half a dose, while building sufficient
immunity levels. The study won't be done in time for this year's
vaccination season.

<HEADLINE> Six more West Nile-infected crows found in Baltimore  </HEADLINE>
By ALEX DOMINGUEZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE (AP) - Six more dead crows found across the city have
tested positive for the mosquito-borne West Nile virus that can be
fatal to humans, state officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the crows were infected in Maryland is not known, but
none of the mosquitoes tested in the state so far have been
infected with the virus, said J.B. Hanson, a spokesman for the
state health department.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't know what the point of origin is,'' Hanson said.
''They could have been from Massachusetts, Canada, New York, New
Jersey. We just don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   The West Nile virus caused the Sept. 14 death of an 82-year-old
New Jersey man - the first such death in the United States this
year.
</P>
<P>
   The virus also has been detected in birds in New York,
Connecticut, Massachusetts, Rhode Island and Pennsylvania. A total
of 17 people have been infected.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the virus killed seven people in the New York
metropolitan area. No human cases have been reported in Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   The six latest Baltimore crows were received by state health
officials on Monday for testing. The positive test results followed
last week's announcement three crows found in the Federal Hill
neighborhood and in Baltimore County and Howard County were also
infected.
</P>
<P>
   State officials sprayed parts of Baltimore County and Howard
County to kill mosquitoes that may be carrying the virus.
</P>
<P>
   The state also planned to spray the city's downtown area and
nearby neighborhoods, but canceled the spraying because of cold
weather that made the insecticide Permethrin less effective. The
spraying has been criticized by some who claim Permethrin poses a
greater health risk than the virus itself.
</P>
<P>
   But state officials said the spraying will continue, perhaps on
a larger scale, when possible.
</P>
<P>
   ''Right now, when weather permits, spraying will continue in an
effort to decrease the mosquito population,'' Hanson said. ''As it
stands, the weather's been too cold to do any significant spraying,
or it's been raining.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've got a lot of areas to deal with now, that's why we've
got to assess this to find the best mechanism.''
</P>
<P>
   The virus, transmitted through mosquito bites, can cause
encephalitis - the swelling of the brain - and meningitis - the
swelling of the lining of the brain and spinal cord - in humans.
</P>
<P>
   While those diseases can be fatal, the very young and the very
old are the most at risk, health officials have said.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore Health Commissioner Peter Beilenson urged residents
not to panic.
</P>
<P>
   ''The bottom line is the same. This is not a very serious virus
or illness,'' he said. ''The vast majority of the people, even if
they did get bitten by a mosquito are not even going to develop
symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   ''The few that develop symptoms, it will be like a normal flu.''
</P>
<P>
   State health officials again urged residents to eliminate
standing water in which mosquitoes can breed and to wear long
sleeves and pants when going outside at dusk or dawn, when
mosquitoes are most active.
</P>
<P>
   The threat from the virus subsides once cold weather arrives and
the mosquitoes become dormant, state officials said.

<HEADLINE> Italians in Uproar Over Child Porn  </HEADLINE>
By CANDICE HUGHES
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME (AP) -- Italian television officials resigned Thursday after
state TV aired graphic images in a prime-time news report on child
pornography. The broadcasts, seen by nearly 11 million people,
shocked Italy and ignited a political firestorm.
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican newspaper L'Osservatore Romano criticized TV for
worshipping a ''cult'' of sensational images and said the
broadcasts had ''violated Italian families'' in the guise of news.
</P>
<P>
   ''The images transmitted last night were not just an offense to
viewers, but most of all to the children represented -- twice
victims, twice exploited, twice violated when they should have been
protected,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
   An anchorman and two assistant news directors resigned Thursday.
Two top news executives offered to follow suit, but RAI-TV rejected
the offers late Thursday after lengthy meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The case hit the news a day earlier, when police said they had
broken up an online international child pornography ring, arrested
eight Italians and three Russians and seized thousands of videos
and photographs.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian-run ring, which distributed an explicit catalog on
the Internet, catered to clients in the United States, Italy and
Germany. Its inventory included films of children being tortured
and killed.
</P>
<P>
   State television's RAI Tre station showed some of the photos and
graphic snippets of video during the 7 p.m. newscast Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   RAI Uno did the same an hour later, even though complaints had
already started pouring in. By the end of the 30-minute broadcast,
RAI Uno's news director, Gad Lerner, was on the air apologizing for
images ''not only unwatchable but violent.''
</P>
<P>
   Called on the carpet Thursday, Lerner and his RAI Tre
counterpart Nino Rizzo Nervo both admitted they didn't know what
was going to be on the broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
   The uproar threatened to overshadow the horror over the
pedophilia case itself.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators say the pornography ring produces and distributes
images showing children as young as 2 years old being sexually
abused. Some of the victims were reportedly stolen from orphanages;
others from families.
</P>
<P>
   Its catalog offers films of killings for about $20,000 and
images of people having sex with children for half that. Images of
children being kidnapped are relatively cheap at less than $200.
</P>
<P>
   RAI Uno's broadcast showed pages from the catalog and a video of
a man apparently having sex with a little girl.
</P>
<P>
   The attacks on RAI came from both the left and the right.
</P>
<P>
   The communist newspaper Liberazione ran indignant letters from
viewers on the front page. In parliament, the center-right
opposition scolded RAI and demanded Lerner and Rizzo Nervo's
resignations be accepted.
</P>
<P>
   Never prudish, Italian TV has grown increasingly daring about
sex and violence. The Italian version of ''Big Brother,'' for
example, routinely shows nudity and sex.
</P>
<P>
   Aldo Grasso, one of Italy's most respected television critics,
said the RAI broadcasts were ''symptomatic of what has been
happening in Italian TV, both state and private, over the last
couple of years.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Editors are driven not by quality or responsibility toward
viewers but only the ratings,'' he told The Associated Press.
''Disturbing and violent images intrude in all kinds of programs,
throughout the day.''
</P>
<P>
   The UNICEF head in Italy, Giovanni Micali, also complained
bitterly about rising violence. ''It was an extreme case, but not
the first and not the only one,'' he said of the RAI newscasts.
</P>
<P>
   Top government officials promised action.
</P>
<P>
   The justice minister said he was looking into how RAI got the
material and the telecommunications minister said prosecutors were
checking to see if RAI's broadcast had violated the law.

<HEADLINE> Lieberman Criticizes GOP Drug Plan  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Democratic vice presidential candidate Joseph
Lieberman, flanked by longtime congressional colleagues, on
Thursday accused Republicans of ''downright deceptive'' claims
about their plans for drug coverage for senior citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Standing on the Capitol steps, Lieberman said the plan backed by
Republican presidential nominee George W. Bush would ''leave behind
more than half of all senior citizens who have coverage today.'' By
contrast, he said, Al Gore and the Democrats want to offer
protection under Medicare to ''every single senior citizen and
person with disability in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   In response, Republicans accused President Clinton and the
Democrats of stalling.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Dennis Hastert said GOP leaders had made a ''good
effort at trying to do some things to help our seniors.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, ''We're calling on the
president to work with us on getting prescription drug help for
seniors.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman's appearance marked a rare drop-by at the Capitol for
Gore's running mate. His limousine, parked a few feet away,
underscored his new status after 12 years as a rank-and-file
senator from Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   At an appearance billed as a ''unity'' rally, House Democratic
Leader Dick Gephardt and Senate Democratic Leader Tom Daschle
heaped criticism on congressional Republicans, and said Democrats
would press for passage of a prescription drug plan under Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have a group of Republican leaders in Congress who do not
like Medicare, who have never liked Medicare, and a group that
doesn't want prescription drugs delivered through Medicare,'' said
Gephardt.
</P>
<P>
   Daschle accused Republicans of spending millions of dollars on
''misleading campaign ads'' designed to persuade voters the GOP
favors a prescription drug bill.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman said millions of ''middle class Americans are going to
be left without prescription drug coverage'' under Bush's plan.
While Bush criticizes Gore's proposal as a government-run HMO,
Lieberman said the GOP's own claims are ''downright deceptive'' in
the political marketplace of ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Later, at a Democratic National Committee fund-raiser that was
raising more than $1 million for the party, Lieberman listed what
he said were economic achievements by Clinton and Gore and said:
''That doesn't happen by accident and it won't continue by
inertia.''

<HEADLINE> Milosevic Will Take Part in Runoff  </HEADLINE>
By JOVANA GEC
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Slobodan Milosevic deepened the
political crisis in Yugoslavia on Thursday, confirming he will take
part in runoff presidential elections despite claims of a
first-round victory by a pro-democracy challenger and opposition
threats of a general strike.
</P>
<P>
   In a show of confidence, Milosevic summoned his closest
Socialist Party associates for a meeting that focused on
''immediate tasks'' ahead of the Oct. 8 second round of the
presidential vote, government-sponsored television reported.
</P>
<P>
   ''The presidential elections will go into the second round,''
said Milosevic's top aide, Nikola Sainovic. ''We will do our best
so that our candidate wins.''
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic's move signals he has no intention to back down and
recognize an apparent victory of the opposition candidate, Vojislav
Kostunica, as demanded by the opposition and dozens of
international officials, including President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton on Thursday called for lifting economic sanctions
against Yugoslavia once a democratically elected government is
installed in Belgrade. He said in Washington that all NATO nations
should consider removing the sanctions if Milosevic is removed from
power.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we should all say, in unequivocal terms, as soon as
there is democratic government there, the sanctions should be
lifted,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition threatened Thursday to call a general strike,
shutting down schools, offices and other public institutions until
Milosevic steps aside.
</P>
<P>
   The scope of such a boycott is questionable, since the state
services and economy have been in disarray for years. The
opposition has tried public disobedience campaigns in the past, but
they have never really worked.
</P>
<P>
   Announcing final results of the Sunday vote, the Federal
Electoral Commission said just before midnight Wednesday that
Kostunica earned 48.96 percent of the vote to 38.62 percent for
Milosevic. That would require a runoff Oct. 8.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition, however, using figures from its poll watchers,
claims Kostunica won outright. Although it published new figures
late Thursday narrowing the gap, the Kostunica camp still said its
candidate triumphed, winning 51.34 percent to 36.22 percent for
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   ''The election process is going on in accordance with the law,''
Sainovic said dismissing opposition claims. ''The Socialists will
respect the decisions of legal bodies.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics fear Milosevic might cite the ''legality'' of the
federal commission's announcement, and use force against any future
opposition demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   Encouraged by the enormous popular support for Kostunica at an
opposition rally Wednesday, a key opposition leader, Zoran
Djindjic, warned ''we shall seek to paralyze all institutions,
schools, theaters, cinemas, offices ... call everyone onto the
streets and stay on the streets until he who wants to be president
by force gives up his post.''
</P>
<P>
   Key officials in Kostunica's coalition conducted emergency
talks. In a statement issued after the meeting they pledged to
''defend the truth and the democratic will of our people,'' but
failed to outline any specific strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Declaring that ''Kostunica was elected Yugoslav president in the
first round of the elections,'' the opposition leaders once again
called on the members of the Federal Electoral Commission to
''publicly acknowledge the true election results.''
</P>
<P>
   The influential Serbian Orthodox Church recognized Kostunica's
election victory and addressed him as ''president-elect.'' The
church holds no direct political power in Yugoslavia, but its
dictates hold great moral sway in a population that recognizes it
as a pillar of rectitude in a corrupt society.
</P>
<P>
   In Montenegro, the pro-Western Prime Minister Filip Vujanovic
also recognized Kostunica's win, insisting that Milosevic must no
longer manipulate the will of the people.
</P>
<P>
   Support for Kostunica's victory claim grew after more than
200,000 people swarmed the capital's downtown district in a major
demonstration of support for their leader. There was no visible
police presence near the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Belgrade's ally Russia, however, warned Western countries not to
interfere. Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov said Moscow ''stands firmly
for the peoples of Yugoslavia to have full freedom to express their
will without internal or external pressure'' and urged other
countries ''not to allow destabilization of the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic faced new troubles, meanwhile, within his governing
coalition. The ultranationalist Serb Radical Party demanded a
reshuffling of the government and the dismissal of a key Milosevic
aide, Interior Minister Vlajko Stojiljkovic.
</P>
<P>
   The party's leader, Vojislav Seselj, said he will demand
Stojiljkovic's resignation at the assembly meeting Saturday because
of his alleged corruption, misuse of authority and incompetence.
</P>
<P>
   Stojiljkovic is a top aide of Milosevic. After the bloody
offensives last year by Serb government troops against ethnic
Albanian separatists in the province of Kosovo, both were indicted
by the U.N. war crimes tribunal in The Hague, Netherlands.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Governor OKs Open Primary Law  </HEADLINE>
By SCOTT LINDLAW
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, California (AP) -- Gov. Gray Davis signed legislation
Thursday allowing California's independent voters to participate in
primary elections, moving to salvage remnants of a wide-open
candidate selection process thrown out by the U.S. Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   The ''blanket'' system approved by voters in 1996 -- which
allowed voters to choose any candidate, regardless of party
affiliation -- was overturned in June.
</P>
<P>
   The new law permits independent voters to participate in
primaries, but limits them to voting only for one party's
candidates. It takes effect next year, and its effect will be felt
in 2002, when Davis and other statewide officials will face
re-election.
</P>
<P>
   Allowing independents to vote, however, would ultimately be left
to the political parties. Both Republicans and Democrats signaled
on Thursday a readiness to accept the new system.
</P>
<P>
   Voters registered with a party will once again be permitted only
to choose candidates affiliated with their party.
</P>
<P>
   ''While this bill will not fully reinstate the open primary, it
will ensure broader participation in primary elections than voters
would otherwise enjoy,'' the Democratic governor said.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic and Republican parties bitterly fought the
blanket primary system, contending it weakened the parties in the
candidate selection process by giving a voice to independents and
even members of the opposing party.
</P>
<P>
   Independents account for 2 million of the state's 14.6 million
registered voters, and their numbers have grown steadily in the
last two decades. With passage of the new law, independents become
California's most hotly pursued bloc in primary season, along with
Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent survey, the Public Policy Institute of California
found 35 percent of independent voters drawn to Democrats, 31
percent to Republicans and 30 percent to neither, said pollster
Mark Baldassare.
</P>
<P>
   State GOP Chairman John McGraw has endorsed the new open
primary, and the party will vote on it at a February gathering.
Democrats also approve and are expected to formally accept it at a
December meeting.

<HEADLINE> African Refugee Worker Freed  </HEADLINE>
By JONATHAN PAYE-LAYLEH
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONROVIA, Liberia (AP) -- Her leg bandaged after days of walking
in the jungle, a U.N. refugee worker resurfaced Thursday after
being abducted in the same raid that killed a U.N. colleague.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities offered no immediate explanation for how Sapeu
Laurence Djeya, 37, escaped those who captured her Sept. 17.
</P>
<P>
   ''Thank God for life, and I want to thank my colleagues who were
concerned about me,'' Djeya told reporters in the Liberian capital,
Monrovia, after soldiers handed her over to the Ivory Coast consul
and U.N. staff.
</P>
<P>
   Djeya, based in Abidjan, Ivory Coast, wore a bandage on her
right ankle, and walked about to ease her legs before boarding a
plane back to Abidjan.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. refugee agency said her feet were swollen, apparently
from her trek.
</P>
<P>
   Djeya disappeared after delivering supplies to a UNHCR base in
the town of Macenta, Guinea. Liberian Information Minister Joe
Mulbah on Thursday blamed ''Guinean dissidents'' for the
kidnapping.
</P>
<P>
   The head of the U.N. refugee agency operation in Macenta, Mensah
Kpognon, was killed in the same attack.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees withdrew all its field
personnel in Guinea to the capital, Conakry, following the attack.
</P>
<P>
   Kpognon's death, and the murder of three UNHCR workers in West
Timor earlier this month, prompted marches and rallies by U.N.
humanitarian workers around the world to demand better protection
for staff working in dangerous situations.
</P>
<P>
   High Commissioner Sadako Ogata welcomed the release, saying she
was ''enormously relieved and very grateful to all those who
contributed to bring Laurence to safety.''
</P>
<P>
   The episode occurred near the border of Liberia and Guinea,
which has seen rising violence in recent weeks. Military activity
has increased following a crackdown by Guinea on the hundreds of
thousands of refugees who have taken shelter in that country from
wars in Liberia and Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, the U.N. Security Council expressed concern about
the very serious situation around Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone
after a briefing by the U.N. Secretariat.
</P>
<P>
   According to the U.N. refugee agency and Liberian authorities,
Djeya and five refugees in Guinea walked for days before reaching
Liberia's northern district of Zorzor -- scene of alleged
cross-border shelling by forces in Guinea over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Liberian soldiers rescued her there, bringing her to Monrovia.

<HEADLINE> Airline Passenger Possibly Provoked  </HEADLINE>
By L. ANNE NEWELL
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- A 19-year-old man who flew into a rage
during a Southwest Airlines flight and died after being subdued by
passengers may have been provoked by the flight crew, passengers
told police.
</P>
<P>
   ''Several passengers stated that the flight crew antagonized the
young man and that intensified his anger,'' according to the Salt
Lake City Airport Police incident report, obtained Thursday by The
Associated Press. Names of the passengers were not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Burton of Las Vegas became combative 20 minutes before
the flight was due to land, screaming obscenities, hitting other
passengers and pounding a hole in the locked cockpit door. As many
as eight of the plane's 120 passengers subdued him and held him
down until the Aug. 11 flight arrived in Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   Burton died after being removed from the plane and an autopsy
determined that he was killed by the passengers. Federal
prosecutors have said they will not file criminal charges.
</P>
<P>
   One passenger contacted Thursday agreed that flight attendants
may have provoked the man after his initial outburst.
</P>
<P>
   Anne Crawford, 41, of Barstow, Calif., said that after Burton
attacked the cockpit door, passengers succeeded in getting him back
to his seat and calming him. She said a flight attendant then
loudly announced that another passenger, an off-duty police
officer, would take care of the situation.
</P>
<P>
   ''She was standing next to me when she was making the
announcement and I was just cringing in my seat because they had
pretty much calmed him down,'' said Crawford, who was seated two
rows behind Burton.
</P>
<P>
   Burton punched the officer in the face, Crawford said.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was calm, he seemed like he was going to relax, but then he
went into this fit again,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Rutherford, a Southwest spokeswoman, said flight
attendants are trained to deal with unruly passengers.
</P>
<P>
   ''We feel our flight crew did exactly what they needed to do get
that plane on the ground, and that the passengers who were
restraining Mr. Burton did what they thought they had to do to keep
him from moving again,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Burton's family has hired an attorney for possible legal action.
That attorney did not return telephone messages on Thursday and the
family did not return calls.
</P>
<P>
   Crawford denied passengers used excessive force to restrain
Burton.
</P>
<P>
   ''Was there force? You bet. He was strong, he had the strength
of a mad man,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Cheney Promises Stronger Military  </HEADLINE>
By BILL KACZOR
<TEXT>
<P>
   PENSACOLA, Fla. (AP) -- Dick Cheney promised a stronger military
but said Thursday that specifics from him and George W. Bush on
achieving that would have to come later.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican vice presidential candidate repeatedly was
interrupted by chants of ''No more Gore'' from about 1,000 people
after being introduced by Bush's brother, Florida Gov. Jeb Bush,
during a campaign rally at Pensacola Junior College in this Navy
town.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney, who was defense secretary under President Bush, the Bush
brothers' father, said it takes many years to develop and produce
weapons. He recalled telephoning former President Reagan after the
Persian Gulf War in 1991 to thank him for the military buildup he
began in the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wonder if any future secretary of defense is ever going to
call (President) Clinton or Al Gore?'' Cheney asked as the crowd
cheered.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bush began a post-Cold War military reduction, Cheney
contended that additional cuts have been too deep under Clinton and
Vice President Gore, the Democratic presidential nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney said later that the Republican ticket has not yet put a
final dollar figure on what it would propose to do. Gore has
proposed adding $100 billion in new defense spending to an existing
$300 billion annual budget.
</P>
<P>
   ''The governor said he's got a lot of things he'd like to do,''
Cheney said. ''One is to review our worldwide commitments and
decide which ones we definitely want to keep.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Bush also wants to examine procurement for possible
spending cuts, and he noted that the Joint Chiefs of Staff, in
congressional testimony Wednesday, favored more base closings.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney said he expects the next administration will seek
authorization from Congress for another round of base closing.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would not argue there's no savings to be had in a $300
billion budget,'' Cheney said. ''What the governor's talking about
is sort of leapfrogging, if you will, to the next generation. That
is, thinking in terms of what we want the force to look like 30 or
40 years down the road.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheney did mention spending $20 billion for research and
development. He also reaffirmed his support for two new major
weapons programs: the Air Force's F-22 Raptor fighter and the
Navy's F/A-18E&AMP;F Super Hornet fighter-bomber. He said those were
his top priorities as secretary of defense.
</P>
<P>
   As he began to address the crowd, Cheney asked for minute of
silence for two aviators who died when a training plane from
Pensacola Naval Air Station crashed Wednesday in southern Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're safer because of their service,'' Cheney said.
</P>
<P>
   Before the rally, he accepted an endorsement on behalf of the
Republican ticket from the Florida Association of State Troopers.
Florida Highway Patrol Sgt. Mike Kirby, chairman of the
association, said it was the first time FAST had made a national
political endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney also attended a fund-raising cocktail party before
heading for Jacksonville.

<HEADLINE> Clinton: N. Ireland Involvement Good  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton said Thursday he was glad he
decided to involve the United States in the Northern Ireland peace
process, calling the decision ''a sea change in American foreign
policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spoke at a fund-raiser for Rep. Richard Neil, D-Mass., a
strong backer of the peace accords who praised Clinton for going
against the wishes of the State Department and granting a visa to
Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The president said it ''was a sea change in American foreign
policy getting involved in the Irish peace process. We're not
entirely there yet.''
</P>
<P>
   He thanked those on stage with him for their support, including
Neil, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., and a Republican, Rep. Peter
King of New York, who is a friend of Neil.
</P>
<P>
   The president went through a litany of his campaign
accomplishments, and urged the crowd to return congressional
Democrats to the majority.
</P>
<P>
   ''In my lifetime, we never had a chance like this. We never had
so much prosperity and social progress, and the absence of an
internal crisis,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Neil, first elected in 1988, is unopposed in his re-election
race.

<HEADLINE> McCain Raps Bush As Well As Gore  </HEADLINE>
By RON FOURNIER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- John McCain said Thursday ''it was a mistake''
for George W. Bush to reject his challenge to ban soft money from
the presidential race against Democrat Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Bush advisers said they were frustrated with McCain for forcing
the issue of campaign finance reform into the race by seeking a
voluntary ban on the unlimited, unregulated donations. Gore
accepted McCain's proposal, and Republican strategists said the
whole episode could complicate Bush's efforts -- just as he has been
rising in polls.
</P>
<P>
   Climbing back into the political ring after a cancer scare, the
Arizona senator has seized the spotlight with attacks against bad
movies, flawed tires, wasteful spending and, most notably, the
fund-raising practices of both presidential nominees.
</P>
<P>
   Accepting a soft money ban ''would have been a major step toward
ridding the political system of its most pernicious evil -- and
that's unregulated donations,'' the senator said Thursday in a
telephone interview that also included a harsh assessment of Gore's
''reprehensible'' record on campaign fund-raising.
</P>
<P>
   After Democrat Hillary Rodham Clinton and Republican Rep. Rick
Lazio agreed to ban soft money from their New York senate race,
McCain and Democratic Sen. Russell Feingold of Wisconsin decided to
seek voluntary bans in all federal races, including the
presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   A letter proposing the ban was sent to both Gore and Bush with
little notice before it became public -- a point that upset some
senior campaign advisers in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Gore quickly accepted. McCain's advisers said they urged Bush's
team to enter into discussions about a possible ban to keep Gore
from grandstanding on the issue, but the idea was firmly rejected.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would have liked for him to accept our offer and I feel it
was a mistake not to,'' McCain said in an interview arranged by
aides to discuss his post-surgery agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'll continue to try'' to get soft money out of the
presidential race, ''but obviously we were dealt a setback'' by
Bush, said McCain, who gave Bush his stiffest challenge in this
year's GOP primaries.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said that for one thing, he wasn't sure he could trust Gore
to live up to any such agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said Thursday the offer was still open and that having
McCain and Feingold as ''arbiters'' of any deal should erase
questions about trust.
</P>
<P>
   ''Does he trust John McCain and Russ Feingold?'' Gore
rhetorically asked in an appearance on CNN's ''Larry King Live.''
</P>
<P>
   On a related matter, Gore shrugged off questions raised about
overnight visits in the White House by financial contributors to
President Clinton and his wife, Hillary.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he would allow such visits if he wins the election, he
said: ''If somebody is a close friend who is also a campaign
supporter, yes.''
</P>
<P>
   Pressed if he would do the same for someone who is a financial
contributor but not a close friend, Gore hesitated, shrugged and
said no.
</P>
<P>
   Saving his harshest criticism for the vice president, McCain
dismissed suggestions that Gore would benefit from accepting the
ban.
</P>
<P>
   ''The vice president's record on this is reprehensible. They've
debased the institutions of government and that kind of activity
continues with Hillary Rodham Clinton, who is renting out the
Lincoln bedroom.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush advisers said privately that McCain gave Gore an opening to
throw the Texan off-message and inoculate himself against the
Clinton-Gore fund-raising controversies.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'd rather be talking about education reform and issues that
count,'' said Ron Kaufman, former political director for President
Bush and a Washington ally of the Texas governor. Still, he said
voters will view Gore's pledge as insincere and ''this McCain thing
could backfire.''
</P>
<P>
   For Bush to accept the ban would be a strategic mistake, GOP
analysts said, because the most recent financial reports show Gore
with a $10 million cash advantage; that means Bush is more reliant
than Gore on soft money spending by the GOP and outside interest
groups. In addition, the GOP has a multimillion dollar soft money
advantage over the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said Wednesday he would consider a voluntary ban but
expressed strong skepticism that Gore would live up to the
agreement, and aides said the remarks amounted to a rejection of
McCain's proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ''The governor wants to ban soft money but there's no reason to
believe Al Gore would abide by a handshake agreement when he has a
hard time abiding by the laws of the land,'' said Ed Gillespie, a
top Bush adviser.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who said he is fully recovered from skin cancer surgery,
said the soft money fight is only part of his agenda as chairman of
the Commerce Committee. He said he's also focused on improving the
way Hollywood markets its entertainment to youngsters and the
investigation into fatal accidents involving Firestone tires.

<HEADLINE> Congress OKs Prisoner-Doctor Bill  </HEADLINE>
By JESSE J. HOLLAND
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal prisoners who can afford it would be
forced to pay for visits to jailhouse doctors, with most of the
money going to crime victims, under a bill headed to President
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate passed the bill unanimously late Thursday without
debate. The House approved it Sept. 19.
</P>
<P>
   ''The free health care currently enjoyed by federal prisoners is
an offense to every law-abiding, hard-working American taxpayer who
struggles to make ends meet,'' said Rep. Matt Salmon, R-Ariz.,
during the House debate. ''It is time to end the free ride for
federal prisoners by requiring them to contribute to the costs of
their own care.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the bill, inmates in federal prison cannot be refused
treatment because they cannot pay the fee. But those who can afford
to pay must be charged at least $1 for most doctor visits,
lawmakers said.
</P>
<P>
   That fee will mostly go to pay restitution to crime victims,
lawmakers said.
</P>
<P>
   The bill will also help ensure prisoners do not abuse their free
health system, lawmakers said.
</P>
<P>
   The Bureau of Prisons has told Congress ''it believes some
inmates often sign up for sick call as a way of getting out of
other responsibilities,'' said Rep. Edward Pease, R-Ind. ''This fee
will also help deter inmates from abusing the system in that
manner.''
</P>
<P>
   The fee cannot be assessed for Bureau of Prison-required health
care or for treatment of chronic infectious diseases, mental health
care, or substance abuse treatment, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone was happy with the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ''Discouraging prisoners from getting necessary health care
services by charging a co-pay violates the government's
constitutional obligation to provide such services,'' said Rep.
Bobby Scott, D-Va.

<HEADLINE> Probe Focuses on Greek Ferry Sinking  </HEADLINE>
By LISA ORKIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   PAROS, Greece (AP) -- Four officers and crew members were charged
with murder Thursday over a ferry sinking that killed at least 66
people, but one of the suspects blamed bad weather for the
disaster.
</P>
<P>
   ''Bad weather stopped us turning the boat,'' said Anastasios
Psychoyos, captain's deputy of the Express Samina, which crashed
into rocks Tuesday just outside the main port of this resort
island.
</P>
<P>
   ''The weather pushed us on the rocks. We had maintained a safe
distance,'' he told reporters, without giving further details.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators are also examining reports that essential crewmen
left the bridge to watch a soccer match -- a charge Psychoyos also
denied.
</P>
<P>
   The Express Samina had more than 500 people aboard when it sank
in rough seas. But government officials said the crew acted with
''criminal negligence'' since the rocky islets were well-marked and
carried a light beacon.
</P>
<P>
   The ferry's operating company, Minoan Flying Dolphins, has
blamed the accident on the captain. But the company's safety record
is coming under increased scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   Late Thursday, another Minoan ferry, the Express Artemis,
collided into the harbor wall on the island of Naxos, neighboring
Paros, the merchant marine ministry said.
</P>
<P>
   The ship suffered minor damage and there were no injuries, the
ministry said.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's accident drew attention to Greece's aging fleet of
ships, many used on busy tourist routes. An appeals court
prosecutor late Thursday ordered random safety inspections at large
ports to begin immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you check all the ferries, I imagine that only one or two
are above standard. If you report a problem you're in danger of
losing your job,'' said Yannis Manousoyannakis, leader of the Greek
Seamens Union.
</P>
<P>
   Another maritime union described the sunken ferry as a ''rusting
hulk.'' But the coast guard said the 34-year-old ship had been
inspected earlier this month and found seaworthy.
</P>
<P>
   Ferries must be decommissioned after 35 years, and the Express
Samina was to be pulled from service next year. About 18 vessels
are over 29 years of age in Greece's coastal fleet of some 130
ferry boats.
</P>
<P>
   A search operation on Paros failed to find any more bodies or
survivors Thursday. Rough seas prevented navy divers from searching
the sunken ferry.
</P>
<P>
   Eight people are officially listed as missing, but rescuers said
there could be up to 14. Among the 473 survivors, 108 foreigners
were left without belongings and travel papers, most wearing
clothes donated by islanders.
</P>
<P>
   They were from Australia, Austria, Albania, Belgium, Britain,
Canada, Egypt, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, New Zealand, Russia,
South Africa, Saudi Arabia, Switzerland, Ukraine and the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   The Express Samina left the Athens' port of Piraeus on Tuesday
afternoon, on a six-stop route, starting from Paros and ending at
the tiny Lipsis islands near the Turkish coast.
</P>
<P>
   The 345-foot, 4,407-ton ferry rammed into the Portes islets,
just two miles from Paros' main port.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is inconceivable that lives were lost this way,'' said
government spokesman Tilemahos Hitiris.
</P>
<P>
   The ship's captain Vassilis Yannakis, his deputy, Psychoyos, and
two crewmen were transported to the island of Syros to be formally
charged with five felonies by a regional prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   The charges included multiple counts of homicide with possible
malice, causing serious bodily injuries with possible malice,
violating maritime regulations, violating international regulations
on avoiding an accident, and sinking a ship.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing for the first time in public since the accident, the
ship's captain looked pale and exhausted, and could barely speak.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am very upset,'' Yannakis told reporters. ''I have been at
sea for nearly 50 years.''

FDA Approves Abortion Pill
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Capping a bitter 12-year battle, the government today
approved use of the abortion pill RU-486, a major victory for abortion-rights
advocates that could dramatically alter abortion in this country. The
long-expected decision by the Food and Drug Administration allows Americans an
early-abortion method already used in France, Britain, China and 10 other
countries. The action is expected to make abortion in the United States more

   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) -- Danish voters on Thursday rejected the European
Union's common currency in favor of keeping the 125-year-old krone. The

on euro adoption -- was an embarrassment to the European Union which has pressed
for a monetary union. ''The Commission regrets this decision,'' said Romano
Prodi, president of the EU's executive commission. ''I firmly believe that a

Maximum Age at Death Trending Higher
</SUBHEAD>

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In the 1860s, the oldest person to die each year in Sweden
was about 100. Last year, that age had risen to 108. Researchers are finding
this trend in all industrialized countries and say the very old may get even
older. Plotting the increasing maximum age of death among the Swedes, says
researcher John R. Wilmoth, suggests the life span of humans is expanding and
that there is no clear upper limit. Wilmoth, a researcher at the University of

<HEADLINE> Lazio seeks to improve image upstate  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) - Rep. Rick Lazio sought Thursday to step up
his campaign in crucial upstate New York where Hillary Rodham
Clinton has been making surprising inroads, seeking to convince
voters he understood the economic pain that still existed in the
region.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican congressman had come under fire for earlier
statements that western New York's struggling economy had turned
the corner.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech to Buffalo's Rotary Club, Lazio noted that over the
last 18 months, the region had seen a net job gain of about 11,000
jobs. But he pointedly added, ''I know that the recovery here
hasn't reached every single family.''
</P>
<P>
   When someone in the audience suggested that he might be a
different kind of carpetbagger who would forget western New York
once the election against Democrat Clinton was over, Lazio said:
''I don't think of Long Island as my home. I think of New York as
my home.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio, the Republican Senate candidate, had been criticized by
Clinton's campaign, the Buffalo News editorial page and even some
Republicans for painting a rosy picture of the upstate economy
during the candidates' first debate in Buffalo two weeks ago and in
earlier appearances in the region.
</P>
<P>
   The Lazio camp made it clear that the candidate's comments were
part of a stepped up effort to win support in traditionally more
conservative upstate New York. His campaign plans to redirect
advertising dollars to the region and have him spend more time
there. His comments Thursday came as he kicked off a three-day bus
tour through upstate New York.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, a poll from the Quinnipiac University Polling
Institute showed Clinton leading Lazio, 50 percent to 43 percent,
statewide. The poll also showed Clinton running Lazio almost even
in the upstate area.
</P>
<P>
   A Newsday/WB11 poll first released Thursday night had Clinton
leading Lazio 52 percent to 42 percent. The poll of 1,100 people
had a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio also criticized the National Abortion Rights Action League
of New York, which said Thursday that it intends to violate the
soft-money ban reached by Lazio and Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think it's in the spirit of the agreement. I think
Mrs. Clinton should condemn it,'' Lazio said.
</P>
<P>
   Kelli Conlin, head of NARAL-NY, said Thursday that the ban on
television and radio ads paid for by outside groups in the Senate
campaign ''is a violation of our First Amendment rights to free
speech.''
</P>
<P>
   Conlin showed a TV ad the group has produced criticizing Lazio's
stands on abortion rights. NARAL-NY has not yet bought air time for
the ad, but Conlin said eventually it would.
</P>
<P>
   NARAL-NY has endorsed Clinton, and bought air time earlier in
the campaign for a different anti-Lazio ad.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Clinton and Lazio made a deal prohibiting their
respective political parties from using unregulated campaign
donations to purchase TV and radio ads to boost their candidacies.
Both Clinton and Lazio asked other independent groups to abide by
the deal.
</P>
<P>
   But Conlin said her group is ''not beholden to any candidate.
... Our purpose is to preserve abortion rights.''
</P>
<P>
   NARAL-NY is nonpartisan. Before Lazio entered the race, the
group had declined to make an endorsement because the previous
Republican candidate, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, was considered by
NARAL to have as strong a record on abortion rights as Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio has repeatedly said that he supports abortion rights, but
he has voted against Medicaid funding for abortion for low-income
women, and more significantly for abortion-rights supporters, Lazio
has said he would not use Roe v. Wade as a litmus test in approving
Supreme Court justices. Clinton has committed to voting only for
nominees to the high court who vow to uphold abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's campaign manager Bill deBlasio said the campaign sent
NARAL a letter Wednesday asking the group ''to respect the
agreement that we came to, reminding them that it's something
Hillary cares about deeply.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spokeswoman Cathie Levine added that ''NARAL has a lot
at stake in this election and we appreciate that to date they have
abided by Hillary's request.''
</P>
<P>
   Until NARAL buys the air time, it has not technically broken the
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Clinton's campaign unveiled a new statewide ad that
began airing Thursday. The ad touted Clinton's tax-cut initiatives
and bashed Lazio's tax plan as a clone of Republican presidential
candidate George W. Bush's.
</P>
<P>
   The soft-money ban does not apply to ads the campaigns
themselves produce using so-called hard money, which consists of
$1,000 individual donations.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio tried to walk a fine line Thursday when asked if he felt
Bush should take up Vice President Al Gore's offer to implement a
soft-money ban modeled on the New York version for the presidential
race.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would like to see every campaign in America have a
soft-money ban,'' Lazio said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has said he doesn't trust Gore enough to enter into such an
agreement.

<HEADLINE> Peru Congress To Dismantle Agency  </HEADLINE>
By RICK VECCHIO
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- The Peruvian Congress voted to dismantle the
country's National Intelligence Service, which for a decade served
as the power base of now-exiled spy chief Vladimiro Montesinos.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers on Thursday voted 101 to one, with one abstention, to
deactivate within 15 days what has become Peru's most vilified
institution.
</P>
<P>
   Hours after the vote, some 2,500 laborers, teachers and students
marched to the Government Palace, demanding President Alberto
Fujimori's immediate resignation and the extradition of his
intelligence adviser from Panama to face corruption charges.
</P>
<P>
   The march, the largest of several demonstrations Thursday in
Peru's major cities, was peaceful. Riot police lined the front
gates of the palace while banner-waving protesters chanted
''Justice and jail for the Mafioso Montesinos.''
</P>
<P>
   ''There is widespread corruption, so deeply institutionalized
that this government no longer makes sense,'' said Jose Luis Risco,
president of the General Confederation of Peruvian Workers, an
umbrella group of unions and labor federations.
</P>
<P>
   Peru's spy agency administered an extensive intelligence network
credited by many with crippling leftist insurgencies and combatting
narcotics trafficking in the early years of Fujimori's decade in
power. But in recent years, it earned a darker reputation as a
Gestapo-like police force, accused of human rights abuses and of
bending Peru's democratic institutions to Fujimori's will.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori announced Sept. 16 that he was ending his 10-year
presidency with new elections and would call for the deactivation
of Montesinos' espionage agency after a videotape showed the
intelligence adviser apparently bribing an opposition lawmaker.
</P>
<P>
   The decision caused an apparent power struggle between Fujimori
and his once-trusted aide, who fled Peru on Sunday to seek
political asylum in Panama.
</P>
<P>
   At least 10 lawmakers have abandoned Fujimori's Peru 2000 party
since the corruption scandal began, depriving him of the majority
in the 120-seat legislature that he has used for most of the last
decade to pass laws at will.

<HEADLINE> Philly Imposes New Teacher Salaries  </HEADLINE>
By DAN ROBRISH
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The city school board imposed new salaries
and working conditions on 21,000 teachers in the nation's
fifth-largest school district after negotiators failed to reach a
contract agreement Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Philadelphia Board of Education unanimously approved the new
financial package at the recommendation of Mayor John Street, who
set a 7 p.m. deadline for a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   The Philadelphia Federation of Teachers had threatened its first
strike since 1981 if Street unilaterally imposed the new terms,
potentially idling 210,000 pupils. But union officials did not
immediately call a walkout Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have all kinds of options to look at. What we do or what
happens will be on the head of the mayor,'' chief negotiator Linda
Harris said.
</P>
<P>
   The union must give two days' notice of a strike, so the
earliest teachers could be out of school is Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The new terms would extend the school day by one hour and the
school year by two days, give principals more say over where
teachers are assigned and implement a merit pay system in which
teachers whose pupils are doing well are paid more money.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange, the teachers would get a $500 bonus and a raise of
17 percent over five years, Street said. The union said the terms
would impose longer hours for teachers without enough of a pay
increase.
</P>
<P>
   The teachers have been working without a contract since Sept.
11, when a court-mandated contract extension expired. The two sides
have been negotiating since January.
</P>
<P>
   Street said he met with union president Ted Kirsch for about an
hour Thursday night but failed to reach an agreement before the
school board's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm disappointed but I'm not surprised. We're in very
different places in some significant ways,'' Street told KYW Radio
at City Hall. He said he would meet with union leaders again after
this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Under a two-year-old state law, the old contract cannot be
extended. Rather than risk a state takeover of the school system,
union members decided to work without a contract for the first time
in 35 years.
</P>
<P>
   The law allows Street to unilaterally impose a new contract, but
he had been trying to avoid such a step.
</P>
<P>
   More than 1,000 teachers chanted ''We want a contract'' and
''Where's our respect'' and held signs outside the Board of
Education building.
</P>
<P>
   ''We know we're never going to get paid what the suburban
teachers get, but we deserve something fair if he wants us to work
the extra hour'' said fourth-year teacher Christine Patrone.
</P>
<P>
   School Board President Pedro Ramos said the new terms were
approved despite widespread teacher opposition because the city
wants to begin negotiating with state lawmakers for next year's
funding.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've been working on school reforms for a long time the
planning and implementation has to start now,'' Ramos said.

<HEADLINE> Monroe Independence Party leader to quit  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) - The chairman of the Monroe County
Independence Party said he's quitting the party he helped launch to
join the growing ranks of unaffiliated American voters.
</P>
<P>
   David Stockmeister of Rochester on Thursday called the
Democratic and Republican parties mirror images of one another and
said the national Reform Party the Independents had been associated
with was ''a joke.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the Independence Party had proven no better, and that he
had decided to register blank for next year's election.
</P>
<P>
   ''The party seems to have gravitated toward an affection with
Lenora Fulani who has declared herself a Marxist,'' he said. ''I do
not wish to be affiliated with or associated with that element.''
Fulani has been a perennial candidate of the left-leaning New
Alliance Party for everything from governor to president.
</P>
<P>
   Stockmeister was key among those who founded what became the
state's third largest political party in Rochester in 1994. The
party was meant to offer a middle-of-the-road alternative to
traditional conservative or liberal views.
</P>
<P>
   His decision follows Sunday's statewide Independence Party
meeting, which he did not attend. The meeting ended with party
members giving their presidential ballet line to John Hagelin of
Fairfield, Iowa and then voting to sever all ties with the national
Reform Party.
</P>
<P>
   Rivals for the ballet line had included Ralph Nader and Pat
Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   State party chairman Frank MacKay of Suffolk County said he was
saddened by Stockmeister's decision but downplayed Fulani's role in
it. In reality, MacKay said, the decision was a reflection of the
party's expansion beyond its Rochester roots to include downstate
members such as Fulani.
</P>
<P>
   ''Right now it's spread out and the balance of power is
excellent,'' Mackay said.

<HEADLINE> Heffner pleads not guilty to sexual abuse charges  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   Troy, N.Y. (AP) - A 39-year-old former teacher's aide pleaded
innocent in Rensselaer County Court Thursday to charges she
sexually abused one of her former students.
</P>
<P>
   A seven-count misdemeanor indictment charges Diane Heffner with
six counts of second-degree sexual abuse and one count of
endangering the welfare of a child.
</P>
<P>
   Heffner is accused of having inappropriate phone conversations
with a 12-year-old boy who was a student at Poestenkill schools.
The boy's parents taped three conversations between the two on May
17th and 18th.
</P>
<P>
   In those tapes, Heffner told the boy she loved him and would one
day sleep with him.
</P>
<P>
   Three dozen supporters filled the courtroom during the
arraignment wearing white ribbons depicting Heffner's innocence.

<HEADLINE> Despite more dead crows, state says West Nile virus has not spread  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN P. McALPIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - More dead crows infected with the West Nile
virus have been found, but state health officials said Thursday the
fatal disease has not spread in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   An 82-year-old man from Little Falls in Passaic County was the
first person in the nation to die from the mosquito-borne disease
this year. State officials announced his death Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Another person is being tested for the disease. That brings the
total number of human patients who have been tested for the virus
to 39, Health Department officials announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Four people including the man who died Sept. 14 have tested
positive. Another 16 were cleared and 19 are still waiting for
results.
</P>
<P>
   All those tested had symptoms of the disease and all are from
areas in New Jersey where the virus has been found in animals or
mosquito pools.
</P>
<P>
   Infected crows have been found in 16 of the state's 21 counties.
</P>
<P>
   Six horses have also tested positive, two each in Atlantic and
Sussex counties and one each in Cape May and Ocean counties.
</P>
<P>
   State labs logged 93 more infected crows, bringing the total to
931 birds, Health Department spokesman Dennis McGowan said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   All of those crows were found in counties that already have
reported infected birds, McGowan said.
</P>
<P>
   Health officials expect reports of the virus to drop as the
temperatures do the same, McGowan said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It does help. Mosquitoes become less active in cool weather,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Of course, the first hard frost will officially end the
season,'' McGowan said.
</P>
<P>
   Other victims in New Jersey are a 72-year-old Bayonne woman, a
43-year-old Jersey City man and a 54-year-old man with dual
residency in Brooklyn, N.Y., and Cliffside Park.
</P>
<P>
   There have been seven cases of human infection in New York City
this year. The virus caused 62 human cases of encephalitis and
seven deaths in New York last year.
</P>
<P>
   Residents are urged to protect themselves from mosquito bites by
wearing long clothing and insect repellant. People have been told
to clear all pools of standing water where mosquitoes breed.
</P>
<P>
   The virus is transmitted through the bite of mosquitoes, which
acquire it by feeding on infected birds. Generally, it causes
flulike symptoms or no problems at all, but it can be dangerous to
young children, the elderly and anyone with a weakened immune
system.
</P>
<P>
   Little Falls Mayor Eugene Kulick announced officials will hold a
town meeting Saturday at the municipal building to address concerns
about the local man's death from the virus. Local and state health
officials will answer residents' questions.
</P>
<P>
   All 21 counties in the state have increased mosquito-control
efforts, state officials said. Many of those programs include
spraying pesticides to kill the mosquitoes at various stages of
development.
</P>
<P>
   Infected birds have been found in Bergen (188), Burlington (6),
Camden (3), Cape May (2), Essex (94), Gloucester (2), Hudson (61),
Hunterdon (3), Mercer (7), Middlesex (199), Monmouth (139), Morris
(33), Ocean (11), Passaic (69), Somerset (16) and Union (98)
counties.

<HEADLINE> Study: Ethnic Disparities in Lending  </HEADLINE>
By KIMBERLY LAMKE
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Despite the rise in homeownership across the
country, blacks and Latinos were nearly twice as likely to be
turned down for mortgage loans than whites, according to a study
released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Discrimination based on ethnicity or income, known as redlining,
in the mortgage industry is just bad as it has ever been, according
to the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now, or
ACORN.
</P>
<P>
   ''The banks have said, 'The numbers are changing, there's less
discrimination than before,' but this study shows that that's not
really the case,'' Rebekah Kebede, a spokeswoman for ACORN's
Sacramento office, said in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   ''People need to call them on what they're doing. People need to
say 'We know that you are discriminating, we notice,''' Kebede
said.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide in 1999, blacks were denied mortgages 54 percent of
the time, while Latinos were denied 39 percent of the time and
whites were denied mortgages 27 percent of the time, the study
found.
</P>
<P>
   ACORN, an advocacy group for low- and middle-income people,
analyzed data from the Federal Financial Institutions Examination
Council about the lending activity of 7,800 institutions covered
under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, more loans to all ethnic groups were granted in 1999 as
compared to previous years but there was no significant improvement
in the number of loans to ethnic minorities, ACORN said.
</P>
<P>
   ''About 95 percent of the increase in loans to minorities were
increases in higher cost, subprime loans, or lenders giving loans
to minorities with higher interest rates than conventional loans,''
Kebede said. ''That's not really an improvement at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Banking industry executives said the numbers were deceiving.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think there are dramatic improvements,'' said James
Ballentine, director of the Center for Community Development at the
American Banking Association. ''This is a very competitive market
and lenders are reaching out more than ever to everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Many lenders have programs to reach all potential homeowners,
such as educational seminars to teach people how to improve their
credit in order to qualify for loans, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The ACORN study fails to recognize that with lenders receiving
more mortgage applications, there will be more rejections,
Ballentine said.
</P>
<P>
   Loans are generally approved based on the ratio of income to
debt and the value of the property for sale, which the study did
not examine, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's also difficult to look at the study and determine the
debt levels and credit histories of the people who applied and were
denied,'' Ballentine said.
</P>
<P>
   The Home Mortgage Disclosure Act statistics report only the
ethnicity, gender and income of those who applied for mortgages and
the percentage of loans granted and denied.

<HEADLINE> Auction of fiberglass cows nets over $1.3 million   </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - An auction of some of the bovine beauties that
were stationed around the city this summer has netted more than
$1.3 million for a variety of charities.
</P>
<P>
   Seventy-five of the fiberglass cow statues were auctioned on
Thursday night, with a total sale of $1,354,000, said a spokesman
for CowParade New York 2000. The highest seller was Tiffany Cow, a
statue of a sitting cow done in the style of a Tiffany
stained-glass lamp. It went for $60,000.
</P>
<P>
   The benefits of the live auction will go to The City Parks
Foundation, God's Love We Deliver, Hale House, Citymeals-on-Wheels,
New Yorkers for Children, and The Center for Arts Education.
</P>
<P>
   CowParade featured 500 life-sized cows, decorated in an array of
styles, displayed in all five boroughs from June to September.

<HEADLINE> Former Canadian PM Trudeau Dies  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL (AP) -- Former Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau, a
flamboyant and charismatic politician who led Canada through some
of its most tumultuous events, died Thursday. He was 80.
</P>
<P>
   Trudeau died of prostate cancer, said Roy Heenan, senior partner
of the Montreal law firm Heenan Blaikie, where Trudeau worked.
</P>
<P>
   He said Trudeau's health had declined ''very steadily'' in his
final days. Trudeau's sons Justin and Sacha Trudeau confirmed their
father's death.
</P>
<P>
   Trudeau was hospitalized for 10 days with pneumonia at the
beginning of the year and associates say he never fully regained
his strength. He also was believed to suffer from Parkinson's
disease.
</P>
<P>
   During 16 years as prime minister, briefly interrupted by a 1979
election defeat, Trudeau seemed to personify North America's
political and social changes, with a sophisticated, sometimes
irreverent style that fascinated and captivated his country.
</P>
<P>
   Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien, who canceled a Caribbean
summit in Jamaica so he could return to Canada, praised Trudeau as
a force for change that continues to ''shape the soul of his
people.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Trudeau ''dreamed of a society that afforded all of its
citizens an equal opportunity to succeed in life.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, President Clinton expressed his sympathies and
noted Trudeau's impact.
</P>
<P>
   ''As prime minister for nearly a generation, Pierre Trudeau
opened a dynamic new era in Canadian politics and helped establish
Canada's unique imprint on the global stage,'' Clinton said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   British Prime Minister Tony Blair called Trudeau ''a prime
minister with vision, political courage and great personal style.''
</P>
<P>
   The death received blanket coverage on Canadian television, with
old clips showing Trudeau the orator giving a passionate retirement
speech in 1984, in a canoe and with glamorous women.
</P>
<P>
   Officers of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police gathered outside
his house in Montreal along with a growing crowd of friends and
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Cosmopolitan and witty with a flair for celebrity, Trudeau was a
sharp departure from the generally dry, provincial politicians of
Canada's past.
</P>
<P>
   His personality and influence were so strong, Trudeau was named
Canada's newsmaker of the century in a 1999 Canadian
Press-Broadcast News poll.
</P>
<P>
   With typical style, Trudeau said he was ''surprised and quite
pleased'' about the honor, but he worked to keep his post-political
life private.
</P>
<P>
   He wore sandals to Parliament, dated celebrities such as Barbra
Streisand and actress Margot Kidder, flashed an obscene hand signal
to protesters and once did a pirouette behind the back of Britain's
Queen Elizabeth.
</P>
<P>
   Politically, Trudeau came to prominence at the height of social
change in the 1960s and his policies reflected the new ideas. As
justice minister in 1967, he liberalized laws on abortion and
homosexuality. He became Canada's 15th prime minister April 20,
1968.
</P>
<P>
   A Montreal native, he made French an official language with
English, promoted the metric system, led the fight against Quebec
separatists, and in what was his most profound legacy, enshrined
the Charter of Rights in a new Canadian Constitution in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   He married Margaret Sinclair, a ''flower child'' half his age,
in 1971 and they had three sons before their 1977 separation and
eventual divorce, which received the kind of media attention
normally reserved for film stars.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his two adult sons. His youngest son, Michel,
died in an avalanche in 1998 at age 23; Trudeau's grief over the
death was considered a factor in his hospitalization for pneumonia.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Trudeau's celebrity, the changes he inspired brought
inevitable opposition from some segments of Canadian society. The
Quebec separatist movement gained strength in battling Trudeau's
efforts toward federalism, and the Western-based Reform Party was
created in part from lingering resentment in oil-rich Alberta over
the National Energy Program imposed by the Trudeau government in
1980 that increased federal control over energy resources.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he decided to resign in 1984, Trudeau's popularity
had dissipated, leading to a decline in the Liberal Party and rise
in the successive Conservative Party governments.
</P>
<P>
   He was born Oct. 18, 1919, into a wealthy Montreal family.
Trudeau graduated with honors in law from the University of
Montreal and received a master's degree in political economy from
Harvard in 1945.
</P>
<P>
   Trudeau become a professor of constitutional law at the
University of Montreal in 1961, and his leftist writings and
association with Quebec intellectuals positioned him for entry into
federal politics.
</P>
<P>
   He won election to Parliament in 1965 from Montreal, and became
justice minister two years later, positioning him to assume the
Liberal Party leadership in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   As he pushed through bills that made divorce easier and relaxed
laws on abortion and homosexuality -- unpopular positions in mostly
Catholic Quebec -- Trudeau came up with one of his most famous
phrases: ''The state has no place in the bedrooms of the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Trudeau's funeral will be in Montreal. Arrangements have not
been announced.

<HEADLINE> Twins 4, Indians 3, 10 Innings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND (AP) -- After Travis Fryman's dramatic ninth-inning
home run gave Cleveland a reprieve, the Indians stumbled again,
losing to the Minnesota Twins 4-3 in 10 innings Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland, which wasted a 2-0 lead and split the four-game
series against the team with the AL's worst record coming in,
remained 1&AMP;frac12; games back in the wild card race, failing to take
advantage of Oakland's 6-3, 14-inning loss to Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians (87-72) close the regular season at home with a
three-game series against Toronto starting Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Oakland (88-70), a half-game behind AL West-leading Seattle
(89-70), has three games at home against Texas, then a makeup game
Monday night at Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Corey Koskie drove in the winning run with a broken-bat,
bases-loaded, fielder's-choice grounder off Bob Wickman (1-3).
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota, which won the season series 8-5, loaded the bases on
two infield hits and an intentional walk. Koskie then grounded a
ball past Wickman that second baseman Roberto Alomar stopped with a
dive behind the bag. He threw to shortstop Omar Vizquel for a
forceout as Luis Rivas scored from third.
</P>
<P>
   Wickman was hit by part of the broken bat on the play and
replaced by Steve Karsay, who got the final out.
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Guardado (7-3) got three outs in the ninth and LaTroy
Hawkins pitched the 10th for his 14th save in 14 chances. Kenny
Lofton singled with one out, pinch-hitter Russell Branyon lined out
to left, and Alomar singled Lofton third.
</P>
<P>
   With the sellout crowd chanting ''Man-ny, Man-ny,'' Manny
Ramirez hit a sharp grounder to second that forced Alomar for the
final out.
</P>
<P>
   Fryman had hit the first pitch from reliever Bob Wells in the
bottom of the ninth for his 22nd homer, tying the score 3-all. The
ball landed just above the yellow line atop the left-field wall and
originally was ruled a double. With Cleveland manager Charlie
Manuel and several Indians players on the field protesting, the
umpires got together to discuss the call and signaled home run.
</P>
<P>
   That deprived Twins starter Eric Milton of his 14th win. He
allowed two runs and six hits in eight innings, struck out nine and
walked two.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland's Bartolo Colon, which has won six straight decisions
since July 26, left with the Indians behind 3-2.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Thome's two-run homer put Cleveland ahead in the second, and
fans cheered in the fourth when Oakland's loss was posted on the
scoreboard, but seconds later the crowd fell silent as Torii Hunter
hit a two-run double -- Minnesota's first hit -- then scored on
Jacque Jones' single.
Notes: Alomar extended his hitting streak to 15 games. He has hit
.439 (29-for-66) during the streak. ... Twins second baseman Jay
Canizaro sustained a concussion when he was hit in the head with a
pitch during batting practice. He was examined at a hospital, then
returned to the clubhouse in the second inning. ... Hunter hit .391
(9-for-23) with six RBIs against Cleveland this season.

<HEADLINE> Baseball Reschedules Games  </HEADLINE>
By RONALD BLUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- With American League teams bunched closely and
home-field advantage at stake, the commissioner's office has
rescheduled two rainouts for Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Florida Marlins, long eliminated from postseason contention,
must go to New York to play the Yankees at noon EDT, making up a
July 15 washout.
</P>
<P>
   Oakland, competing for the AL West and a wild card berth, will
play at Tampa Bay at 6:05 p.m. That makes up for the game missed
Sept. 17 because of Hurricane Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's fine with me,'' Marlins manager John Boles said. ''The
only problem is I've got a dentist appointment Monday. But I'm a
firm believer that you play the entire schedule if you can. It
would be nice to go up there and play a meaningful game in front of
a packed house.''
</P>
<P>
   First baseman Derrek Lee wasn't as eager for the road trip,
which would require the Marlins to charter a flight following
Sunday afternoon's game against Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ''That wouldn't be any fun unless we had a chance to knock the
Yankees out of the playoffs,'' Lee said. ''Hopefully we won't have
to go.''
</P>
<P>
   The Marlins can figure on paying between $50,000 and $75,000 to
charter the plane, plus the cost of about 50 hotel rooms on short
notice -- including a few extra ones because of the expanded roster
-- and per diem for the players.
</P>
<P>
   ''All we need are some hotel rooms and an airplane and we'll be
all set,'' said Bill Beck, the Marlins' traveling secretary. ''I
guess I have a few phone calls to make.''
</P>
<P>
   The Athletics have perhaps the most difficult potential schedule
of all. It's theoretically possible Oakland could finish its series
with Texas on Sunday, play at Tampa Bay on Monday night, return to
Oakland for a tiebreaker game on Tuesday to determine the wild card
team or AL West -- and then open the playoffs on the road Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a lot of things that could happen, but I think if we
just take care of our end, we won't have to worry about any of
that,'' Jason Giambi said. ''We win three games this weekend, and I
think you'll see things working out in our favor. If we've got to
go to Tampa, we'll do it, but we'd probably prefer not to.''
</P>
<P>
   Oakland traveling secretary Mickey Morabito told reporters he
couldn't give them any of his customary help finding hotel rooms on
the Athletics' potential travels. He was too busy planning for
every contingency for his team.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's what makes this time of year exciting,'' Oakland
manager Art Howe said. ''You'd rather be wondering where you're
going than knowing you're going home.''
</P>
<P>
   While Chicago has clinched a playoff berth and home field in
both rounds of the AL playoffs, Seattle (89-70), Oakland (88-70)
and the Yankees (87-71) are tightly bunched.
</P>
<P>
   ''I guess you could look at it as our postseason,'' Devil Rays
manager Larry Rothschild said.
</P>
<P>
   New York, which needed one win or Boston loss to clinch the AL
East, intends to pitch Denny Neagle against the Marlins, while the
Devil Rays plan to start Cory Lidle against Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'll do what we have to do, whatever we're told to do, and go
from there,'' Yankees manager Joe Torre said. ''I don't want to
hear it any more. I've heard too many scenarios, and it's
interfering with what we need to do, win a ballgame. I just shut
myself off. Wherever they tell me to go, I'm going to make sure I'm
at the end of the line getting on whatever plane.''
</P>
<P>
   If it turns out the makeups have no affect on either playoff
teams or home field, baseball probably would decide this weekend to
call them off.
</P>
<P>
   The AL playoffs are scheduled to start Tuesday at Chicago and at
the home park of the division winner with the second-best record.
If a tiebreaker game is needed Tuesday to decide the wild-card
berth, the start of the AL playoffs would be pushed back.

Voters Reject Euro in Denmark
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) -- Favoring the 125-year old krone, Danish voters on
Thursday rejected the European Union's common currency. The referendum --
closely watched because Britain, Sweden and Greece also plan votes on euro
adoption -- was an embarrassment to the European Union which has pressed for a
monetary union. ''The Commission regrets this decision,'' said Romano Prodi,
president of the EU's executive commission. ''I firmly believe that a positive
vote would have been in our common interest.''

FDA OKs Abortion Pill RU-486
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government today approved use of the abortion pill
RU-486, capping a bitter 12-year battle. The pill is a major victory for
abortion-rights advocates that could dramatically alter abortion in this
country. The long-expected decision by the Food and Drug Administration allows
Americans an early-abortion method already used in France, Britain, China and 10
other countries. The action is expected to make abortion in the United States
more accessible and more private.

<P>
   BALTIMORE (AP) -- Delino DeShields homered and had a career-high
five RBIs as the Baltimore Orioles eliminated the Toronto Blue Jays
from the postseason race with a record-setting 23-1 rout Thursday
night.
</P>
<P>
   The 23 runs scored by Baltimore broke a team mark, set June 13,
1999 at Atlanta in a 22-1 victory. The Orioles raked four Blue Jays
pitchers for 23 hits.
</P>
<P>
   Brady Anderson hit his 200th career homer and had four RBIs, and
Brook Fordyce also homered for Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles broke the game open with a 10-run fourth, tying a
club record for runs in an inning. Thirteen men batted and out of
the 10 runs, the most allowed by Toronto in an inning this year,
all were unearned against the team.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Jays committed four errors and starter Chris Carpenter,
making his first start since Sept. 16 when he was struck in the
face by a ball off the bat of Chicago's Jose Valentin, was
ineffective.
</P>
<P>
   Darrin Fletcher's solo home run in the fifth off Baltimore's Pat
Rapp prevented a shutout and gave the Blue Jays seven players with
20 or more homers, tying the major league record set by Baltimore
in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Rapp (9-12), who won only four of his previous 20 starts,
allowed two hits and one walk in seven innings, striking out seven.
</P>
<P>
   Carpenter (10-12) lasted three innings, surrendering six runs --
four earned -- on five hits and two walks.
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles took a 3-0 lead in the first. Anderson lined a 2-2
pitch into the bleachers in right-center field for a 1-0 lead, his
18th homer of the season. Chris Richard added an RBI double, then
scored on Cal Ripken's single to right.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto committed two costly errors in the second as the lead
grew to 6-0.
</P>
<P>
   Carpenter allowed a leadoff single to Fordyce and walked
Anderson with one out. Fordyce scored when second baseman Craig
Grebeck booted Jerry Hairston's grounder. DeShields singled in
Anderson, and Hairston came home when third baseman Tony Batista
couldn't handle a throw from center fielder Jose Cruz.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore sent 13 men to the plate in the fourth, using eight
hits and two Blue Jays errors to expand the lead to 16-0.
</P>
<P>
   Roy Halladay relieved Carpenter and walked Anderson before
Hairston reached when Grebeck bobbled his grounder. Albert Belle's
run-scoring single made it 7-0. Hairston went to third on Richard's
fielder's-choice grounder and scored when catcher Alberto
Castillo's attempted pickoff throw to first base glanced off the
foot of umpire Al Clark, who had to leave the game.
</P>
<P>
   Singles by Ripken and Melvin Mora loaded the bases for Fordyce,
who singled to left, scoring Richard for an 9-0 lead. Eugene
Kingsale's bases-loaded single chased Halladay.
</P>
<P>
   Lance Painter relieved and surrendered a two-run double to
Anderson and a run-scoring infield single by Hairston. DeShields
capped the inning with a three-run homer off the right-field foul
pole.
</P>
<P>
   After Fletcher's home run, Baltimore added five more runs in the
fifth to make it 21-1. Eleven Orioles batted with RBI singles by
Kingsale, Hairston, DeShields and Belle, and a sacrifice fly from
Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   Fordyce hit his 14th homer in the sixth off reliever John
Frascatore.
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles got their record-breaking 23rd run in the eighth
inning. Ryan Minor led off with a walk and advanced to second on
Mark Lewis' single. The runners moved up on a passed ball by
Castillo and Minor scored on Fernando Lunar's grounder to
shortstop.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Anderson hit his 43rd career home run as a leadoff hitter,
second to Rickey Henderson's 78. ... Batista's error was his
team-high 17th. ... Belle's RBI was his first since Sept. 2. From
Sept. 3-26, he missed 20 games with a sore right hip.

<HEADLINE> Bulgarian Kayaker Still Under Probe  </HEADLINE>
By JAIME ARON
<TEXT>
<P>
   PENRITH, Australia (AP) -- The International Canoe Federation
said it has run into nothing but dead-ends as it investigates
allegations of drug use by a Bulgarian kayaker who is a finalist in
three Olympic events.
</P>
<P>
   ICF president Ulrich Feldhoff said he was turning over all he
has learned to the International Olympic Committee, but wasn't
confident that agency could do any better.
</P>
<P>
   ''For the IOC, there is the same problem that we have,''
Feldhoff said at a news conference Friday (Thursday night EDT).
''Without written evidence, it is impossible to take any action.''
</P>
<P>
   The IOC said it had no knowledge of the case of Peter Merkov.
</P>
<P>
   ''As of today, as I speak, there is absolutely no case
concerning this athlete. We have nothing on the table,'' said
Francois Carrard, the IOC's general secretary.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulgarian newspaper 24 Hours reported two weeks ago that
Merkov and two teammates tested positive for a diuretic that's
banned because it can be used to cover up steroid use. The test
reportedly was taken at the national championships in late July.
</P>
<P>
   Ivan Slavkov, an IOC member from Bulgaria who leads his
country's delegation to the games, told the ICF he has never
received that information from the Bulgarian anti-doping agency.
</P>
<P>
   Feldhoff released a letter in which Slavkov wrote, ''The
Bulgarian Olympic Committee has not received any official
information from the Bulgarian Anti-Doping Commission. It is rather
surprising that your request is based on a newspaper article.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Bulgarian team manager Victor Kirin: ''They usually send a
letter when it's positive. When it's negative, they don't send a
letter.''
</P>
<P>
   But Feldhoff said Bulgarian reporters told the federation the
test results were announced by the anti-doping commission at a news
conference in Bulgaria. His attempts to reach the commission have
been fruitless.
</P>
<P>
   ''For three days now, I have tried by fax to get an answer from
the anti-doping commission of Bulgaria. We've received no answer,''
Feldhoff said. ''Since yesterday, we have tried to make telephone
contact with those responsible for the anti-doping commission. That
also has been unsuccessful. The two telephone numbers that have
been given to us have been continuously engaged.''
</P>
<P>
   Jan Verstuyft, the chairman of the ICF's medical committee, said
the ICF can't ask the Bulgarian doctor in Sydney about the results
because proper channels must be followed.
</P>
<P>
   He added that even if the IOC is able to get information from
the Bulgarians, it isn't completely reliable because the testing
facility is not among the IOC's 25 accredited labs.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's another problem,'' Verstuyft said. ''We don't know who
they are, how they work, what their independency or transparency
is.''
</P>
<P>
   Merkov, meanwhile, advanced to the finals in the solo 500- and
1,000-meter races and in the four-man event. The K-1 1,000 and the
K-4 will be decided Saturday (Friday night EDT). The K-1 500 finals
are on Sunday (Saturday night EDT).
</P>
<P>
   Merkov won his 500 semifinal heat Friday, then shouted to
reporters: ''I'll talk after the finals.''
</P>
<P>
   Merkov has not had any positive tests in Sydney, Verstuyft said.
</P>
<P>
   The other two accused Bulgarians are Marian Dimitrov, who failed
to make the finals in the 1,000-meter K-2, and Moetceo Tchalakov,
who the team said did not compete in Sydney because of health
reasons.

<HEADLINE> Americans Advance in Wrestling  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN ROBINSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Warm up the bubble bath, wipe off the
rubber ducky. Sammie Henson is one victory away from the gold-medal
match in Olympic freestyle wrestling.
</P>
<P>
   Henson, a former world champion who specializes in
come-from-behind victories and then always enjoys a good bubble
bath afterward, pulled off another comeback Friday (Thursday night
EDT) to reach the semifinals at 119 pounds (54 kg).
</P>
<P>
   All four Americans wrestling in Friday's first session were
winners. Brandon Slay, who upset Olympic champion and four-time
world champion Bouvaissa Saitiev of Russia on Thursday, reached the
semifinals at 167&AMP;frac12; pounds (76 kg).
</P>
<P>
   Lincoln McIlravy at 152 pounds (69 kg) and heavyweight Kerry
McCoy won the first matches in their pools.
</P>
<P>
   Henson fell behind 4-0 -- nothing new there -- then rallied with a
succession of speed and strength moves to repeatedly take Oleksandr
Zakharuk of Ukraine to the mat for an 8-4 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Henson, a two-time former NCAA champion who still wears Clemson
gear to the mat over top of his singlet, has won his three matches
by a combined score of 28-5.
</P>
<P>
   ''Eliminate and dominate, that's the idea,'' said Henson, who
said his goal before the Olympics was to get the gold medal and win
each match by 6 or 7 points.
</P>
<P>
   Henson flirted with his own elimination against Zakharuk, a
three-time world placewinner, by falling behind 4-0 -- the
equivalent of a basketball team trailing 20-0.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you're ahead 4-0, you expect to win,'' Henson said. ''I
made a mistake and I overcame it. Something like this used to be
the downfall of Sammie Henson, I'd get mad and frustrated. But what
used to be a deficiency is now a strength. I kept my head and
started doing what I can do.''
</P>
<P>
   Henson, who now lives in Norman, Okla., came from behind in all
five matches to win the world championship in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ''Certainly, 4-0 is more of a deficit you would like to see,''
U.S. co-coach John Smith said. ''The focus is not losing your
composure against a quality opponent. But Sammie is a wrestler who
makes things happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, the 5-foot-4 Henson, who is short but muscular and
seems to have a perpetual 5 o'clock shadow, likes to soak in all
the attention. And soak in a steamy bubble bath drawn by wife
Stephanie.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was great last night,'' he said. ''We got out of the
Olympic Village and stayed in a hotel downtown not far from here
... and, yes, I had my bubble bath,'' Henson said. ''I've always
got to have my bubble bath.''
</P>
<P>
   Henson's semifinal match against Sergei Demchenko of Belarus was
later Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Slay had another tight match, winning on referee's decision over
Gennadi Laliyev of Kazakstan after the two tied 2-2. Slay backed
off his offense in the final minute of overtime, aware he was ahead
on passivities -- stall warnings -- and to guard against making a
mistake that would cost him a point and the match.
</P>
<P>
   Slay, of Amarillo, Texas, was to wrestle 1999 world bronze
medalist Adem Bereket of Turkey later Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I enjoyed the exuberance of the moment (in beating Saitiev)
for a few hours, but I realized I still had three matches to go,
and now it's two,'' Slay said.
</P>
<P>
   McIlravy, a former NCAA champion at Iowa who was second in last
year's world championships at 152 pounds (69 kg), won by injury
default over Ibo Oziti of Nigeria, an opponent the U.S. coaches
knew nothing about.
</P>
<P>
   Oziti trailed 2-1 when he quit wrestling for no apparent reason.
Asked about the injury, McIlravy said, ''I think it was lungs'' --
suggesting Oziti ran out of gas.
</P>
<P>
   McCoy, who beat world champion Stephen Neal in the U.S. trials
just to get to the Olympics, won 3-0 in overtime over Merabi Valiev
of the Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
   McCoy, a two-time NCAA heavyweight champion at Penn State, has
considerable pressure on him at a weight in which the United States
was expected to get a gold medal. Neal was chosen as last year's
world freestyle wrestler of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Also, at 255 pounds, McCoy gives up as much as 30 pounds to
opponents. Still, he has gained 35 pounds since losing to two-time
Olympic champion Bruce Baumgartner in the 1996 U.S. trials.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel better than I ever have, mentally, strength, quickness,
conditioning,'' McCoy said. ''I don't care if a match lasts nine
minutes, 12 minutes, 20 minutes, 50 minutes. I've just got to keep
on going.''
</P>
<P>
   McCoy and McIlravy wrestle again Saturday. The other two
Americans who have not yet wrestled, Charles Burton (187&AMP;frac14; pounds,
85 kg) and former world champion Terry Brands (127&AMP;frac34; pounds, 58 kg),
had their first pool matches later Friday.

<HEADLINE> Woman stranded on side of mountain  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CORNWALL, N.Y. (AP) - A helicopter was sent from Albany Thursday
night to rescue a woman reported stranded on a ledge of Storm King
Mountain.
</P>
<P>
   The woman was apparently walking with a male acquaintance just
before 8 p.m. when they became separated. Her acquaintance
apparently was the one who called for help.
</P>
<P>
   Town of Cornwall police said they were unable to reach the woman
and were unsure whether the woman was hurt. They said she was not
adequately dressed for the anticipated 30 to 35 degree overnight
temperatures.

Dorr Bothwell
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Painter and pioneering printmaker Dorr
Bothwell, who traveled Asia, Europe and Africa for inspiration,
died Sunday. She was 98.
</P>
<P>
   Bothwell's paintings, drawings, collages and prints were
exhibited in the United States and Europe, in museums such as the
Los Angeles County Museum of Art; New York's Metropolitan Museum of
Art, Museum of Modern Art and Whitney Museum of American Art; the
Bibliotheque Nationale in Paris; and the Victoria and Albert Museum
in London.
</P>
<P>
   Bothwell lived and worked all over the world. Between her
travels, she taught at numerous art schools, including the San
Francisco Art Institute, California School of Fine Arts and the
Mendocino Art Center.

<P>
Richard Mulligan
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Actor Richard Mulligan, who won Emmys for his
portrayals of dads in the sitcoms ''Soap'' and ''Empty Nest,'' died
Tuesday after a long battle with cancer. He was 67.
</P>
<P>
   From 1977 to 1981, Mulligan played lovable working-class
screwball Burt Campbell -- stepfather to Billy Crystal's character --
on the quirky television series ''Soap.'' He won an Emmy for the
role in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   On ''Empty Nest,'' a spinoff of ''The Golden Girls'' that ran
from 1988 to 1995, Mulligan played Dr. Harry Weston, a widower with
three grown daughters. The part won him another Emmy, in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Among the other highlights of Mulligan's career was performing
on stage with James Stewart in ''Harvey'' and working with director
Blake Edwards in the 1981 film ''S.O.B.,'' which starred Julie
Andrews and William Holden.

Wilbur F. Pell Jr.
</P>
<P>
   EVANSTON, Ill. (AP) -- Federal appeals court Judge Wilbur F. Pell
Jr., who wrote the decision overturning the convictions of the
''Chicago Seven'' anti-Vietnam War activists, died Monday. He was
84.
</P>
<P>
   Pell served 30 years on the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals in
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Pell was appointed by President Nixon in 1970. He assumed senior
status, a semiretired position, in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   In 1972, Pell wrote the opinion for the three-judge panel
reversing the convictions of five of the Chicago Seven defendants,
who had been convicted of crossing state lines to incite a riot
during the 1968 Democratic National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   In reversing the convictions, Pell wrote that the federal judge
and prosecutors had behaved improperly, that jury selection was
flawed and that jurors had been improperly questioned.
</P>
<P>
Carmen Robertson
</P>
<P>
   VENTURA, Calif. (AP) -- Former actress Carmen Robertson, who had
roles as a child in early ''Little Rascals'' movies and performed
as a synchronized swimmer in Esther Williams films, died Tuesday
from injuries suffered in a car crash. She was 77.
</P>
<P>
   As a child, Robertson performed under her maiden name Carmencita
Johnson in the ''Little Rascals'' movie series.
</P>
<P>
   When she turned 20, she began to work as a synchronized swimmer
in the Esther Williams aquatic movies.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson also worked as a movie stand-in for Lana Turner
throughout the 1940s.
</P>
<P>
Pierre Elliot Trudeau
</P>
<P>
   MONTREAL (AP) -- Former Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Elliott
Trudeau, a flamboyant and charismatic political giant who led his
country through some of its most tumultuous events, died Thursday.
He was 80.
</P>
<P>
   Trudeau died of prostate cancer, said Roy Heenan, senior partner
of the Montreal law firm Heenan Blaikie, where Trudeau worked.
</P>
<P>
   During 16 years as prime minister, briefly interrupted by a 1979
election defeat, Trudeau seemed to personify North America's
dynamic political and social changes, with a sophisticated,
sometimes irreverent style that fascinated and captivated his
country.
</P>
<P>
   Trudeau won election to Parliament in 1965 from Montreal, and as
justice minister in 1967, liberalized laws on abortion and
homosexuality. In 1968 he assumed the Liberal Party leadership,
becoming Canada's 15th prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   A Montreal native, Trudeau made French an official language with
English, promoted the metric system, led the fight against Quebec
separatists, and in what was his most profound legacy, enshrined
the Charter of Rights in a new Canadian Constitution in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his celebrity, the changes he inspired brought
inevitable opposition. By the time he decided to resign in 1984,
Trudeau's popularity had dissipated, leading to a decline in the
Liberal Party and rise in the successive Conservative Party
governments.
</P>
<P>
   Trudeau was named Canada's newsmaker of the century in a 1999
Canadian Press-Broadcast News poll.
</P>
<P>
Bonnie Wiley
</P>
<P>
   HONOLULU (AP) -- Bonnie Wiley, the only woman combat
correspondent for The Associated Press in the Pacific during World
War II, died Saturday. She was 90.
</P>
<P>
   Wiley covered action on Iwo Jima, the mop-up operations on
Okinawa and was the first woman war correspondent to reach Japan,
covering the Japanese surrender aboard the USS Missouri in Tokyo
Bay Sept. 2, 1945.
</P>
<P>
   Wiley was working for the AP in San Francisco in January of 1945
when she applied to be a war correspondent and was assigned to the
Navy.
</P>
<P>
   She received a Navy commendation and battle stars for combat.
</P>
<P>
   Wiley earned a journalism degree in 1948 at the University of
Washington and worked for the Yakima Morning Herald in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In 1965 she received a doctorate from Southern Illinois
University and joined the University of Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1980s, Wiley went to Beijing to served as an
editorial adviser for Xinhua at the New China News Agency.
</P>
<P>
   Wiley in 1989 was awarded the UNESCO Award for outstanding
contributions to international journalism and education.

<HEADLINE> Disposal Lighters Being Recalled  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- An Atlanta company is recalling about 350,000
disposable cigarette lighters because they can burn with high flame
and fail to extinguish, posing fire and burn hazards.
</P>
<P>
   The Consumer Product Safety Commission said Thursday the agency
and Halpern Import Co. have received one report of a woman who
received second-degree burns on her chest when the lighter failed
to extinguish and ignited her clothes.
</P>
<P>
   The lighters are oval-tube shaped and have a green, red, blue,
black or yellow body and a metal top. They have ''TURBO 2000''
printed on them, and a label reads: ''CHILD-RESISTANT DISPOSABLE
LIGHTER,'' ''KEEP OUT OF REACH OF CHILDREN,'' and ''MADE IN
CHINA.''
</P>
<P>
   The UPC number 0 80692 05010 1 is printed on the back of the
lighters.
</P>
<P>
   Tobacco and thrift stores nationwide sold the lighters from June
1999 through May 2000 for about $1.
</P>
<P>
   The CPSC advised consumers to immediately stop using the
lighters and return them to the store where they were purchased for
a refund. For more information, consumers can call 1-800-624-5280
between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. EDT Monday through Friday.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Peruvian Spy Chief Arranges Photo  </HEADLINE>
By KATHIA MARTINEZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) -- Panamanians caught their first
glimpse of ex-Peruvian spy chief Vladimiro Montesinos on Thursday --
in a posed photograph giving no hint of where he is hiding while
awaiting a decision on his political asylum request.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign Minister Jose Miguel Aleman, told reporters Thursday
that Panama's decision on Montesinos will be made only in the
interest of ''contributing to a peaceful end to the Peruvian
crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   Montesinos, who fled Peru after a videotape showed him allegedly
bribing a Peruvian lawmaker, arrived in Panama on Sunday. The
scandal over the video prompted Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori
to call early elections in which he will not be a candidate.
</P>
<P>
   The photograph, published on the front page of the daily
newspaper El Panama America, showed Montesinos seated and appearing
to read a book. Beside him is a small white table holding a glass
of water and a vase of tropical flowers.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not spontaneous; he posed,'' said the newspaper's news
editor, Octavio Amat. He said Montesinos agreed to one photograph
on condition that he choreograph the shot and that the newspaper
promise not to tell where it was taken.
</P>
<P>
   ''They allowed us to send one of our people, but only under
strict security,'' Amat said.
</P>
<P>
   Seven people who accompanied Montesinos to Panama, including a
Peruvian general, were kicked out of the country on Tuesday after
government officials said they had illegally entered on tourist
visas.
</P>
<P>
   Montesinos' asking for political asylum provoked a furor in
Panama, which has a history of providing refuge to deposed Latin
American strongmen.
</P>
<P>
   Panamanians who want to clean up the country's reputation oppose
granting Motesinos asylum, as do opposition Peruvian lawmakers who
want to see him prosecuted in Peru.
</P>
<P>
   President Mireya Moscoso has come under strong pressure from the
Organization of American States and regional heads of state to
accept Montesinos, especially after reports that his supporters in
Peru might stage a coup if he were rejected.
</P>
<P>
   Moscoso has said that while she considers the asylum request,
Montesinos could stay in Panama under a visa granted by a previous
Panamanian president.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is a very hard decision to make,'' Aleman, the foreign
minister, said before leaving for a summit of Central American
leaders in Guatemala. ''It will be a hemispheric gesture that
attempts to contribute to a peaceful end to the Peruvian crisis.''

<HEADLINE> Gore Appears on CNN Talk Show  </HEADLINE>
By CALVIN WOODWARD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Al Gore says all those hits he's taking about
exaggerating aspects of his past are, well, exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
   ''In a campaign, you know, if you get a fact wrong, all of a
sudden you are accused of committing some horrible offense,'' he
said Thursday on CNN's ''Larry King Live,'' a touch defensive
during a mostly smooth hour.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic presidential candidate and his wife Tipper
appeared on King's show two nights after Republican George W. Bush
and his wife Laura came on to answer questions from the talk show
host and a few call-in viewers.
</P>
<P>
   Gore pronounced himself relaxed about next Tuesday's TV debate
with his Republican opponent, the first of three coming up in their
close contest for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of the debate preparations he will be doing this weekend
in Sarasota, Fla., will consist of reading ''pretty boring''
briefing books, as well as practice debate sessions, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The older I get, the less I'm nervous about things that might
have made me nervous when I was younger,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet again Gore was asked about his motives behind the long kiss
he gave his wife while taking the stage at the Democratic National
Convention. Was he trying to send a message to voters that he is
devoted to his wife and not like President Clinton?
</P>
<P>
   ''I was trying to send a message to Tipper,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Like I said, message received,'' Tipper Gore said, describing
the kiss as ''pleasant.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore said he thinks he can win Florida, where Bush's brother Jeb
is governor but polls indicate a close race. But he admitted he
doesn't have much hope of carrying Texas, where Bush himself is
governor.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was somewhat uncomfortable when asked about
misrepresentations he's made during the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think that itself is an exaggeration,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tipper Gore pitched in, saying that sometimes ''you're just
talking, you're just thinking ... just being yourself'' when
certain things are said and then put under a microscope. ''I just
think people have to understand all of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore recently represented figures in a study as prices actually
paid for an arthritis medicine for his mother-in-law and his dog,
even though the numbers were not related to his family's
experience. He was trying to make a point about drugs costing more
for people than pets.
</P>
<P>
   And he claimed to have remembered a union song from childhood
even though it was not written until he was an adult. After that
was pointed out, he said he was joking.
</P>
<P>
   Gore picked the Mote Marine Laboratory in Sarasota -- a shark
research station -- for his debate rehearsals after considering Cape
Cod or Boston, the city where he meets Bush on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Gore aides said they were outhustled for Massachusetts
accommodations by tourists crowding in to see the changing leaves.
</P>
<P>
   But they said Sarasota is fine, given Florida's importance in
the Nov. 7 election and the fact that the area has many senior
citizens living on fixed incomes -- the sort of people who might
like Gore's plans for a Medicare drug benefit.
</P>
<P>
   ''Any time we can get the vice president in a position in
Florida where he is talking about issues is a plus for us,'' said
Doug Hattaway, speaking for Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Gore will be going to Sarasota on Saturday and leaving directly
from there for Boston on Tuesday morning, Hattaway said. Gore was
planning a public event with seniors while in the area.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Miami Manager Pleads Innocent  </HEADLINE>
By ADRIAN SAINZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- The former city manager fired after the Elian
Gonzalez raid pleaded innocent Thursday to federal charges alleging
he took more than $86,000 from a police pension fund and a charity.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Warshaw, who was once Miami's assistant police chief and
had been widely credited with cleaning up corruption, is charged
with one count of conspiracy and four counts of mail fraud and
faces one to three years in prison if convicted.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is probably, with the exception the day my father died,
the saddest day of my life,'' Warshaw said after his initial
hearing. ''I probably could have used better judgment for what I
did, but that's in the past now. All I can do about it is defend
myself when I get my day in court.''
</P>
<P>
   Warshaw, who also was once Miami's chief of police, was released
on $100,000 bond. His arraignment was set for Oct. 11.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment accuses Warshaw of using the pension fund's
American Express card to buy $16,775 worth of hockey tickets. It
also says nearly $70,000 was taken from the charity Do the Right
Thing Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Warshaw was chairman of the pension fund from 1991 to 1998 and
secretary and treasurer of the charity from 1991 until August. The
dates in the indictment range from May 1993 to April 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Warshaw has blamed his problems on sloppy record-keeping and
said the money had been repaid.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment also named the charity's former accountant, who
committed suicide last year. A note found after the suicide led to
the investigation, Miami-Dade Police Chief Carlos Alvarez said.
</P>
<P>
   As city manager, Warshaw was known for his stand against
corruption and for helping restore the city's financial health
after a 1996 kickback scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Joe Carollo fired him in April, accusing him of lying and
mismanagement, after Warshaw refused to fire Police Chief William
O'Brien in the wake of the federal raid that removed 6-year-old
Elian from his Miami relatives and reunited him with his Cuban
father. O'Brien did not notify the mayor of plans for the raid.

<HEADLINE> No. 2 Florida State 59, Maryland 7  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID GINSBURG
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLLEGE PARK, Md. (AP) -- The game was decided by halftime, just
like all the other mismatches between Florida State and Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Weinke threw three touchdown passes before leaving early
in the third quarter with a sprained ankle, and second-ranked
Florida State cruised to a 59-7 victory Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   William McCray scored on two short runs and Atrews Bells caught
two TD passes for the Seminoles (5-0, 3-0 ACC), who built a 32-7
halftime lead en route to their 17th straight victory.
</P>
<P>
   Weinke left after his third touchdown pass made it 38-7. With
rival Miami next on the Seminoles' schedule, coach Bobby Bowden was
probably ready to pull his senior quarterback anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Weinke went 11-for-15 for 234 yards. His final TD pass gave him
58 for his career, breaking Danny Kanell's school record.
</P>
<P>
   It was 25-0 before Maryland (2-2, 0-1) got its initial first
down, on a 74-yard touchdown run by LaMont Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan finished with 114 yards rushing, his first 100-yard game
of the season, but Maryland managed only eight first downs, four on
the final drive of the game. Calvin McCall, who was victimized by
several dropped passes, went 10-for-27 for 100 yards and one
interception.
</P>
<P>
   Florida State is 11-0 against Maryland, winning by an average of
34 points. The Seminoles have scored at least 48 points in eight of
the last nine games between the teams.
</P>
<P>
   After the Terrapins took the opening kickoff and gained only 1
yard in three plays, the Seminoles quickly covered 59 yards to go
up 7-0. Weinke went 3-for-3 for 36 yards before McCray ran in from
the 1.
</P>
<P>
   Maryland again did nothing on offense, and a 28-yard punt return
by Clevan Thomas set up a career-long 44-yard field goal by Matt
Munyon.
</P>
<P>
   The Terrapins' next possession featured two dropped passes, and
after the Seminoles' first punt, a botched pitchout by McCall was
recovered by FSU at the Maryland 16. Although the Seminoles
couldn't convert, a coffin-corner punt by Keith Cottrell set up a
safety for a 12-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately after the free kick, Robert Morgan slipped behind
Curome Cox on the right sideline and hauled in a 58-yard touchdown
pass.
</P>
<P>
   The Terrapins not only found it impossible to get a first down,
but they couldn't help giving the ball away. An interception by the
Seminoles' Chris Hope led to a 2-yard touchdown run by McCray and a
25-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Maryland ended its first-down drought and snapped the shutout
with one play, Jordan's lengthy touchdown run off a block by tight
end Jeff Dugan.
</P>
<P>
   Undaunted, the Seminoles made it 32-7 on a 2-yard pass from
Weinke to Bell with 14 seconds left in the half.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, a good portion of the 47,044 at Byrd Stadium
headed for the exits. It was the biggest crowd at Maryland since
1995.

   DALLAS (AP) -- David Aebischer stopped Joe Nieuwendyk on a
penalty shot, and Adam Deadmarsh scored two power-play goals in
Colorado's 6-2 exhibition victory over Dallas on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   David Aebischer, who made 31 saves, stopped Nieuwendyk's attempt
