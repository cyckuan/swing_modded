MOSCOW, March 23 (Xinhua) -- The Contact Group members today
descried as a primary goal of the next phase of implementation of
the Dayton agreement on peaceful Bosnian settlement the
preparation and establishment of conditions for elections in the
war-torn Bosnia-Herzegovina.
</P>
<P>
At a one-day meeting held in Moscow's President-Hotel, foreign
ministers of the five-nation Contact group summed up the results
of the first phase of the implementation of the Dayton agreement
signed last December and outlined the tasks of its next phase.
</P>
<P>
A final document approved at the meeting pointed out, "On the
whole, implementation is proceeding according to the timetable
established by the (Dayton) agreement." "The peace process is now
entering a new stage in which the primary responsibility will be
on the (conflicting) parties to give substance to the civilian
provisions of the agreement."
</P>
<P>
Regarding the failure to release prisoners as a serious case of
non-compliance for all the Bosnian sides, the ministers regretted
that despite the parties undertakings, given at Geneva, that
release would take place by March 23, this had not happened.
</P>
<P>
They appealed to all the parties to live up to their
responsibilities, referring to strict compliance with their
obligations in the agreement and their genuine commitment to
reconciliation and to building a common future.

preparation and the establishment of the conditions for
elections," the document pointed out. In this regard, it
continued, "the Contact Group gave its full support to the work of
the OSCE (the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe)
Mission in Bosnia-Herzegovina".
</P>
<P>
"Free, fair and democratic elections, held within the timeframe
set out in the agreement, will lay the foundation for
representative government and ensure the progressive achievement
of democratic goals throughout" the former Yugoslav republic, the
document added.
</P>
<P>
The ministers called the return of refuges and displaced
persons as "an urgent element" in the reestablishment of the
political and economic life of the country.
</P>
<P>
They also stressed the need for all the parties to cooperate
fully with the War Crimes Tribunal in the investigation and
prosecution of war crimes and other violations of international
humanitarian law.

<HEADLINE> President: Sudan not to Allow Return of Political Parties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Sudan's newly-elected President
Omar al-Bashir said his government would not allow the return of
political parties that were banned after the 1989 coup when the
elected Sudanese government was overthrown.
</P>
<P>
In a speech delivered at a mass rally held in Khartoum today to
celebrate his victory in the elections, President al-Bashir said
threats and plots will not deter Sudan from pursuing its policy.
</P>
<P>
"The Sudanese people are quite aware that the road to faith is
the road to might," the Sudanese president said.
</P>
<P>
"Instigating the neighboring countries, along with the U.N.
Security Council resolutions, would not compel Sudan to make
concessions and would even make it more resolved and more
determined to adhere to the course it is following," he added.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council has warned that it would impose
sanctions against Sudan if this country does not hand over the
three Egyptians, suspects in the failed assassination attempt on
life of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in Addis Ababa in June
1995, at the end of this month.

<HEADLINE> Activities on Leadership Change in Taiwan Region End </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 23 (Xinhua) -- The activities concerning the
change of leaders of the Taiwan region ended today, according to
media reports from Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
According to the reports, Lee Teng-hui and his partner obtained
54 percent of the votes, and the votes going to Lin Yang-kang,
Chen Li-an and their partners, who opposed "Taiwan independence"
and advocated promoting the relations across the Taiwan Straits,
surpassed those to Peng Ming-min and his partner of the Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP), who advocated "Taiwan independence".
</P>
<P>
Peng and his partner obtained only 21 percent of the votes,
which was a marked drop in comparison with the DPP's 41 percent
votes in the election of county magistrates and city mayors at the
end of 1993 and 33 percent of the votes in another election at the
end of last year.
</P>
<P>
People here held that China's opposition to separatism and
"Taiwan independence" has demonstrated the Chinese people's firm
determination to safeguard their country's sovereignty and
territory integrity, and thus dealt a heavy blow to the "Taiwan
independence" and separatist forces.
</P>
<P>
The call for ending the state of hostility and developing the
relations across the Taiwan Straits is increasingly surging on
Taiwan island. In order to cater to the demand of the broad masses
of the people in Taiwan and fish for votes, some leaders of the
Taiwan authorities were forced to repeatedly claim to oppose
"Taiwan independence" and advocate reunification. The facts show
that the broad masses of the people in Taiwan demand stability and
development of the relations across the Taiwan Straits, and
cast aside "Taiwan independence".

<HEADLINE> Leadership Change of Taiwan Region Can't Alter its Status as Part of China's Territory: Says official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 23 (Xinhua) -- There is only one China in the
world, and Taiwan is an inalienable part of China. Neither the
changes in the way in which the Taiwan leaders are produced nor
their result can change the fact that Taiwan is a part of China's
territory.
</P>
<P>
A leading member of the Information Bureau of the Taiwan
Affairs Office under the State Council said this in an interview
with Xinhua here tonight following the end of the activities
concerning the way in which the leaders in Taiwan region are
produced.
</P>
<P>
"Our stand on developing the relations across the Taiwan
Straits on the basis of the principle of one China is consistent
and so is our stand on firmly opposing creating 'two Chinas', 'one
China, one Taiwan' or 'Taiwan independence'," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The question of Taiwan is purely China's internal affairs. We
oppose any foreign forces to interference in China's internal
affairs in any form or under any pretext," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
"We place our hopes on the Taiwan people and ardently call on
all the Chinese, including Taiwan compatriots, to join hands and
make unremitting efforts to oppose separatism and 'Taiwan
independence', and develop the relations across the Taiwan Straits
and promote the reunification of the motherland," he said.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's White Farmers Locked In Game Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 23 (xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's white commercial
farming body is defending members' practice of turning their
farmland into game ranches.
</P>
<P>
Comercial Farmers Union Deputy Director Jerry Grant told the
Zimbabwe National News Agency today that the government is
exerting political pressure upon white farmers who want to change
farming to game business.
</P>
<P>
"The use of wildlife, particularly through high value output in
tourism is a perfectly acceptable form of alternate land use and
there is absolutely no justification for political rhetoric aimed at
this section of industry," Grant said.
</P>
<P>
Wildlife is seen by authorities as an excuse by land holders
to justify under-utilization of land in the face of rising
pressure from the land acquisition act, according to the deputy
director of the country's white farmers union.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwean government, which vows to resettle landless
blacks, feels the mainly white commercial farmers are
diversifying into game farming to stop it from compulsorily
acquiring under-utilized land.
</P>
<P>
In 1992, the government enacted the land acquisition act
enabling it to compulsorily acquire under-utilized land for
the resettlement purposes.
</P>
<P>
President Robert Mugabe, who won re-election last week for
another six-year term, has already warned the white commerfcial
farmers that the government will not hesitate to compulsorily
acquire their land for resettlement purposes.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, March 23 (Xinhua) -- AT&AMP;T Corp., the world's
telecommunication giant, saw its share of the long-distance market
falling by 2 percent to 55 percent in the fourth quarter of 1995
from a year ago.
</P>
<P>
But its revenues were pushed up by 6 percent to 12 billion U.S.
dollars, according to a report of the Investor's Business Daily
today.
</P>
<P>
Its rivals MCI Communications Corp. and Sprint Corp. saw their
market share rising by 0.5 percent to 18 percent and by 0.1
percent to 9 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Several smaller firms together grabbed 18 percent of the
market, up 2 percent, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Experts said the competition on the telecommunication market
will be growlingly tense this year, since the companies find new
rooms in Internet and other computer network services.
</P>
<P>
After AT&AMP;T announced a handsome offer of free hours of
Internet-access service to its long-distance clients last month,
MCI lost no time cutting charges on its Internet service.
</P>
<P>
More than 200,000 people have signed up for AT&AMP;T's Worldnet
service since the company introduced it on Feb. 27. MCI would not
disclose how many subscribers Internet MCI had, saying only that
more than two million people had gained access to the Internet
through its fiber-optic network.

<P>
NEW DELHI, March 23 (Xinhua) -- All India Indira Congress
(AIIC) President N.D. Tiwari said that his party will not become a
part of the proposed third front in the coming general elections,
the Press Trust of India reported.
</P>
<P>
Tiwari's remarks marked the first time that the breakaway
faction of the ruling Congress Party has clarified its position on
whether the AIIC would be part of the third front against Congress
and the major opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).
</P>
<P>
Since the exposure in January of the hawala case, an
18-million-U.S. dollar-bribery scandal, parties of the national
front-left parties combine have been considering the formation of
a third force to make use of the favorable situation arising from
the scandal.
</P>
<P>
While making the clarification, Tiwari also said his party
would hold talks with all secular and democratic minded parties
for forming a strategic alliance excluding the Congress Party and
the BJP.
</P>
<P>
The AIIC Central Parliamentary Board would meet on March 26 to
discuss the party's state-level alliance, he added.
</P>
<P>
The AIIC leader called for the consolidation of leftist and
Gandhian forces in the country.
</P>
<P>
India will hold general elections to its 11th Lok Sabha (House
of the People) from April 27 to May 21.

KUWAIT CITY, March 23 (Xinhua) -- The Gulf Cooperation Council
(GCC) states are considering holding a meeting on measures
necessary to prevent the contagious "mad cow" disease from
reaching the Gulf region, Gulf sources told Kuwait News Agency
(KUNA) today.
</P>
<P>
Qatar Friday banned the import of British beef after a
statement made on Wednesday by British Health Secretary Stephen
Dorrell that scientists had proved the possibility that the
disease could hit human beings.
</P>
<P>
Germany, New Zealand, Finland, Singapore, Austria and France
have jointly banned the import of British beef.

<P>
Fear dominated Europe following the death of 10 British
youngsters inflicted by the disease.

Scientists said they had traced the relation between the
disease, (or bovine spongiform encephalopathy,) and its deadly
human equivalent, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.
</P>
<P>
GCC states import beef from Britain. However, no statistics
were available on British beef imports by the GCC states which

JERUSALEM, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Several Artillery shells were
fired by Hezbollah (Party of God) gunmen at Israeli army
positions in the eastern sector of the "security zone" in south
Lebanon today, reports from the area said.
</P>
<P>
However, there were no reports of injuries or damage. The
Israeli army returned fire to some Hezbollah posts.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Health Minister Ephraim Sneh said today that in
addition to military option in south Lebanon, pressure can also be
brought upon to Syria to contain the Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Israel Radio, Sneh said that there are
three levels of responsibility for Hezbollah activities in south
Lebanon -- Iran, Lebanon and Syria.
</P>
<P>
He said that Israel should make it clear to Syria that its
interest will be damaged if the current situation in south Lebanon
continues.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Knesset (Israel's parliament) member Uzi Landau of
the Likud party charged today that the situation in south Lebanon
only proves that there is no basis for the statement by Prime
Minister Shimon Peres about a new Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Landau also agreed that the key to peace in
south Lebanon is in the hands of Syria.
</P>
<P>
The tension in the "security zone" escalated during the past
week between the Israeli army and South Lebanon Army (SLA) and
Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, An Israeli army officer and an SLA soldier
were killed in bombing attacks by Hezbollah activists.

<HEADLINE> CPPCC Chairman Meets Moldovan Parliament President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Li Ruihuan, chairman of the
National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC), said here today that a powerful and stable
China is of major importance to world peace, stability and
development.
</P>
<P>
Some people who are unhappy with the comparatively fast growth
of China's economy in recent years constantly cause China trouble
by groundlessly spreading the view of the so-called "China threat"
to mold public opinion for their containment of China.
</P>
<P>
Li made the remarks when meeting with Petru Lukinsky, president
of the Moldovan Parliament, in the Great Hall of the People.
</P>
<P>
Li said that a powerful and stable China with a population of
more than 1.2 billion is of major importance to world peace,
stability and development.
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, he said, it would bring suffering to the world if
China remained so undeveloped for a long period that it could not
feed its people.
</P>
<P>
China should withstand various pressures imposed by certain
international hostile forces and maintain long-term stability and
sustained development, Li said. Therefore, China has to establish
and develop friendly and co-operative relations with more
countries and try to win more supports from its friends.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting Li also expressed his thanks for Moldova's
understanding and support for China on many major issues.
</P>
<P>
China and Moldova enjoy growing relations though they
established diplomatic ties not long ago, Li said, adding that
China is optimistic about the prospects for the development of
bilateral relations for they not only face common tasks in
developing their economies and improving their people's living
standards, but also share the same or similar views on many major
international issues.
</P>
<P>
Li said that China hopes the two countries will maintain
frequent exchanges of visits between high-ranking leaders, and
closer co-operation in various fields including politics, economy
and culture.
</P>
<P>
Lukinsky cited an old Chinese saying that a 1,000-li journey is
started by taking the first step, and said that Moldova, proud of
it sound and sincere relations with China, will be always a
reliable partner of China.
</P>
<P>
He said he hoped bilateral relations would continue to be
strengthened.
</P>
<P>
Lukinsky and his party arrived in Beijing today at the CPPCC's
invitation.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Israeli forces and Moslem
guerrillas exchanged bombardments in south Lebanon this morning
despite reported efforts to ease the tension on the last
Arab-Israeli battlefront.
</P>
<P>
Security sources reported that the Israeli occupation forces
from their position at Az-Zafata since this morning shelled
intensively the vicinities of the southern Lebanese market town of
Nabatiyah and a nearby Lebanese army barrack.
</P>
<P>
The bombardments were extended to the areas of Nabatiyah Fauqa

position at Dabsheh by firing rockets and machineguns at the
target, the security sources announced.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Radio reported that an Israeli position in the central
sector of the so-called "security zone" was attacked by guerrillas
with rockets.
</P>
<P>
It quoted a spokesman of the Israeli army as saying that no
single Israeli soldier was injured in the attack, nor any damage
was caused.

of the sources of the attack, the Israeli army spokesman added.

<HEADLINE> Russia Urges Fair Approach to Bosnian Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin today called for a "fair and impartial approach" in
settling the Bosnian crisis.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a one-day meeting in Moscow of the five-nation
"Contact Group" for a Bosnian settlement, Chernomyrdin stressed
that peace remains fragile in Bosnia-Herzegovina and there is a
long way to go to secure real reconciliation there.
</P>
<P>
"The tragic exodus of Serb residents from Sarajevo (capital of
Bosnia-Herzegovina), the problems in relations within the
Muslim-Croat federation, the mutual manifestation of fear and
hatred make one seriously apprehensive of a resumption of armed
clashes," he said.
</P>
<P>
He called on the "Contact Group", made up of Britain, France,
Germany, Russia and the United States, and international
organizations to help solve the issue.
</P>
<P>
All "should show, not by words but by deeds, a demanding, but
also fair and impartial approach in both appraising the acts of all
Bosnian sides and giving them the so crucially needed aid and
assistance," he added.
</P>
<P>
The "Contact Group" opened its meeting in Moscow's President
Hotel this morning to survey the results of the first stage of the
implementation of the peace agreements signed in Dayton, the
United States, last December which ended the Bosnian war.
</P>
<P>
The group also discussed how to realize the political
agreements in the peace accord.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin told the meeting the history of the
Bosnian crisis indicates the need for a strong Organization of
Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) which Europeans could
turn to in emergencies.
</P>
<P>
He said the 53-nation organization needed effective tools for
preventive diplomacy, a legal foundation, and a common approach to
peace-making.
</P>
<P>
"The Bosnian crisis has proved conclusively: the challenges to
European security have been engendered not by military problems
but rather by difficulties in social transformation of new states
multiplied by unsettled ethnic conflicts," Chernomyrdin said.
</P>
<P>
He called for true pan-European cooperation in consolidating
democratic institutions, encouragement of economic reforms and
protection of minorities.
</P>
<P>
Present at the meeting are the foreign ministers of Britain,
Germany, Russia, the United States, France, Italy, the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia, Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina.
</P>
<P>
Supreme Commander-in-Chief of the forces ensuring the
implementation of the Dayton agreements George Joulwan, UN High
Commissioner for Refugees Sadako Ogata and high-ranking
officials from the Organization of Security and Cooperation in
Europe (OSCE) also attended the meeting.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Marks World Water Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus, which relies on rainfall
to save water for consumption, has taken measures to mark the
World Water Day.
</P>
<P>
Costas Petrides, Cyprus' Minister of Agriculture, announced on
Friday plans for the development of new reservoirs on the
Mediterranean island state as part of the government's long term
strategy for water distribution, said a report reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
He said that the strategy includes the use of processed waste
water, the development and rational distribution of water
resources as well as the implementation of laws and other measures
such as the conservation of water.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that a sea water desalination plant in the
Dhekelia area, the first of its kind on the island, is already
under construction and is expected to start operation in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The Minister noted that Cyprus is facing serious water shortage
problems this year due to continuing drought and the low
concentration of water in the reservoirs.
</P>
<P>
"The rational use of water and the conservation of water must
become a way of life for the good of everyone and the good of
Cyprus," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, as part of an awareness campaign, the Water Board
of Nicosia launched a composition competition for students
nationwide with the theme "New Ideas for Water Conservation."
Winners will be awarded prizes.
</P>
<P>
The Water Board has also given out information pamphlets,
rulers and stickers to all the primary schools in Nicosia to
heighten awareness of water conservation among the pupils.
</P>
<P>
Due to the water-saving efforts of the Cyprus government, the
water storage capacity of the reservoirs on the island has
increased from 6 million cubic meters in 1960 to the current 300
million cubic meters.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Bans Beef Imports from Britain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus has banned the imports of
beef and any of its by-products from Britain following the British
government's admission for the first time that the so-called "mad
cow" disease, a lethal brain condition, could be transmitted to
human beings.
</P>
<P>
However, Paul Economides, the head of the Cyprus Veterinary
Department, was quoted today by the local press as saying that
"there is no cause for worry here as there has been no case of mad
cow disease in Cyprus."
</P>
<P>
"We have all the information from the United Kingdom and we
will study it. But there is still no scientific evidence to
justify a panic," he said.
</P>
<P>
South Africa, New Zealand and Singapore joined Friday most of
Britain's European Union partners in banning imports of British
beef.
</P>
<P>
Economides said British beef already on the Cyprus market is
not contaminated with the disease, bovine spongiform
encephalopathy (BSE), linked this week to fateful
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD).
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that only 6.7 per cent of the 2,000 metric tons
of frozen beef Cyprus imported last year came from Britain.
</P>
<P>
Economides told Cyprus radio that measures were and still are
being taken and that Cyprus has adopted directions and views
expressed by the World Health Organization and the European Union.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the belief that "there is no reason for
particular worry in Cyprus."

<HEADLINE> Jordan, Iraq Give Conflict Reports over Whereabouts of Iraqi "Defector" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, March 23 (Xinhua) -- The whereabouts of a former Iraqi
army Chief, who was reportedly to have defected to Jordan,
remained unclear today, two days after the Jordanian government
said it had accepted the man's request to come to the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian sources said Lieutenant-General Nizar Kazraji had
already arrived in the kingdom but declined to give details. Some
Iraqi opposition sources said they did not have any information on
his whereabouts, while others said the man was in Jordan.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether Jordan had granted Kazraji political asylum,
Jordanian Information Minister Marwan Muasher said: "We have
granted him permission to come to Jordan, but it does not mean
that we have give him political asylum."
</P>
<P>
Muasher was quoted by today's local daily Jordan Times as
saying that he was not aware whether the defector had arrived in
Jordan. However, the daily did not specify when and on what
occasion the Information Minister made such remarks.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian and Iraqi sources gave conflicting accounts. Some
said Kazraji arrived here late Thursday night and was "taking a
rest" before appearing in public at a press conference in the next
few days. Others said he was due to land here late Friday aboard a
flight from Turkey.
</P>
<P>
But Jordan's official media has been keeping silent on the
event, and officials in the Ministry of Information contacted by
Xinhua declined to give any more information than the report
appeared in the local press today.
</P>
<P>
Reports here said that Kazraji led Iraq's Seventh Army Division
during the eight-year Iran-Iraq war, which began in 1980, and
served as Iraqi army Chief during the Iraqi occupation of Kuwait
in early 1991, and he has lived in a low profile since then.
</P>
<P>
The general's defection follows the debacle of Hussein Kamel
and his brother Saddam Kamel, both sons-in-law of Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein, who fled their homeland along withe their wives
last August.
</P>
<P>
The Kamels returned to Baghdad in February after the Iraqi
leadership said it was granting them a pardon. But the two
brothers and another sibling and their father were killed by
family members two days after their return, Iraqi official reports
said.
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview with the Jordan Times, Izzeldine Al
Majid, a brother-in-law of Hussein Kamel who defected to Jordan
last August but refused to return to Iraq, said he would
coordinate with the former army Chief whom he described as "one of
the cleanest persons in Iraq."
</P>
<P>
He said he did not know Kazraji personally but said the man was
"courageous and trusted."
</P>
<P>
"He is a very credible man known for his honesty among the
people of Iraq," said Majid.

<HEADLINE> Russia, Belarus Agree to Form Union </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Russia and Belarus plan to form a
union of the two countries, Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko
said here today.
</P>
<P>
An accord to set up the union which will include a Supreme
Council made up of both presidents and prime ministers, its own
flag and joint border defense, will be signed on April 2, the
president told reporters after his meeting with Russian Prime
Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin this morning.
</P>
<P>
Lukashenko said the decision was made during his talks on
Friday with Russian President Boris Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
Belarus, Russia's small western neighbour, with a population
of some 10 million, has remained closest to Russia since the
Soviet Union broke up in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Itar-Tass quoted Lukashenko as saying that a Supreme Council
comprising presidents, premiers and other top officials of the two
states will be formed with "very wide powers."
</P>
<P>
An executive committee will also be formed which "in effect
will become a government."
</P>
<P>
The union will have its own flag and emblem, common budget and
joint border defense as well as, in the future, common currency.
</P>
<P>
But Russia and Belarus will maintain their own sovereignty
separately within the union, the Belarussian president said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the union would be open to other former Soviet
republics to join.
</P>
<P>
Russia and Belarus have speeded up steps toward integration
since the beginning of last year.
</P>
<P>
Analysts noted the announcement of the union coincided with
the visits by Secretary-General of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) Javier Solana and U.S. Secretary of State
Warren Christopher in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
Both Western leaders said NATO's strategy of eastward
expansion, which Moscow has strongly opposed, remains unchanged.
</P>
<P>
On March 29 in Moscow, leaders of Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan
and Kyrgyzstan will sign other agreements on deepening the
integration process between them.

<HEADLINE> Syrian Newspaper Raps Israel for Escalating Tension in South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Israel is criticized here today
by a local daily for escalating the tension in south Lebanon and
impeding the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper "Tishrin" said in its editorial that the current
tension and turmoil in south Lebanon indicate that military
solution to the conflict is impossible, noting that "Israeli
military leaders themselves acknowledged that the best solution
should be a political one."
</P>
<P>
The reason for the exacerbation of the security situation in
the area is not the existence of Lebanese national resistance, but
the Israeli occupation, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Once the Israeli occupation of south Lebanon is completely
removed, all forms of tension will be over, because the peace
process is based on the land-for-peace principle, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Tension will go on in the area as long as the Israeli forces
continue to bombard Lebanese villages.
</P>
<P>
The paper stressed that Israel would make a mistake if it
imagined that it could solve the problem and achieve security for
its northern border by using force.
</P>
<P>
Israel should hold responsibility for the consequences of the
deteriorated situation. Aggression is doomed to failure throughout
history in solving differences, the paper noted.
</P>
<P>
If Israel is keen on securing stability in south Lebanon, it
must comply with the resolutions of the U.N. Security Council and
of the Madrid conference which stipulate that the Israelis
completely pull out from the Syrian Golan Heights and south
Lebanon, the paper said.

<HEADLINE> Britain, France, Italy Agree Joint Frigate Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Britain, France and Italy have
agreed to collaborate on the development of a new frigate to
defend convoys or navy task forces from air attacks.
</P>
<P>
After eight years of tough negotiations, the three countries on
Friday struck a 10.5-billion-U.S.-dollar deal to produce 22
ships, 12 of which are for Britain, four for France and six for
Italy, the Financial Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
The new ships, due to go into service in 2002, are designed to
provide a "defensive bubble" which will protect civilian cargo
convoys or naval battle groups from attack by enemy aircraft and
anti-ship missiles.
</P>
<P>
Britain is expected to use the new ships to replace its ageing
Type-42 destroyers, while France and Italy will replace their
Suffren and Doria frigates.
</P>
<P>
The first ships will be built by each country and subsequent
vessels will be built under competitive tender.
</P>
<P>
While construction facilities will be duplicated in each
country, the joint project will be cheaper than separate national
programs because development costs will be shared and there
will be longer production runs for the main equipment.
</P>
<P>
The development of the whole project will be split into two
parts: the main missile system and controlling radar, code named
Anti-Air Missile System, will be based in Paris; ship design,
command and control and secondary weapons systems,
designated Project Horizon, will be run from a project office in
London.

<HEADLINE> Two Cambodian Parties Merge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, March 23 (Xinhua) -- The new opposition Khmer
Nationa Party (KNP) merged with the tiny Liberal Reconciliation
Party (LRP) today in a bid for legal status.
</P>
<P>
The government has refused to recognise the KNP which was
founded only five months ago by Sam Rainsy, a former finance
minister in the royalist FUNCINPEC party.
</P>
<P>
The government says that the party was set up before being
approved and objects to its emblem. King Norodom Sihanouk has told
the KNP to change its logo and founding date.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to get recognition, the KNP decided to merge with the
LRP, one of 20 political parties which took part in the
U.N.-sponsored elections in May 1993.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> More Horses Test Positive in HK Jockey Club </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 23 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Jockey Club has
withdrawn three more horses trained by champion Frenchman Patrick
Biancone from race meetings scheduled for today after they tested
positive for prohibited substances.
</P>
<P>
The newest withdrawal brought to six the number of horses in
Biancone's stable to be out of race, the club announced Friday.
</P>
<P>
One of the horses withdrawn today was the highly regarded
Deauville, a favorite for 3.56 million HK dollars (460,000 US
dollars) Gold Cup race today.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, a senior official downplayed reports that
there had been a breach in the fencing around the stables, about
100 meters from the guard post.
</P>
<P>
Biancone had earlier suggested sabotage, but refused to make
further statements, telling reporters he did not want to influence
an investigation.
</P>
<P>
The substance traced in the tests, Dembrexine, is a generic
drug used as a decongestant and is not supposed to enhance the
horse's performance. Nor is it believed to be a masking agent for
a more sinister drug.
</P>
<P>
The club's veterinarians took samples from all the 57 horses in
Biancone's stable after three of his horses has turned positive
testes.
</P>
<P>
The club has set up a panel to investigate the drug scare
which, so far, has been confined to Biancone's stable. The panel
is to hold its first session Monday to look into the positive
tests and see what, if any, action should be taken.
</P>
<P>
And then the panel would open a formal investigation into how
the horses may have consumed it.

<HEADLINE> HK Sees Increase in "Ice"-Related Cases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 23 (Xinhua) -- The amount of "ice" confiscated
 by Hong Kong police so far this year is almost half the total
seized during the whole of last year, according to a report in
today's Eastern Express.
</P>
<P>
A senior officer in the local Narcotics Bureau was quoted as
saying that the number of "ice"-related cases continues to rise
and the police expect to seize record amounts of "ice" this year.
</P>
<P>
Two men were arrested Thursday, and police seized "ice" which
was valued at about one million HK dollars (about 130,000 US
dollars) in the latest operation involving the drug.
</P>
<P>
So far this year, the police have confiscated 6.5 kilograms of
"ice", compared with 14.2 kilograms seized for the whole of last
year, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
"Ice" is a highly addictive chemical compound which can produce
 a powerful high lasting up to 24 hours, longer than any other
known drug, and during the last few years it has become one of the
 most popular street drugs in Hong Kong.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 23 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong government will
form a new committee to provide more support to small and
medium-sized enterprises (SME), said Regina Ip, director-general
of industry.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a seminar "Rebuilding the Competitiveness of SMEs in
Hong Kong" organized by the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce,
Mrs. Ip said Friday the committee would be established under the
Industry Department.
</P>
<P>
"So far, responses to the proposal of forming the SME committee
have been encouraging," she said. "I envisage that the committee
can be established within two months."
</P>
<P>
She said that local small and medium-sized companies had needs
which were different from large companies. Among the urgent needs
of small firms were information access, technological support,
human resources development, market access and financing.
</P>
<P>
A survey conducted recently by the Chinese Manufacturers'
Association of Hong Kong has shown that small and medium-sized
enterprises in Hong Kong are facing difficulties in finding
expertise and technical talents, tapping overseas market and
enhancing research and development.
</P>
<P>
In Hong Kong, a manufacturing enterprise that employs less than
100 persons is defined as small and medium-sized one.

<HEADLINE> Macao to Build Large New Running Water Plant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Macao is to begin the building of a
 large running water plant this year to meet its increasing demand
 for water by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The Macao Daily News reported today that the Macao Running
Water Company has announced that it will invest 66.80 million
Patacas (about 8.67 million US dollars) in building the new plant
and other relevant facilities this year.
</P>
<P>
The project will be carried out in two phases. Upon completion
of the first phase in June 1997, the running water company will
be able to add 60,000 cubic meters of water daily, pushing the
total daily water supply capacity to 260,000 cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
That means the water supply capacity will be able to meet the
demand in the year 2000, the report quoted an engineer of the
company as saying.
</P>
<P>
With a total population of about 400,000, Macao mow consumes
about 140,000 cubic meters of water a day. Most of the water is
provided by Zhuhai City adjoining Macao.

<HEADLINE> Hainan Breakthrough in Oil-Gas Exploration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, March 23 (Xinhua) -- There have been new findings in
oil and gas exploration in the seas around south China's Hainan
Province, with three high-yielding oil and gas wells drilled since
the beginning of the year.
</P>
<P>
Experts here note that the areas around Hainan are very rich in
oil and gas resources. Western Company of the China National
Offshore Oil Corp. drilled two high-yielding wells last January in
the east and south of the island. The Wenchang 8-3-1 well produces
1,378 cu m of crude and 363,000 cu m of gas a day, and Lingtou
1-1-1 produces 230,000 cu m of gas a day.
</P>
<P>
A well drilled this month on the Ledong 22-1 gas-bearing
structure southwest of the province produces nearly 1.22 million
cu m of gas daily.
</P>
<P>
There are three large gas fields, Yacheng 13-1, Dongfang 1-1,
and Ledong 15-1 here, with total proven deposits of 188.83 billion
cu m. Yacheng 13-1 started supplying gas to Hong Kong and Hainan
last January.
</P>
<P>
According to local sources, the rich oil and gas resources
provide a solid foundation for the development of the fertilizer
industry in the province.
</P>
<P>
The province is building a fertilizer plant to produce 300,000
tons of synthetic ammonia and 520,000 tons of urea annually using
gas supplied by Yacheng 13-1. The plant is to be put into
operation in the latter half of this year.
</P>
<P>
The province is also planning to build a group of chemical
enterprises by using its gas resources and is trying to turn
Hainan into an important chemical production base.

<HEADLINE> Teaching Vacancies on Rise in India's Top University </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 23 (Xinhua) -- The number of vacancies in
teaching posts in India's most prestigious university -- Delhi
University (DU) -- has swelled to 200 but no fresh appointments
have been made in 1995-96, the Indian Express reported today.
</P>
<P>
Functioning with barely one-third of its regular strength, the
university has scrapped certain courses while senior faculty
members complained that their research output has been affected.
</P>
<P>
Justifying the delay, DU registrar professor S.K. Wasan said it
was very difficult to fill all the vacancies advertised within the
short time available.
</P>
<P>
"The selection procedure is very time-consuming and it is very
hard to get the vice-chancellor, the visitor's nominees and
experts together, who constitute the selection committee," he
said.
</P>
<P>
According to the Indian Express report, the university has
spent nearly 200,000 rupees (about 5,700 US dollars) in placing
advertisements for 157 posts in the north campus and 53 posts in
the south campus. But so far interviews have been held for only
seven posts in the north campus.

<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, March 23 (Xinhua) -- The six-day ceasefire announced
by the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) last week has been broken
with three attacks on villages in South Sierra Leone, which left
at least 12 people dead, aid agencies reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
the attack came three days before high-level peace talks
between Sierra Leone's Head of State, Brigadier General Julius
Maada Bio and RUF leader Foday Sankoh in Cote D'Ivoire.
</P>
<P>
General Bio is to hand over power to civilian President Tejan
Kabbah on March 29. Bio is to leave Freetown on Sunday for
Abidjan of Cote D'Ivoire and later go on to Nigeria for talks
with Head of State Sani Abacha, diplomatic sources said.
</P>
<P>
The government has not yet made any official statement on the
attack and diplomats here attributed the silence to ''moves not
to jeopardize'' the Monday talks which is crucial to the outgoing
military government.
</P>
<P>
Local journalists quoting survivors of the attacks said about
100 RUF rebels attacked Sengay village and killed three women,
gunned down two men at Funguya while seven people, including
three women, were tortured to death at Ngovokpehun, all in the
south

<HEADLINE> India's Ruling Party to Release Election Manifesto </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 23 (Xinhua) -- The ruling Indian National
Congress is expected to release its manifesto for the coming
general elections next week, according to the National Herald
today.
</P>
<P>
The disclosure was made by Indian Foreign Affairs Minister
Pranab Mukherjee, chairman of the Congress Party's high-powered
manifesto committee.
</P>
<P>
"Our major plank will be once again stability and performance,"
Mukherjee told Indian reporters who accompanied him on his
three-day visit to Uzbekistan.
</P>
<P>
The minister said he had discussed the manifesto with Congress
President P.V. Narasimha Rao before leaving on his foreign tour,
adding that Rao would make some changes before releasing it.
</P>
<P>
Replying to a question, Mukherjee said he had no plan to
contest the Lok Sabha (lower house of parliament) poll.
</P>
<P>
Mukherjee, together with another 10 ministers, was allegedly
listed in the diaries of hawala dealers (illegal foreign exchange
dealers) as a receiptor of bribes.

<HEADLINE> Weekly Review of Malaysia's Tin, Rubber, CPO Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 23 (Xinhua) -- The Kuala Lumpur Tin Market
(KLTM) ended the week higher following strong buying support from
overseas buyers in the last three days.
</P>
<P>
Tin price closed at 15.95 Malaysian Ringgit (about 6.38 US
dollars) per kg, 70 sen higher than last week's close of 15.25
Ringgit (about 6.1 dollars).
</P>
<P>
Dealers said that the price would possibly be higher than 16
Ringgit (about 6.4 dollars) next week following a continued buying
support mainly from abroad.
</P>
<P>
Trade volume of the week stood at 903 tons compared with 659
tons last week.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian rubber market ended the week easier as buyers'
sentiment was weak.
</P>
<P>
The price of April RSS1 was down one sen to 388.5 sen (about
1.55 dollars) per kg while the SMR20 dropped 10.5 sen to 361.5 sen
(about 1.44 dollars) per kg.
</P>
<P>
Dealers here said the price may climb up as China would in the
coming days come to buy some rubber to meet its requirement for
the second half of the year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile crude palm oil (CPO) physicals closed lower this week
on lack of leads and pessimism over the future market.
</P>
<P>
Price for March south closed the week at 1,205 Rinngit (about
482 dollars) per ton against 1,220 Ringgit (about 488 dollars) at
last week's closing.

<HEADLINE> Qian Qichen Reaffirms Chinese Government's Stand on Taiwan Issue (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The eight-point proposal on promoting the reunification of the
motherland put forward by President Jiang Zemin last year has
given an overall and profound explanation on the principles and
won acclaims from both at home and abroad, he noted.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the concept of "one country, two systems"
was initially put forward for the solution to the Taiwan question.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with the principle of "one country, two systems,"
he said, "the policies towards the Taiwan question are more
lenient than that for the Hong Kong issue."
</P>
<P>
This means that the policy towards the Hong Kong issue will be
also applied to the settlement of the Taiwan question and that
Taiwan is allowed to retain its own military forces, Qian quoted
Deng Xiaoping as saying. "But the prerequisite is to adhere
to 'one China' principle," Qian said.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang stressed that the practice of "one country, two
systems" principle in settling the Hong Kong issue is of great
significance to the settlement of the Taiwan question, Qian said.
</P>
<P>
"Proceeding from the high plane of completely accomplishing the
motherland's reunification, we should get everything prepared for
the establishment of the Hong Kong SAR and earnestly implement the
principle of 'one country, two systems'," Qian said.
</P>
<P>
"We must let the Taiwan compatriots see that the principle
of 'one country, two systems' is feasible and also in the
interests of all the Chinese people including the Taiwan
compatriots," he added.

<HEADLINE> Qian Qichen Reaffirms Chinese Government's Stand on Taiwan Issue (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 23 (Xinhua) -- The present tension and chaos in
Taiwan are created by some leading members of the Taiwan
authorities who are seeking "Taiwan independence" by relying on
support from foreign forces, said Chinese Vice-Premier Qian Qichen.
</P>
<P>
He made the remark at the Second Plenary Session of the
Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region (SAR) which opened here today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening session, Qian, also chairman of the
Preparatory Committee, said that the Taiwan question has been
deeply concerned by all the Chinese people including the Hong
Kong compatriots and international communities as well.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government consistently holds that there is only
one China in the world and Taiwan is an inalienable part of the
Chinese territory, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We are firmly opposed to splittist activities designed to
bring about the 'independence of Taiwan' and create 'two Chinas'
or 'one China, one Taiwan'," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The Taiwan question is purely China's internal affairs. No
foreign forces are allowed to interfere in the Taiwan affairs," he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
He said, "We stand for the end of separation between the two
sides of the Taiwan Straits and for the accomplishment of the
great cause of the reunification of the motherland in accordance
with the principles of 'peaceful reunification' and 'one country,
two systems'."
</P>
<P>
However, he said, "We have never undertaken to give up the use
of force." This is not directed against the Taiwan compatriots,
but against foreign forces attempting to interfere in China's
internal affairs and make intrusion and those on the island trying
to bring about the "Taiwan independence", he added.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Increases Contacts with Azerbaijan, Armenia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Turkey has strengthened its
contacts with Azerbaijan and Armenia to overcome the remaining
stumbling blocks, though the countries still debate the terms of a
framework agreement regarding a solution to the dispute over
Nagorno-Karabakh.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Presidential envoy Ayhan Kamel has gone to the region
and conveyed a message from President Suleyman Demirel to his
Azerbaijani counterpart Geidar Aliyev. Kamel will also deliver a
message from Demirel to Armenian President Levon Ter-Petrossian.
</P>
<P>
The messages indicate that the restoration of peace and
stability in the region will enable the establishment of normal
bilateral relations among the regional countries and contribute to
 the prosperity of the region, and stress that "the momentum
gained" in solving the problem should not be lost.
</P>
<P>
According to diplomatic sources, one of the questions which
remain unsettled and must be dealt with in the framework
agreement is the "definition of 'maximum autonomy' that is to be
given to Nagorno-karabakh."
</P>
<P>
While maximum autonomy that would not infringe Azeri
sovereignty is foreseen, the Armenian side insists on a "clear
definition" of the term.
</P>
<P>
Another stumbling block is the future of the Lachin corridor
and the city of Shusha. Azeris maintain that Armenian withdrawal
from these areas should be prompt.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish diplomatic circles hold that peace between the
feuding Azerbaijan and Armenia will quickly lead to the
establishment of diplomatic ties between Turkey and Armenia.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Commission on Status of Women Ends 40th Session </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 22 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Commission on the
Status of Women ended its 40th session Friday after adopting
resolutions on the follow-up actions of the Fourth World
Conference on Women.
</P>
<P>
In its main resolution named the Follow-up to the Fourth World
Conference, the commission set up a U.N. calendar on the
implementation of specific goals of the Beijing Declaration and
Program of Action.
</P>
<P>
Accordingly, in the year of 1996, the target issues are
poverty, women and the media, child and dependent care, including
the sharing of responsibilities between men and women.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the target issues will be women education, women and
decision-making, women and economy, and women and environment.
</P>
<P>
The commission plans to finish the implementation of all major
goals by the year of 1999. It will have a thorough review of the
implementation of the Beijing Declaration and the Program of
Action in 2000.
</P>
<P>
The resolution also asked all member states to submit to the
U.N. Secretariat by 1998 a synthesis report on their
implementation of the major goals set out by the Beijing
Conference.
</P>
<P>
"The atmosphere of the meeting is both practical and
harmonious," said Wang Shuxian, head of the Chinese delegation to
the session.
</P>
<P>
"All delegates have a common wish, that is to turn the
commitments they made at the Beijing Conference into action."
</P>
<P>
"From the introductions in the session, we can see that some
countries have formulated mid-term and long-term plans for the
empowerment of women, and some countries have strengthened
national mechanism for the implementation of the Program of
Action," she said.
</P>
<P>
Wang believed that the Commission on the Status of Women will
play a major coordinating role among U.N. agencies in implementing
the Beijing Declaration and the Program of Actions.
</P>
<P>
The Commission on the Status of Women is a subordinate organ of
the U.N. Economic and Social Council. It has 45 members and
convenes once a year.
</P>
<P>
It has to submit its resolutions to both the Economic and
Social Council and the General Assembly for approval.

<HEADLINE> Researcher: China Has Better Human Rights Record Than U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, March 22 (Xinhua) -- China has a much better record
on human rights than the United States and the latter is not
qualified to criticize the former on such a matter, a Chinese
human rights researcher said here today.
</P>
<P>
"In approaching the human rights issue, we use the criterion
which is embodied in the U.N. Universal Declaration of Human
Rights and the International Conventions on Human Rights," said
Professor Yu Quanyu, vice-president of the China Society for Human
Rights Studies.
</P>
<P>
Both the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the
1966 international conventions highlight the right to being free
from terror and want, Yu said.
</P>
<P>
In public security, he said, 2 million cases of criminal
violence occur annually in the U.S. in which more than 20,000
people are murdered, five times as many as in China in the ratio
to population.
</P>
<P>
Also in the U.S., an average of more than 180,000 women are
raped per year, which represents 18 times more than that in China.
</P>
<P>
From the freedom point of view, China performs better than the
United States, he said. The number of people serving prison terms
in the U.S. totaled 1.5 million, the ratio of prisoners to the
total population being 565 per 100,000, five times as high as that
in China, where the ratio stands at 107 per 100,000.
</P>
<P>
On being free from want, there are more than 7 million people
who have been rendered homeless in the U.S., of whom 2 to 3
million sleep in the open air.
</P>
<P>
In China, however, one can hardly see such a situation, Yu said.
</P>
<P>
Yu continued to say that more than 80 people died from freeze
in the coastal areas around Washington D.C. on December 20,
1994. But in Beijing, which is on the same latitude as the former,
there has been no report of death from freeze for many years.
</P>
<P>
It is ridiculous that the U.S. State Department published a
report to attack China on the human rights issue just 10 days
after more than 80 of its own people were frozen to death in the
region around Washington.
</P>
<P>
Yu noted, it is right to say that there is no perfection on
human rights in any country, and the issue can be discussed but
this should be done on the basis of equality.
</P>
<P>
To interfere in the internal affairs of other countries under
the name of protecting human rights will not be tolerated by
international law.
</P>
<P>
Professor Yu said that under a declaration adopted by the
United Nations in 1981, any country must not use the human rights
issue as an instrument to put pressure on other nations.
</P>
<P>
However, the U.S. State Department publishes reports every year
to criticize other countries on their human rights record. This is
a violation of the U.N. Charter and an act of hegemonism, Yu
stressed.

percent.

BEIJING, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Qian Qichen, vice-premier and
chairman of the Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR), today described the committee's work
over the past two months as being "fruitful".
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Second Plenary Session of the Preparatory
Committee of the Hong Kong SAR which opened here today, Qian said
that the five working panels of the Preparatory Committee have
held meetings separately and the Economic panel will convene its
first meeting soon after the session.

<P>
The panels' discussions agreed that suggestions put forward
by the Preliminary Working Committee laid a sound foundation for
the Preparatory Committee to further study specific issues and make
decisions about them, he said.
</P>
<P>
Qian said the Selecting Committee panel has discussed the
method for producing the selecting committee members and reached
a consensus on the issue in principle.

The Celebrating Activities panel put forward a suggestion
on the establishment of a committee responsible for celebrations
by all walks of life in Hong Kong on its return to the motherland.

decision on holidays in Hong Kong in the later half of 1997 and in
1998.
</P>
<P>
All these demonstrate that the Preparatory Committee is
operating efficiently and orderly with the fruitful efforts made
by its members, Qian said.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Bans British Beef </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 23 (Xinhua)-- South Africa yesterday
imposed a temporary ban, with immediate effect, on British beef
imports due to fears over so-called ''mad cow'' disease.
</P>
<P>
A local daily ''the Citizen'' today quoted Agriculture
Ministry spokesman Deon Joubert as saying that the temporary ban
had been imposed after day-long talks between health and
agriculture ministry officials in Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
Joubert said South Africa planned to send a government team to
Britain to ask for guarantees on the safety of beef exports.
</P>
<P>
South Africa last year imported more than 27,000 tons of
British beef, about 3 percent of its total beef consumption.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the South African Meat Board said this week that
meat known to be unfit for human consumption had entered South
Africa last year after escaping inspection.
</P>
<P>
fifteen other countries have already imposed ban on British
beef imports pending scientific advice. They include Austria,
Italy, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Luxembourg, the
Netherlands, Portugal, Spain and Sweden, New Zealand, Singapore
and Cyprus.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Principals Stress Need to Motivate Students </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 22 (Xinhua) -- How to motivate students, to
draw parents' attention to school work and to teach the disabled
are among the top concerns of American elementary and middle
school principals.
</P>
<P>
Some 97 percent of the 800 principals surveyed by the National
Association of Elementary School Principals said it is "important"
or "very important" to find ways to motivate students and maintain
high expectations of them.
</P>
<P>
Sixty-five percent said it is "very important" to find ways to
help parents become more committed to and involved in their
children's education.
</P>
<P>
Richard Sauls, principal of Carver Heights Elementary School in
Goldsboro, North Carolina, said parents "are placing very little
value on education. We have to educate not only the children, but
the parents as well."
</P>
<P>
The principals also stressed the importance of providing
special education to the disabled children.
</P>
<P>
"I'm more concerned about gang activity and special education
issues," Tony Harduar, principal of Hanshew Middle School in
Anchorage, Alaska, said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Army Anti-missile Test Fails </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 22 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Army failed today in
an anti-missile test of the planned high-altitude defensive
system, U.S. military sources said.
</P>
<P>
The failure was the second in less than four months by the
U.S. Army in a series of tests of the Theater High-Altitude Area
Defense (THAAD) missile.
</P>
<P>
In Friday's test, the missile failed to carry out in-flight
command and control orders, the Pentagon's Ballistic Missile
Defense Organization announced in a brief statement after the test.
</P>
<P>
A similar failed attempt was conducted on December 13 at the
U.S. Army's White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
The THAAD defensive system was developed by the biggest U.S.
military contractor Lockheed Martin Corp. to succeed the existing
Army antimissile missiles, such as the Patriot missile.
</P>
<P>
It is part of its national "Theater Missile Defense" program
being pressed by the Republican-controlled Congress.
</P>
<P>
This program is far less costly than the so-called "Star War"
program advocated by former U.S. president Ronald Reagan in the
mid-1980s.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Appeals For Increased Foreign Assistance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania has asked the
donor community for increased financial support, pledging
improved aid management, accountability and good governance.
</P>
<P>
The request was made here on Friday by the Minister for
Finance, Simon Mbilinyi when opening a Round Table Conference on
Aid Management and Accountability Program improvement proposals.
</P>
<P>
The one-day conference was attended by representatives of some
of the donor countries and agencies including the World Bank, the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the United States Agency
for International Development (USAID).
</P>
<P>
The minister told the conference about the positive effect of
foreign aid on Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
He said foreign assistance from bilateral, multilateral and
Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) played a critical role in
Tanzania's development.
</P>
<P>
Total foreign aid as percentage of total government
development expenditure increased from 59.2 percent in 1982/83 to
over 90 percent in 1994/95.
</P>
<P>
"These statistics reveal the increasing role of foreign aid
especially after launching the Economic Recovery Program (ERP) in
1986," Mbilinyi said.
</P>
<P>
He said the share of foreign aid in the Gross Domestic Product
(GDP) rose from an average of 7.0 percent per year during 1970 to
1975, to 13.0 percent during 1980 to 1982.
</P>
<P>
"The increased resources were meant to provide the basis for
growth and sustainability," he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the minister said that the government had
established the Aid Management and Coordination System (AMCS) in
preparation for the Aid Management and Accountability Program
(AMAP).
</P>
<P>
He told that participants that AMAP had been designed to put
in place an improved aid management system in three central
institutions most directly concerned with financial management.
</P>
<P>
These institutions are the Ministry of Finance, the Planning
commission and the Bank of Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
AMCS, he said, was designed to improve the mechanisms for
coordinating, managing and administering the aid program and
address the issues relating to linkages between external
assistance and economic and financial management.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Mbilinyi told the donor community that the reforms
taking place in the country were aimed at preparing the country
for a determined drive towards the ultimate goal of
self-reliance.

<HEADLINE> Car Worker Travels In Time to Qing Dynasty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, March 22 (Xinhua) -- When car worker He Zhihua
finishes work in a plant in Tianjin he takes a journey back in
time to China's Qing Dynasty.
</P>
<P>
Alongside his wardrobe of modern clothes, 58-years-old He
Zhihua has a large collection of authentic Qing Dynasty clothing.
</P>
<P>
Collecting has become a favorite spare-time hobby for growing
numbers of Tianjin residents, and many of them say they benefit a
lot from their hobby.
</P>
<P>
He Zhihua, who works at the Tianjin Motor-car Electronic
Apparatus Plant, is a typical example.
</P>
<P>
He has built up a collection of more than 600 pieces, or sets of
clothes, of Qing Dynasty (1644-1911), and clothing popular during the
days before the founding of new China in 1949.
</P>
<P>
He has spent decades gathering his large collection which has
formed a series, reflecting the evolution and development of
modern Chinese dress culture.
</P>
<P>
For He, now a member of the Collecting Committee of China Society of
Cultural Relics, collecting clothes not only makes his spare-time
life more colorful, but also helps him know more about knitting,
dyeing, embroidering, and using of cloth in making clothes.
</P>
<P>
"I also make certain contributions to research on dressing
culture," he said.
</P>
<P>
In the north China port city, there were many folk collectors
in the past, and there are more today with local residents' living
standards being improved.
</P>
<P>
A recent exhibition of folk collection attracted 28 collectors
including cardres, workers, professors, engineers and medical
workers, with ages ranging from 20 to 70.
</P>
<P>
Exhibits included irons of different dynasties in
Chinese history, and modern domestic and foreign irons, works of
art made from fish bone, face masks, fireworks, and coins of
different countries, which all bear their own moving stories.
</P>
<P>
The city organized its first folk collection exhibition in
1995, attracting more than 2,000 visitors. Symposiums have been
organized regularly, making Tianjin's collectors, and their
collections, occupy an important position in the country.

<HEADLINE> GM Workers End 18-Day Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Workers of the General Motors
Corp. (GM) ended their 18-day strike today after the company
agreed to create hundreds of new jobs at its two brake-making
plants in Dayton, Ohio, the birthplace of the strike.
</P>
<P>
The agreement allows the GM to continue to use "outsourcing" --
the purchase of auto parts from outside suppliers -- as a tool in
its campaign for lower costs and greater productivity.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the GM will pay 5.6 million U.S. dollars to the
workers as compensations for previous subcontracting and other
grievances.
</P>
<P>
Production resumed immediately at the Dayton plants which
supply brakers and braking parts for the GM's all 29 assembly
plants in the North American region.
</P>
<P>
The GM said that most of the plants that receive parts from
Dayton plants could be back in operation within about a week.
</P>
<P>
The strike, started by some 3,000 employees at Dayton
brake-making plants on March 5 brought the GM's North American
assembly plants to a near standstill and more than 177,000
workers had been laid off.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated the strike, the longest against the GM since
1970, would cost the world's largest automaker hundreds of
millions of dollars in short-term profits.

<HEADLINE> Foundations Pouring Money to Aid Three Gorges Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, March 23 (Xinhua) -- A total of 14 provinces or
municipalities across China have set up foundations totalling 335
million yuan (about 40 million US dollars) in an effort to support
the construction of the Three Gorges Project.
</P>
<P>
Provinces and municipalities, such as Guangdong, Shanghai,
Fujian, and Shandong, have used interest-free loans from local
government budgets, while Jiangsu Province has taken 20 million
yuan from its power development foundation, to set up foundations
for the gigantic project.
</P>
<P>
A fibre-board manufacturing factory, with aid from Shanghai's
foundation, has invested 14.28 million yuan in Sichuan's Wanxian
City.
</P>
<P>
The project has not only developed local resources, but has
also helped resettlement work, and spurred local economic
development.
</P>
<P>
The Township Enterprises Bureau in Sichuan's Wushan County in
the reservoir area applied for loans from Guangdong's Shenzhen
City. But an expert group sent by the city's foundation discovered
that the new site of the factory is below the reservoir's water
level. They refused to agree to the investment.
</P>
<P>
Plans to launch "Oriental Dynasty," a luxury pleasure-boat in
Wushan County, were shelved because of a shortage of money for its
interior decoration. Learning this, the Shenzhen foundation loaned
2.5 million yuan, and the pleasure boat is now in operation. In
less than one year, the pleasure boat earned nearly one million
yuan for the county.

<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Colombian President
Ernesto Samper may shorten his term and advance the presidential
election to resolve the present political crisis, local press
today quoted sources close to the government as saying.
</P>
<P>
Samper, who came to power in 1994, is pondering the option and
has consulted political, business and cultural personalities,
including his predecessor Cesar Gaviria and Colombian Nobel
laureate Gabriel Garcia Marquez, said the sources.
</P>
<P>
The constitution would have to be amended if the election, due
to be held in 1998, was moved up, according to the sources.
</P>
<P>
Colombia has been in political turmoil since former Defense
Minister Fernando Botero alleged on January 22 this year that drug
traffickers contributed funds to Samper's 1994 election campaign.
</P>
<P>
Samper has repeatedly denied the charges and said that if any
drug-related money infiltrated his campaign, it was done behind
his back.

<HEADLINE> Russia, U.S. Still Wide Apart on NATO Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov
today repeated Russia's strong opposition to NATO's planned
eastward expansion to include former Soviet satellite states.
</P>
<P>
He was speaking to reporters at a joint news conference with
U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher who came here to
impress upon the Kremlin Washington's determination to enlarge the
western military alliance.
</P>
<P>
But Primakov said both he and Christopher expressed readiness
at their talks to seek a compromise in the interests of both sides.
</P>
<P>
Christopher arrived here on Thursday afternoon from Prague,
where he reassured the foreign ministers of 12 central and east
European countries on Wednesday of Washington's resolve to expand
NATO.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Secretary of State met with Yeltsin in the Russian
president's Kremlin residence this morning and held talks with
Primakov in the afternoon before the news conference.
</P>
<P>
Primakov said he and Christopher discussed preparations for the
upcoming G-8 Moscow summit on nuclear security and U.S. President
Bill Clinton's Moscow visit timed to coincide with the summit.
</P>
<P>
Asked about Clinton's attitude toward Yeltsin, who looks
unlikely to win a second term in the June presidential election,
Christopher said Washington continues to support Russia's reforms
in both political and economic spheres and Clinton continues his
backing for Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
Christopher said he and Primakov will take part in the Moscow
meeting on Saturday of the Contact Group on the former Yugoslavia,
which groups Russia, Britain, the United States, Germany and
France, on Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Colombian President Proposes Shortening His Term </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Colombian President
Ernesto Samper proposed today that the present presidential term
be cut short and a government of unity be created to solve the
political crisis arising from drug corruption charges.
</P>
<P>
The president proposed a political option to pull the country
out of the crisis: to create a government of unity after the
shortening of the presidential period.
</P>
<P>
The cutting short of the presidential term would be made
without affecting that of the Congress of the Republic to avoid
the effects of the crisis. This process would be effected by means
of a constitutional reform, which can be realized perfectly,
Samper said.
</P>
<P>
Samper has been accused of receiving money from the Cali drug
cartel to finance the electoral campaign that brought him to power
in 1994. A special committee has been set up to look into the
charges.
</P>
<P>
Samper stated his belief that an integral solution to the
problems faced by Colombia should be found.
</P>
<P>
There exist several steps to overcome the crisis, said the
Colombian president, but they should be applied when the Chamber
of Deputies finishes the investigation.

<HEADLINE> U.S. House Votes to Repeal Assault Weapon Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 22 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. House of
Representatives on Friday voted 239-173 to repeal the ban on 19
types of semiautomatic weapons, a bill President Bill Clinton said
he will veto if it passes Congress.
</P>
<P>
The house measure would remove the ban on weapons such as the
AK-47 and the Uzi from the 1994 anti-crime bill, which was passed
when Democrats controlled Congress.
</P>
<P>
Opponents said the bill was brought to floor with only two days
notice to keep a promise Republican House leaders made to the
National Rifle Association (NRA) last year to have a vote on the
issue. The NRA has been fighting gun control, a bitterly fought
issue in the Congress in recent years.
</P>
<P>
"It is an outrage for the Congress to vote to repeal the
assault weapon ban. It's an IOU to the National Rifle
Association," Vice President Al Gore said before the vote.
</P>
<P>
Supporters of the bill said the ban was ineffective and
violated the constitutional right of Americans to own guns.
</P>
<P>
Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole said on Thursday that he also
did not think the ban was working. "What we need to do is find a
way to prevent criminals from obtaining firearms," he said.
</P>
<P>
But Dole said he doubted the bill had enough support to pass in
the Senate and he had no plans to bring it up any time soon. "It's
not a priority," said Dole, though he also promised the NRA last
year that he would work to repeal the ban.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday Clinton said, "I believe it would be deeply wrong
for Congress to repeal this assault weapon ban. It doesn't need to
be voted on in the House or the Senate and if it is passed, I will
veto it."

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Russian and Belarus presidents
agreed today that accelerating the multi-level integration of
their two countries will broaden the fields for cooperation among
countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States.
</P>
<P>
Russian President Boris Yeltsin and his Belarus counterpart,
Alexander Lukashenko, reached the agreement at a meeting here today
to discuss their integration strategy, the Russian Presidential
Press Office said.
</P>
<P>
Lukashenko is now in Moscow for a one-day working visit.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents "have coordinated main parameters
determining a new level of integration in political, economic and
social spheres," a press release from the office said.
</P>
<P>
But it did not say whether Lukashenko asked Yeltsin to sign a
bilateral union treaty as he told Yegor Stroyev, chairman of
Russia's upper house of parliament, the Federation Council,
earlier today in Minsk, capital of Belarus.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting with Stroyev who is heading a parliamentary
delegation on a two-day visit, Lukashenko again stressed his
determination to integrate his country with Russia and said he
would suggest Yeltsin sign a bilateral union treaty.
</P>
<P>
The union treaty, which provides for the setting up of numerous
supernational structures, may be joined later by other members of
the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), Lukashenko said.
</P>
<P>
Russia and Belarus have been in good relations since the
dissolution of the Soviet Union and sped up an integration process
since the start of 1995. Among the CIS countries, Russia remains
the largest trading partner and energy supplier for Belarus.

TIRANA, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Albania and Greece, once two
quarreling neighbors over border incidents and ethnic disputes,
today signed their first historic treaty on bilateral cooperation,
good-neighborliness and security.
</P>
<P>
Albanian President Sali Berisha and his Greek counterpart,
Costis Stephanopoulos agreed that the signing turned "a new
chapter" in bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Clinton Signs 11th Stopgap Spending Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 22 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
today signed the 11th temporary spending bill of fiscal 1996 to
avoid a third government shutdown.
</P>
<P>
The stopgap spending bill, passed in the House of
Representatives by 244-180 votes and approved by a voice vote in
the Senate Thursday, will keep some departments and agencies
running through March 29.
</P>
<P>
"The reason that I must sign yet another continuing resolution
is that the Congress still has not passed five of this year's
appropriations bills in acceptable form," the president said.
</P>
<P>
He urged Congress to send him a bill "in acceptable form"
before its a two-week spring recess beginning March 29.
</P>
<P>
With the 1996 fiscal year half gone, three quarters of the
non-military budget of the United States is being provided through
temporary spending bills.
</P>
<P>
The Republican-controlled Congress wants to appropriate 160
billion U.S. dollars for government agencies in the remaining half
of the year. Clinton is demanding 8 billion more.
</P>
<P>
"Congress ought not to look to any additional short-term
spending bills," said White House chief of staff Leon Panetta,
hinting that the president might not sign another stopgap bill.
</P>
<P>
At a White House meeting Wednesday between Clinton and
Republican Congressional leaders, both sides expressed a desire
to reach a long-term solution to the 1996 budget before the
Congress goes into its Easter-Passover recess.

BANGKOK, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Thai fragrant rice continues to
be in high demand on the world market due to it high quality, said
Thai Foreign Trade Department Director-general Prachai
Charutrakulchai.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> More EU States Ban Importing British Beef </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Austria and Spain decided today to
ban the importing of British beef and beef products in reaction to
the reported "mad cow disease" in the island country.
</P>
<P>
Austrian Health Minister Christa Krammer told the Austria
Presse Agentur (APA) that the suspension was to prevent cheap
British beef from entering the Austrian market and protect
Austrian consumers from eating beef infected with the disease.
</P>
<P>
The "mad cow disease" has triggered a major health scare
throughout the European continent and led to prices slump by 15
percent of British beef and beef products.
</P>
<P>
The minister has asked the European Union (EU) to hold a
veterinarian conference and coordinate moves of member states to
shake off the beef crisis.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, Spain also announced to suspend buying
British beef and cattle, fearing of importing the "mad cow
disease" into the nation, said reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
A Spanish quarantine organ and an agricultural and husbandry
organization announced that no "mad cow disease" has been found in
the country till now and adviced the Spanish consumers to buy
domestic beef.
</P>
<P>
Nine other EU states -- Italy, Belgium, Finland, France,
Germany, Greece, the Netherlands, Portugal and Sweden -- have
announced bans on British beef imports as a precaution due to
scientific advice and expected EU action next week.
</P>
<P>
Some countries outside the 15-member organization also joined
in, including New Zealand, South Africa, Singapore and Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
British Health Secretary Stephen Dorrell said a few days ago
that there was a likely link between the "mad cow disease," also
bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), in British cattle and its
fatal human equivalent Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD).
</P>
<P>
Ten young people died lately in Britain of the CJD, which
scientists said could take more than 10 years after infection to
reveal itself.
</P>
<P>
The EU might follow German suggestions and opt for a blanket
EU-wide ban on British beef. This could cost the British
government 20 billion pounds (30.8 billion U.S. dollars) in
compensation and strengthen anti-EU sentiment in Britain.
</P>
<P>
The EU is the world's second beef producer, after the United
States, accounting for nearly 15 percent of the world output. It
produces about eight million tonnes of beef a year from a herd of
around 32 million cattle.
</P>
<P>
Annual consumption has remained stable at around 21 kilograms
per person in the EU member states.

<HEADLINE> Thai Defense Minister Expects 100 Generals to Quit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 23 (Xinhua) -- More than 100 high-ranking
military officers are expected to take early retirement this year
under a scheme designed to trim the armed forces, according to
Thai Defense Minister Gen. Chavalit Yongchaiyudh.
</P>
<P>
For now, the retirement initiative aims to reduce the number of
generals but is likely to extend to officials with lower ranks in
the future.
</P>
<P>
Gen. Chavalit was quoted today by local media as saying that he
is confident the scheme will be a success. There will be fewer
officials to be promoted to generals from now on.
</P>
<P>
He said the armed forces are waiting to see exactly how many
people will join the scheme this year.
</P>
<P>
As the forces need time to draw up their lists of retirees,
including those retiring early, an announcement of the military
reshuffle next month may be delayed, said Gen. Chavalit.
</P>
<P>
He said many officials are giving careful thought to the
scheme. Incentives will be provided to those leaving the forces
early.

<P>
BANGKOK, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Thai Deputy Foreign Minister
Charas Puachuay suggested Thailand and Myanmar increase joint
activities in a bid to strengthen bilateral relations, according
to today's Bangkok Post.
</P>
<P>
Charas made the suggestion Friday during a visit to Mae Sai
district in northern Thai province of Chiang Rai where a border
crossing was opened a week ago after it had been closed for one
year.
</P>
<P>
Charas said he told Chiang Rai Governor Kamron Booncherd to
look for ways of working with Myanmar officials so cultural
activities could be held with people across the border, for
example, Kathin ceremony (an annual ceremony to present robes to
monks).
</P>
<P>
He explained that once the relations between the two countries
are strengthened, it is less likely for conflicts to arise which
could lead to closing the border crossing again.
</P>
<P>
The deputy foreign minister also agreed with Kamron's proposal
to build another bridge across the Mae Sai River linking Thailand
and Myanmar.

<P>
ROME, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Italian Serie A players could launch
another strike as Friday's three-hour meeting between Sergio
Campana, the leader of players' union (AIC), and federation
officials did not reach a complete agreement.
</P>
<P>
After the first meeting since last weekend's unprecedented
strike by the country's leading players, Campana said the only
real progress at the meeting was a timetable for further
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The serie A, B and C divisions and the players' and coaches'
unions agreed to meet in Milan on March 29 to discuss the
consequences of the recent European Court Bosman ruling.
</P>
<P>
Campana added that the union wanted agreement as soon as
possible to lift further threatened action but difficulties
remained before that could be achieved.
</P>
<P>
The union is protesting on a range of issues. They want the
leaders of the players' and coaches' unions admitted to the
sport's ruling body, as well as the topping-up of a guarantee
fund that ensures players receive their salaries even if their
club goes bankrupt.
</P>
<P>
They also want to maintain limits on players from outside the
European Union and are seeking the immediate abolition of the
current transfer fee system at the end of the current season.
</P>
<P>
The matches postponed last weekend because of the strike have
been rescheduled for April 10.

TAIYUAN, March 23 (Xinhua) -- The heavily-polluted Fenhe River
in north China's Shanxi Province is expected to put on a new look
in the coming decade, thanks to the government's efforts.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government has worked out provisions for the
treatment of water pollution in the river and its valley.
</P>
<P>
The project will be carried out in two stages with an
additional 20 million yuan (about 2.4 million US dollars) a year
allocated to it during the 1996-2000 period.
</P>
<P>
Local governments are encouraged to join hands to treat the
pollution.
</P>
<P>
The Fenhe is a major tributary of the Yellow River, the
second-longest river in China.
</P>
<P>
The valley is home to about 41 percent of the provincial
population, and turns out 46 percent of Shanxi's industrial output
and 64 percent of its agricultural production.
</P>
<P>
Since the mid-1980s the provincial government has allocated 50
million yuan to clean the river.

<HEADLINE> "Mad Cow Disease" in UK Could Benefit Brazil: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Agriculture Minister Jose
Eduardo de Andrade Vieira said today that Brazilian beef producers
could benefit from the "mad cow disease" in the United Kingdom,
which has prompted several countries to stop importing beef from
the island country.
</P>
<P>
Brazilian beef exports toward the European market could
increase after five European countries banned the import of
British beef, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
The "mad cow disease," known as bovine spongiform
encephalopathy (BSE), affects a lot of cattle in the United
Kingdom, and scientists are afraid it can be caught by the human
being.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the minister ruled out the possibility of the
spreading of the disease to Brazil, saying the import of cattle
for reproductive purposes will be carefully monitored.
</P>
<P>
The predominant beef race in Brazil is the Nelore, which is
different from those affected in the United Kingdom, said the
minister.
</P>
<P>
Europe is haunted by a major health scare and beef cattle
prices slumped 15 percent in Britain, whose beef industry is worth
about 3 billion U.S. dollars a year and sees about one third of
its sales go overseas.

<HEADLINE> Xiamen Reports Brisk Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XIAMEN, March 23 (Xinhua) -- This major port in east China's
Fujian Province and one of the country's four special economic
zones, has seen rapid economic growth in the last few years.
</P>
<P>
Official figures show that in 1995 the city had a GDP of
25 billion yuan, which is eight times the figure for 1990.
</P>
<P>
In the same year the city approved 450 overseas-funded
businesses, involving 1.7 billion US dollars of overseas
investment, which is 87 percent of the 1986-1990 total.
</P>
<P>
In 1995 the city exported 3.4 billion US dollars-worth of
goods, which is five times the figure for the 1986-1990 period.
</P>
<P>
According to an official evaluation, the city's comprehensive
economic strengthen puts Xiamen among the top 10 Chinese cities.
</P>
<P>
City officials attributed their economic success to improvement
in the city's investment environment, which has helped draw 4.3
billion US dollars in overseas capital and 2.6 billion yuan in
domestic funds in the last five years.
</P>
<P>
From 1991 to 1995 the city spent seven billion yuan on road,
airport, port, telecommunications, power supply and other
infrastructure projects.
</P>
<P>
In the same period the city approved 2,300 enterprises funded
by businesses from 23 countries and regions worldwide, with 1,600
of them already in operation. Overseas-funded enterprises now
account for 72 percent of its industrial production.
</P>
<P>
The city is forging closer economic ties with other Chinese
regions. Its decision to extend preferential policies which it
had previously reserved for overseas investors to other domestic
regions proved to be a smart move. Investors from other Chinese
regions set up 1,586 business in the city in the last five
years.

<HEADLINE> Honduras, United States to Ink Two Agreements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEGUCIGALPA, March 22 (Xinhua) -- U.S. government officials
arrived here today to work together with Honduran Foreign Ministry
representatives in analyzing the signing of two cooperation
agreements between the two countries, official sources said.
</P>
<P>
One of the proposed agreements is about the two nations' joint
fighting against drug trafficking by using Honduran territorial
waters in the Atlantic coast and the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
Drug trafficking cases have been on the increase over the past
few years. Just during the first two months of this year, more
cocaine has been confiscated than that seized in 1995, the sources
said.
</P>
<P>
The situation causes so much concern to the U.S. government
that it is studying the possibility of installing more radar
systems to detect drug traffickers' aircraft in the zone.
</P>
<P>
The second agreement to be signed verses about the
U.S. cooperation with Central American countries to counteract the
exports to Hoduras stolen motor vehicles in the United
States.

<HEADLINE> Wuhan Plans to Lower Summer Temperatures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Wuhan, the capital of central
China's Hubei province, plans to keep its summer temperature below
36 degrees centigrade by the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
More urban afforestation was listed as one of the ways of
cooling the city, which is known as one of the three hottest
cities by the Yangtze River, along with Chongqing in Sichuan
and Nanjing in Jiangsu province.
</P>
<P>
Other measures include planting duckweed in lakes in and around
the city, which is known for the amount of water it contains, and
banning large and tall chimneys.
</P>
<P>
According to China Environment Journal, the plan, which was
proposed by 37 deputies to the Wuhan Municipal People's Congress
and approved at a meeting of the congress earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
Professor Zeng Renduan, who drafted the proposal, said that
temperatures above 36.5 degrees centigrade can cause psychological
problems.
</P>
<P>
He said that temperatures stay above 37 degrees centigrade for
at least 40 consecutive days in the summertime, the highest having
been above 39 degrees for nearly a month.
</P>
<P>
The professor said the high temperatures are a problem not only
for quality of residents' lives, but also for matters of foreign
exchange and economic development.
</P>
<P>
Many overseas investment projects and summer academic exchanges
cannot be carried out simply because of the hot weather, the
professor explained.
</P>
<P>
He said it is possible to lower the temperature by two degrees
centigrade even though the whole world is moving towards warmer
temperatures.
</P>
<P>
Zeng went on to say that Nanjing, one of China's hottest
cities, was a little bit cooler last year because of better
afforestation work in recent years. There were only a few days
with temperatures above 36 degrees centigrade last year.
</P>
<P>
The professor cited the U.S.'s Los Angeles as another
example. Although it is located in a desert area, the weather in
the city has become hospitable thanks to more than a hundred
years' efforts at improvements.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Adopts Platform for Talks with IMF, WB </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, March 22 (Xinhua) -- The Yugoslav government adopted
a platform today for talks with the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) and the World Bank, scheduled for March 27 in Paris.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav delegation will be headed by Dragoslav Avramovic,
governor of the Yugoslav National Bank, the Yugoslav Ministry of
Information said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia wishes to reach an agreement as soon as possible on
the reactivation of its membership in the IMF and resumption of
financial cooperation with this institution in creating an open
and market-oriented economy.
</P>
<P>
A resumption of Yugoslavia's membership in the IMF is a
precondition for resuming its membership in the World Bank. The
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, as the successor state to the
former Yugoslavia, is a co-founder and signatory of the documents
of the Bretton Woods conference on the setting up of the IMF and
the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development in
December 1945.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia maintains that, as the successor state, it should
resume its membership in the IMF and the World Bank. The U.N.
International Law Commission has stated that the Federal Republic
of Yugoslavia is the successor after the secession of some
republics of the former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia is willing to meet its
obligations towards the fund as soon as they normalize their
relations. After that, new talks are expected with creditors on a
consolidation and rescheduling of the foreign debt of the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia, the statement said.

<HEADLINE> LSE Clears Way for Trading Revolution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 22 (Xinhua) -- The London Stock Exchange (LSE)
board Thursday agreed to introduce its controversial computerized
order-driven share dealing system, but not for at least another
year and initially only for FT-SE 100 stocks.
</P>
<P>
The move from the current quote-driven system had been fiercely
opposed by market-making firms whose wholesale activity is not
required with order-driven dealing.
</P>
<P>
But they will retain a role by being allowed to deal "upstairs"
(off the order book) in large blocks of shares.
</P>
<P>
The move to order-driven dealing was masterminded by former
Exchange chief executive Michael Lawrence, who blames the original
opposition for the decision to sack him in January.
</P>
<P>
The new system, also known as order-matching or order-book,
allows buy and sell orders to be entered on a central system, and
automatically executed when they match.
</P>
<P>
In the current quote-driven system, marketmakers list on screen
the prices at which they are willing to buy or sell, but deals are
actually struck over the telephone.
</P>
<P>
The compromise agreed Thursday was drawn up by a steering
committee of the LSE following consultation last month with market
users.
</P>
<P>
It avoids making detailed recommendations for implementing the
change, however, and further consultation is to follow.
</P>
<P>
The LSE said that before the new system can be introduced, an
extensive consultation exercise will have to be undertaken with
market users and the various watchdogs that oversee City
regulation.
</P>
<P>
The board of the Exchange announced that there will be a second
round of consultation beginning in May and timed to end in June.
Spring 1997 is the earliest possible date for introduction of the
new order matching service.

<P>
WASHINGTON, March 22 (Xinhua) -- An agent from the Federal
Bureau Investigation and a drug dealing suspect were both killed
today during a shootout in a motel parking lot in Philadelphia,
authorities said.
</P>
<P>
The agent was trying to buy drugs from the suspect in an
undercover operation when he was fatally shot along with the
suspect in the agent's car in a Comfort Inn parking lot.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Commissioner Richard Zappile said the undercover agent
was shot several times, but he refused to elaborate.
</P>
<P>
Local radio station KYW-AM, quoting unidentified sources, said
the agent was wearing a "body wire" to tape the transaction and
had backup agents waiting nearby.
</P>
<P>
A witness said police officers swarmed the area seconds after
the shooting. Another witness said he saw police remove two bodies
from the front of the agent's car.
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for a local hospital described the suspect as a
23-year-old white man with gunshot wounds to the head and upper
chest. She said he was pronounced dead in the emergency room.
</P>
<P>
The undercover agent, whose identity was not immediately
released, was the 32nd FBI agent killed in the line of duty in the
bureau's 87-year history.

WASHINGTON, March 22 (Xinhua) -- The United States today warned
American travelers of cautiously using the Hellenikon International
Airport in the Greek capital of Athens.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Federal Transportation Secretary Federico Pena said in a
statement that the Hellenikon Airport does not meet international
standards for security and all the U.S. airliners issuing tickets
for travel between the United States and Athens must advise
passengers of the finding.
</P>
<P>
The announcement came after a team of U.S. Federal Aviation
Administration security analysts visited the Hellenikon Airport.
But details of the investigations were not released.
</P>
<P>
The Transportation Department said that it raised the security
issue of the Hellenikon Airport several months ago and the Greek
authorities concerned has been making efforts to improve the
security conditions in accordance with the International Civil
Aviation Authority standards.
</P>
<P>
But Pena said that security improvement is not yet sufficient
although progress is being made at the Hellenikon Airport.
</P>
<P>
A Greek government spokesman said in Athens that Greece and
the United States are cooperating in improving the security
conditions at the airport.

<P>
He pledged that the improvement work will continue until "a

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Govt Fights Corruption In Crude Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's military government
today announced measures to moniter oil exports in the Africa's
biggest crude producer and exporter.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Finance Anthony Ani explained that the measures,
including forming special inspecting teams in April this year, is
aimed at boosting the country's foreign exchange earnings and
enhance the exchange rate of its currency, Naira.
</P>
<P>
Corruptive practices are widely existing in Nigeria, which
gets over 85 percent of its foreign exchange earning from the
export of its oil products.
</P>
<P>
However, despite its huge oil income since the oil boom at the
beginning of 1970s, the West African state remains one of the low
income listed by the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
People say the oil dollars have gone to very few "upstarts"
who were either senior officials of the government or illegal oil
exporters, while the ordinary people remain poor.
</P>
<P>
The foreign donors also sharply criticized the corruptive acts
practiced by some government officials of those having close
links with the military government, saying that the malpractices
would affect the country's foreign aid, trade and investment.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the government is determined to fight
corruption in the country's oil export field.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Suspected Arson Fire Kills 5 in US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 22 (Xinhua) -- A suspected arson fire killed
two adults and their three children today in a suburban town near
Houston, Texas, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
Police said they found the bodies of five victims, some of them
with gunshot wounds, in a burning home in Stafford, Texas.
</P>
<P>
Detective Sgt. Lonnie Crum said the victims had been shot
before the fire and at least one gasoline can, apparently used to
start the fire, was found inside the house.
</P>
<P>
"We discovered a gasoline can, and there are multiple sites of
fire being set throughout the house," Crum said. He said police
found no sign of forced entry into the house.
</P>
<P>
Reports from Stafford said fire fighters and police officers
had to force their way into the home after a passing patrolman
noticed smoke and no one responded when he pounded on the door.
</P>
<P>
After gaining entry, fire fighters and police officers found
five victims, three of whom were small children, perhaps aged
between one and six years.
</P>
<P>
Neighbors said the couple who lived in the home were a nurse
and a drug store manager. They had three children, aging three,
five and six.
</P>
<P>
Crum said police were handling the case as a combination of
murder, suicide and arson. But he said further investigation was
needed before they could reach a conclusion.

<HEADLINE> Second Round Of Local Elections Opened In Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 23 (Xinhua) -- The second round of the on-going
Nigeria's local government elections on non-party basis took
place today in 6,909 of the the West African Country's 6,927
wards.
</P>
<P>
Voters have elected one councillor and ten local government
delegates.
</P>
<P>
The 18 wards left out are suspected to be places where ward
delegate elections were disrupted last Saturday for various
reasons.
</P>
<P>
As the Xinhua correspondent visited the Wahab Folawiyo polling
centre today in the Eti-Osa local government area, Lagos, the
polling was being conducted in a classroom of a college. Several
policemen and security agents were guarding the polling place
outside the classroom.
</P>
<P>
A total of 29 delegates, including three women, who emerged
from last Saturday's ward delegate election, elected one local
government councillor and ten local government delegates.
</P>
<P>
The elected 11 will then join their counterparts from other
wards in the Eti-Osa local government area in electing the
Chairman of the local government next Monday in the last round of
the local government election.
</P>
<P>
The polling at the Wahab Folawiyo ward today went on
hitch-free in a peaceful atmosphere and came to a successful end.
</P>
<P>
To ensure a smooth and orderly polling exercise in the
election, the intra-state and inter-local government movements of
people were restricted this morning by the Nigerian government.
</P>
<P>
Radio Nigeria said that reports from across the country
indicated today's election was peaceful and orderly.
