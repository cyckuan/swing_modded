<P>
BERLIN, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Brazilian Gustavo Kuerten won the
Hamburg Masters Series on Sunday with a 6-4, 5-7, 6-4, 5-7, 7-6
win over Russian Marat Safin in 3 hours 51 minutes.
</P>
<P>
The fifth seed from Brazil, who had lost his three previous
matches against Safin, kept his cool under fire from the 20-year-
old's heavy artillery and held on to win the final set tiebreak 7-
3 on the first of three match points, according to reports
reaching here.
</P>
<P>
Twelfth seed Safin, who had won 17 of his last 18 matches,
troubled his opponent with heavy groundstrokes. But the towering
20-year-old struggled to get his first serves in and lacked
composure at crucial moments.
</P>
<P>
Kuerten, who lost last weekend's Rome Masters final to Magnus
Norman, shot to fame by triumphing as a complete outsider at
Roland-Garros in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Syrian Former Prime Minister Commits Suicide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Official source in the Syrian
Interior Ministry on Sunday confirmed that former Syrian prime
minister Mahmoud Zouebi committed suicide by shooting himself with
a handgun when a senior police officer went to his house to meet
him.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued to the Syrian News Agency, the source said
that under an order issued by the economic investigation judge, the
police chief in Damascus went to Zouebi's house in Dumur district
near Damascus to tell him to stand before the judge for
investigation over charges of abusing power and damaging the
national economy.
</P>
<P>
When the police chief asked for meeting Zouebi, he heard the
sound of gun firing and soon came to know that Zouebi committed
suicide by shooting himself in his room, the source added.
</P>
<P>
He said that Zouebi was immediately taken to a hospital in
Damascus for emergency treatment, but he was dead.
</P>
<P>
Zouebi, 62, held premiership for 13 years. During the last two
years of his office, the cabinet was widely accused of corruption
and
bribery. A new cabinet was later formed under Mohammed Mustafa
Miro.
</P>
<P>
Sources close to Zouebi family said since he was fired from the
ruling Arab Baath Socialist Party and declaring and tried by a
Syrian court, Zouebi has been suffering from nerves breakdown.

<HEADLINE> No Jews Accused of Spying for Iraq: Iranian Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 22 (Xinhua) -- An Iranian judiciary official on
Monday denied reports that some of the Iranian Jews being tried for
spying for Israel were also accused of spying for Iraq.
</P>
<P>
All the 13 Jews being tried are solely charged of spying for
Israel, and none of them have been accused of spying for Iraq, said
Hossein Ali Amiri, head of justice department in the southern Fars
Province, where the accused are being tried.
</P>
<P>
The official termed the report by AFP on Sunday as "baseless".
The AFP report was based on a statement by two French lawyers who
have been sent to Iran by the Lawyers Without Borders to follow the
trial, which has caused international concern, even protests by
Jewish communities in Western countries.
</P>
<P>
The trial of the 13 Jews by a revolutionary court opened on
April 13. So far seven secret court hearings have been held and 10
of the suspects have reportedly admitted having connections with
Israel's security service.
</P>
<P>
The 13 Jews were arrested more than a year ago along with eight
Muslims accused of the same crimes. Currently the eight Muslims and
three of the Jews are free on bail.
</P>
<P>
However, the judiciary official said on Monday that five of the
freed suspects, both Muslims and Jews, have appeared before the
revolutionary court in Shiraz, Fars Province and responded to the
charges against them in recent days following a subpoena.
</P>
<P>
The court has also summoned other suspects freed on bail and
they are required to appear before the court three days after
receiving the order.

<TEXT>
<P>
SANAA, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of Yemenis on Monday
celebrated the tenth anniversary of the country's Unity Declaration
at the Sabe'ini Square in capital Sanaa with a military parade and
athletic shows.
</P>
<P>
Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh and other top officials
attended the celebrations.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the gathering, Yemeni Prime Minister Abdul-Karim al-
Iryani said unity would remain as the source of strength for Arab
and Muslim countries.
</P>
<P>
"Unity of Yemen will remain an important factor of security and
stability in the region," Iryani said, adding that "Yemen has an
unshakable conviction that Arab solidarity and unity of ranks are a
prerequisite to face current and future challenges."
</P>
<P>
Yemen will continue calling on Arab countries to set aside their
past differences, with visions for forging closer inter-Arab ties
and for Arab joint action so as to face the challenges and
developments of the time, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
The festivities were also attended by foreign guests, including
the Chinese delegation headed by Deputy Chairman of the National
People's Congress Timor Dwamat.
</P>
<P>
Yemen was divided for centuries and ruled by monarchies and
local
tribes until the 1960s. On May 22, 1990, Yemen Arab Republic and
People's Democratic Republic of Yemen were united as the Republic
of Yemen.

<HEADLINE> Building of New Jewish Neighborhood in Abu Dis Approved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 22 (Xinhua) -- The Jerusalem Municipal Planning
and Building Committee approved on Monday a plan for building a
Jewish neighborhood in Abu Dis, a Palestinian village east of the
Old City of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Seven committee members voted in favor of the plan, while only
one against.
</P>
<P>
The plan, encompassing 200 home units, is to be submitted to the
Regional Planning and Building Committee for approval.
</P>
<P>
With the approval by the regional committee, the municipality
will be able to draw up a more conclusive plan for the neighborhood
construction.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Jerusalem Mayor Shmuel Shakedi of the National Religious
Party called the decision "historic" and added that whoever favors
Jewish-Arab coexistence should be happy with it.
</P>
<P>
But other peace groups in Israel called the decision a political
one, saying that it proves that Jerusalem Mayor Ehud Olmert, a
member of the opposition Likud party, is trying to force the
government to accept his own political agenda.
</P>
<P>
Abu Dis is one of the three Palestinian villages near Jerusalem
that the government decided to hand over to the Palestinians. The
transfer has been delayed due to violent clashes in recent days in
the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli Knesset approved the transfer of the three villages
last Monday.
</P>
<P>
Building Jewish houses in Abu Dis will be a sensitive issue and
it will cause more conflicts between the Palestinians and Israel.

<HEADLINE> Algerian President Urges Annan to End Ethiopian- Eritrean Conflict </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALGIERS, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Algerian President Abdul-Aziz
Bouteflika called on U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan on Monday to
exert more efforts to halt the ongoing atrocities between Ethiopia
and Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
In a message sent to Annan, Bouteflika, who is currently
rotating president of the Organization of African Unity(OAU), said
he discussed with the U.N. chief on May 5 the possibility of
resumption of the armed conflict between the two African countries.
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, according to the message, his concerns came true
on May 12 and the military confrontation between Ethiopia and
Eritrea is escalating despite the efforts of the OAU and the U.N.
Security Council.
</P>
<P>
"In the name of the OAU, I have issued several appeals to the
leaders of the two warring countries to ceasefire and resume the
peace talks. For the same purpose, I sent my personal envoy to the
capitals of the two countries on May 21," Bouteflika said.
</P>
<P>
"The fact that the armed conflict is escalating forces me to
admit that the OAU efforts are not able solely to stop the sounds
of weapons, stop the bloodshed and return the two warring sides to
the negotiating table," he said.
</P>
<P>
The border dispute between Ethiopia and Eritrea broke off on May
10 and the Ethiopian forces intruded into the Eritrean boder towns,
forcing thousands of civilians to flee from the western areas to
the capital city of Asmara.
</P>
<P>
In addition, more than half a million Eritrean people face a
humanitarian catastrophe due to insufficient human relief supplies.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 22 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan Monday warned that the blocking of U.N. peacekeeping funds
by one U.S. Senator was going to hamper U.N. activities and the U.
N. ability to have the resources required to carry on its mandated
functions.
</P>
<P>
Annan said, "The holds are against four peacekeeping operations
and today. I will be making a proposal to the Council that may
introduce another operation on southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
"And of course, if all these holds continue, it is going to
hamper our activities and our ability to have the resources
required to carry on our mandated functions," he said.
</P>
<P>
"So I hope that the other members of the Senate would work with
the Senator concerned to remove their holds," Annan added.
</P>
<P>
Republican Senator Judd Gregg of New Hampshire has blocked for
several months 368 million U.S. dollars that the United States
owes the U.N. to support peacekeeping operations in Sierra Leone,
Kosovo, East Timor and the Democratic Republic of Congo.
</P>
<P>
The United States has already owed the United Nations 1.7
billion dollars, of which 1.1 billion is for peacekeeping debts.

<HEADLINE> Reppas on Proposal for Withdrawal of Turkish Aegean Army </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
ATHENS, May 22 (Xinhua) -- What is of interest is the foreign
policy exercised by Turkey in practice, the improvement of the
Greek-Turkish relations and the establishment of a new cooperation
relationship between the two neighboring countries, Greek
government spokesman Dimitris Reppas said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Reppas made the remarks when commenting on the proposal by
Turkish Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit's adviser for the abolition
of the Turkish "Aegean Army" and the adoption of a policy of
mutual concessions on Greek-Turkish issues.
</P>
<P>
The senior Turkish military aide also proposed Ecevit's
referral of the Aegean continental shelf issue to international
arbitration or a "freeze" on the issue, the Turkish daily "Sabah"
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Reppas said that Greece had no reason to comment on articles
or views expressed by different officials.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's Aegean Army, which is deployed in Izmir, is created
following Greece's intentions to extend its territorial waters to
12 nautical miles.

<HEADLINE> Venezuela To Allow Private Gas Exploitation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Venezuela's Ministry of Energy and
Mines will begin in June the bidding process for granting to
private firms 11 areas for gas exploration and production.
</P>
<P>
These developments of "non-associated" gas, that is, not
subject to petroleum exploitation, will require an investment of 2
billion U.S. dollars during 15 years, said the ministry.
</P>
<P>
Venezuela's reserves of free and associated gas are over 142
billion cubic feet, equivalent to 25 billion barrels of crude oil,
placing this country among the seven main world producing
countries.
</P>
<P>
About 90 percent of these reserves is made up by gas associated
with crude production.
</P>
<P>
The Organic Law of Gaseous Hydrocarbons of Venezuela allows
exploring and producing of gas by national or foreign private
companies, with or without state participation.
</P>
<P>
But in the case of non-associated gas, a license on behalf of
the Ministry of Energy and Mines is required, and permits will be
granted in the coming December.

<HEADLINE> Food Output, Sale Drop in Romania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Romania's sales of foodstuffs
dropped by 30.4 percent in the first two months of this year
against the same period of 1999, exceptions being vegetable oil,
margarine, beer and tobacco, the official Rompres news agency
quoted Monday data of the National Statistics Commission as
reporting.
</P>
<P>
The plunge in consumption was the result of price rises and
attracted a shrinkage in the output of the respective industries.
</P>
<P>
Romania's per capita consumption of meat dwindled to 30 kg from
45 kg in recent years, prompting negative effects on the
population's health.
</P>
<P>
The activity of nearly 30 percent of Romania's food processing
firms is now at a standstill, with many of them facing bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
The Romanian industry of canned vegetable and fruit and the
sugar industry account for a meager 25 percent of the domestic
demands, with imports being higher than the domestic output.
</P>
<P>
Increased taxation for the 441 food companies resulted in price
rises for vegetable oil, sugar, milk, meat and bread amid lower
personal income, according to the National Statistics Commission.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Not to Occupy Eritrean Territory: PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles
Zenawi said on Monday that Ethiopian troops' recent incursions
deep into western Eritrea were only part of a military strategy
without any intention to occupy Eritrean territory.
</P>
<P>
"We have no intention in anyway of infringing on Eritrean
sovereignty. That was not the issue. That is not the issue, and
that will not be the issue," said Meles when briefing resident
African diplomats here.
</P>
<P>
"That Ethiopia is land-locked is no surprise; it is not a new
thing to us. We knew what we were going into then. We have no
regrets about that", the prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia was the first country to accept the result of the
independence referendum in Eritrea, a former province of Ethiopia,
he recalled.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia, as it has always been, is ready to go to the
negotiating table, and start dialogue on substantive issues, said
Meles.

But "the ball is in Eritrea's court. We had to start from
where we left off, which is the Algiers proximity talks," he

<HEADLINE> Egypt's Grand Imam Calls for Reconciliation, Peace in Somalia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Egypt's most prestigious cleric, Grand
Imam of Al-Azhar Mohamed Sayed Tantawi, on Monday called on Somali
factions to seek ways of ending war and realizing national
reconciliation and peace, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The civil war has destroyed state institutions and the economy
of Somalia and resulted in displacement of hundreds of thousands of
people, who face oppression and tyranny, Tantawi said in a message
to Djiboutian Foreign Minister Ali Abdi Fareh. Djibouti is hosting
a Somali reconciliation conference.
</P>
<P>
A group of influential people exploited the war for more
influence and wealth at the expense of innocent children and women,
Tantawi said, adding that such chaotic situation would provide
foreign powers with the opportunity to tear up Somalia for their
expansionist interests.
</P>
<P>
"Sincere Somalis and their Arab and Muslim brothers should
cooperate in order to achieve the peace aims," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Somalia has been in division since 1991 when the former
president, Siad Barre, was toppled. Djiboutian President Ismael
Omar Guelleh proposed last year an initiative, calling on the
Somali warlords to disarm, turn their factions into political
parties, and to submit to the authority of a formal legal system.
</P>
<P>
Under this peace plan, a Somali reconciliation conference opened
in Djibouti on May 2. Some 460 representatives of the civil
society, including university professors, intellectuals, writers
and tribal leaders took part in the gathering. Representatives of
the United Nations, the Organization of African Unity, the European
Union, Egypt and the United States also attended the conference.
</P>
<P>
The Grand Iman described the Somali peace conference as "a
precious opportunity for Somalia and its people to pass out of the
debacle."
</P>
<P>
"We appreciate the efforts exerted by Djibouti for this noble
end. All Arab and Islamic countries must support Djibouti in order
to achieve this aim," Tantawi said.
</P>
<P>
Al-Azhar is Egypt's leading Muslim authority and the highest
seat of Sunni Islamic studies in the world.

</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- Turkey's leading oil producer Altinyag firm has
started trade with Greece, reported Anatolia News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Altinyag General Director Ramazan Abay said in Izmir, southwest
Turkey, on Monday that his company will export 3,000 tons of
sunflower oil to Greece and in return import 2,000 tons of soybean
oil from Greece every month.
</P>
<P>
The project was initiated by Izmir Trade Chamber, said Abay. The
first oil transfer from Turkey to Greece was made on Monday by a
ship which will make weekly trips to carry oil between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Greek firms used to purchase oil from France, however, they
began to turn to Turkey due to the geographical closeness of the
two countries as well as the reasonable prices of Altinyag.

<HEADLINE> Bulgaria Hopes to Enhance Cooperation With Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Bulgaria is keen on enhancing
cooperation with Iraq in industrial, trade, economic, scientific
and artistic fields, said visiting Bulgarian Deputy Prime Minister
and Minister of Economy Petar Zhotev here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Iraqi-Bulgarian Joint Committee meetings, which
started on Monday, Zhotev said Bulgaria hopes to establish long-
term cooperation with Iraq, as Bulgaria has also suffered economic
losses due to the U.N. embargo imposed on Iraq since 1990.
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria wishes to enhance trade ties with Iraq through the
joint committee meetings, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
Zhotev, heading an 80-member delegation, arrived in the Iraqi
capital Baghdad late Sunday to attend the 24th session of the
Iraqi-Bulgarian Joint Committee, the official Iraqi News Agency
(INA) reported.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Iraqi Minister of Industry and Minerals Adnan
Abdal-Majid al-Ani expressed the hope that Iraq and Bulgaria can
develop a mechanism for improving bilateral trade and economic
relations.
</P>
<P>
Terming Bulgaria as "a friendly country," the Iraqi minister
said the two countries enjoyed good relations before the imposition
of the U.N. embargo against Iraq for its invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have agreed to establish three new subcommittees
of trade, finance and science subordinate to the joint committee as
a means of promoting bilateral cooperation, said the INA.
</P>
<P>
The last round of the joint committee meetings were held in the
Bulgarian capital Sofia in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The visit of the Bulgarian deputy prime minister came amid
mounting international pressure for lifting the U.N. embargo on
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria, as a trading partner of Iraq, is eagerly vying for a
slice of Iraq's lucrative reconstruction market of about 200
billion U.S. dollars.

<P>
ANKARA, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Turkey is making its last ditch
effort Monday to search for four people still missing in a Black
Sea boat catastrophe Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The death toll has by Monday reached 34 in the rowboat accident
that took place in the sea off Besikduzu County, Trabzon Province.
</P>

festivity. When a strong northeasterly wind suddenly rose and the
sea became choppy, the boats appeared to keel, capsize and then
sink in high waves.
</P>
<P>
Sadettin Kalkan, a leading Besikduzu official, told reporters
that that 34 dead bodies have been recovered so far, adding that
Engin Coban, Ali Coban, Mehmet Alkurt and Gonul Yanik, are still

<HEADLINE> Romanian Exports Might Amount to 10 Billion Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, May 22 (Xinhua) -- The main objective of the
Romanian government in 2000 is economic growth to be achieved
mainly through the increase of exports, the amount of which might
reach 10 billion U.S. dollars this year, the official Rompres news
agency Monday quoted government counselor Adrian Vasilescu as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Adrian Vasilescu made the remark late last week at the seminar
on "The truth about Romanian exports."
</P>
<P>
To encourage this sector, the tax on export profit decreased to
five percent, which proved to have a good influence. This measure
led to an increase in exports volume by eight percent, in profits
from exports by 27 percent (2.399 billion U.S. dollars) and an
improvement in exports' structure this year compared with the same
period last year. The tax on export profit would remain five
percent in the next years, Vasilescu stressed.
</P>
<P>
By the end of the year, exports will reach 10 billion dollars.
In the structure of exports, first ranked is the fabrics and ready-
mades industry (610 million U.S. dollars representing 25.5 percent
of the exports' total value. Next ranked are the metallurgical
industry (395 million U.S. dollars representing 16.4 percent) as
well as the wood processing and furniture industry (248 million U.
S. dollars representing 10.4 percent).
</P>
<P>
Exports to developed countries went up by 22.5 percent while
sales to countries in transition increased by 58.7 percent. As
much as 64.8 percent of Romania's trade partners are from the
European Union and 13.5 percent are from central and eastern
Europe, official statistics showed.

<HEADLINE> Romania to Plant 2 Million Hectares with Forest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Romania's Environment Ministry
unveiled recently a national program for planting nearly 2 million
hectares of land with forest over 50 years at a recent meeting of
the United Nations Convention on the desertification of land
affected by drought and deterioration.
</P>
<P>
"It is an ambitious program which calls for planting an annual
10,000 to 40,000 hectares with forest on deteriorated land, so as
to expand Romania's forested land by 2 million hectares," Gheorghe
Laza, secretary general of the Ministry of Waters, Forests and
Environment Protection, told the press Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Environment Ministry officials are currently implementing a
government resolution aimed to set up a specialized national
committee that will include experts and members of such national
institutions as the National Meteorological Institute and the
Forestry Research Institute. The committee plans to pursue a
national strategy and action plan for deteriorated land, due to be
finalized by this September.
</P>
<P>
The Environment Ministry officials want the document to be
presented by the Romanian delegation to the 4th meeting of the

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 22 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan Monday expressed the hope that developments in Lebanon would
not unduly affect the plans for peacekeepers that would be
outlined in his report.
</P>
<P>
Annan was responding to a question on the splitting in two by
Hizbollah guerrillas of the Israeli occupation zone in southern
Lebanon as Israel's allies in the South Lebanon Army abandoned
villages and military posts.
</P>
<P>
"The Israeli Government plans to withdraw its forces sometime
this summer. You know, I have been in touch with the leaders of
the region, and my Special Envoy Terje Roed Larsen has been
talking to the leaders on the ground," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
"And today, I shall issue a report for southern Lebanon,
detailing how we intend to implement resolutions 425 and 426," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"I have heard the reports of what's happening on the ground;
but obviously, I am waiting for the detailed report from my men to
be able to analyze it. But I do hope that what is happening will
not unduly affect the plans that I shall be putting forward today,
" the U.N. chief added.
</P>
<P>
Israel has informed the United Nations that it will withdraw
all its troops from southern Lebanon by July.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations is planning to increase the personnel of
the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon after the withdrawal
of Israeli troops.

ATHENS, May 22 (Xinhua) -- The number of Internet users in
Greece has increased by 40 percent to some 500,000 this year,
compared to 320,000 at the end of 1999.
</P>
<P>
The increase in the number of Internet users in Greece exceeds
the European average, which is estimated at 70 percent this year,

<HEADLINE> Mobile Licenses Boost For Euro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Mobile phone operators are facing an
85 billion pound bill to buy next-generation licenses which could
give an unexpected boost to the flagging euro.
</P>
<P>
The figure, calculated by economists in J.P. Morgan is several
times larger than previously estimated because European
governments are opting to auction their licenses rather than
assign them after contests.
</P>
<P>
The British newspaper, The Times, said Monday that Germany,
France, Italy, The Netherlands and Belgium are all keen to
replicate the success of Britain's license auction, which raised
22.5 billion pounds.
</P>
<P>
The countries are all expected to hold auctions over the next
12 months. Spain and Finland have already completed their
preparation for the contests.
</P>
<P>
According to J.P. Morgan, the vast transfer of funds from the
private sector to the public sector could help to move the budget
position of euroland from a deficit of 0.4 percent of GDP to a
surplus next year of 0.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
Gordon Brown, the British chancellor, has indicated that he
will use the proceeds of Britain's license auction to reduce the
national debt.

HARARE, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Lesotho Prime Minister Pakalitha
Mosisili Monday pledged his support for Zimbabwe' s efforts to
distribute the country's land on an equitable basis.
</P>
<P>
He made the statement after holding talks with visiting
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe, according to reports reaching
here.
</P>
<P>
"We are full of hope and confidence that the situation is under
control and that the land issue is being handled responsibly," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"It is incumbent to demonstrate in an unquestionable manner our
 solidarity with you because the land issue underpins the
liberation struggle," he told Mugabe, who was on an one-day visit
to the southern African kingdom.
</P>
<P>
On Lesotho's land issue, the prime minister said his country
had a land tenure system, which made the situation different from
those in Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
He said Lesotho had a land review commission, which was
collecting from the grassroots views on land allocation and use in
the country.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe, in response, extended his appreciation for the support
Zimbabwe' s neighbors including Lesotho had given him.
</P>
<P>
"We are very grateful for the support that our neighbors
especially our co-Southern African Development Community members
are giving us on this issue," Mugabe said.

same.

JOHANNESBURG, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Former South African President
Nelson Mandela Monday met here separately with leaders of two
Burundian rebel groups to discuss the peace process in their
war-torn country.
</P>
<P>
"It is basically to get their support for the ongoing peace
process and to explain that they will have the opportunity to make
recommendations on the draft program (for the peace process)," a
spokeswoman of Mandela's office said.
</P>
<P>
Participants in the talks were representatives of the Party for
the Liberation of the Hutu People (PALIPEHUTU) and Front for
National Liberation (FROLINA), said the spokeswoman Zelda Le
Grange.
</P>
<P>
So far the meetings have been "very positive, very fruitful",
said the spokeswoman, adding the rebel representatives were "all
committed to driving the peace process as quickly as possible".
</P>
<P>
Mandela, chief mediator in Burundi's peace process, will on
Tuesday hold separate talks with representatives of another three
rebel groups and of Burundian government.
</P>
<P>
War broke out in 1993 in Burundi, pitting several rebel Hutu

<HEADLINE> About 100 SLA Militiamen Surrender to Lebanese Army </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Nearly 100 South Lebanon Army (SLA)
militiamen Monday noon surrendered to Lebanese army in a checkpoint
at Bayet Yahoon in south Lebanon, ANN television station reported.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Hezbollah guerrillas, who have been leading a war to
oust Israeli occupation forces and the the pro-Israeli SLA from
south Lebanon, also captured ten SLA militiamen who refused to
surrender or withdraw at the position of Houla, local radio
reported.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, nearly a thousand Lebanese returned to the five
villages evacuated by the SLA in south Lebanon. Hundreds of them
swarmed into the village of Toyeebat with dozens of armed Hezbollah
members.
</P>
<P>
Israel invaded and occupied south Lebanon in 1978 and set up a
security zone there in 1985 with a self-claimed aim of protecting
its northern settlements from cross-border guerrilla attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since Israel began its withdrawal from south Lebanon earlier
this month, dozens of SLA militiamen have deserted, many of them
surrendering to the resistance guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
As Israel promised to pull out all its forces from south Lebanon
by July, the fate of the SLA militiamen has drawn more and more
world attention. Both the Lebanese government troops and Hezbollah
have announced that they will not forgive the militiamen who
betrayed their country and will bring them to trial.

<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, May 22 (Xinhua) -- One Iraqi civilian was injured
Monday during air raids by U.S. and British warplanes on southern
Iraq, an Iraqi military spokesman announced.
</P>
<P>
In a statement carried by the official Iraqi News Agency (INA),
the spokesman said that at 8:55 local time (0455 GMT), five
formations of U.S. and British planes coming from Saudi Arabia and
Kuwait made 10 armed sorties over southern Iraq, bombing civilian
and service installations.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman added that at 11:30 (0730 GMT), nine hostile
formations from Turkey made 15 armed sorties over northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
On both occasions, Iraqi anti-aircraft artillery intercepted
these planes, forcing them to flee back to their bases in Turkey,
Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
According to the spokesman, the total number of sorties made by
the U.S. and British jets have reached 21,289 since December 1998
when the U.S. and Britain launched the four-night fierce air
attacks against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and British planes have been patrolling the two so-
called no-fly zones, set up by the two powers after the 1991 Gulf
War to, as they said, provide aerial protection from the Iraqi
government forces for Kurds in the north and Shiite Muslims in the
south.

<HEADLINE> Israel Would Launch Reprisals if Northern Israel Attacked: Barak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
warned again on Monday that if Israel is attacked after its troop
withdrawal from south Lebanon, the Israeli military will launch
reprisals not to be limited to the border area.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the northern border town of Zarit, Barak said the
reprisal will be in entirely different places, which will prove
very painful.
</P>
<P>
"I don't recommend to anyone in the area to provoke a response
from Israel," Barak added.
</P>
<P>
Barak repeated the warning as the situation in south Lebanon and
as in northern Israel has become even more tense, as the Israeli-
backed South Lebanon Army (SLA) abandoned on Monday all the
outposts in central security zone and two outposts in the western
sector.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of local Lebanese Shi'ite Muslims, some of them
Hezbollah activists, reportedly poured into the abandoned outposts
and nearby villages, throwing the security zone Israel has occupied
for years into chaos.
</P>
<P>
Israeli helicopters opened fire and killed at least two local
Lebanese civilians, apparently trying to scare them from entering
the abandoned places.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, SLA soldiers and their families crowed around some of
the crossings on the Lebanese-Israeli border on Monday and the
Israel Defense Force (IDF) is coordinating their entrance into
Israel.
</P>
<P>
To study the tense situation in south Lebanon and along the
northern border, Barak visited the north on Monday together with
top IDF officers.
</P>
<P>
For fear of possible Hezbollah guerrillas attacks, the IDF
ordered residents of northern Israel into bomb shelters on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Israeli Defense Minister Ephraim Sneh also went to the
north on Monday and warned that any Hezbollah attacks after a
withdrawal will prompt Israel to send forces back into Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
"If anyone wants to avert the need for us to go in again, the
way to do that is to keep Hezbollah away from the border," Sneh
told SLA militiamen who fled to northern Israel earlier on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Sneh said Israel is prepared to offer political asylum to SLA
members and their families and have already put aside apartments to
house them.
</P>
<P>
Israel is coordinating its withdrawal with the United Nations,
which plans to expand its peacekeeping forces in south Lebanon.

Barak promised to bring the IDF home from south Lebanon by July

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Continue Supporting Federation in Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, May 22 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. will continue to support a
bizonal, bicommunal federation formula in Cyprus, said U.S.
Ambassador to Cyprus Donald Bandler here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus issue will be resolved by the Greek and Turkish
Cypriot leaders "with some help from their friends," said Bandler
after meeting with Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides.
</P>
<P>
However, "we do not have a plan to solve the Cyprus problem that
is going to be imposed on anyone," Bandler was quoted as saying by
the Cyprus News Agency.
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope that the next round of U.N.-sponsored
proximity talks on Cyprus will be upgraded and will lend itself to
a meaningful negotiation.
</P>
<P>
Bandler made the pledge apparently to address concerns by some
local political leaders about U.S. President Bill Clinton's remarks
to some Greek American leaders last week on two entities in Cyprus
and the right of free movement on the island.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek and Turkish Cypriot
communities since 1974 when Turkey invaded and occupied the
northern part of the island after a pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
In efforts to solve the Cyprus issue, two rounds of U.N.-
sponsored talks have been held so far, during which the two sides
presented and elaborated on their positions.
</P>
<P>
The third round of talks have been scheduled to start on July 5
in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
Bandler also said that he had "good meeting" with President
Clerides, who looked in excellent form, three weeks after
undergoing an operation to remove a polyp from his large intestine.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Northern Residents Ordered into Bomb Shelters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 22 (Xinhua) -- The Israel Defense Forces (IDF)
ordered about 200,000 residents in Israel's northern communities
along the border with Lebanon to lock themselves into bomb shelters
late Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The order was prompted by IDF's pessimistic evaluation on the
tense situation in the zone and intelligence information that
Lebanese Hezbollah guerrillas may launch reprisal attacks against
these settlements, army sources revealed.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Monday, Israel Air Force fighter planes and attack
helicopters reportedly killed two Lebanese civilians and wounded at
least seven others in an aerial assault in the occupied security
zone, a buffer area set up by Israel in 1985 with a self-claimed
aim to prevent cross-border guerrilla attacks.
</P>
<P>
The two were among hundreds of Lebanese, most of them Hezbollah
supporters, who were marching into the zone to reclaim their homes
in several villages, which they left behind after Israel's
occupation two decades ago.
</P>
<P>
The villagers decided to return on news that the Israeli-backed
South Lebanon Army (SLA) militiamen had abandoned their positions
in these villages and fled with their families to Israeli border to
seek asylum.
</P>
<P>
The IDF, in carrying out the Israeli cabinet's resolution in
March to pull out of south Lebanon by July, had transferred some
outposts to SLA, hoping the militia would control these abandoned
areas and act as buffer forces for some time.
</P>
<P>
However, the proxy group, which depends upon Israel's ammunition
supply and air force backup, collapsed faster and more disorderly
than IDF had thought, according to some military analysts.
</P>
<P>
It appeared now that the Hezbollah, a Shiite Muslim guerrilla
group which has been fighting against Israeli occupation in south
Lebanon for decades, will fill the vacuum left by Israeli and SLA
soldiers.
</P>
<P>
The approaching of the Hezbollah made Israeli northern residents
really worried about their future security as their communities had
been hit by Hezbollah's Katyusha rockets time and time again during
the years.
</P>
<P>
The latest of such attacks took place in early May, when several
waves of Katyusha rockets landed in these communities, wounding
civilians, damaging properties and triggering fire.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, speaking at the border town
of Zarit on Monday, warned again that if Israeli north is attacked
after its troops pullback from south Lebanon, the IDF will launch a
reprisal not to be limited to the border area.
</P>
<P>
It is still not clear whether the rapidly deteriorating
situation will force the IDF to move up its redeployment plan to
early June, as some media reports had speculated.

<HEADLINE> Iranian President Calls for Respect for Freedom, Civil Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad Khatami
stressed here on Monday that the people's legitimate freedom and
civil rights must be respected as they are the basis of national
security.
</P>
<P>
Everyone living in the country should observe the Constitution,
which specifies that everybody enjoys legitimate freedom and civil
rights, Khatami said in an address marking the third anniversary of
his landslide victory in the presidential election on May 23, 1997.
</P>
<P>
In the election, reform-minded Khatami defeated his conservative
rival, current Majlis (parliament) Speaker Ali Netaq-Nouri.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Khatami has been promoting his social and political
reform programs, including easing Islamic restrictions on personal
freedom and encouraging public participation in politics, which are
welcomed by the people.
</P>
<P>
In his address, quoted by the Islamic Republic News Agency,
Khatami hailed the people's active participation in the political
scene as one of the greatest achievements of his government since
taking office three years ago.
</P>
<P>
He praised in particular the people's massive turnout in the
sixth parliamentary election in February, which gave his reformist
allies a good opportunity to seize control of the legislative body
long dominated by the conservatives.
</P>
<P>
However, the president, in an implicit way, criticized the
powerful conservatives for their relentless crackdown on the
reformist campaign following the February election, which included
annulment of partial election results, imprisonment of reformist
journalists and the ban of outspoken newspapers.
</P>
<P>
The line between those loyal to the Islamic republic and those
who do not believe in the Islamic republic should be clearly made,
but it does not mean that the opposition to the Islamic republic
should be suppressed, Khatami said.
</P>
<P>
"We should not adopt wrong methods in the name of defense of
Islam, the Islamic revolution, leadership and security," he added.
</P>
<P>
Under a direct order of Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali
Khamenei, the conservative Guardians Council (GC) finally approved
the election result in Tehran, the political center of the country,
after a three-month-long delay. The move removed the last obstacle
for the new parliament to formally inaugurate on May 27.
</P>
<P>
According to the confirmation by the GC, reformers bagged 26 of
Tehran's 30 seats in the 290-seat parliament. Only two seats went
to conservatives. The other two have to be decided in a re-
competition among four candidates.
</P>
<P>
In other constituencies of the country, reformers also seized
most of the seats, ensuring their dominance in the new parliament.
</P>
<P>
However, the conservatives still control most of the country's
powerful organs, including the military, judiciary and the
broadcasting network. The political struggle in the country is
destined to intensify further in the future, especially next year
when the presidential election will be held.

<HEADLINE> Swiss Press Welcomes Adoption of Bilateral Accords with EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, May 22 (Xinhua) -- The Swiss press has welcomed the
adoption of Switzerland's seven bilateral accords with the
European Union (EU) in Sunday's referendum.
</P>
<P>
Most newspapers Monday hailed the vote as the end of Swiss
isolationism and the start of a normalization of relations with
the EU, according to a Swiss Radio International report.
</P>
<P>
The German-language Neue Zurcher Zeitung said that it is a
clear victory for the government's Europe policy, but warned that
it must not be interpreted as any more than a "yes" to the seven
bilateral accords.
</P>
<P>
"It is not a signal for rapid membership of the EU; nor does it
mean the end of the process of integration with the EU," it added.
</P>
<P>
The Zurich-based Tages Anzeiger said that the scale of the vote
for the accords (67 percent) was a welcome surprise, and that the
result was due to a marriage of political vision and economic
sense, as well as the fact that Switzerland is doing rather well
economically.
</P>
<P>
However, the Tages Anzeiger warned that it would be dangerous
for the government to channel this newly-won political capital
into a head-on campaign for entry into the EU. It said this would
play into the hands of right-wing populists. Instead, the paper
argued, next on the list should be a rethink on Switzerland's
relations with the United Nations and NATO.
</P>
<P>
The main French-language daily, Le Temps, declared that the
language divide was non-existent in the vote, and that the results
surpassed even the most optimistic prognosis. It concluded the age
of pessimism that colored Swiss politics in 1992 has been replaced
by a new-found confidence and ambition.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Le Temps said, the issue of EU membership has not
gone away and calls for a major debate. But at least a taboo has
been abolished, it added, so that a debate is now possible.
</P>
<P>
In the Italian-spoken Ticino, where the vote against the
treaties was largest, newspapers called on the federal government
not to ignore its voice even if the result in the rest of
Switzerland was overwhelming.
</P>
<P>
They said the region's distrust is a direct result of the
federal government's persistent shortsightedness and refusal to
consider the canton's real fears about pressure on the regional
job market and an avalanche of trucks passing through.

<HEADLINE> Canada Faces Shortage of 500 Radiologists: Medical Warning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, May 22 (Xinhua) -- With the aging problem increasing,
Canada is facing a shortage of 500 radiologists by 2004, says the
country's medical profession.
</P>
<P>
In its latest warning made available here Monday, both the
Canadian Medical Association and the Canadian Association of
Radiologists say there are far too few radiologists to read the
imaging results from sophisticated machines such as CT scanners
and MRIs.
</P>
<P>
The country is already suffering a shortfall of 150 full-time
radiologists, about eight percent of the medical specialty's total
workforce.
</P>
<P>
Doctors are exhausted, frustrated and stressed, they say,
urging immediate measures ranging from increasing medical school
enrollment to establishing a medical technology fund.
</P>
<P>
They attributed the "looming crisis" to the early '90s decision
by federal and provincial governments to severely limit the number
of practicing physicians.
</P>
<P>
In 1992, the health ministers endorsed a plan to reduce
Canadian medical school entry class sizes by 10 percent by the
fall of 1993.
</P>
<P>
The impact of the cuts is now just beginning to be felt as it
takes several years to educate a physician, according to Canadian
doctors.

<P>
He will explain his proposal to the Security Council after a
thorough assessment of the political and military situation in
Sierra Leone, Annan said in his latest report on the U.N. Mission
in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL), which was released Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council was considering to increase the UNAMSIL's
strength to 13,000 in anticipation of arrival of reinforcements
that would push the force strength beyond the planned 11,100.
</P>
<P>
The UNAMSIL is mandated to monitor the implementation of a
peace accord signed last July by the Sierra Leonean Government and
Foday Sankoh, leader of the rebel Revolutionary United Front (RUF),
with an aim at ending the nation's 9-year civil war.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. will not abandon Sierra Leone whose "plight has become
a crucial test of the solidarity of the international community,"
the U.N. chief noted.

<HEADLINE> Annan Dismisses Role for Rebel Leader in Sierra Leone Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 22 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan Monday dismissed the role for Sierra Leone rebel leader,
Foday Sankoh, in any peace process in the country.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the press, Annan said, "I think the longer-term
fate of Foday Sankoh is being discussed seriously now."
</P>
<P>
"I believe by his behavior, he has excluded himself from the
process," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
"And I don't see how one can consider him part of any peace
process in Sierra Leone," the Secretary-General said.
</P>
<P>
Annan said the United Nations is determined to bring all
detainees to safety.
</P>
<P>
"We had 54 released yesterday -- 54 additional peacekeepers.
We expect more to be released in the course of this week," he
added.
</P>
<P>
 About 8,700 U.N. peacekeepers arrived in Sierra Leone in
April to monitor a peace accord signed by the Government of Sierra
Leone and the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) rebels in July last
year.
</P>
<P>
A total of 500 U.N. peacekeepers were taken hostage in early
May by the RUF led by Foday, who was arrested Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The group released Sunday was composed of 10 Kenyans, 42
Zambians, one Malaysian and one Norwegian. The rebels are still
holding 280 U.N. soldiers.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. contingent now numbers 10,400, the largest U.N.
peacekeeping deployment in the world, and has been authorized to
grow to 13,000.

<P>
Addressing the U.N. Millennium Forum, Annan said the NGOs (non-

their right choices on behalf of the world's poor."
</P>
<P>
The civil society can work at the international level to lift
billions out of poverty by helping them participate in the global
economy, he believed.
</P>
<P>
The NGOs can also help in urging developed nations to open
their markets to poor countries' products and alleviate the latter
's debt burden, he added.
</P>
<P>
Scheduled for May 22-26 as part of the preparations for the U.N.
Millennium Assembly in September, the forum is themed "the United
Nations for the 21st century."
</P>
<P>
The forum's topics include peace, security and disarmament;
eradication of poverty, including debt cancellation and social
development; human rights; sustainable development and the
environment; and the challenges of globalization and strengthening
the Untied Nations and international organizations.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Meets with South African President Wbeki </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 22 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Monday welcomed South African President Thabo Wbeki's visit at the
White House, praising South Africa's critical role in the new
century.
</P>
<P>
"The vision now needed to define South Africa's critical role
in the new century. You are leading your nation and an entire
continent forward, supporting peacemaking and peacekeeping,
fighting against poverty and illiteracy and for economic
opportunity," Clinton said at a formal ceremony in the White House
East Room.
</P>
<P>
Clinton made the remarks in the term very general while Wbeki
pointed out that the United States must help Africa address many
challenges facing both "our two countries, as well as many other
parts of the world."
</P>
<P>
"These challenges ... include the human threat posed by
deepening underdevelopment, widespread poverty; diseases such as
AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis; as well as violent conflicts and
wars afflicting especially the continent from which we come,
Africa," Wbeki said.
</P>
<P>
He said he would spend the next four days to meet U.S.
politicians, businessmen and academics and media people to discuss
how to bring peace, social and economic justice for the billions
of poor people.
</P>
<P>
Wbeki appealed to Clinton to act together to meet "challenges
in the ever-widening income and development gap between the rich
and the poor."

<HEADLINE> U.S. Starts Investigation on Plane Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Engines failing simultaneously is "highly improbable" and could
indicate some sort of systems failure, NTSB member George Black
said.
</P>
<P>
Nine people were killed as the charted plane crashed in
overcast conditions Sunday as it approached the Wilkes-Barre/
Scranton International Airport in Pennsylvania State.
</P>
<P>
"We'll be looking at fuel systems; we'll be looking at ignition
systems, the weather -- all of the variables that are associated
with the operation of the engines," Black told CBS' "The Early
Show" Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
Among the possibilities, he said, was that the fuel was somehow
contaminated. Investigators were trying to figure out where the
plane had last refueled, he added.
</P>
<P>
NTSB investigators were reviewing the transcript from air
traffic controllers who spoke with the crew before the accident.
The two pilots can be heard on a portion of the tape saying, "We
lost both engines."
</P>
<P>
Burned and twisted wreckage from the plane -- carrying 17
passengers and two crew members -- was scattered across a swath of
forest about nine miles south of the airport. The plane's cockpit
voice recorder was recovered, the NTSB said.
</P>
<P>
Sunday's crash appeared to be the worst in Pennsylvania since
1994, when a USAir 737 crashed near Pittsburgh, killing all 132
people aboard.

<HEADLINE> Annan Calls For Immediate Ceasefire Between Ethiopia, Eritrea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 22 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan Monday called, in the strongest possible terms, for an
immediate ceasefire between Ethiopia and Eritrea in accordance
with U.N. Security Council resolutions 1297 and 1298 so as to give
peace a chance.
</P>
<P>
According to reports reaching here, the large scale of
hostilities between Ethiopia and Eritrea has resumed.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by his spokesman's office said the Secretary-
General had been following closely and with increasing concern the
latest developments of the situation.
</P>
<P>
"He has, from the outset two years ago, sought to promote a
peaceful settlement of the border dispute between the two
countries," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The Secretary-General is immensely saddened at the resumption
of what is an increasing incomprehensible war. There can be no
justification for such large-scale death and suffering, especially
at a time when both countries are wracked by drought and hunger,"
the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The Secretary-General wishes to take this opportunity to
express his full support for the current mission of Mr. Ahmed
Ouyahia, the Special Envoy of OAU (the Organization of the African
Unity) Chairman and Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika and
for the efforts of other peace envoys. He urged the governments of
Ethiopia and Eritrea to seize this opportunity," the statement
added.
</P>
<P>
The bitter border conflict between the two countries erupted in
May 1998.
</P>
<P>
The two sides broke off indirect talks in Algiers on May 4
after Ethiopia accused Eritrea of setting preconditions. Ethiopia
said Eritrea has demanded the two sides sign the three-part, OAU
drafted accord and approve a cease-fire as a prerequisite for any
substantive discussions.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Security Council has imposed arms embargo on
both sides.

<HEADLINE> Marc Dutroux Appears in Court Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Marc Dutroux, the alleged child
abuser and killer in Belgium, appeared Monday a second time in
court for breaking loose and running away from police for more
than three hours in early 1998.
</P>
<P>
The Neufchateau correctional tribunal held a hearing of the
Dutroux runaway case. The Belgian court is yet to start trial of
Dutroux for allegedly abusing little girls and voluntarily killing
four of the six girls forcefully kept on his premises.
</P>
<P>
Dutroux, the most notorious prisoner in the country, broke away
from two escorting policemen prior to a court hearing at
Neufchateau on March 23, 1998. He ran away with one of the
handguns of the policemen and snatched a motor vehicle from a
passer-by just outside the courtroom.
</P>
<P>
The man remained at large for more than three and a half hours
before being caught again by a forest policeman some 15 kilometers
away from the court at Neufchateau. Thousands of policemen from
Belgium, Luxembourg, France and Germany were mobilized to join the
manhunt.
</P>
<P>
A verdict is expected to be emitted by the court on June 19.
</P>
<P>
The runaway incident shocked the nation and caused two Belgian
cabinet members to resign.
</P>
<P>
Dutroux has been detained for four years by now, waiting for
court trial for what he was accused of. Trials will not be held
before 2001.
</P>
<P>
He was arrested in August 1996 on charges of raping, torturing
and assassinating four little girls, of whom two died from
starvation on his premises after he was arrested by the police.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Bans Weekly for Censorship Violation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan authorities Monday
banned the printing and publication of an English-language weekly
for violating the government's censorship laws, the state radio
said.
</P>
<P>
The weekly, The Sunday Leader, was the second paper to be
closed down in less than a week amid fighting between government
troops and separatist Tamil Tiger rebels in the northern Jaffna
peninsula.
</P>
<P>
The radio quoted the government censor as saying the newspaper
reported on the war in a way that "would have benefited the enemy.
"
</P>
<P>
The radio said The Sunday Leader and other publications of the
Leader Publications (Pvt. Ltd. had been shut down for six months
after several warnings to obey the censorship laws.
</P>
<P>
The tough new censorship laws came into force for both the
local and foreign media earlier this month as fighting escalated
between government troops and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam
rebels who are engaged in ferocious assaults in a bid to retake
their former stronghold of Jaffna.
</P>
<P>
Last Friday the government temporarily closed down the Tamil-
language Uthayan newspaper in Jaffna for violating the censorship
laws.
</P>
<P>
Local and international media groups have urged the government
to ease restrictions imposed on both local and foreign
correspondents based in the country.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lankan Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Lakshman Kiriella
promised Sunday that press censorship in the island nation would
be lifted soon.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh, India Postpone Flag Meeting on Enclave Conflict </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 22 (Xinhua) -- India's Border Security Force (BSF)
Sunday night postponed a proposed flag meeting with Bangladesh
Rifles(BDR) to settle a conflict in a Bangladeshi enclave within
India, the official Bangladesh News Agency announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
BDR has so far sent 10 official letters, including protest
letters, inviting BSF to sit for a dialogue in a flag meeting to
solve the problem at the earliest.
</P>
<P>
Several hundred Indians, allegedly supported by BSF personnel,
Thursday intruded the Bangladeshi enclave of Mashaldanga under the
district of Kurigram, about 400 kilometers northwest of Dhaka, and
abducted Bangladesh nationals, set ablaze around 55 houses and
looted valuables and cattle. The Bangladesh nationals were,
however, released later.
</P>
<P>
More than 10 women and children reportedly received injuries
during the attack that lasted at least one hour.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the enclave is reported to be in acute shortage of
food, medicine and other humanitarian supplies for its more than 2,
000 inhabitants, who are now virtually confined in the Indian
territory since last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
A district official was quoted as saying it is difficult to
provide relief materials even to the people of the enclave as it
is 1.5 kilometers from the mainland. The confined people are
surrounded,guarded and restricted by Indian BSF and police from
coming to the mainland of Bangladesh, the official said.

<HEADLINE> 70 LTTE Rebels Killed in Sri Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, May 22 (Xinhua) -- More than 70 Tamil rebels were
killed in a face-to-face battle with government troops who used
aircraft and artillery to repulse fresh assaults by the Liberation
Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in Sri Lanka's Jaffna peninsula, the
Press Trust of India (PTI) reported from Colombo, the Sri Lankan
capital, Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Sri Lankan Army claimed to have successfully repulsed two
more attempts by "well-armed guerrillas" to break through the
defenses on the outskirts of Chavakachechri, a small but strategic
town which the rebels claim they captured from the army Saturday
evening, the PTI reported.
</P>
<P>
The rebels were killed in fierce fighting with the troops at
Sirasali, about five kilometers east of Chavakachechri, the PTI
quoted a Sri Lankan government spokesman as saying.
</P>
<P>
This was the first time that the LTTE suffered such a major
loss since it launched its new offensive to recapture Jaffna on
May 10, the PTI said.
</P>
<P>
The PTI also reported from Colombo that the Sri Lankan
government Monday said it had decided to explore "diplomatic means
" to invite India to join the mediation process toward a
negotiated solution of the current crisis.
</P>
<P>
Also according to the PTI, India's Cabinet Committee on
Security Monday held a meeting to discuss the situation in Sri
Lanka. Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee chaired the
meeting, which was attended by senior officials including Defense
Minister George Fernandes and the chiefs of the three service of
the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Indian National Security Advisor Brajesh Mishra and
the three service chiefs of the armed forces reviewed the latest
developments in the situation in the Jaffna peninsula.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian Journalists Condemn Government's Decision to Suspend Opposition Paper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 22 (Xinhua) -- The Egyptian Journalists Union on
Monday condemned the government's decision to suspend the
publication of the mouthpiece of an opposition party, saying the
move was against the country's constitution and press law.
</P>
<P>
The Committee for Parties' Affairs, which is made up of
officials and those close to the government, suspended on Saturday
the opposition Labor Party and its mouthpiece, Al-Shaab newspaper,
until the party resolves an internal power struggle.
</P>
<P>
Al-Shaab has been accused by government press of inciting
violent demonstrations by Al-Azhar University students against the
allegedly blasphemous novel, "Feast of the Seaweeds," written by
Syrian writer Haidar Haidar.
</P>
<P>
"The board of the Egyptian Journalists Union denounces the
decision to suspend the party and the paper, and believes it is a
blow to public freedom," the union said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"Al-Shaab's suspension is contrary to articles 48 and 208 of the
Egyptian constitution and article five of the law on the press,
which forbids the suspension or closure of newspapers by
administrative decisions," it said.
</P>
<P>
The union leadership "urges all political and union bodies and
non-governmental organizations to use legal means to block the
decision which undermines liberty of expression," the statement
said.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Share Prices Plunge to Year's Low in Singapore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Share prices plunged to this year
's low on Singapore Stock Market Monday as U.S. NASDAQ's 4-percent
drop on Friday and U.S. Federal Reserve's tough stance on
inflation dampened market sentiment.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark Straits Times Index (STI) dropped 62.54 points to
end at 1,929.88 in light trading.
</P>
<P>
The market volume totaled 234 million shares worth 524.96
million Singapore dollars (303.92 million U.S. dollars). Declining
issues overwhelmed advancers by 284 to 54 with 203 counters
unchanged.

was transacted at 2.23 Singapore dollars per share. It was
followed by NatElec which had 11.21 million units done. Chew

</P>
<P>

finish at 27.6 Singapore dollars. SPH tumbled by 150 cents to end
at 27.6 Singapore dollars.

inflation.
</P>
<P>
They also noted that electronic stocks suffered the heaviest
losses and banking stocks also fared poorly.

<HEADLINE> Anti-Taliban Forces Counterattack in Northern Afghanistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Afghanistan's northern alliance
forces Monday launched a major counter-offensive against the
ruling Taliban militia, the Afghan Islamic Press(AIP) reported.
</P>
<P>
The counter-offensive was aimed at recapturing the territory
they lost to the Islamic militia in the Hindukush range of
Afghanistan over the weekend, said the Pakistan-based agency.
</P>
<P>
According to initial reports, six soldiers were killed and
eight wounded from both sides.
</P>
<P>
Heavy artillery and tanks were being used by both sides in the
fierce fighting in the Salang area of Baghlan Province,said AIP.
</P>
<P>
The two factions have been fighting each other for the past
several years. After the winter's short peace, fighting erupted
again this year following the advent of summer in northern
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
AIP said the Taliban controlled the Salang-Baghlan highway
while the fighters loyal to opposition commander Ahmad Shah Masood
had occupied the heights of Hindukush overlooking the highway.
</P>
<P>
The Hindukush range separates northern Afghanistan while the
Salang tunnel is the sole major highway connection between the two
parts.
</P>
<P>
Masood's forces fortified themselves in the mountainous
Panjsher Valley while the Taliban control the rest of the country.
If the Taliban forces could seize the Salang area,they could
threaten Andarab, a strategic center of the Masood forces, AIP
said.

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi President Shahabuddin
Ahmed appointed M. A. Sayeed, a former civil servant, as the
country's new chief election commissioner (CEC) Monday, after the
post had been left vacant for two weeks.
</P>
<P>
Nominated by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina under Articles 118
and 48 of the Bangladesh Constitution, Sayeed became the eighth
CEC of the country after the resignation of Mohammad Abu Hena on
May 8 for health reasons.
</P>
<P>
Sayeed, as the second civil servant to hold this constitutional
post in independent Bangladesh, held several important government
positions before, such as secretary of agriculture, secretary of
home affairs and secretary of information.
</P>
<P>
Press secretary to the prime minister Jawadul Karim described
Sayeed as a "senior, honest and dedicated officer" while briefing
reporters on the appointment.
</P>
<P>
After the resignation of Hena on May 8, Prime Minister Hasina
wrote a letter to the leader of the opposition, Khaleda Zia,
inviting her for discussions on the appointment of a new CEC.
</P>
<P>
However, the opposition showed no interest in sitting with the
government to reach a consensus on the issue.
</P>
<P>
The ruling and the opposition parties had made accusations and
counter-accusations against each other in finding the right person
to fill up the important post.

NEW DELHI, May 22 (Xinhua) -- The Sensitive Index (Sensex)
plunged by a whopping 148.47 points and closed at an 11-month low
of 3,920.18 on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) Monday, as infotech,
communication and entertainment (ICE) shares came under a renewed
onslaught of indiscriminate selling.
</P>

The ICE counters bore the brunt of large-scale offerings and

which adversely affected market sentiment.
</P>
<P>
The BSE-30 share Sensitive Index opened sharply lower at 3,978.
54 and logged a high of 4,015.38 in early deals. However,
persistent selling pushed down the Sensex to close at the day's
low of 3,920.18 as against last Friday's close of 4,068.65, a
hefty loss of 3.65 percent.
</P>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 22 (Xinhua) -- South Africa accounts for
almost three- quarters of the Southern African Development
Community (SADC)'s economic output with only a quarter of its
population.
</P>
<P>
But it ranks third behind two Indian Ocean island states of
Seychelles and Mauritius as far as per capita income is concerned.
</P>
<P>
Statistics released by international economics consultancy WEFA
Southern Africa, Seychelles had an annual per capita income of
7,145 U.S. dollars in 1997, which more than doubled South
Africa's figure of 3,454 dollars.
</P>
<P>
Mauritius had a per capita income of 3,827 dollars, 11 percent
higher than that of South Africa.
</P>
<P>
At the other end of the economic spectrum, the Democratic
Republic of the Congo (DRC), while accounting for more than 28
percent of the total SADC population, contributes just over 3
percent to its total economic output. The DRC had a per capita
income of just 127 dollars, and Mozambique was marginally higher
at 140 dollars.
</P>
<P>
According to WEFA, the two poorest SADC countries showed
remarkably different economic fortunes during the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
"Mozambique reaped its peace dividend and enjoyed an average
annual economic growth rate of 6.2 percent between 1990 and 1997,
while the deepening of the DRC civil war resulted in its economy
declining at an average rate of minus 6.1 percent per annum over
the same period," the consultancy said.
</P>
<P>
The Mozambican economy grew faster than any other SADC member
state between 1990 and 1997.

<HEADLINE> S. African Economy Up 0.9% in First Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 22 (Xinhua) -- The South African economy grew
by 0.9 percent in the first quarter of this year, Statistics South
Africa announced in Pretoria on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The agency's director Mark Orkin said this was the lowest
quarterly increase in the seasonally adjusted real gross domestic
product (GDP) at market prices since the 0.6 percent recorded in
the last three months of 1998.
</P>
<P>
"The main countervailing factors -- off-setting growth or
relative stability in other industries -- was the sharp drop in
agriculture, forestry and fishing due to high rainfalls and
floods," he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The 0.9 percent rise in the first quarter of this year was,
nevertheless, the sixth quarterly increase in a row.
</P>
<P>
This was mainly because of increasing activity in three
industries -- hotels and restaurants (which grew by 0.5 percent),
real estate and business services (0.5 percent) and transport and
communication (0.4 percent).
</P>
<P>
An annual growth rate of 1.2 percent was recorded last year
following a fourth quarter jump of 3.6 percent in the GDP.
</P>
<P>
This compared to an annual growth rate of 0.6 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The GDP in the first three quarters of last year were 1.1
percent, 2.1 percent and 3.2 percent respectively.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Minister Says Not to Close Higher Education Institutions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 22 (Xinhua) -- South African Education
Minister Kader Asmal on Monday dismissed as unfounded fears that a
review of the higher education system was aimed at closure of
some institutions.
</P>
<P>
He said his intention was not to close institutions such as
historically disadvantaged universities and technikons
experiencing difficulties.
</P>
<P>
"On the contrary, the reconfiguration exercise is key to
preventing closure of those institutions that are in crisis,"
Asmal said in a statement issued in Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
Soon after taking office in July last year, Asmal said the
shape and size of higher education could not be left to chance and
should be reviewed.
</P>
<P>
The minister reiterated last Wednesday that the exercise was
likely to result in mergers between some institutions, and
decisions to change the missions of others.

<HEADLINE> France Urges Syria to Help Ease Situation in Southern Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 22 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac on
Monday urged Syria to help ease tension in southern Lebanon while
Israel is pulling out its troops from there and leaving behind a
vacuum of power.
</P>
<P>
In a telephone conversation with Syrian President Hafez Assad,
Chirac said he is worried about the present situation in southern
Lebanon and hopes all countries in the region will cooperate in
easing the tension.
</P>
<P>
Chirac also called for an immediate session of the Monitoring
Committee of the Truce in Southern Lebanon, which consists of
France, the United States, Israel and Syria.
</P>
<P>
The committee was set up in 1996 to supervise an agreement
between Israel and the Syria-backed Hezbollah guerrillas on
avoiding striking civilian targets in their tit-for-tat attacks
against each other.
</P>
<P>
The meeting of the committee was suspended in January after
Israel pulled out of the talks of the committee in protest against
the death of an Israeli soldier in a Hezbollah attack.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Monday, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak ordered
the Israeli army to be ready to end its 22-year occupation of
southern Lebanon as early as June 1 -- five weeks ahead of his own
July 7 deadline.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Security Council is due to decide whether
the 4,500-member U.N peacekeeping force in Lebanon, established
from nine countries in 1978, will be expanded to deploy in the
areas evacuated by Israel.
</P>
<P>
Israel established a buffer zone in southern Lebanon to block
attacks on northern Israeli towns. It hoped to withdraw as part
of a broad peace deal with Syria, the main power in Lebanon.

</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli troops have begun withdrawing from southern Lebanon,
a process that will end 22 years of continuous occupation. The

in the Middle East and the start of a perilous new one.
</P>
<P>
-- Rebel forces in Sierra Leone on Sunday freed 54 more of the
500 U.N. peacekeeping troops they had seized early this month,

The New York Times:
</P>
<P>

negotiators from Sweden Sunday after a firebomb critically wounded
a two-year-old Israeli girl in a car passing through the sleepy
Palestinian-ruled city of Jericho.
</P>
<P>

headline the most lucrative political fund-raising event ever,
collecting at least 25 million U.S. dollars from 12,000 donors
packed into the MCI Center in Washington.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>

large and midsize companies, the highest level since late 1998, a
quarterly Fed survey showed.

BEIJING, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Australian Minister for Trade Mark
Vaile said here today he believes that China's entry into the

global trading system, including Australia and the United States.
</P>
<P>
He told a news conference that momentum for China's accession
to the WTO is continuing, and all parties concerned should spur on
the momentum, not only for China's membership in the WTO, but also

<HEADLINE> Study of Jiang's Directives Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 22 (Xinhua) -- The Central Commission for
Discipline Inspection of the Chinese Communist Party (CPC) and the
Ministry of Supervision jointly issued a circular today, calling
for further study of recent directives made by Chinese President
Jiang Zemin.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, also general secretary of the CPC Central Committee,
said in a recent inspection tour of south China's Guangdong that
the key to running China well lies in the CPC, in its ideology,
style of work, organization, discipline, capabilities and
leadership.
</P>
<P>
The CPC will remain successful and enjoy the heartfelt support
of the people of China so long as the party always earnestly
represents the development requirements of China's advanced social
productive forces, the progressive course of China's advanced
culture, and the fundamental interests of the Chinese people,
Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
The circular noted that Jiang's directives represent a new view
of the CPC's nature, goal and historic mission, a development of
Marxist party-building theory and the new requirements for the
whole party in the new situation.
</P>
<P>
It asked all discipline inspection and supervisory departments
in the country to further study, grasp and carry out the
directives and make them criteria for judging the success or
failure of the discipline inspection and supervisory work.
</P>
<P>
The circular also called on the discipline inspection and
supervisory departments to take concrete measures to combat all
kinds of corruption.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Humanization Key to Digital Gap (2)  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Statistics also show that Asia has roughly three-fifths of the
world's population, but only one in five of the world's Internet
users is from there. South Asia is home to one-fifth of the world'
s population, but only 1 percent of its people use the Internet,
while the United States, with 5 percent of the world's population,
accounts for more than half of the world's Internet users.
</P>
<P>
This disparity is more troubling when one considers the fact
that four out of five people in the world have never used a
telephone, let alone sent an e-mail, Bradley said. And even if the
rest of the world were connected, they would need to learn English,
since four out of five sites on the web are in English, a language
that is understood by only one-tenth of the world's population, he
added.
</P>
<P>
As a result, Bradley noted, technology has to be simple to use,
certainly simpler than it is now, with hardware connecting
seamlessly, without conflicting with other devices, and software
loading easily and functioning properly.
</P>
<P>
Making it accessible means putting all the pieces of technology
together and making them easily available to customers, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, making it personal is more than loading a web page
with an individually tailored selection of news, sports, stock
quotes and weather, the Gateway vice-president explained. It must
also ensure that people know how to use the technology they have
purchased.
</P>
<P>
"Bridging the divide isn't just about selling more personal
computers and Internet service," Bradley said. "It's about such
fundamental issues as productivity and efficiency and global
competitiveness."
</P>
<P>
Digital revolution depends upon having trained workers to
extend its horizon and consumers eager to enjoy its benefits, he
added. Companies should take bridging the division as a particular
responsibility, including teaching computing skills to teachers,
students and the public.
</P>
<P>
"All of us have a vested stake in our digital future whether we
are computer makers or software developers, or simply customers,"
Bradley concluded.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Humanization Key to Bridging Digital Gap (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Humanization of the digital
revolution is, perhaps, the only way out for bridging the
increasingly-widened digital gap around the world today, analysts
here said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Internet Industry Analysts believe that the cost that will be
paid for the digital revolution is alienation of a different form
as millions and millions of people are in the process of getting
left at the station as technology's bullet train hurtles ahead.
</P>
<P>
Participants in the Third Annual Business Week Digital Economy
Forum, being held here from May 22 to 24, agreed that the
effective way to narrow the gap brought up by the digital
revolution is humanizing it.
</P>
<P>
"What humanizing the digital revolution really boils down is to
make it more simple, accessible and personal," said Todd Bradley,
executive vice-president of global operation of the U.S.-based
Gateway Inc. Humanization means connecting folks gingerly into a
world of unparalleled technological opportunity, he added.
</P>
<P>
Bradley stressed that businesses responsible for taking
technology forward need to be at the forefront of a movement to
bridge the digital divide opening up between the technology haves
and have-nots to avoid profound social alienation.
</P>
<P>
The analysts cautioned that as rapid development in the
technology field is profoundly changing the way people live, learn,
work and play in the 21st century, the digital division between
the rich and the poor and that between the west and east are
getting wider and wider.
</P>
<P>
In the United States, twice as many classrooms in affluent
districts are connected to the Internet as they are in poorer ones,
African-Americans and Hispanics are 40 percent less likely to have
Internet access than whites, urbanites are 50 percent more likely
to have Internet access than rural residents, and those earning
more than 75,000 dollars a year are 20 times more likely to have
Internet access that those who make less, according to Bradley.

<P>
MANILA, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Ten home-made bombs exploded
simultaneously in the southern Philippine island of Mindanao
Sunday night,a report reaching here said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The bombings took place in the coastal towns of Buug and
Malangas in South Zamboanga Province,Philippine News Agency (PNA)
said.
</P>
<P>
But according to the PNA, no one was injured in the blasts and
no suspect was arrested. The damage caused by the explosions is
under estimation.
</P>
<P>
The series of explosions occurred less than three hours after
terrorists set off a powerful bomb at SM Megamall here in Manila,
which killed one person and wounded 17 others.
</P>
<P>
The bomb exploded inside the SM (Shoemart) Megamall, the
biggest shopping mall in the Philippine capital, Sunday afternoon,
the second bombing incident in Manila in less than a week.
</P>

Last Wednesday, an explosion inside Glorietta mall injured 13
people.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Philippine President Joseph Estrada condemned the
bombing incidents and vowed to ferret out the terrorists behind
the explosions.
</P>
<P>
These bombings, the president said, were acts of cowardice
committed by terrorists whose agenda is to sow fear among the
people and destabilize the government.
</P>
<P>
He noted the government is not helpless in fighting terrorism."
Let me be clear. We are not helpless in this fight. We can and

<HEADLINE> Nepali Minister Leaves for Refugee Talks in Bhutan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Nepali Foreign Minister Chakra
Bastola left here for Thimpu, Bhutan, Monday for the 9th
ministerial-level talks on the Bhutanese refugee issue to be held
from May 22 to 25.
</P>
<P>
Bastola told reporters at the airport before his departure that
the Bhutanese government are becoming "more positive in solving
the refugee issue."
</P>
<P>
"The Bhutanese government should be committed politically to
solving the refugee crisis," said Bastola.
</P>
<P>
The 9th round of Nepal-Bhutan Joint Ministerial Level Committee
Meeting (JMLC) will focus on the modality for verifying the
refugees, according to the Nepalese Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
About 100,000 Bhutanese refugees are living in eastern Nepal
and they are divided into four categories: bona fide Bhutanese who
were forcibly evicted, Bhutanese who emigrated under compelling
circumstances,non-Bhutanese and Bhutanese with criminal records.
</P>
<P>
The completion of the verification will lead to the
repatriation of those who are genuine Bhutanese.
</P>
<P>
The previous JMLC meeting was concluded in Kathmandu in
September last year with Bhutan agreeing to go ahead with field
verification for the first time. However, the talks were
inconclusive as the two sides could not agree on the modality of
the verification process.
</P>
<P>
The eight rounds of ministerial talks between the two Himalayan
kingdoms have so far failed to reach any agreement on the
repatriation of the refugees who left Bhutan in early 1990s.

MANILA, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph Estrada
urged the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) Monday to show
sincerity in the peace process as the government and MILF are
prepared to resume peace efforts on May 30.

<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Share prices plunged to this year
's low on Singapore Stock Market Monday as U.S. NASDAQ's 4-percent
drop on Friday and U.S. Federal Reserve's tough stance on
inflation dampened market sentiment.

end at 1,929.88 in light trading.
</P>
<P>
The market volume totaled 234 million shares worth 524.96
million Singapore dollars (303.92 million U.S. dollars). Declining

<P>
They also noted that electronic stocks suffered the heaviest
losses and banking stocks also fared poorly.

<HEADLINE> Lesotho Government Tables Vehicle Theft Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 22 (Xinhua) -- The Lesotho government on
Monday introduced legislation aimed at curbing the rising
cross-border car theft, the South African Press Association
reported.
</P>
<P>
Introducing the second reading of the Motor Vehicle Theft Bill,
Home Affairs Minister Mopshatla Mabitle said the main purpose of
the legislation was to "address the escalating theft of motor
vehicles and motor vehicle parts between Lesotho and South
Africa."
</P>
<P>
He said stolen vehicles were piling up at police stations in
Lesotho. The suspects were often released on bail and most fled to
South Africa where it was difficult to trace them.
</P>
<P>
He said the bill provided for heavy penalties for tampering
with motor vehicles, using false identification plates, breaking
into motor vehicles and dealing in stolen vehicles.
</P>
<P>
It also covered the unlawful disposal of vehicles without
proper documents.
</P>
<P>
A numbers of participants in the debate stressed the need for
stringent measures to curb cross-border car theft, and one
proposed that car thieves should have a leg and arm amputated "to
underline the seriousness of the crime".

<HEADLINE> Support Expressed for Statement on Taiwan (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The joint statement issued on May 20 was authorized by the
Taiwan Work Office of the Central Committee of the Communist Party
of China (CPC) and the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council.
</P>
<P>
Those gathered at today's meeting said they hoped that the new
leader of Taiwan would not act against the common wishes of the
Chinese people on both sides of the Taiwan Straits and other parts
of the world, and would take concrete steps to improve and develop
the cross-Straits relations.
</P>
<P>
Cheng Siyuan, vice-chairman of the Standing Committee of the
National People's Congress and representative of the non-party
personages, noted that in his inauguration speech, the new leader
of Taiwan uttered many placating phrases about not encouraging "
Taiwan independence," but was evasive and vague on the one-China
principle.
</P>
<P>
The new leader of Taiwan also claimed that one China is a
matter that will be handled in the future, while saying nothing
about the much-desired direct links in trade, transportation and
postal services between the two sides of the Straits.
</P>
<P>
"This showed that the new leader of Taiwan was short on
sincerity," Cheng said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Chinese citizens will no longer
need to provide an overseas invitation and permission from
overseas relatives or friends when applying for passports.
</P>
<P>
An official with the Exit and Entry Administration under the
Ministry of Public Security said China will use new private
passports starting from June 1, and the passport application
procedure will be simplified.
</P>
<P>
The new passport will be used first in Shanghai and its
neighboring Jiangsu Province. Other areas will adopt the new
passport later this year.
</P>
<P>
The official said that the old passports will remain valid
until they expire, but the expiration date will not be extended.
</P>
<P>
The administration promised that the waiting period for
receiving approved passports will be reduced to no more than 15
days, and even five days in cases of emergency. The passports may
be delivered by EMS on the request of applicants.
</P>
<P>
People planning to travel overseas with a tourism agency, need
to submit only the receipt of traveling expenses; formerly, a
governmental verification was necessary.
</P>
<P>
The new passport will be valid for five years and may be used
repeatedly. The old passports had a one-year validity and could be
used just one time.

Zhang Kehui, vice-chairman of the National Committee of the
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and chairman of
the Central Committee of the Taiwan Democratic self-government
League, said that though he made a gesture toward improving cross-
Straits relations, his vague words actually contained the "two-
state" sentiment.
</P>
<P>
"As people from Taiwan, we sincerely hope for peace, stability
and development in our homeland," Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
"And we also hope for an earlier settlement of the Taiwan issue
and the reunification of the motherland," Zhang said, warning that
denying that Taiwan is part of China would only end in disaster.
</P>
<P>
Tong Fu, vice-chairman of the Central Committee of
Revolutionary Committee of Chinese Kuomintang, pointed out at the
meeting that the new leader of Taiwan had purposely evaded the one
China principle.
</P>
<P>
"We will not make any compromise or concession on the one-China
principle," Tong said. The Taiwan new leader should fully realize
that the Taiwan issue will be solved only under the one-China
principle -- a principle stands strong in spite of outside
attempts to thwart it.
</P>
<P>
Yuan Xingpei, vice-chairman of the Central Committee of China
Democratic League, noted that if the new leader of Taiwan was
sincere about cross-Straits dialogue and negotiations, he should
not regard the one-China principle as a problem.

years more and more people in Taiwan have joined the call for
direct links in trade, transportation and postal services between
the two sides of the Straits.
</P>
<P>
However, some of the Taiwan authorities have stubbornly stuck
to the "Taiwan independence" theme and attempted to split the
island from the motherland.
</P>
<P>
"This will endanger not only the social stability and economic
growth in Taiwan, but also the fundamental interests of the
Chinese people," Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
Zhang called on the industry and commerce circles in Taiwan to
understand what "Taiwan independence" really means and to join the
mainland in putting an end to the separatists' schemes.
</P>
<P>
All participants at today's gathering vowed to take the lead in
opposing "Taiwan independence" and striving for the early
reunification of the motherland.

<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, May 22 (Xinhua) -- At least one person was killed
this evening when a helicopter exploded in mid-air over Changsha,
the capital city of central China's Hunan province.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said that around 6:10 p.m., a red helicopter was
flying low over Juzizhoutou Park in the city, when it suddenly
exploded and plunged into the Xiangjiang River.

<HEADLINE> Iran Reiterates Support for Lebanese Resistance Against Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Foreign Ministry spokesman Hamid Reza
Asefi Monday reiterated Iran's support for Lebanon's resistance
movement against Israel, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
On the planned withdrawal of Israeli forces from south Lebanon,
Asefi said that it was a victory of the resistance movement of
Hezbollah guerrillas and other popular forces who have enjoyed
long-time Iranian backing.
</P>
<P>
Iran believes that Israel should withdraw from the territories
in south Lebanon unconditionally so that security and calm would be
restored in the country, he said.
</P>
<P>
He called on Arab and Muslim countries in the Middle East to
continue pressuring Israel to join the Nuclear Non-Proliferation
Treaty and put its nuclear arms under international supervision.
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope that through further coordination among the
regional countries in the future, the goal of a nuclear-free Middle
East would be realized soon.
</P>
<P>
Israel has set July 7 as the deadline for its withdrawal of
forces from south Lebanon, where it has kept a so-called buffer
zone with a self-claimed aim of protecting its north from cross-
border guerrilla attacks.
</P>
<P>
Iran has refused to recognize the Israeli regime since the 1979
Islamic revolution and it has always called for armed struggle
against the Jewish state for the return of Arab and Islamic lands.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Leader Rules Out State of Emergency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph Estrada
said Monday that the government will not declare a state of
emergency despite some bombing incidents in Metro Manila.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference at the presidential palace,
Estrada said he condemned the bombing of SM Megamall Sunday which
killed one person and injured several others as well as the
bombing of Glorietta Mall in Makati City last week.
</P>
<P>
These bombings, the president said, were acts of cowardice
committed by terrorists whose agenda is to sow fear among the
people and destabilize the government.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said his government can solve the problem without
declaring a state of emergency. "I have enough powers under the
constitution to smash terrorism," he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the government is not helpless in fighting
terrorism. "Let me be clear. We are not helpless in this fight. We
can and will insure the safety and security of all Filipinos
throughout the country," he said.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said the intelligence services of the Armed Forces of
the Philippines (AFP) and the Philippine National Police (PNP) are
now stepping up their operations to ferret out these terrorists "
at the soonest possible time."
</P>
<P>
According to the president, while the PNP has intensified its
investigation into the bombing incidents, he has at the same time
ordered the Department of Interior and Local Government to
mobilize local government units to help prevent acts of terrorism
in their respective localities.
</P>
<P>
"Local executives should seek the assistance of private and
public establishments in their areas to adopt more effective
security measures to protect the public against these acts," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Estrada asked the people to be more vigilant and be
more security conscious, calling on them to cooperate with the law
enforcement agencies that will be implementing measures for their
safety.
</P>
<P>
He also urged the people to go on and live their normal lives."
This would be our best response to those forces who want to
confuse and terrorize us and derail our national progress and
development," he said.

<HEADLINE> Asia-Pacific Economies Recover, Risks Remain: UN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Asia-Pacific economies can look
forward to optimistic growth prospects in the immediate future,
but should realize downside risks, the United Nations said here
Monday.
</P>
<P>
At the launch of its annual Economic and Social Survey of Asia
and the Pacific, the U.N. Economic and Social Commission for Asia
and the Pacific (ESCAP) said the recovery from the crisis, which
happened almost three years ago, has been "broad-based."
</P>
<P>
All the subregions, except South and Southwest Asia, have shown
improved growth performance.
</P>
<P>
The report attributed the recovery to fiscal stimulus policy
practiced in many regional economies and better export performance,
saying the combination of the two factors helped increase capacity
utilization and contained a rise in unemployment.
</P>
<P>
"The current indications suggest reasonably optimistic
prospects for the further strengthening of regional growth in the
immediate future," the report said.
</P>
<P>
The agency forecast a 6.2-percent gross domestic product growth
rate for the regional developing economies in 2000, 0.6 percent
higher than the rate achieved in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The ongoing progress in financial restructuring, the potential
for further easing of the monetary policy stance and falling
interest rates and the likelihood of maintaining a strong export
performance, easing of the credit crunch and higher global demand
were all cited as the elements underlying the optimistic
projection.
</P>
<P>
The report also expected further progress in corporate debt
restructuring, stable exchange rates, strong export performance
and return of private capital inflows into the region to help
sustain the recovery.
</P>
<P>
Despite the optimistic scenario, however, the U.N. agency
warned that the region is not free from some downside risks which
pose a number of policy challenges.
</P>
<P>
The much-needed structural reforms may generate a sense of
uncertainty with respect to employment prospects and thus dampen
the pickup in domestic demand, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the plagued financial sectors in many regional
economies, over-reliance on external demand, comparatively low
agricultural productivity, limitation of fiscal stimulus policy
and an uncertain external environment can also dampen the momentum
of recovery, noted the report.
</P>
<P>
ESCAP also urged developing economies in the region to
establish and strengthen social security and safety nets, saying
the issues have become "prominent of late, especially after the
crisis."
</P>
<P>
A number of formal social security and safety arrangements are
currently in operation or under consideration within the region to
provide protection against involuntary unemployment or loss of
income due to ill health and old age.
</P>
<P>
However, the report said, the coverage remains highly limited,
suggesting the establishment of new programs, greater reliance on
market-based or other non-governmental programs and reforms in
existing programs.
</P>
<P>
The report also urged efforts to improve economic and financial
monitoring and surveillance in the region, saying that this is "an
integral part of the overall response" to the call for the
international financial system reform after the Asian crisis.

DHAKA, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh is expected to reach the
official projection of a 6.4-precent gross domestic product growth
rate in fiscal year 1999-2000, following a significant increase in
crop production and industrial and service sector output,
according to a survey released here Monday.
</P>
<P>
"A bumper harvest of rice crop, an upturn in industrial
production and a higher output in the construction, power,
transport and wholesale and retail trade would help achieve the
growth target," Director General of Bangladesh Institute of
Development Studies Abu Ahmed Abdullah said when formally
launching the "Economic and Social Survey for Asia and the Pacific
2000."
</P>
<P>
Abdullah said Bangladesh has maintained a steady growth in
comparison with other South Asian countries despite devastating
floods in 1998 which lowered projections.
</P>
<P>
The country's inflation rate rose to nearly 9 percent in 1999
from 7 percent in the previous year due to a flood-related decline
in food and industrial production, Abdullah said, adding that both
food and non-food prices dropped at the end of 1999 as direct
effects of the floods eased.
</P>
<P>
Referring to trade and exchange rates, he said export growth
declined to less than 3 percent in 1999 from nearly 17 percent
recorded in the previous year, as extensive flooding depressed
production and disrupted transport and communication links.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey, import payments rose by 7 percent as
expenditure on foodgrain imports rose significantly in response to
a flood-related shortfall in domestic supplies.
</P>
<P>
Import liberalization, removal of import restrictions and
reduction in import duties have made Bangladesh a more outward-
looking trade regime, said Abdullah.

<HEADLINE> Prodi Hails Swiss Vote on EU Treaties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, May 22 (Xinhua) -- President of the European
Commission Romano Prodi on Monday welcomed the result of the Swiss
referendum on the country's economic treaties with the European
Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
Prodi said in a written statement that the result of the
referendum has clearly demonstrated the will of the Swiss people
to further develop and foster relations with the EU.
</P>
<P>
"It is a milestone on our joint road toward prosperity and
stability in Europe, to the benefit of the people of Switzerland
and of the European Union," said Prodi.
</P>
<P>
Switzerland held a national referendum on Sunday on seven
bilateral economic agreements with the 15-nation bloc and more
than two thirds of the voters voted in favor of the agreements.
</P>
<P>
Prodi said the Swiss-EU agreements will further improve the
already excellent good-neighborly relations between the two sides
with many positive effects on the daily life of the citizens in
these countries.
</P>
<P>
"The agreements shall bring about considerable strengthening of
our relations, but in no way pre-judge any steps to further
integration," said the president of the commission, the executive
body of the EU.
</P>
<P>
The European Parliament, the legislative body of the EU, has
already approved the agreements concerning transit transport, free
movement of people and bilateral trade and other sectors.
</P>
<P>
"The parliaments of our member states will have to give their
approval to the agreement on the free movement of persons. The
matter will be treated as a priority, and I am confident that the
agreement can start to apply sometime in 2001," said Prodi.

<P>
LHASA, May 22 (Xinhua) -- The gross domestic product (GDP) of
southwest China's Tibet Autonomous Region reached a record of 10
billion yuan (about 1.25 billion U.S.dollars) in 1999, up 9.6
percent over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
According to figures released during the third session of the
Seventh Tibet Autonomous Regional People's Congress, which opened
in Lhasa today, growth in the local economy last year was due to
the steady development in farming and pasturing.
</P>
<P>
The grain output in Tibet reported 922,000 tons in 1999.
Meanwhile, the region's industrial volume reached 998 million yuan,
up 6.4 percent over 1998.
</P>
<P>
The service industry has become a major driving force in the
region's economy. Last year the sector topped 1.74 billion yuan,
up 10.2 percent over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, Tibet received a total of 448,000 domestic and
overseas tourists and earned 36.3 million U.S. dollars in tourism,
up 9.9 percent over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Tibet invested 5.66 billion yuan in dozens of
construction projects, including infrastructure, power, water-
conservancy and transportation.

GUANGZHOU, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Mobile phone subscribers in south
China's Guangdong Province today topped eight million, an average

</P>
<P>
The number of phone subscribers in Guangdong accounts for one-
sixth of the country's total, ranking first among Chinese
provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities.

<P>
Five years ago, the province only had one million mobile phone
users, said the official. By the end of last year, Guangdong
reported an increase to six million mobile phone users.

<HEADLINE> Retail Sales Up in April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Dropping prices and holidays helped
drive the volume of retail sales by 9.1 percent in April, official
figures show.
</P>
<P>
According to figures that the National Bureau of Statistics (
NBS) released today, retail sales surged by 9.1 percent over one
year ago to 257.15 billion yuan (about 31 billion US dollars) in
April.
</P>
<P>
Retail sales for the first four months totaled 1.1 trillion
yuan, 10.1 percent more than the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
NBS said this is an indication that the consumption market
continues to improve, though slowly.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, earlier figures showed that consumer price
index (CPI), a crucial indicator of the consumption demand,
dropped by nearly one percent over the previous month in April.
</P>
<P>
NBS said that discount on clothes and price wars among electric
household appliance producers helped drive up sales by 20-53
percent. Sales of air conditioners in Beijing doubled in April.
Sales of cars were also up.
</P>
<P>
Long public holidays around May 1 also helped boost sales of
cameras and other tourist goods.

In April, the catering sector saw a growth of sales of 17.9
percent over one year ago. Sales in the trading grew to 11.8
percent while manufacturing sector saw a 4.3 percent increase.

BEIJING, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Li Peng, chairman of the Standing
Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC), expressed today
appreciation and thanks to the government and parliament of Papua
New Guinea (PNG) for their one-China policy.
</P>
<P>
Li told Bernard Narokobi, speaker of the PNG National

opposing the so-called diplomatic relationship between his country
and Taiwan, which was initiated by the former government of Papua

<P>
The Chinese Government and people uphold that a peaceful

condition of One China. The government is making vigorous efforts
to achieve this, Li said.
</P>
<P>
"We are firmly opposed to any attempt to split the motherland
by Taiwan separatists," Li stressed. "We are convinced that this
principled stand will continue to be backed by the people of Papua
New Guinea and other countries around the world," Li said.
</P>

<HEADLINE> More Chinese Become Overweight, Obesity: Research </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 22 (Xinhua) -- "Keep your weight at a safe level!"
More and more Chinese get this advice, or the health warning, from
doctors as obesity is becoming a major epidemic in this populous
country.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that 18 out of every 100 people in China are
overweight. The rate of obesity has reached 2.48 percent, which
means at least 30 million people older than 20 are overweight.
</P>
<P>
Overweight among people aged between 35-59 has even surpassed
50 percent, the average level in some industrialized countries,
according to the latest research.
</P>
<P>
Residents in north China, especially males in Beijing and
females in Shandong Province, run higher risk of having extra
weight than those in the south. Females and urban residents are
more likely to become fat than males and rural people.
</P>
<P>
"Obesity is not only a health-threatening illness, but also the
key risk factor of some other diseases, such as diabetes, cardio
and cerebral vascular illnesses, and respiratory system problems,"
according to researchers from the Chinese Academy of Preventive
Medicine, the Chinese Academy of Medical Science and the No. 1
Hospital of Beijing University.
</P>
<P>
The researchers employed the BMI index -- body weight (
kilometer)/square of body height (meter), which has been
recommended by the World Health Organization.
</P>
<P>
A person can be diagnosed overweight if the BMI equals or
surpasses 25, while the criteria of obesity is 30 or higher.
</P>
<P>
However, some Asian scholars argue that bottom lines for
overweight and obesity diagnosis among Asians should be
respectively lowered to 23 and 25, because the Asians are more
vulnerable to diabetes and cardio vascular diseases.
</P>
<P>
If this is the case, China will have a larger population of
overweight people. The researchers said specific measures should
be drawn up as soon as possible to deal with the problem.

China the permanent normal trade relations (PNTR) status with the
United States made considerable progress in their efforts last
week, according to a high-level delegation from the American
Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong Monday.
</P>
<P>
While Congressional passage is not yet assured, the delegation
is encouraged that momentum is in the direction of a positive vote,
said the delegation that has just returned from an advocacy
mission in Washington DC.
</P>
<P>
"From our intensive series of meetings on Capitol Hill last
week, we are convinced that it's going to be a very close vote.
Neither proponents nor opponents can confirm the 218 votes
required to win in the House," said Richard Kahler, chairman of
the American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong (AmCham) and head of

<HEADLINE> Iraq Urges AL Move to End U.S., British Aggression </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Iraq has asked the Arab League (AL)
to exert pressure on the United States and Britain to stop their
almost-daily aggressions on Iraq, the official Iraqi News Agency
reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to AL Secretary General Ahmed Esmat Abdel-Meguid,
Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammad Said Al-Sahaf also demanded that
the pan-Arab forum condemn the continuous aggressions on Iraq "in
conformity with principles of the Arab League Charter," said the
INA.
</P>
<P>
In the letter, Sahaf elaborated on the bombings and violations
by U.S. and British planes on Iraq on May 8-14, when they carried
out 152 armed sorties from bases in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi government absolutely rejects the so-called no-fly
zones imposed by the U.S. and Britain and "the feeble pretexts
which the two states use to justify their military aggressions on
our country," said Sahaf.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has constantly protested to the AL over the aggressions of
the U.S. and British planes taking off from bases in Saudi Arabia
and Kuwait, close allies of the U.S. in the Gulf region.
</P>
<P>
U.S. and British planes have been enforcing the two no-fly zones
in northern and southern Iraq since their imposition in the wake of
the 1991 Gulf War. Iraq never recognizes the zones and has
challenged the allied planes since December 1998 by targeting the
aircraft with surface-to-air missiles and anti-aircraft artillery.

<HEADLINE> Mozambique to Dispose of Obsolete Pesticides </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, May 22 (Xinhua) -- A team of technicians is finalizing
arrangements to dispose of about 850 tons of obsolete pesticides
stored at the waste treatment station in Matola, less than 10
kilometers from the Mozambican capital of Maputo, Monday's
"Noticias" daily reported.
</P>
<P>
Despite opposition from environmentalists, the Mozambican
government has decided to incinerate some of pesticides in the
furnaces of the Matola cement company.
</P>
<P>
Mozambican Environment Minister John Kachamila said that some
of the waste will be incinerated,some will be exported, and the
remainder is to be buried in a place yet to be defined.
</P>
<P>
"The issue of pesticides is not simple. We have been working in
 accordance with international rules. This is a national problem
that worries the government", he said.
</P>
<P>
He explained that what the government is doing now is to select
and define which pesticides will be given which destiny, and that
will be done soon.
</P>
<P>
In principle, the pesticides to be buried in a landfill are
those which contain heavy metals and are those too dangerous to
incinerate.
</P>
<P>
Danish Cooperation and Development Minister Jan Torborg said
that the Mozambican Environment Ministry had informed him of its
decision on how to deal with the pesticides.
</P>
<P>
The Danish government is involved because it is financing the
disposal of the pesticides.

<P>
BEIJING, May 22 (XINHUA) -- Returned overseas Chinese leaders
who attended a local forum here today spelt out their strong
opposition against separatism and "Taiwan independence",
expressing their eagerness for reunification of the motherland.
</P>
<P>
The forum was jointly held by the Overseas Chinese Affairs
Office of the State Council, the Overseas Chinese Affairs
Committee of the National People's Congress, the Subcommittee for
Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan Compatriots and Overseas Chinese of
the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference, the Public Interest Party, and the All-
China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese.
</P>
<P>
Almost 100 people attended the forum. The leaders criticized
the new leader of Taiwan Province for his evasive and ambiguous
position on the One-China Principle in his inaugural speech.
</P>
<P>
The leaders supported the May 20 statement on the cross-straits
issue by the general offices of the Central Committee of the
Communist Party of China and the State Council.
</P>
<P>
They are of the same opinion that if the new leader of Taiwan
is sincere enough he should give up any secessionist stance and
return to the position of the One China Principle without any
additional condition. Otherwise, he will be following the steps of
Lee Teng-hui and become a criminal of the Chinese nation.

<HEADLINE> Iran Protests Turkish Arrest of Iranian Citizens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Ministry on Monday
summoned Turkish ambassador Turan Moraly once again to protest the
arrest of hundreds of Iranian citizens in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Terming the Turkish move as "inhuman," the ministry's Director
General Mohammad Sharif Mahdavi said that the arrest of hundreds of
Iranians by Turkish police aroused grave concern of Iranian
officials and public opinion.
</P>
<P>
"The Islamic Republic of Iran condemned such inhuman actions of
the Turkish government and urged Ankara to stop such moves and
release the arrested Iranians as soon as possible," he said, quoted
by the official Islamic Republic News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Mahdavi also warned that Turkish government should shoulder
responsibility for the consequence of the arrests.
</P>
<P>
Moraly in reply expressed regret over the arrest of Iranians in
Turkey and promised to convey Iran's protest to the Ankara
government as soon as possible to follow up the case.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that the Turkish police and security forces stormed
the residences of Iranians in Turkey's largest city Istanbul on
Saturday, rounding up over 300 Iranians amid an intensified
crackdown on Islamic activists.
</P>
<P>
Iran's Foreign Ministry spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi on Monday
called the Turkish move "unacceptable" and said "we not only
consider this a despicable move out of context with diplomatic
norms and international regulations, but also an affront to the
good neighborly relations between the two countries."
</P>
<P>
He said that due to the emphatic follow-up of Iranian
government, many of the arrested Iranians have been released and
his ministry is continuing a probe into the status of the other
detainees.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Ministry will employ all within its capacity to
stop the measure, Asefi said.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, the ministry had summoned the Turkish envoy to voice
Tehran's "strong dissatisfaction over the expanded anti-Iran
propaganda" by the Turkish mass media.
</P>
<P>
Following the arrest of nine Turkish Islamic activists, Turkish
press accused Iran of being involved in the bomb explosions of two
Turkish journalists in 1993 and 1999. Tehran rejected the
allegation.

<HEADLINE> 1 Israeli Solider Injured in Hezbollah Attacks on Shebaa Farms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 22 (Xinhua) -- One Israeli solider was injured
Monday morning in Lebanese Hezbollah guerrillas attacks on Israeli
positions in the controversial Shebaa Farms, Lebanon's Oriental
radio reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah fired missiles and mortars at Israeli positions
following a speech made by Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah on
Sunday, which said the resistance will not cease attacks on the
farms after Israel's scheduled withdrawal if the farms are not
included in the withdrawal list.
</P>
<P>
Monday morning, Hezbollah also shelled an Israeli early-warning
station in the Shebaa Farms region located at an altitude of 2,000
meters on Mount Hermon, which can oversee the activities of the
whole Lebanon, Syria, Jordan and some part of Israel.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah attacked Israeli positions in Shebaa Farms on Sunday
for the first time since 1989 when the guerrillas killed four
Israeli officers in Jabal Lus in the region.
</P>
<P>
The fertile Shebaa Farms are located on the Lebanese side of
Mount Hermon, now under Israeli occupation. Israel said the farms
belong to Syria, and that a withdrawal from the area would be
considered in its peace talks with Damascus.
</P>
<P>
According to a British-French agreement on the Lebanese-
Palestinian border in 1923, the Shebaa Farms were not included in
the Lebanon side. But Lebanon claimed that the area was bequeathed
to Beirut in an agreement between Lebanon and Syria.

<HEADLINE> Former Indonesian President Undergoes Questioning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's Attorney General Office
(AGO on Monday once again examined former president Soeharto at
his residence to get more information on his alleged involvement
in corruption practices.
</P>
<P>
A member of Soeharto's lawyer team, Danny Kailimang, told
Xinhua after the investigation that in the course of the
questioning Soeharto replied as many as 11 questions from
prosecutors. "And he has answered all the questions but in a
simple way," Kailimang said without elaborating.
</P>
<P>
He added that the questioning was ceased because the state of
health of the 78-years-old man worsened.
</P>
<P>
"Yes, based on advice of Soeharto's doctors and medical team
from the AGO, the investigation into Pak Harto (Soeharto) was
ceased. The blood pressure of Soeharto arise (due to today's
questioning)," Kailimang said, but hoping the investigation could
be continued next Monday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Spokesman of the AGO Yushar Yahya told Xinhua that
his side has yet to receive a report from the prosecutors on the
result of today's questioning.
</P>
<P>
But he admitted that prosecutors have found "leads that
Soeharto committed corruption practices during his rule."
</P>
<P>
"And we will carry on the investigation, so that it could be
completed before the period of Soeharto's city arrest status
expires (on August 10)," Yahya said.
</P>
<P>
Last week Attorney General Marzuki Darusman said the dossiers
of Soeharto's case on corruption charges would be submitted to the
court in August this year.
</P>
<P>
He asked Soeharto and his family to cooperate with prosecutors
and warned them that "the security protection (for Soeharto and
his family) will be reduced to the minimum level (if they don't do
so)."

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Budget May Need to be Revised, Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's Coordinating Minister
for Economy, Finance and Industry Kwik Kian Gie said here Monday
that the state budget for fiscal year 2000 needs to be revised if
the exchange rate of rupiah stands at 8,000 per U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
"If the rupiah continues to weaken and standing at 8,000 per
dollar,the (current) state budget needs to be revised," Kwik told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
The government had set the exchange rate of rupiah within the
current fiscal year ending in December at 7,000 rupiah for one U.S.
dollar.
</P>
<P>
But the rupiah dropped to a six months low against the
greenback last week, hitting around 8,500 per U.S. dollar last
week. But it was quoted at 8,100 (buying) and 8,350 (selling) per
dollar Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Minister of Finance Bambang Sudibyo said the
government would not revise its current budget as the exchange
rate of rupiah is still susceptible.
</P>
<P>
While Kwik backed Sudibyo's statement hoping that in the future
the rupiah will regain strength, he added "we can not predict when
the rupiah will strengthen as we hope."

<P>
COLOMBO, May 22 (Xinhua) -- A Norwegian peace mission, led by

a government official here said Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Johansen is now meeting Sri Lankan Foreign Minister Lakshman

Johansen would also meet President Chandrika Kumaratunga and
leader of the main opposition United National Party Ranil
Wickremesinghe during the three-day visit.
</P>
<P>
Norway has offered to hold talks between the government and the
rebels. It appointed Solheim last month as an envoy to try and
find a way to end the 17-war in Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
Norway has said the current fighting would have to be resolved
before the peace initiative could proceed.
</P>

However, intense fighting is continuing on the northern Jaffna
Peninsula, with clashes on the outskirts of the Chavakachcheri
town between the government troops and the Tamil rebels who are
launching a fierce attack on troops in bid to recapture their
former stronghold in the Peninsula which they lost in may 1996.

<P>
PYONGYANG, May 22 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. State Department working
delegation is to pay an additional visit to the underground
facility in Kumchang-ri, North Phyongan Province of the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), the Korean Central News Agency
reported here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The delegation, at the invitation of the DPRK Foreign Ministry,
is expected to arrive here Tuesday and visit the facility in
accordance with its itinerary, said the report.
</P>
<P>
A U.S. working delegation visited the Kumchang-ri site last May
as it claimed that the facility was a suspected nuclear weapons
installation. After the investigations the delegation said what
they found at the underground site was an empty tunnel.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement reached between the United States and the
DPRK in March 1999, the DPRK allowed U.S. experts to "enter" the
underground facilities in Kumchang-ri last May in return for a U.S.
pledge to improve relations with the east Asian country.

<HEADLINE> French Interior Minister Apologizes for Anti-German Remarks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 22 (Xinhua) -- French Interior Minister Jean-Pierre
Chevenement apologized on Monday for his anti-German remarks,
which have triggered an outcry of protests in French political
circles.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with television channel France II on Sunday,
Chevenement said that by presenting a proposal on building a
European federation, Germany has not been "cured of the derailment
which was Nazism."
</P>
<P>
He also accused Germany of "always dreaming of the Roman-
Germanic Holy Empire" and of "having a conception of nation of
Folks (people), which is an ethnic conception."
</P>
<P>
"I am deeply sorry that my thinking was without doubt a little
tense for the television but I see that for a certain number of
specialists of provocation, the fact of not being rallied to a
European federal project suffices to make you anti-German," said
the interior minister in a statement on television and radio
Europe I Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
Former French President Valery Giscard d'Estaing said that he
was shocked by Chevenement's attack against Germany, while
Socialist Party leader Francois Hollande said that Nazism is
already a period belonging to the past of Germany.
</P>
<P>
"Of course, I love Germany, I am for Franco-German friendship.
I only said that Germany was not cured, not of Nazism, but of the
derailment which Nazism was in its history, which means that
Nazism was in my mind an accident in the German history," said
Chevenement, who is leader of the sovereignist Citizens' Movement
party.

<HEADLINE> Project Planned to Ensure Water Quality in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Feasibility studies have been
completed on building a project to ensure quality of water
supplied from Shenzhen, in Guangdong Province, to Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
According to Li Yihui, deputy head of Guangdong Provincial
Environmental Protection Bureau, the project will begin this year
and be finished by 2003.
</P>
<P>
Fresh water in Hong Kong is mainly provided by Dongjiang-
Shenzhen Water Supply Project constructed in the 1960s. Water
comes from Dongjiang River and is then sent to the Shenzhen
Reservoir and eventually channeled to HK. Along the way, the water
runs through 12 towns and is polluted by industrial wastes and
sewage.
</P>
<P>
In the past decades, a local law was passed to protect water in
the Dongjiang River. In the meantime, the provincial government of
Guangdong has set up a water quality control committee to monitor
the water in the province and the environment.
</P>
<P>
From 1992 to 1999, Guangdong Province invested 1.8 billion yuan
(about 217 million U.S. dollars ) to control pollution in the
Dongjiang River Valley and along the Dongjiang-Shenzhen Water
Supply Project. They closed down or relocated 130 major companies
who were polluting the environment and forced 200 enterprises to
take measures to curb pollution according to state requirements.
</P>
<P>
Completion of the project will prevent water supplied to Hong
Kong from being contaminated by industrial wastes and other
pollutants from surrounding areas.

<HEADLINE> Anti-Narcotics Education for Over 60 Million School Children in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 22 (Xinhua) -- More than 60 million Chinese
primary and secondary students received anti-narcotics education
in 1999, the Ministry of Public Security said today.
</P>
<P>
Of these 60 million students, more than 26 million are
secondary school students and 35 million are primary school
students.
</P>
<P>
China's schools usually conduct anti-narcotics education in the
form of holding lectures, exhibitions, and composition contests or
organizing students to read anti-narcotics books or watch related
films or VCDs.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that China had over 680,000 registered drug
addicts in 1999, 14.3 percent more than in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Among the total drug population, 80 percent of the registered
addicts are male, and people between the ages of 17 and 35 take up
78 percent. More than 490,000, or 72 percent of the total, take
heroin.

<HEADLINE> Magazine Warns Taiwan's New Leader Not to Follow Lee Teng-hui's Step </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Outlook, a Xinhua-sponsored
biweekly, publishes an article on its May 22 issue, warning the
new leader of Taiwan not to take the same disastrous road as his
predecessor, Lee Teng-hui.
</P>
<P>
On May 20, Lee formally stepped down and he also left his post
as chairman of the Kuomintang due to his separatist activities
that have been opposed by all patriotic Chinese, the article says.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan issue should not have been a complicated one, it
says, reiterating that there is only one China in the world and
Taiwan is part of China, which is a consensus for Chinese living
on the two sides of the Taiwan Straits and is recognized by the
whole world.
</P>
<P>
All countries that have established diplomatic ties with China
including the United States have recognized and followed the one-
China principle.
</P>
<P>
The article notes that when Lee just took over power, he also
pledged: there is only the policy of one China rather than two
Chinas.
</P>
<P>
The magazine blames those who want to split China for turning
the Taiwan issue into a complicated one. These people want to use
"Taiwan independence" to interfere in China's internal affairs and
to make Taiwan their "unsinkable aircraft-carrier", it says.
</P>
<P>
Some people in Taiwan, including Lee, want to separate Taiwan
from China by depending on foreign forces. Lee has fostered
separatist forces in Taiwan, first covertly and then openly.
</P>
<P>
The cross-straits relations remain strained although Lee Teng-
hui has stepped down.
</P>
<P>
If the new leader of Taiwan really cares for the people of
Taiwan and does not want to be abandoned by them, he must
completely give up the "legacy" of Lee on handling cross-straits
relations, it says.
</P>
<P>
The article reiterates the Chinese government's stance that
everything is negotiable as long as the one-China principle is
recognized.

<HEADLINE> Thorpe Joins Olympic Humanitarian Aid Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 22 (Xinhua) -- World-record swimmers Ian Thorpe
and Susie O'Neill on Monday joined Olympic Aid, a humanitarian
project created to raise funds for refugees and disadvantaged
children.
</P>
<P>
At the Olympic Aid relaunch in Sydney, founder Johann Olav Koss,
a member of the International Olympic Committee's athletes'
commission, said the cause was based on the Olympic ideals of
peace and human dignity.
</P>
<P>
Koss founded Olympic Aid in 1994 in the buildup to the
Lillehammer Winter Olympics. The program continued during the 1996
Atlanta Olympics and has so far raised about 31 million U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
"Olympic Aid is a project where Australians can make a huge
difference to the lives of children in Australia and around the
world," said Koss, a speedskater who won three gold medals at
Lillehammer.
</P>
<P>
"The money raised from the last two Olympic Games has improved
the lives and prospects of over 16 million children and enabled
the vaccination of over 12 million children."
</P>
<P>
The Australian athletes were aiming to raise 5 million
Australian dollars (2.85 millions U.S. dollars) before the
September 15-October 1 Sydney Olympics.
</P>
<P>
"Children are the world's biggest assets and, by helping them,
we can make the world a better place," said Thorpe, who set three
world records last week at the Australian Olympic selection trials
in Sydney.

<HEADLINE> China's Shipbuilding Industry Plans More Sales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 22 (Xinhua) -- China's shipbuilding industry
expects an annual sales income of 23 billion yuan by 2005 and 35
billion yuan by 2010.
</P>
<P>
China's top two shipbuilding companies, the China State
Shipbuilding Corporation (CSSC) and the China Shipbuilding
Industry Corporation (CSIC), have both unveiled their blueprint
for the early years of the new century.
</P>
<P>
The CSSC plans an annual output of 2.5 million tons in 2005 and
3.5 to four million tons in 2010, which will make the company one
of the top three shipbuilders in the world.
</P>
<P>
The CSIC is expected to generate a sales revenue of 11 billion
yuan and an output of 980,000 tons this year. Both figures will be
doubled by the year 2005, according to the company's plan.
</P>
<P>
Last year, China's shipbuilding industry received record orders
of 8.57 million tons, 80 percent of which came from overseas.
</P>
<P>
These orders, which accounted for 19 percent of the global
total, made China the world's third biggest shipbuilder.

<HEADLINE> Kidnapping Ring Busted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Chinese police have smashed a major
kidnapping ring who abducted and forced women to provide sexual
services, the Ministry of Public Security said today.
</P>
<P>
To date, police have seized 13 criminal suspects and rescued
seven abducted women.
</P>
<P>
A police investigation shows that since 1996, Yang Xuerong, a
jobless resident from the Zhijiang Dong Autonomous County in
central China's Henan Province, collaborated with twelve criminal
suspects to abduct more than 20 local young girls, and sold them
as prostitutes in south China's Guangdong Province and Hainan
Province for more than one million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Most of the girls are students from local nursing schools,
normal schools and technical schools. The ring leaders made
friends with these girls and later took them provinces in south
China saying that they would provide good job opportunities.
</P>
<P>
Qian Xiongfei, an official with the ministry, said that as most
abducted women and children are sold to mountainous areas or
underground criminal rings in coastal areas, it's hard for police
to catch the leaders without the help of grass-root Party and
government units, local people and police units.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Public Security Jia Chunwang said in a recent
speech at a national tele-conference that the nationwide hunt for
traffickers of women and children is a major task for the ministry
this year.

<HEADLINE> Sino-U.S. Statement on Cooperation in Environment, Development Signed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 22 (Xinhua) -- China and the United States has
signed a joint statement on the environment and development
cooperation between the two countries, the Chinese Ministry of
Science and Technology said today.
</P>
<P>
The statement, signed on May 19 by Chinese Science and
Technology Minister Zhu Lilan and U.S. Ambassador to China Joseph
Prueher on behalf of their respective governments, was released by
the Ministry today.
</P>
<P>
The joint statement said the two countries believe that energy
and environment constitutes one of the most important areas of
cooperation between them.
</P>
<P>
"By making clean energy widely available through the
development and application of new technologies and strengthening
efforts to protect our environment and the earth's biodiversity,
China-U.S. cooperation will contribute significantly toward
further securing the welfare and quality of life of the people of
the two countries," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
The statement was initially proposed by U.S. Vice-President Al
Gore last month in a bid to further exchanges and cooperation
between the two countries in bilateral and global environmental
protection endeavors, including protection of global climate and
biodiversity.
</P>
<P>
The statement reviewed the efforts made by both China and the
United States in energy and environment and spelt out a framework
for the future development and cooperation in these areas.
</P>
<P>
The document also reaffirmed their strong support for
international efforts to combat changes in global climate under
the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the
Kyoto Protocol, "in accordance with the principle of common but
differentiated responsibilities."
</P>
<P>
It also noted both China and the United States "intend to work
together and with other countries toward realizing the Kyoto
Protocol" and "assure that any increased trading will not
undermine natural resource management and special protection
programs."

ANKARA, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Turkish security forces have stepped
up their crackdown on Islamic terrorist groups and more suspects
have been arrested.
</P>
<P>
In operations on Saturday, police killed four suspected Islamic
militants in the southern city of Adana and the biggest city of
Istanbul. Two policemen were wounded in the clashes.
</P>
<P>
Police also sent seven suspects of Islamic gangs, captured in
the ongoing Operation Hope, to Ankara State Security Court (DGM) on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Two suspects, recently detained for involvement in the killing
of famous secular intellectuals, told police that two Iranian
agents had planted the bombs in the murder of Ugur Mumcu, a
journalist who was assassinated in a car bomb in 1993.
</P>
<P>
But police discovered the two who planted the bombs were not
Iranian, but Turkish. They were identified as Ferhan Ozmen and
Necdet Yuksel, who have confessed to the crimes.
</P>
<P>
According to police sources, they admitted having taking part in
a string of terrorist attacks in last decade. Ozmen described many
cases, including the killing of a U.S. soldier and wounding of an
Egyptian diplomat.
</P>
<P>
He is also said to have confessed to the car-bomb killing of
Ehud Sadan, security chief at the Israeli embassy in Ankara, in
1992, as well as the wounding of Yuda Yurum, the leader of Ankara's
tiny Jewish community in a car-bomb attack in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Other Turkish victims were secular intellectuals including
journalist Mumcu, he added. According to the confessions, Ozmen
admitted that he was behind the whole series of killings.
</P>
<P>
However, the public have started to become confused as a result
of the suspects' confessions. Some people said that it was
difficult to believe that one man had done everything.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 22 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading Israeli newspapers Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Several Jews who own private plots in the Abu Dis area have
put their properties up for sale, with a view to sell them to local
Arabs, according to sources in the Jerusalem Municipality.
</P>
<P>
The municipality is aware that the owners of some 24 dunams
(about 2.4 hectares) are already negotiating to sell their land, as
the government prepares to hand full control of Abu Dis and its
environs to the Palestinian National Authority.
</P>
<P>
Of the 300 dunams (about 30 hectares) of Jewish-owned land
around Abu Dis, 100 (about 10 hectares) are held by the Jewish
National Fund. Of this, the Jerusalem Municipality is looking to
build 200 apartments on a plot. The remaining 176 dunams (about 17.
6 hectares) of privately owned land are as yet not for sale.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Israel has expressed reserved satisfaction with the results
of the United Nations conference on the Nuclear Non-Proliferation
Treaty (NPT), which closed in New York on Saturday. Israel did not
take part in the conference or send an observer.
</P>
<P>
Sources in Jerusalem say the United States prevented the
conference from taking any measures against Israel and thus
fulfilled its commitment to the understandings reached between
Washington and Israel on the subject.
</P>
<P>
In the concluding remarks, Israel was mentioned for the first
time as the only country in the Middle East that has not signed the
NPT. However, the U.S. and Egypt reached an "arrangement" that no
substantive measures would be taken against Israel.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli military sources are worrying that the events of the
past few days signal the impending collapse of the Israeli-backed
South Lebanon Army.
</P>
<P>
As many as 40 SLA soldiers and their families abandoned their
outposts in the central sector of the Israeli-occupied buffer zone
in south Lebanon Sunday, after masses of Lebanese Shiite residents
returned to their homes in the region, according to unconfirmed
reports from Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The SLA soldiers reported that they took most of the arms with
them when they left the Taiben outpost, which was transferred to
them by the Israeli army just a week ago, but it is not clear what
happened to an armored personnel carrier and tank stationed there.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a wave of defections by Shiite soldiers has swept
through the ranks of the SLA in recent weeks, with the Lebanese
Hezbollah guerrillas claiming that dozens have defected.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak on Sunday suspended the
back-channel negotiations with the Palestinians in Stockholm and
ordered the Israeli team home, due to the ongoing violence in the
West Bank and Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
Team leader and Israeli Public Security Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami
and negotiator Gilad Sher are expected to be back on Monday.
Barak's spokesman Gadi Baltiansky said the situation must be
reviewed before the talks can resume.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Israelis and tourists have been barred from entering
the Palestinian self-rule city of Jericho, following a firebomb
attack on an Israeli car traveling through the city early Sunday
morning, en route to the Golan Heights.

<HEADLINE> Thai-Branded Products to be Promoted in ASEAN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 22 (Xinhua) -- The Thai government is supporting a
move to promote Thai-branded products in the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) market by allowing local
advertising agencies to take part in the campaign, the Thai News
Agency (TNA) reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Director-General of the Department of Export Promotion
Charin Harnsuebsai was quoted as saying that the move would
benefit both exporters of Thai-branded products and local
advertising agencies, which have said they are ready to join
manufacturers and exporters in promoting Thai brands in other nine
ASEAN countries.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN now groups Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia,
Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
The move coincides with the preparations by ASEAN states to
implement the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA) over the next three
years.
</P>
<P>
Thai manufacturers and exporters who have already created their
own brands and those who are going to introduce their own ones can
now turn to local advertising agencies to help promote and
publicize their Thai-branded products in the ASEAN market, said
the report.

<HEADLINE> MILF Intends to Resume Talks With Philippine Govt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 22 (Xinhua) -- The Moro Islamic Liberation Front (
MILF)expressed its intent to resume peace talks with the
Philippine government later this month, the Philippine News Agency
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Aleem Abdulaziz Mimbantas, MILF chief peace negotiator, was
quoted as saying that their intention came amid the government's
pronouncement of maintaining an open line to peace options with
them despite recent clashes of their forces in flashpoint areas of
Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
The MILF's move came after it indefinitely suspended its almost
three-year-old talks with the government earlier this month due to
continuous clashes of their respective combatants in the field.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, government chief negotiator Edgardo Batenga
reiterated the government's position to entertain peace ventures
with the MILF to forge lasting peace in the island.
</P>
<P>
As sign of their sincerity to the proposal, Al Haj Murad, MILF
military chief, has announced the repositioning of their forces
back to Camp Abubakar, their biggest camp located in the jungle of
Maguindana, within 48 hours starting today to clear the Ramos
highway of resisting guerrillas.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 22 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank (WB) will cooperate
with the Thai government to develop information technology (IT) in
Thailand, which will lead to new approaches of economic
development in the country, Thailand's Science, Technology and
Environment Minister Arthit Urairat said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Arthit was quoted by the official Thai News Agency as saying
that he had discussed the issue with executives of the World Bank
recently, and the WB officials are scheduled to fly to Thailand
this week to work out the cooperative project with the Ministry of
Science, Technology, and Environment.
</P>
<P>
The cooperation would help enhance the competitiveness of both
the public and private sectors in the local IT industry, which
would lead to the economic development, based on new IT-oriented
approaches, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Information technology is now seen as a key element of modern
economic development policies of countries in the globalization
era, said Arthit, and with the help by the World Bank, Thailand's
competitiveness in the international market will be enhanced.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Ruling Coalition Expected to Be Restored Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, May 22 (Xinhua) -- South Korean President Kim Dae-jung's
nomination of Lee Han-dong as prime minister is seen as a first
step to restore the ruling coalition between his Millennium
Democratic Party (MDP) and the minor United Liberal Democrats (ULD)
.
</P>
<P>
The restoration of the coalition is unavoidable destiny, Lee,
who is ULD president, said at a press conference after his
nomination Monday morning to succeed Park Tae-jung, who resigned
last weekend over tax evasion scandal.
</P>
<P>
President Kim will meet ULD founder Kim Jong-pil for restoring
the coalition ahead of the inter-Korean summit. As far as national
security is concerned, Kim Jong-pil wants a supra-partisan
approach to the matter, said the prime minster-designate.
</P>
<P>
Ironically, it was none other than Lee Han-dong who declared
the breakup to the coalition before the general elections on April
13 this year, and accused President Kim of failing to practice the
cabinet system agreed by the two parties ahead of the presidential
election in December 1997.
</P>
<P>
Under the 1997 agreement, President Kim promised to carry out
the cabinet system after two years in office.
</P>
<P>
Designating Lee as new prime minister, President Kim is
believed to have taken into account Lee's role in restoring the
ruling coalition.
</P>
<P>
Lee will become the third prime minister of the Kim Dae-jung
government after Kim Jong-pil and Park Tae-joon from the ULD if
the South Korean parliament approves the nomination.
</P>
<P>
To maximize his political role, Lee is expected to push for an
early restoration of the broken relations between President Kim
and ULD founder Kim Jong-pil.
</P>
<P>
However, some ULD members are strongly opposed to restoring the
coalition.
</P>
<P>
ULD Vice President Kim Jong-ho said the designation of Lee as
prime minister is an issue different from the restoration of
relations between the two parties.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the major opposition Grand National Party (GNP) is
attacking the designation as a "plot to artificially reorganize
the political landscape."
</P>
<P>
If the coalition is successfully restored between the MDP with
119 parliament members and the ULD with 17, it can obtain a razor-
thin majority in the 273-member South Korean parliament.
</P>
<P>
The GNP, which now enjoys a parliamentary majority with 133
seats, has called for hearing on the nomination, warning that Lee'
s approval as prime minister is impossible without a hearing.
</P>
<P>
A new round of political struggle is feared to surface in the
new National Assembly, observers here said.

<HEADLINE> Kirsten Extends Contract with Leverkusen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, May 22 (Xinhua) -- German star striker Ulf Kirsten has
signed for an extra season at the German league Bayer Leverkusen.
</P>
<P>
"I'm 34 years old, so I'm not going to be making any big moves.
Leverkusen is my life," Kirsten told the Reuters.
</P>
<P>
Kirsten extended his old contract by a year until the end of
the 2001/2002 season.
</P>
<P>
Leverkusen blew their chances of winning the German league for
the first time in the club's history on Saturday when they lost to
lowly Unterhaching in the final game of the season, handing Bayern
Munich their 16th championship.
</P>
<P>
Kirsten, the league's second-top scorer with 17 goals, said he
still dreamed of following veteran libero Lothar Matthaeus across
the Atlantic to play U.S. major league soccer when his time was up
at Leverkusen.
</P>
<P>
"My American plans are not dead -- I will definitely play MLS
soccer for one season starting in 2002," Kirsten said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Filmmakers Prepare for WTO Entry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Chinese filmmakers have urged
that more efforts need be taken to enable their products to become
more competitive when the country joins the WTO.
</P>
<P>
They worry that the industry might be further eclipsed by
American blockbusters when China opens a bigger market to the
international movie world
</P>
<P>
"The job is imperative," said Wei Yuming, a leading filmmaker
with the Changchun Film Studio, the cradle of the country's movie
industry.
</P>
<P>
The studio shut down its special effects workshop in 1992 when
it ran out of money. There are only about 10 experienced special
effects technicians in the country, according to Wei.
</P>
<P>
The popularity of American movies such as "Titanic," "Twister"
and "Jurassic Park" can be largely attributed to computer-aided
special effects. All these films have been shown in China and
lured a huge number of Chinese viewers.
</P>
<P>
The restoration of a special effects workshop will cost at
least 10 million yuan (1.2 million U.S. dollars), a figure which
is beyond the means of China's sluggish movie industry, said Wei.
</P>
<P>
However, filmmakers say that they welcome China's entry into
the WTO because globalization is a general trend.
</P>
<P>
China's film authorities decided last month that the reform and
upgrading of film making technologies should be one of the ten
tasks the film industry will do in the near future.
</P>
<P>
A special effects department will also be established in the
Beijing Film College to train experts who will be able to thrive
in a competitive market.

<HEADLINE> Debt-to-Equity Swap Deals Help Beijing's State Enterprise Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Another 12 state-owned enterprises
in Beijing have signed debt-to-equity swap deals to get themselves
out of financial difficulties and improve their performance,
adding the total number such enterprises to 16.
</P>
<P>
A total of 16.62 billion yuan of debts have been converted into
share-holding rights owned by banks, accounting for about 94.5
percent of the total amount approved by the municipal economic and
trade commission for swap deals.
</P>
<P>
These swap deals have greatly deepen the reform of China's
state-owned enterprises, since the lessened debt burden allows
these companies in backbone industries to adjust their product mix
and realize better growth, according to a municipal official in
charge of local enterprise reform.
</P>
<P>
The debt-to-equity swap is adopted as a measure to revitalize
China's state-owned enterprises, the backbone of the national
economy. So far the country's four big commercial banks have all
set up asset management companies aimed at dealing with the
problem of bad debts from state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Under the swap program, after bad debts from enterprises are
converted into equity and state-owned enterprises begin to perform
better economically, asset management companies will either list
the enterprises concerned or have the enterprises buy the equity
back.

Guangdong will also construct a light rail that will link up
main cities in the Pearl River Delta, Hong Kong and Macao, while
continuing to build subways in Guangzhou and Shenzhen cities.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the province will build more airports and the
New Guangzhou International Airport. The construction of inland
river navigation routes will also be expanded.
</P>

<HEADLINE> China Should Concern Deflation: UN Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Deflation, rather than inflation,
should be China's principal policy concern, according to a United
Nations report released here today.
</P>
<P>
Consumer prices are estimated to have fallen by 1.4 percent in
1999 after a fall of 0.8 percent in 1998, said the report on the
Economic and Social Survey of Asia and the Pacific 2000 launched
by the UN Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific
(ESCAP).
</P>
<P>
In China deflation is a manifestation of weak consumer
confidence occasioned by business uncertainty and associated job
insecurity. Households have reacted to this by increasing savings,
the report noted.
</P>
<P>
Prices are expected to stop declining in 2000 with the increase
in oil and other commodity prices. Whether this counters the high
propensity to save of Chinese households remains to be seen, the
report noted.
</P>
<P>
The report said that consumer expenditure is still weak in
China, and the situation needs to change soon if fiscal deficits
are to become a sustainable burden.

<HEADLINE> Asia-Pacific Economy Growing Rapidly: UN Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 22 (Xinhua) -- The economy of developing nations
in Asia and the Pacific is expected to grow around six percent
this year, 0.5 percentage points more than the increase of last
year, according to a United Nations report released here today.
</P>
<P>
The world economy led by strong growth in the U.S., higher
growth in the European Union and tentative signs of recovery in
Japan is estimated to have grown by 2.6 percent in 1999, said the
report on the Economic and Social Survey of Asia and the Pacific
2000 launched by the UN Economic and Social Commission for Asia
and the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
Both developed and developing economies have performed better
than expected in 1999, the report said, adding that the economic
growth of Asia-Pacific developing countries represents a
remarkable turnaround from the virtually zero growth experienced
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Higher growth in Asia-Pacific developing countries was the
combined result of fiscal stimuli and buoyant exports. These two
factors were particularly evident in the crisis-hit economies of
the region. The growth has been achieved in an environment of
lower inflation.
</P>
<P>
This, in turn, led to enhanced business and household
confidence, higher stock markets, exchange rate stability and a
moderate recovery of external capital flows, according to the
report.

<P>
DALIAN, May 22 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government is stepping
up efforts to encourage privately-run enterprises in the east to
join in the nationwide campaign to develop the western part of the
country.
</P>
<P>
The State Economic and Trade Commission (SETC) is working on
how to provide better services for private businesses to join in
the effort, according to an SETC official, who was attending a
related meeting in Dalian.
</P>
<P>
Participants included some private entrepreneurs. They said
that the east and west should strengthen ties in making the most
of their respective technologies and resources.
</P>
<P>
The west presented more than 2,000 projects at the meeting,
which aroused attention of the east.
</P>
<P>
The private economy in China's western regions accounts for
about 10 percent of the economy, compared with some 50 percent in
the east. It therefore has great development potential.
</P>
<P>
The central government will provide more preferential policies
to develop the west and encourage more privately-run enterprises
to invest in the west.

<HEADLINE> HK Attaches Importance to Information Security: Officials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Information security is an
important issue to tackle if Hong Kong strives to nurture the
development of electronic commerce in the digital and globally
connected world, Deputy Secretary for Information Technology and
Broadcasting Alan Siu said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Siu was commenting on reports of virus attacks and hacking on
networked computer systems following the rapid growth in the use
of computers, Internet access and electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
He said that Hong Kong already had in place an effective
mechanism in handling information security-related incidents, such
as tackling computer virus within government, disseminating
relevant information to the public, educational and promotional
activities to enhance public's awareness of information security.
</P>
<P>
Director of Information Technology Services Lau Kam-hung also
said that the government has placed great emphasis on the security
of its computer network and in particular on the use of the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
The government has adopted a four-prong approach in tackling IT
intrusion in the government computer network, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Information Technology Services Department (ITSD) has
regularly issued guidelines and provided up-to-date information on
computer virus, he said, adding that government departments have
also been advised to install anti-virus software for protection of
personal computers and network.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the ITSD closely monitors information on computer
security made available by international and local organizations
to keep abreast of the trends of computer security attack and
solutions available against such attack, and organizes seminars on
IT security for the public to promote their awareness on
information security, he said.
</P>
<P>
The government supported the establishment of a CERT (computer
emergency response team) in Hong Kong to provide a centralized
contact on computer incidents reporting and responses to local
enterprises and Internet users in case of network security
incidents, Lau said.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 22 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government said
Monday the intelligence and law enforcement communities are
working hard to determine the perpetrators behind the bomb blast
that hit a shopping mall here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado said in a radio speech that
the police have orders from President Joseph Estrada to heighten
security measures to prevent a repeat of the incident, which
occurred at the SM Megamall Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
"The president ordered the Philippine National Police and Armed
Forces of the Philippines to heighten security measures," Mercado
said.
</P>
<P>
He also urged the public to practice vigilance on their part,
saying the perpetrators might strike even outside malls. "We all
have to be very security conscious," he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, national police head Panfilo Lacson said he is
taking a direct hand in the incident by having the Presidential
Anti-Organized Crime Task Force (PAOTF) participate in the
investigation of the mall blast.
</P>
<P>
Lacson said he ordered the PAOCTF to set aside its other
pending intelligence assignments and focus on the SM Megamall
bombing.
</P>
<P>
He said the bombing could have been the handiwork of the rebel
group of the New People's Army, adding that the Central Police
District of Manila is questioning eight suspects in the bombing
incident.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, SM Megamall, the biggest shopping center in the
country, tightened its security of incoming shoppers, resulting in

<HEADLINE> Tension Continues Between Ugandan, Rwandan Army in Congo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

KAMPALA, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Tension has remained high in
Kisangani, causing fears of a fresh outbreak of clashes between
Ugandan and Rwandan armies in the northeast city of the Democratic
Republic of the Congo (DRC), the New Vision daily reported here
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Uganda and Rwanda have agreed to demilitarize the city after
their troops clashed on May 5 and 8. They have also agreed to
withdraw their troops to a distance of 100 kilometers out of the
city and leave only companies of 200 soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the Rwanda-backed Goma rebels of the
Congolese Rally of Democracy (RCD) are also to withdraw. But
RCD-Goma's Military Commander Jean Pierre Ondekane said his forces
would not withdraw, according to the New Vision report.
</P>
<P>
"The agreement to demilitarize is null and void if the Goma
group does not pull out," Sula Semakula, Ugandan army commander in
Kisangani, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Uganda and Rwanda army chiefs said the situation in Kisangani
is unavoidably hostile, the report said.
</P>
<P>
It said James Baxter, chief of staff of the U.N. Observer
Mission in the DRC, attempted to bring Semakula and his Rwandan
counterpart to a round table, but he failed twice last week.
</P>
<P>
Bangoka International Airport, controlled by the Uganda
People's Defence Forces (UPDF), is being besieged by the Rwanda
Patriotic Army (RPA) who have dug-in along the southern and
eastern sides of the runway, said the report.
</P>
<P>
It added that the rival armies are separated only by a
100-meter runway.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Patrick Kiyingi, commander of UPDF's 9th
battalion, as saying that the situation is tense and fighting may
re-erupted anytime.
</P>
<P>
Uganda and Rwanda troops supported rival rebel groups to fight
against DRC President Laurent Kabila's government in a less than
two-year conflict which also drew Zimbabwean, Angolan and Namibian
forces on Kabila's side.

<P>
BEIJING, May 22 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese economy is expected to
grow 7.5 percent this year, and increases of 7.8 percent and 7.6
percent are forecast for 2001 and 2002, respectively, according to
a United Nations report released here today.
</P>
<P>
Inflations for 2000, 2001 and 2002 are estimated at zero, 1.1
and 2.3 percent, respectively, said the report on the Economic and
Social Survey of Asia and the Pacific 2000 launched by the UN
Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP).
</P>
<P>
China's gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 7.2 percent in
1999, marginally down on 7.8 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The country remains one of the fastest-growing economies both
in the ESCAP region and in the world as a whole, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The slippage in the growth rate in 1999 was the result partly
of domestic factors, such as weak consumer demand, and partly the
result of the crisis-induced reduction in foreign demand in the
region. The main stimulus to growth was provided by government
investment expenditure, the report noted.
</P>
<P>
China has weathered the effects of the economic crisis in Asia
rather well, according to the report.

BEIJING, May 22 (Xinhua) -- China remains the largest recipient

decline in 1999, a United Nations report said.
</P>

The policy of exchange rate stability followed by the Chinese

Exports were either flat or were tending to weaken in the first
half of 1999. After a series of measures taken by the State
Council, export momentum was regained in the second half of the
year with exports registering nearly seven percent growth in the
first 11 months of the year compared to the same period in 1998.
The balance of trade surplus rose significantly during the year.
</P>
<P>
The current account surplus, however, declined significantly
from 3.0 to 0.5 percent of the country's gross domestic product (
GDP), the report said.

BEIJING, May 22 (Xinhua) -- China has successfully solved some
of its financial problems, spurring healthy development of the
sector, according to a UN report.
</P>
<P>
The report on the Economic and Social Survey of Asia and the
Pacific 2000 was released here today by the United Nations
Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP).
</P>
<P>
Although there is a significant problem of non-performing loans
in China, the institution of reforms of the State-owned
enterprises (SOEs) and setting up of asset management companies
for major State banks have prevented the severe credit crunch
experienced by a number of other economies in the Asia-Pacific
region, the report said, adding that low interest rates have
assisted in the process.
</P>
<P>
Given the relatively low ratio of public debt to gross domestic
product (GDP), resolution of the non-performing loan problem and
recapitalization of State-owned banks should not pose a major
fiscal burden, the report noted.
</P>
<P>
Supervision and regulation of the financial sector has been
considerably tightened during the last two or three years.
</P>
<P>
However, durable solution of the non-performing loan problem
affecting banks is not possible without reform of the SOEs, the
report pointed out.
</P>
<P>
A total of seven Chinese financial institutions have become
members of the Institute of International Finance (IIF), including
Bank of China, Bank of Communications, China Construction Bank,
China Development Bank, China Everbright Holdings Co., Ltd., China
Merchants Bank and China Minsheng Banking Corporation.

<HEADLINE> China Curbs Desertification for Beijing's Safety (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 22 (Xinhua) -- An emergency anti-desertification
program has been launched in Inner Mongolia to ensure ecological
safety of China's capital of Beijing and the nearby port city
Tianjin.
</P>
<P>
Twelve major duststorms have swept North China this year,
including Beijing and Tianjin.
</P>
<P>
The emergency program covers three deserts, one of which is
just 180 kilometers away from Beijing, and moving toward the
capital at an annual pace of 1.8 kilometers.
</P>
<P>
China is one of the countries most seriously affected by desert
expansion. Its deserts currently cover 2.62 million square
kilometers or 27 percent of its territory, mainly located in China
's northern areas.
</P>
<P>
Sandstorms this year have alarmed the central authorities.
</P>
<P>
During a recent inspection tour to Hebei Province and Inner
Mongolia, Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji called for immediate and
efficient efforts to combat serious desertification in the country
and to build greenbelts to improve the environment.
</P>
<P>
He called on governments at all levels and the masses to act
immediately to work for a better environment for the benefit of
China and its younger generations.
</P>
<P>
Over-grazing by cattle and sheep is also a major cause of
desertification in China's northern and western regions, he noted,
and urged efficient protection and supervision of the grasslands.

<P>
Zhu also pledged that the central government increase financial
support to Hebei and Inner Mongolia for their efforts to combat
water and soil erosion as well as financial aid for new forests.
</P>
<P>
Related government departments are also taking steps to tackle
desertification.
</P>
<P>
According to the State Forestry Administration, China could
curb desertification as early as 2010. By 2050, authorities "may
be able to bring all of China's deserts under control in a bid to
ensure harmonious development of China's economy, society and
environment."
</P>
<P>
If these measures are successful, the area covered by deserts
would no longer expand 2,460 square kilometers per year in China,
as it is happening now, officials said.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Science and Technology and the Ministry of
Agriculture have also worked out plans to prevent desert expansion
and grass planting.
</P>
<P>
In the past fifty years, the Chinese government has never given
up its battle against desertification. Three sand-shield belts
were built in northern Beijing, and programs to curb soil erosion
have been launched across the country.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that 12 percent of deserts have been reclaimed,
and 11 million hectares of deteriorated grassland was protected or
recovered over the last five decades in China.
</P>
<P>
However, the recovery rate is still behind increasing
desertification in the country. "We still need to work much harder
in this respect," experts claim.

<TEXT>
<P>

Cooperation Award to the late Japanese agronomist, Shouyichi

</P>
<P>

several major Sino-Japanese cooperative programs and made
outstanding contributions to China's agricultural growth and
promotion of Sino-Japanese friendship.
</P>
<P>
An official with the Ministry of Agriculture said with the help
of the Japanese expert, China began to apply the use the plastic
sheeting in growing vegetables in 1979 and then to growing other
crops in 30 provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions.
</P>
<P>
Shouyichi Yishimoto, who was born in January, 1925, learnt of
the award news in the hospital.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said China will promote international scientific
cooperation with foreign countries in the new century.

Technological Cooperation Award is conferred annually to up to
four foreign scientists, engineers, government officials or
organizations for their outstanding achievements for promoting
bilateral or multi-lateral scientific cooperation and development.

<HEADLINE> NZ Central Bank Not to Take Sides in Currency Union Debate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, May 22 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand Reserve Bank
Governor Don Brash said Monday in Auckland that as New Zealand's
central bank, his bank would not be taking sides in the debate
about whether New Zealand should join a currency union with
Australia or the United States.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the Auckland Rotary Club, Brash said: "Entering a
currency union is a major foreign policy decision, and thus a
matter for elected politicians. It is not a matter on which a
central banker should express an overall opinion," according to a
press release issued here by the Reserve Bank.
</P>
<P>
He told the gathering that: "Currency union is not a magic path
to substantially faster New Zealand growth. It is no substitute
for domestic policies that promote stronger productivity growth.
It is not an issue which should be decided in haste. And it is not
an issue on which the Reserve Bank will be taking sides."
</P>
<P>
For the past year and more, there has been a debate among New
Zealand politicians, economists and traders about a currency union
with Australia or the United States. But the New Zealand
government either with the National Party or the Labor Party as
its ruling party has repeatedly made it clear that the issue is
not on its agenda.

<HEADLINE> Gas Reserves Ready for West-east Pipe-Line Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, May 22 (Xinhua)-- Natural gas reserves have been
verified for the first phase of the ambitious west-east pipe-line
project, part of China's strategy to develop its vast western
areas.
</P>
<P>
The Tarim Oil Field Corp. and the Northwest Petroleum
Administration of the China Petrochemical Group have proven 532.9
billion cubic meters of natural gas reserves in the Tarim Basin of
the northwestern Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, a prerequisite
for the project.
</P>
<P>
The 4,167-kilometer pipe-line is designed to supply 12 billion
cubic meters of natural gas annually to Shanghai for 30 years,
said Jia Chengzao deputy manager of the Tarim Oil Field Corp.
</P>
<P>
His company has found nine gas fields in the basin, five of
which are large-scale ones with the largest having 250.6 billion
cubic meters of natural gas, Jia said, adding that the Oil Field
plans to drill another 12 wildcat gas wells by the end of 2001.
</P>
<P>
Construction of the pipe line, which starts from Xinjiang,
running through Shaanxi, Gansu, Shanxi, Henan, Anhui and Jiangsu
provinces, and Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region to Shanghai, will
begin from April next year and is scheduled to be completed within
three years, with a total investment of 38.4 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The Yangtze River Delta areas, the major user of the natural
gas, are working on how to make the best use of the gas. Shanghai,
for example, has begun to reconstruct and expand its gas pipe-line
networks for the coming gas.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Both malnutrition and overweight
are among the problems facing young students in China, according
to health specialists.
</P>
<P>
Although general nutrition conditions of Chinese students have
greatly improved over the past decades, 34.7 percent of boys and
43.8 percent of girls still suffer from malnutrition in varying
degrees, and nearly 32.9 percent of boys and 38.8 percent of girls
are underweight, according to the specialists quoted in today's "
People's Daily".
</P>
<P>
Lack of calcium, Vitamin A and riboflavin, and iron-deficiency
anemia are very common among the children.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, more and more kids are eating a lot more unhealthy
food. Overweight and obesity among urban boys has surpassed 12
percent, the report said, warning that many of them have a high
risk of suffering from cardio-vascular diseases and diabetes.
</P>
<P>
Lacking awareness and knowledge about a balanced nutrition and
food shortages in some poor areas have been blamed as major causes
of the current situation by the specialists.
</P>
<P>
They suggested the students at least have a nutritional lunch
every day.

<P>
BEIJING, May 22 (Xinhua) -- China has set up 73 nature reserves
off its coast in the past several decades to protect marine

The reserves, covering 140,000 ha, are located off the coast
of the island province of Hainan in the tropical south to Liaoning
Province in the northeast.
</P>
<P>
"Excess fishing, environmental pollution, the introduction of
foreign species and other factors have put China's marine
diversity under serious threat," the director said. "Nearly half
of the coastal wetland are lost and 80 percent of the coral reefs
are damaged to varying degrees", he added.
</P>
<P>
About 660,000 ha of intertidal zones or wetlands have been
turned into farming land or other uses in massive development
project in the past four decades, Wang said.

Gyan Acharya, the joint secretary of the Foreign Ministry, told
Xinhua that during Mansingh's visit here, Prime Minister Girija
Koirala, Foreign Minister Chakra Bastola and Foreign Secretary

including issues of security concerns and bilateral economic
relationship.
</P>
<P>
He said discussions were also held on matters relating to
cooperation projects, border issues, law and order issues, and
exchange of high level visits between the two countries in the

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Gov't to Aid Frozen Food Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 22 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government decided to
waive 80 percent interest on the bank loans of the frozen food
factories affected by the 1997 EU ban and 1998 devastating floods
to energize this potential export sector, The Financial Express
reported here Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to the decision, the owners of the factories affected
by the adversities during the two years while remaining in
operation will pay 20 percent of the interest for those two years,
while the government and concerned banks will bear the rest in
equal shares.
</P>
<P>
The decision was taken Sunday at a high-level meeting on
resolving the problems faced by the frozen food export sector,
which was presided by Finance Minister Shah A.M.S. Kibria.
</P>
<P>
A meeting source said with the partial exemption the owners are
expected to get relief from liabilities worth nearly 900 million
taka(17 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Nearly 55 frozen food factories were affected by the import ban
slapped by the European Union in 1997 and the devastating floods
in 1998. Most of them were also overburdened by damage in the 1991
cyclone.
</P>
<P>
"The frozen food export sector is making important contribution
to the country's economy," said the finance minister while
addressing the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Stressing the need for boosting export of frozen foods, Kibria
assured all possible assistance for the foreign exchange-earning
sector, which fetches around 3 billion taka (58 million dollars)
annually in export earnings.

<P>
YANGON, May 22 (Xinhua) -- The Myanmar authorities recently
nabbed an Indonesian for illegally carrying out overseas
communications work by installing a satellite dish and using
sophisticated communications systems.
</P>
<P>
Irawan Sidaria was caught with 15 communication devices
including the United-States-made satellite dish installed and used
at the Asia Plaza Hotel, a private-run hotel in downtown Yangon.
</P>
<P>
Irawan, who arrived in Myanmar in April, hired a room at the
hotel under the pretext of opening a company office to conduct the
activities, the authorities charged.
</P>
<P>
The satellite dish was installed in such a way that it directed
towards a Thai communication satellite named Inmarse over the
Indian Ocean without using the communication link of state-run
Myanma Posts and Telecommunications, the sole agent operating
communication services in Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
A Filipino and an American were also involved in the activities,
the report added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the authorities also warned that action will be
taken against illegal local and overseas communications by use of
satellite communications equipment.

<P>
On Saturday and Sunday GAM rebels engaged in gun battles with
police forces in the town of Jantho in the Aceh Besar regency, 60
kilometers east of the provincial capital of Banda Aceh, killing a
policeman.
</P>
<P>
Gunfights between troops and rebels were also reported in the
Selimun area of Jantho on Sunday, but no immediate casualties were
reported.
</P>
<P>
Separatist rebels on Sunday claimed responsibility for the
death of the policeman saying that it was a retaliatory attack
over the deaths of eight people killed in a clash on May 18.
</P>
<P>
On May 18, eight alleged rebels were found dead following an
overnight armed clash with police in the North Aceh village of
Hagu Barat Laut, some two kilometers west of the regency's main
town of Lhokseumawe.
</P>
<P>
"That was just a warning over the violation of the peace
agreement," Ayah Muni, a GAM spokesman in Aceh Besar, was quoted
by the Jakarta Post as saying.
</P>
<P>
The three-month accord is not due to come into force until June
2.
</P>
<P>
Rebels in Aceh, a province with special autonomous status in
northwestern Sumatera, have been fighting for 25 years for
independence, a greater share of oil profits, and the right to
impose Islamic religious laws.
</P>
<P>
So far at least 399 people have died this year, of which 30 are
soldiers or policemen.

<HEADLINE> Fiji Coup Leader Claims He May "Retire" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Fiji coup leader George Speight
said Monday he will "retire" if the country's tribal chiefs do not
support his attempt to seize power.
</P>
<P>
Fiji's Great Council of Chiefs is due to meet on Tuesday to
discuss Speight's attempted coup in which he took Prime Minister
Mahendry Chaudhry and some of his cabinet hostages last Friday.
</P>
<P>
"If the chiefs requested 'George retire', I'd retire," he told
journalists.
</P>
<P>
Speight's comments may signal the first weakening of his
resolve to take control of the country and mean he could be
considering a way out of the situation.
</P>
<P>
Speight's chances of success retreated further on Monday when
an indigenous Fijian leader refused to join his coup attempt.
</P>
<P>
Apisai Tora, leader of the Taukei Movement, said he sympathized
with Speight's cause but did not approve of his methods, the
fijilive website reported.
</P>
<P>
Tora is a fierce proponent of the indigenous cause and he
revived the Taukei Movement in April with the aim of ousting the
Indian-dominated Chaudhry Government.
</P>
<P>
Tora also said the Taukei Movement had nothing to do with
Speight's attempt to topple the government.
</P>
<P>
He said he had his own more logical plan to achieve change.

<HEADLINE> Lee Han-dong Named S. Korean Prime Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, May 22 (Xinhua) -- South Korean President Kim Dae-jung
on Monday morning nominated Lee Han-dong, leader of a minor
opposition, as the new prime minister to succeed Park Tai-jung who
resigned last weekend over a tax evasion scandal.
</P>
<P>
The nomination, which was announced by Presidential Chief of
Staff Han Kwang-ok, is subject to approval by the National
Assembly.
</P>
<P>
The house is expected to approve the nomination after the
incoming 16th National Assembly leadership and floor groups are
formed in early June.
</P>
<P>
Lee, the 66-year-old leader of the United Liberal Democrats (
ULD), is a six-term lawmaker who started his political career with
the now-defunct Democratic Justice Party (DJP) established by then
President Chun Du-hwan.
</P>
<P>
A graduate of the law school of Seoul National University, Lee
worked as judge, prosecutor and lawyer before joining the DJP as a
founding member in 1981.
</P>
<P>
Lee served as secretary general, chief policy-maker and floor
leader of the DJP, minister of home affairs, floor leader of the
Democratic Liberal Party, National Assembly vice speaker, chairman
of the Grand National Party (GNP) before he assumed the ULD
presidency.
</P>
<P>
He lost to Lee Hoi-chang in the competition for the GNP
candidacy for the 1997 presidential election and the party
presidency in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Lee quit from the GNP last January to join the ULD, the former
coalition partner of Kim Dae-jung's ruling Millennium Democratic
Party.
</P>
<P>
Observers say Lee Han-dong has no "enemies" in political
circles because of his open-mindedness and love for drinking and
mingling.

<HEADLINE> Situation Still Tense in Ambon, Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
According to reports reaching here Monday, explosions of hand-
made bombs and grenades were still heard on Sunday night, breaking
the silence at nights in the Ahuru Karang Panjang area and other
areas prone to conflicts.
</P>
<P>
Streets in the Mardika and Batu Merah areas were still blocked
with barbed wire, rocks and logs, causing traffic to move slowly.
Some youths armed with sharp and pointed weapons guarded their
neighborhood anticipating intrusions by certain groups aiming at
disturbing peace.
</P>
<P>
Commander of the Pattimura Military Command overseeing Maluku
Brig. Gen. Max Tamaela has extended the curfew from 21:00 to 05:00
a.m.
</P>
<P>
He said 200 troops reinforcements from Sriwijaya's 141 Infantry
Battalion arrived in Ambon on Sunday noon by Hercules military
transport airplane from Palembang, South Sumatera.
</P>
<P>
"We warn the warring camps not to attack each other. Leave the
mobs or groups of rioters to us. If they want to help, they may
guard their own neighborhoods. All groups, including Laskar Jihad
(Jihad Force), could face the wrath of the troops if they do not
stop the fighting," he was quoted by the Jakarta Post as saying.
</P>
<P>
Authorities have said there are strong indications that the
Laskar Jihad, who have sneaked an estimated 2,200 volunteers into
Ambon, are behind the latest wave of violence.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, at least 16 Dutch and French people have asked
Maluku Governor Saleh Latuconsina and Tamaela to help evacuate
them from Ambon, about 2,500 kilometers northeast of Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
Most of them are representatives of nongovernmental
organizations which have helped the local administration in
distributing humanitarian aid and building health facilities for
the refugees.
</P>
<P>
"We do not like it, but we understand their wish, especially in
view of the security condition here (Ambon). But they promise to
return once the situation gets better," Latuconsina was quoted by
the Antara News Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
Maluku has witnessed a year-long ethnic bloodshed between
Christians and Muslims, which has claimed more than 1,300 civilian
lives. Clashes have subsided in recent months but tension remains
in some areas.
</P>
<P>
Last week's violence is the first major eruption of violence in
Ambon this month. On April 30 six people were killed and more than
10 others injured near Ambon's port and at least 40 houses were
razed.

The rains, which began on last Tuesday, had swollen the Benenai
River which broke its banks the following day, swamping most of
the Central Malaka and West Malaka subdistricts.
</P>
<P>
The floods have left at least 35,000 people homeless, many of

percent of the houses in the southeastern areas of West Timor have
been destroyed and a further 25 percent damaged.
</P>
<P>
The floods are the worst reported in East Nusa Tenggara in 22
years. According to UNHCR, while there have been no confirmed
cases of cholera, the threat of malaria in flooded areas is
greater.
</P>
<P>
More than 10,000 hectares of land has been destroyed by the
floods in West Timor, the UNHCR spokesman in West Timor Jake
Morland was quoted by the Indonesian Observer as saying.
</P>
<P>
There are 25 international aid organizations in West Timor
working with the Indonesian government, military and police.
</P>
<P>
In East Timor, six days of flooding may have also spoiled the
country's multimillion-U.S.-dollar coffee harvest.

UNHCR said Suai and Los Palos district in southwestern of East
Timor remain isolated. However, access to Viqueque was restored on

<P>
WASHINGTON, May 21 (Xinhua) -- For the fourth straight year,
the New York Knicks beat the Miami Heat 83-82 to win the Eastern
Conference Semi-finals on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
As they have over the past four post-seasons, New York and
Miami scratched and clawed for the slightest advantage.
</P>
<P>
Four of the seven games went down to the final possession and
the teams were separated by only six points.
</P>
<P>
The Knicks will face the top-seeded Indiana Pacers on Tuesday
in a rematch of last year's conference finals, won by New York in
six games.
</P>
<P>
Patrick Ewing had 20 points and 10 rebounds for the Knicks, who
had a 10-3 run over the last four minutes. Ewing scored the game's

final points on a dunk with 1:20 to go and New York did not take
another shot.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the Heat lost to the Knicks on a miraculous shot by
Allan Houston. This year, they can blame only themselves. They
blew an 18-point lead in Game Six and an 11-point edge Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In the fourth quarter, they missed their first five free throws
and made just one basket in the final 4:45, squandering a 79-73

<HEADLINE> China, Indonesia and Denmark Three-Horse Run in Thomas/Uber Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, May 22 (Xinhua) -- With Indonesia and China made
successful runs to reign the trophies of the Thomas and Uber Cup
Final respectively, and Denmark storming into the semi-finals on
both lines, the world badminton team championships presented a
three-horse dance in the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia ended up China's doubles hopes by winning the Thomas
Cup for men for the fourth time in straight, hammering China 3-0
in Sunday's final, while China's overwhelming women's team
pocketed the Uber Cup title at will on the same score over Denmark.
</P>
<P>
It is also a tremendous triumph for the Danes, who carried on
the massive hopes from Europe to occupy among the elite of the
sport, as the European champions made the Thomas Cup semi-final
and a historical Uber Cup final.
</P>
<P>
Tagged as the most all-round squad in the most close matchups
of the past decade in the Thomas Cup, Indonesia outlasted a horde
of title-contenders like China, Denmark, South Korea and the hosts
Malaysia, to replay their four-time winning streak in the 70s.
</P>
<P>
Facing biggest-ever challenge from China in 90s, the 12-time
champions Indonesia had the sky opened up when world number two
shuttler Hendrawan surprised Chinese Xia Xuanze in the first game
in the final, before cruising to an unexpected 3-0 thrash on
Sunday at the Putra Stadium here.
</P>
<P>
"Our players had a great personal-improvements during the
tournament," said Indonesian coach Sumaryono Hadi Nasri. "They
played better after each game, and I knew they would give out
their bests in the final."
</P>
<P>
China were expected to take at least one singles before
surrendered the trophy, which parred them for 10 years after they
picked up a double in 1990, but the Chinese youngsters failed to
transmit their debuts into a memorial victory.
</P>
<P>
Chinese coach Li Yongbo said: "Indonesia are a better team than
us in experiences, and I'm satisfied that my team has made the
first final since 1990."
</P>
<P>
But the Chinese women team proved they were unmatchable and
could be of a class of their own for at least next one or two
versions of the Uber Cup. The conqueresses ran an unbeaten record
by winning 21 games straightly and surrendered just one set in the
competition, with the final serving only as a display of their
unquestionable domination.
</P>
<P>
During the span from 1984-1992, China won five Uber Cup title
in row, and they are expected to reinstate the crown for the
decade.
</P>
<P>
"China will keep their domination in the next ten years," said
Danish coach Kenneth Larsen after Saturday's lop-sided loss. "They
are at the higher level than the others." Larsen said their
campaigns for the next Uber Cup was to dwindle the gap to the
Chinese as much as possible.
</P>
<P>
However, he could not be more happier as the Danes executed the
European pride into the premier badminton competition, which was
conquered by the Asians since it set off. Though still seeking for
the first victory in the Cups for Europe, Denmark delivered their
voices to be in the first class of the biannual event.
</P>
<P>
"It's a big success for the Danish badminton to make both semi-
finals in the tournament," Larsen said. With the best hope for
both the Europeans and the Asians, there are another two years for
them to continue their continental rivalry.

<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Some blunderbusses made in the 14th
century were recently discovered in Nanjing, capital of east China
's coastal province Jiangsu.
</P>
<P>
The firearms, unearthed in a construction site near the
Tongjimen area of Nanjing, were made in 1373, according to the
markings on them.
</P>
<P>
The blunderbusses are 45 cm in length, and with the bores
taking two thirds of the length, the firearms could have stronger
shooting capacity than others of the same kind.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that the well-crafted weapons represent the highest
level of firearm-making technology at that time in China.
</P>
<P>
Nanjing then was the capital and the economic and technological
center of the country.

<HEADLINE> 20,000-year-old Mammoth Fossil Unearthed in Northeast China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Archaeologists here say that the
recently-discovered tooth fossil of a 20,000-year-old woolly
mammoth in Anshan, in northeast China's Liaoning province, is a
priceless addition to scientific research of the species.
</P>
<P>
The woolly mammoth was a huge, prehistoric mammal which once
lived in northeast China and became extinct about 10,000 years ago,
said Zhu Mingye, head of the Museum of Anshan. The tooth fossil
was from a mammoth which evidently drowned in a marsh.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that it is the first find of a mammoth tooth in
the area, although other fossilized remains of mammals have been
unearthed before.
</P>
<P>
Archaeologists believe that other parts of the mammoth are
buried in the vicinity of the tooth, and if they can retrieve at
least one third of the bones they can reconstruct the mammoth's
skeleton.
</P>
<P>
Study of the tooth fossil will also help research of climate
during the prehistoric times and the evolution of elephant,
according to the experts.

Strengthening Party Building Comprehensively," calls for
strengthening of the Communist Party of China (CPC) in line with
President Jiang Zemin's recent remarks about Party building.
</P>
<P>
The editorial says that Jiang's comments that the CPC
represents advanced productivity, an advanced culture and the
fundamental interests of the people in China have both immediate
and long-term significance.
</P>
<P>
-- Chinese President Jiang Zemin met on Sunday with senior
Chinese army officers attending a conference on the political work
at the military academies and universities.
</P>
<P>
The conference was designed to carry out Jiang Zemin's series

improving the political work at the academies and universities,
under the guidance of Deng Xiaoping Theory.

<HEADLINE> China Plans to Limit Desert Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 22 (Xinhua) -- China's State Forestry
Administration has crafted a plan that it hopes will limit
desertification, which is one of China's most serious problems,
today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
The plan, if successful, would mean that the deserts would no
longer expand 2,460 square kilometers a year, as happens now.
</P>
<P>
China's deserts currently cover 2.62 million square kilometers
or 27 percent of its total territory.
</P>
<P>
Desertification could be curbed as early as 2010 or perhaps
within 30 years, Forestry Deputy Director Li Yucai said at a
recent seminar.
</P>
<P>
By 2050, authorities "may be able to bring all of China's
desert land into control in a bid to ensure harmonious development
of China's economy, society and environment," Li said.
</P>
<P>
While the plan focuses on 14 provinces, autonomous regions and
major cities, its priority targets the areas surrounding China's
eight largest deserts, four other major deserts and the areas
along the Yellow River.
</P>
<P>
To limit further desertification, plants will be protected in
oases and desert fringe areas, water-efficient irrigation will be
introduced in oases and sand-shield belts will be constructed
along major transportation lines and key towns.
</P>
<P>
The plan has been submitted to the State Council for approval.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics indicate that land deterioration, including
desertification, has caused production losses on more than 153,000
hectares of farmlands and 100 million hectares of grasslands.
</P>
<P>
Since early spring, 12 sandstorm have swept through much of
northern and northwestern China.

<HEADLINE> Clark Rules out N. Zealand Military Role in Fiji </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, May 22 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand Prime Minister Helen
Clark has ruled out the country's military intervention in Fiji,
saying it could inflame the crisis and put the hostages' lives at
risk.
</P>
<P>
The Dominion Monday quoted the prime minister as saying: "We
have a hostage drama where any ill-advised action could trigger
off disastrous consequences for the people we want to help."
</P>
<P>
"If there are negotiation skills in New Zealand that could be
used, that would be the most useful right now," she was quoted as
saying by the Wellington-based newspaper.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, hundreds of Fiji Indians marched in Auckland, the
biggest city in New Zealand, calling for New Zealand to take
action to free Fiji's Prime Minister Mahendra Chaudhry.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Helen Clark said her country can provide police
negotiators to help with the freeing of hostages if asked by Fiji.
</P>
<P>
She said the best thing New Zealand can do is hang in solidly
behind Fiji's President Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara, the army and the
police, and "back every effort they make to bring it to an end
through negotiation".
</P>
<P>
Clark said New Zealand Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade
Phil Goff has been in close liaison with the Australian and
British governments and other Pacific leaders, "so we're working
very hard in coordinating a response".

<HEADLINE> China Approves Loan of Giant Pandas to U.S. National Zoo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Ambassador to the United
States Li Zhaoxing announced here Sunday that China has approved
to loan two giant pandas to the U.S. National Zoo located in
Washington D.C.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has given its approval to a cooperative
project between the Chinese Wildlife Conservation Association (
CWCA) and the United States Smithsonian Institution National
Zoological Park (NZP) concerning giant panda conservation and
research, Li said.
</P>
<P>
According to the letter of intent signed on April 7 this year,
the CWCA will loan to the U.S. National Zoo one male and one
female captive-born pre-productive giant pandas for study,
breeding and exhibition at the National Zoo.
</P>
<P>
The two sides are firmly committed to the survival of giant
pandas and their habitats through habitat protection, scientific
research, public education, captive breeding, professional
training and other conservation biology measures.
</P>
<P>
As a gesture of friendship for the American people, the Chinese
government gave the U.S. National Zoo a gift of two giant pandas,
Xingxing and Lingling, in 1972.
</P>
<P>
"Their presence went a long way towards fostering and
heightening a public awareness of wildlife conservation," Li said.
</P>
<P>
Li said himself and the Embassy as a whole were saddened by
Xingxing's death last year and have since worked energetically to
make the CWCA-NZP project a success.
</P>
<P>
Right now, there are around 1,000 giant pandas around the world,
122 of which are captive-born, including five inside the United
States.
</P>
<P>
"The Embassy is convinced that the Chinese government's
approval of the project will strengthen the cause of giant panda
protection," Li said.

PARIS, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Hungarian swimmer Agnes Kovacs broke
a European women's 50 meters breaststroke record of 31.34 seconds
in the Mare Nostrum swimming meeting in Monaco on Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Internet Gaining Popularity at Chinese Universities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Of China's 8.9 million Internet
users, some 1.57 million are college students, accounting for
nearly 35 percent of the country's college student population,
statistics with the China Internet Network Information Center (
CINIC) show.
</P>
<P>
A senior at Tianjin University surnamed Meng surfed Internet
websites to find his first job, saying he preferred it to the old-
fashioned way of pounding the pavement.
</P>
<P>
Most of his roommates are frequent net users, and together they
bought a computer to search for useful data, hunt for jobs, read
news, or hang out in chat rooms, Meng said.
</P>
<P>
CINIC officials said that general information websites, e-mail,
and bulletin boards are the most popular Internet destinations for
college students. And intranet systems at universities such as
Nankai and Qinghua have enabled the students to check the latest
research findings in their fields and attend online classes
offered by other departments.
</P>
<P>
Internet browsing has become a daily part of life for most
college kids, and campus intranet development is a necessity for
all the colleges in the information technology (IT) era, said Li
Wenzhen, who oversees Internet systems at Nankai University.
</P>
<P>
He said that high on-line charges and limited equipment in
Chinese colleges have held back the wider spread of Internet use
in colleges.
</P>
<P>
A CINIC survey shows that 530 colleges, research institutes,
and middle and primary schools have launched their own websites
since China entered the dot-com world in 1994.

<HEADLINE> Imports of Chocolates Surge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
From January through April, Shanghai imported 373.5 tons of
retail packaged chocolate worth 2.53 million US dollars, or 6.4
times and 17.1 times the figures for the corresponding period last
year, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Most of the chocolates came from the United States and Germany,
Shanghai customs officers said.
</P>
<P>
The imports during the first four months exceeded those for the
whole year of 1999.
</P>
<P>
This suggests that the consumption level of Chinese has risen
and their demand for between-meal snacks has increased, analysts
said.
</P>
<P>
Compared with Chinese-made chocolates, foreign chocolates come
in a range of flavors and quality, and are neatly packaged.
</P>
<P>
Chinese chocolates seem only to have the advantage of a lower
price tag.

<HEADLINE> 80 Percent Students Abroad Say They Will Return to China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 22 (Xinhua) -- The latest official survey shows
that 80 percent of Chinese students now studying abroad will
return to their homeland to start a career.
</P>
<P>
China has send some 300,000 students abroad in the past two
decades, one third of them have come back. And a rising number of
students abroad have chosen to return to China in the past few
years, according to the survey.
</P>
<P>
"One reason is because of the economic achievements and growing
opportunities in China, and another is because China is paying
more attention to the role played by those returned students,"
said Yue Qianming, a returned student and vice president of the
Anbo Group Company.
</P>
<P>
Yue said his business volume grew seven times in the past six
months, and he sees a vibrant market awaiting entrepreneurs in
China. After hearing his story, many of his classmates abroad also
decided to come home to work.
</P>
<P>
Like Yue, many returned students are now making economic
miracles in China with the knowledge they learned overseas.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Chaoyang, founder of the famous website sohu.com, is in
that category. In the past two years, his company has become one
of the country's best-known success stories.
</P>
<P>
In Beijing, the government has set up a special zone for
returned students to start their new careers.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing municipal government offered a lot of preferential
policies for the returned students, including the reduction or
exemption of taxation of their firms within a certain period and a
special fund for them to set up projects.

<HEADLINE> China Develops Glass Harder Than Steel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, May 22 (Xinhua) -- A type of glass which is
harder than manganin and more rust-resistant than stainless steel
has passed technical examination and gone into trial production in
north China's Hebei Province.
</P>
<P>
The product, named minicrystal glass plate, looks like black
marble but has a shinier surface.
</P>
<P>
Analysis shows that the glass is eight times harder than
manganin, and its rust-resistance is 15 to 20 times better than
that of stainless steel.
</P>
<P>
Such glass can be used anywhere because it is not radioactive,
according to the Hebei Provincial Bureau for Environmental
Protection.
</P>
<P>
U.S. scientists experimented with manufacturing such glass in
the 1960s, but scored no technical breakthroughs.
</P>
<P>
Jingniu Glass Group Company, based in the province's Xingtai
City, spent tens of millions of yuan to develop the product over
an eight-year period. The company used industrial residue to
produce such glass by the method of continuous rolling.
</P>
<P>
Technicians said that the product can be widely used in
interior decoration, manufacturing man-made satellites and space
shuttles, and in the industries of coal, metallurgy, machinery,
electric power and building materials.

LONDON, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Scotland soccer team manager Craig
Brown has turned down the chance to take Hong Kong to the next
World Cup.
</P>
<P>
Brown is under contract until the end of the 2002 World Cup
qualifying campaign and insists he will honour that agreement
unless SFA chief executive David Taylor decides to let him go
before then.
</P>
<P>
"I was offered the Hong Kong job," Brown said. "They phoned me
and said that they were looking for a national coach to get them
to the World Cup."
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong isn't the worst job in the game because with the
World Cup being held in Asia they are very keen to get there and
feel that they have a chance of qualifying. I spoke to them but I
will honour my contract here, but if I get a couple of bad results
I might be told otherwise," he added.

<HEADLINE> Nets Wins NBA Draft Lottery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 21 (Xinhua) -- The New Jersey Nets won the
National Basketball Association draft lottery on Sunday, earning
the right to make the No. 1 overall pick next month.
</P>
<P>
The Nets, who fired coach Don Casey after missing the playoffs
with a 31-51 record and then had president Michael Rowe resign,
had only a 4.4 percent chance of winning the ping-pong ball
lottery.
</P>
<P>
But unlike their injury plagued season, they got lucky.
</P>
<P>
The entire lottery was somewhat of an upset as Vancouver jumped
to second in the selection order.
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Clippers, who had the worst record in the
league at 15-67, got the third pick.
</P>
<P>
Chicago, which won the lottery last year, also slipped despite
having the second worst record (17-65) in the league. They will
draft fourth and be followed by Orlando, which will have three
picks in the draft - fifth, 10th and 13th.
</P>
<P>
Atlanta will pick sixth and will be followed by Chicago - using
a pick it got from Washington, Cleveland, Houston, Orlando, Boston,
Dallas and Orlando.
</P>
<P>
This will be the second time the Nets will have the No. 1 pick.
They had it in 1990 and took Derrick Coleman, currently with the
Charlotte Hornets.

<HEADLINE> UK Set for Tyson vs Lewis Bout  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Reigning world heavyweight champion
Lennox Lewis could take on Mike Tyson in Britain before the end of
the year, boxing promoter Frank Warren disclosed on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Warren told the news on BBC Radio 5 Live as he prepares to take
Tyson to Scotland for next month's controversial clash with Lou
Savarese.
</P>
<P>
Lewis defends his crown against Francois Botha in July, but
Warren admits that the prospect of a meeting with the man who once
took the heavyweight division by storm is a distinct possibility.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the bout could go ahead in the UK, Warren said:"
One of the problems is that both boxers are tied up with different
American TV companies, but if that could be overcome I think that
would be great."
</P>
<P>
"I think there's a chance - but I also think that Francois
Botha is going to give Lewis a shock," he added.
</P>
<P>
Warren's comments came as he defended the decision by British
Home Secretary Jack Straw to allow Tyson back into Britain for his
fight at Hampden Park on June 24.
</P>
<P>
Protesters argue that the convicted rapist should not be
granted a visa despite a trouble-free visit for his last bout in
Manchester.

<HEADLINE> Chelsea Fans Celebrate FA Cup Victory  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of fans braved the rain to
line the streets of west London as jubilant Chelsea paraded the FA
Cup on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
A goal from Roberto di Matteo at Wembley Saturday afternoon was
enough to overcome Aston Villa and spark a night of celebration in
the blue corner of the capital.
</P>
<P>
The party continued at lunchtime when the squad arrived back in
Fulham, close to their Stamford Bridge home.
</P>
<P>
Players and management took an open-topped bus from Fulham Road
to Fulham Town Hall, where they were guests at a civic reception.
</P>
<P>
Captain Dennis Wise was in good form, smiling broadly and
signing loudly as they made their way along the streets at a snail
's pace.
</P>
<P>
Despite the weather, the fans were in high spirits, with their
club lifting the cup for the second time in three years.
</P>
<P>
Some of the players were armed with cameras so they could
capture the magic of the occasion.
</P>
<P>
The top deck was jammed full of people and there was one
embarrassing moment in the crush for manager Gianluca Vialli.
</P>
<P>
Carrying the trophy, he was horrified to see the lid come off
and bounce down onto the street.
</P>
<P>
It would have made a wonderful souvenir for one fan but luckily
for the Italian boss the lid was retrieved and handed back to him.
</P>
<P>
The incident didn't stop Vialli taking the trophy to some of
the fans as the bus approached the town hall.
</P>
<P>
With a couple of the Met Police's finest on his shoulders, he
ambled over to some of the supporters and allowed them to touch
the trophy.
</P>
<P>
That led to the players going on an impromptu walkabout, gladly
signing autographs, posing for pictures and shaking hands.

<HEADLINE> Erekat Calls for More International Efforts to Resume Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian chief negotiator Saeb
Erekat on Monday urged the international community to exert every
possible effort to bring the Middle East peace process back on
track.
</P>
<P>
The appeal was contained in messages to U.N. Secretary General
Kofi Annan, U.S. Middle East special envoy Dennis Ross, European
Union Mideast envoy Miguel Moratinos as well as representatives of
the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
Erekat called on the world leaders to help restore the
credibility of the peace process through urging relevant parties to
implement the signed accords, sincerely and accurately.
</P>
<P>
In a similar message to his Israeli counterpart Oded Eran,
Erekat underscored the necessity of Israel's commitment to carrying
out the third redeployment by June 23.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians are still waiting for Israel's response to the
name list of Palestinian prisoners who should be released under the
Sharm el Sheikh memorandum signed last September, he told Eran.
Erekat made the appeal one day after Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak called his negotiation team in Stockholm for talks with the
Palestinians to return home in light of the surge of violence in
the Palestinian self-rule areas.
</P>
<P>
The two days of violent demonstrations in West Bank and Gaza
Strip reportedly led to the killing of one Palestinian and wounding
of about 160 people. One Israeli solider was seriously wounded by
Palestinian gunfire and five others slightly wounded by stones.
</P>
<P>
The weekend Days of Rage was declared by the Palestinian
National Authority to press for the release of 1,650 Palestinian
prisoners held by Israel.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Security Cabinet Convenes to Discuss Lebanon Withdrawal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
convened his security cabinet Monday evening to discuss the rapidly
deteriorating situation in south Lebanon and its effects on Israeli
army's planned withdrawal from the region.
</P>
<P>
Although the outcome of the inner-circle meeting is not
announced, Israel media has speculated Barak and his policy-making
ministers will explore the possibility to speed up the Lebanon
withdrawal, which was originally set to be carried out before July.
</P>
<P>
It is possible now that the redeployment will advance to early
June, or even the coming days, some analysts predicted.
</P>
<P>
The possibility arised following the sudden change of the
situation in the security zone in south Lebanon, which was set up
by Israel in 1985 with a self-claimed aim to protect its north from
cross-border guerrilla attacks.
</P>
<P>
In March, the Israeli cabinet approved Barak's proposal to
withdraw from the zone by July and end its two-decade occupation in
south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
In order to carry out the cabinet decision, Israel Defense
Forces (IDF) had transferred several outposts in the buffer zone to
its proxy militia South Lebanon Army (SLA) during the past few
weeks, hoping the militant group would act as buffer forces in the
zone for some time.
</P>
<P>
However, the outposts were in turn abandoned on Monday by SLA
militiamen, who deserted their position to seek asylum in Israel or
to defect to the approaching Lebanese Hezbollah guerrillas with a
snowslide style in less than 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
The disorderly SLA disassembly has created such a situation that
there is no longer a territorial continuity under Israeli control
in the security zone, with Hezbollah taking over most fortified
outposts in the central sector of the zone.
</P>
<P>
The situation change is really not in Israel's direction as
Israel had hoped that within the framework of relevant United
Nations Security Council Resolutions, the peacekeeping U.N. Interim
Forces in Lebanon (UNIFIL) will fill the security vacuum left by
IDF soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Barak reportedly had telephone conversations with U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan, U.S. Secretary of State Madelaine
Albright and French President Jacques Chirac on Monday, obviously
exchanging opinions with these leaders about further steps the
International community should take in the context of such a
situation out of control.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, IDF Northern Commander Gabi Ashkenazi clarified at a
press conference Monday evening that no final date has been decided
for the planned withdrawal from Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that even the events that took place Monday were
among the many possible scenarios IDF had predicted, and the army
has not by any means lost control.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Monday, there were media reports that Israeli army had
received orders from Barak to be ready for redeployment to the
international border between Israel and Lebanon as early as June 1,
five weeks ahead of the July deadline.

<HEADLINE> Protestant Leader Campaigns for N.Irish Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Northern Ireland's main pro-British
Protestant leader David Trimble is facing a crucial week as he
sets about convincing his colleagues to restore the power-sharing
executive in the province.
</P>
<P>
Ulster Unionist Party leader Trimble now has less than a week
to convince the 860-member Ulster Unionist Council, before their
meeting on Saturday, that the Irish Republican Army offer to put
its arms beyond use is genuine.
</P>
<P>
He said in Belfast on Monday that if his party voted against
accepting the package of proposals to restart devolution,unionism
would be consigned to the political wilderness.
</P>
<P>
If the party refuses to accept his position of putting the
offer from republicans to the test by going back into a government
including Sinn Fein, his leadership could be in doubt.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Trimble said he believed the IRA's campaign of
violence was finally over.
</P>
<P>
"I'm not saying that the future's going to be entirely free of
violence. I think that the organized, coherent campaign that the
IRA operated for 30 years is not going to come back again,"he said.
</P>
<P>
"There may be problems, there may still be violence, and the
violence may come from dissident elements. It may even come from
elements within the IRA. What I am saying is that the major,
organized campaign has gone because... it was beaten," he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Sinn Fein said the IRA initiative to "put its
weapons beyond use" is now at risk following what the party views
as concessions to Ulster Unionists.
</P>
<P>
A Sinn Fein spokesman said Monday the republicans were
extremely concerned that unionist acceptance of the current
package put forward by the governments to return Northern Ireland'
s power-sharing executive would be conditional.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Hopes a Peaceful Israeli Withdrawal from South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON. May 22 (Xinhua) -- The United States said on Monday
that Israel's withdrawal from south Lebanon is in compliance with
U.N. resolution 425 and urged Arabs to let Israel withdraw
peacefully.
</P>
<P>
"No one should be raising any question about that ... There is
no reason not to support it and there is no justification for
violence to be directed against it," U.S. Mideast envoy Dennis
Ross said at gathering of American supporters of Israel in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
Israel started its withdrawal on Monday and reports said there
were in near chaos following the pullout with Shiite Muslim
guerrillas and their supporters rushed in to reclaim villages held
by Israel forces for two decades.
</P>
<P>
The takeover was peaceful at first, with little resistance from
the Israeli allied militiamen. But it turned bloody when battle
tanks fired artillery shells and an Israeli helicopter gunship
strafed the area, apparently in an effort to scare away the
approaching civilians.
</P>
<P>
Ross, who returned from Israeli-Palestinian peace talks last
week, also spoke about the violence of the past few days between
Israeli troops and Palestinians, including some armed Palestinian
policemen in uniform, saying that violence should not play a part
in negotiations between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
"You can't have negotiations that are going to succeed in an
environment that is characterized by violence. It simply doesn't
work," he said. "There will not be an agreement that is forged
through the street or through violence. There will only be an
agreement if it is done at the negotiating table."
</P>
<P>
On Syrian-Israeli track, in abeyance since a session in West
Virginia in January, Ross said the gaps were not very wide but the
process was "very brittle."
</P>
<P>
"We are at a point where the door has not been closed on trying
to reach an agreement ... But at the end of the day the parties
themselves are going to be the ones who have to walk through the
door together," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The United States won't overcome the differences ... A go-
between can help get things to the point where the two parties
themselves resolve the differences but only the two parties
dealing directly will overcome the gaps," he added.

<HEADLINE> Annan Recommends to Reinforce U.N. Peacekeeping Force In Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 22 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan on Monday recommended to the United Nations Security Council
that the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon(UNIFIL) be
reinforced in order to carry out its responsibilities under
Resolution 425 of 1978.
</P>
<P>
In a written report submitted to the Security Council this
morning, Annan said the total troop strength for carrying out the
tasks related to confirming the withdrawal of Israeli troops would
thus increase from the present Level of 4,513 to approximately 5,
600.
</P>
<P>
Once the Israeli withdrawal is confirmed and if the security
situation permits, the force of UNIFIL would have to be
immediately increased to 7,935 personnel, he added.
</P>
<P>
The report also contains the minimum conditions and
requirements which must be met if resolution 425 is to be
implemented fully and without conditions and if the United Nations
is to be in a position to fulfill its responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
For the Government of Israel, Annan said, it must meet these
requirements including the withdrawal of Israel's military and
civilian personnel from Lebanon, the dismantling by Israel of the
South Lebanon Army's command structure, the cessation of
logistical support and supplies from Israel to the South Lebanon
Army and the removal of the South Lebanon Army's heavy weapons and
the handing over of prisoners in Al-Khiam detention center.
</P>
<P>
For the Government of Lebanon, Annan said, it must provide
full cooperation in the process of identifying, on the ground, the
line to be used for the purpose of confirming the withdrawal of
Israeli troops as recommended in the report.
</P>
<P>
Annan said the return of the effective authority of the
Government of Lebanon would require decisive and prompt action by
the Government to resume public services as well as law and order
functions and to resume its responsibility for providing for
security and safety throughout the area.
</P>
<P>
For the Government of Syria, Annan said, the United Nations
will require full cooperation on all relevant matters, including
in identifying on the ground that portion of the Lebanese-Syrian
boundary necessary to confirming the withdrawal of the Israeli
troops.
</P>
<P>
Israel has informed the United Nations that it will complete
withdrawal of all its troops from southern Lebanon by July.
</P>
<P>
Resolution 425 of 1978 established two requirements. First, the
Security Council called for "strict respect for the territorial
integrity, sovereignty and political independence of Lebanon
within its internationally recognized boundaries. And second, the
Security Council called upon Israel"immediately to cease its
military action against Lebanese territorial integrity and
withdraw its forces from all Lebanese territory.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council also decided "in the light of the request
of the Government of Lebanon, to establish immediately a United
Nations Interim Force for Southern Lebanon aimed at three purposes:
confirming the withdrawal of Israeli troops, restoring
international peace and security and assisting the Government of
Lebanon in ensuring the return of its effective authority in the
area.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Urges Release of Fiji Prime Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 22 (Xinhua) -- The United States on Monday
warned Fiji's gunmen of "substantial consequences" for
international relations if they do not release the island nation's
prime minister.
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to decide an internal political question," State
Department spokesman Richard Boucher said at a briefing. "On the
other hand ... this poor guy's being held, and the first thing
that ought to happen is he ought to be released. And at that point,
any political process in Fiji is up to them."
</P>
<P>
Fijian Prime Minister Mahendra Chaudhry has been held by gunmen
since Friday by Coup leader George Speight, who said he was acting
on behalf of indigenous Fijians.
</P>
<P>
Boucher stressed the importance of Chaudry's release and the
maintenance of constitutional order.
</P>
<P>
"Clearly there are consequences of any unconstitutional seizure
of power," Boucher said. "There would be very substantial
consequences for U.S.- Fiji relations, very detrimental to Fiji's
standing in the international community.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Determined to Get All Detainees Released  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Annan urged the RUF to end hostile acts and fully cooperate "in
retrieving the dead, wounded and missing", while appealing to
those with influence with the RUF to continue to work towards this
objective, Eckhard told a news briefing.
</P>
<P>
A new batch of 54 military personnel of the U.N. Mission in
Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL) was released Sunday night. They include 42
Zambians, 10 Kenyans and two military observers, one each from
Malaysia and Norway, Eckhard announced.
</P>
<P>
Annan hoped that more U.N. detainees would be freed this week.
</P>
<P>
Over 500 UNAMSIL personnel had been taken hostage since the
beginning of may. Most of them are Zambians. RFU's action followed
a dispute between it and the U.N. peacekeepers over disarmament
under the July 7, 1999 peace agreement to end the 9-year war in
the west African country.
</P>
<P>
Annan recommended that the UNAMSIL force strength be raised to
16,500 from the current 13,000. A further expansion may be needed
to establish security throughout the country, disarm rebel
fighters and eventually hold elections, he said in his latest
report on Sierra Leone released Monday.
</P>
<P>
In the report, Annan also suggested that the Security Council
consider a strengthening of the sanctions regime to prevent RUF
commanders from reaping the benefits of their illegal exploitation
of mineral resources, in particular diamonds.
</P>
<P>
At a press encounter Monday, the U.N. chief expressed his
dissatisfaction over U.S. Senator Judd Gregg's hold on U.S. peace-
keeping funds, calling it "disruptive" to the U.N. peace-keeping
mission.
</P>
<P>
In a foreign policy dispute with the U.S. administration,
Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee Gregg has
blocked the government from paying its dues to the U.N. for peace-
keeping missions in Congo, Kosovo, East Timor and Sierra Leone.

<HEADLINE> Arkansas Supreme Court Panel Recommends Disbarment of Clinton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 22 (Xinhua) -- A Supreme Court Committee of
Arkansas State in the United States has recommended that President
Clinton be disbarred because of "serious misconduct".
</P>
<P>
A majority of committee members, who met Friday to consider two
complaints against the president, suggested that President Clinton
be disciplined for false testimony about his relationship with
former White House intern Monica Lewinsky, the Supreme Court said
Monday in releasing the committee recommendation.
</P>
<P>
Under the rules of the Committee of Professional Conduct, the
disbarment recommendation now goes to the Circuit Court in Little
Rock for consideration.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the court, the committee's executive director
said Clinton's behavior in the Lewinsky case "constituted serious
misconduct" in violation of state rules governing lawyers.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, who has been a lawyer for more than 25 years, has not
practiced law since the early 1980s. He was governor from 1979 to
1981 and again from 1983 until he was elected president in 1992.

<HEADLINE> Annan Urges All Parties in Middle East to Exercise Maximum Restraint </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 22 (Xinhua) -- U.N.Secretary-General Kofi
Annan on Monday emphasized once again the vital need for all
parties concerned in the Middle East to exercise maximum restraint
both in their actions and in their public statements.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by his spokesman's office said "The
Secretary-General continues to follow very carefully events in
south Lebanon."
</P>
<P>
"Recent developments on the ground have changed the situation
fundamentally imperilling the plan that has been developed after
consultations with the Governments concerned," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"In these circumstances, it is essential that all concerned
cooperate fully with the United Nations and ensure the security of
U.N. personnel. The Secretary-General will be expecting explicit
commitments in this regard," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The Secretary-General wants to emphasize once again the vital
need for all parties concerned to exercise maximum restraint both
in their actions and in their public statements. Only in this way
will it be possible for Resolution 425 to be implemented in an
orderly manner and for the loss of yet more civilian lives to be
avoided," the statement added.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today the U.N. chief submitted a report to the Security
Council on the implementation of Resolution 425 of 1978 following
the notification of Israel received on April 17 that it would
withdraw all its troops from southern Lebanon by July.
</P>
<P>
The report indicates the U.N.'s plans for implementation and
the requirements that will have to be met before the United
Nations can confirm that Israel has completely withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
The report also stressed the cooperation that is required from
Lebanon and other countries, particularly in the region, so that
the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon can be redeployed and
reinforced.

<HEADLINE> Annan Urges Peace between Eritrea, Ethiopia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"The Secretary-General is immensely saddened at the resumption
of what is an increasingly incomprehensible war. There can be no
justification for such large scale death and suffering, especially
at time when both countries are wracked by drought and hunger,"
Annan's spokesman Fred Eckhard said.
</P>
<P>
The two-year war between Eritrea and Ethiopia stemming from a
border dispute has caused thousands of deaths on both sides.
Peace efforts by the U.N., the Organization of African Unity (OAU)
and regional countries have failed to produce tangible results.
</P>
<P>
There is no indication that the renewed fighting, which erupted
on May 12, will end immediately despite the Council's arms
sanctions against them.
</P>
<P>
The drought in the Horn of Africa is now affecting over 650,000
people in war-torn Ethiopia and Eritrea, U.N. statistics show.
</P>
<P>
International peace efforts led by the OAU is continuing and
Annan fully supports the peace efforts, Eckhard said.

<HEADLINE> Annan Shocked at Mutilated Bodies in Sierra Leone  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Despite uncertainty about the bodies belonging to U.N.
peacekeepers, Annan was "appalled by the culture of violence and
cruelty which pervades the conflict in Sierra Leone", the
spokesman stated.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief called on all parties to respect fully
international humanitarian law and recognized standards of human
rights.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that the continuing efforts by regional leaders will
lead to the expeditious and unconditional release of all U.N.
personnel detained by the rebel Revolutionary United Front (RUF).
</P>
<P>
The U.N. peace-keeping mission, now numbering 13,000 in the
west African nation is to monitor the implementation of a peace
accord signed last July between the RUF and the government to end
the 9-year civil war.
</P>
<P>
Over 500 U.N. peace-keepers have been taken hostage since the
beginning of May. The RUF's action followed a dispute between it
and the U.N. personnel over disarmament under the peace agreement.
About half of the detainees are still in RUF's hands.
</P>
<P>
U.N.peace-keepers couldn't identify the corps wearing U.N.
uniforms as the rebels often stripped many of the captive peace-
keepers of their weapons and uniforms, and took them for their own
use, U.N. sources said.

<HEADLINE> Annan Urges All Parties to Work For Orderly Withdrawal of Israeli Troops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 22 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan on Monday appealed once again to all parties concerned in
the Middle East to work with the United Nations in managing an
orderly withdrawal of Israeli troops from southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the press, Annan said "I think for the first time
in 22 years we have come very close to the full implementation of
Security Council Resolution 425 of 1978 which will lead to orderly
withdrawal of Israeli forces and return of Lebanese authority in
the area."
</P>
<P>
 "It is quite clear what the United Nations will do and what
our posture is. Obviously right now the situation is volatile and
dangerous, but we will verify and certify full Israeli withdrawal
and work with the Lebanese Government to restore its authority in
the region," Annan said
</P>
<P>
Earlier today the U.N. chief submitted a report to the Security
Council on the implementation of Resolution 425 of 1978 following
the notification of Israel received on April 17 that it would
withdraw all its troops from southern Lebanon by July.
</P>
<P>
The report indicates the U.N.'s plans for implementation and
the requirements that will have to be met before the United
Nations can confirm that Israel has completely withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
The report also stressed the cooperation that is required from
Lebanon and other countries, particularly in the region, so that
the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon can be redeployed and
reinforced.

<HEADLINE> Globalization to Drive Consolidation Among Auto Manufacturers, Suppliers, Says Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGLES, May 22 (Xinhua) -- There may be just eight
independent global vehicle manufacturer groups by 2010, down from
16 today, and this will drive further globalization and
consolidation of their suppliers, according to a report released
Monday.
</P>
<P>
And this trend will fundamentally change relationships between
suppliers and manufacturers and create new opportunities for the
survivors, said the report from Roland Berger &AMP; Partners, an
international management consulting firm of European origin with
offices in 22 countries.
</P>
<P>
The firm interviewed 70 representatives from automakers and
suppliers around the world to determine the impact of major "mega-
trends" on suppliers and their relationships with their customers.
</P>
<P>
Ten years from now, the report said, fewer than 50 "mega-
supplier groups" will compete for large, global platform contracts,
take on greater risks for a vehicle's ultimate success and assume
significantly more responsibility for systems integration and sub-
supplier management.
</P>
<P>
According to the study, vehicle-volume growth in major markets
such as the United States may slow down in the near future, but
suppliers still will have the chance to increase revenues by
providing additional value-added content, primarily through
technological innovation that improve safety, reduce weight, boost
fuel economy, enhance component performance, improve driver and
occupant functionality as well as comfort.
</P>
<P>
The study forecasts that electronics will drive 90 percent of
all future innovation in the automobile and that by 2010
electronics will account for a third of vehicle cost, a jump of
more than 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
The share of value-added content contributed by automakers to
every vehicle will steadily decline to little more than 25 percent
by 2010, with suppliers picking up the difference.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, e-commerce will shake the supply chain. As
automakers are moving rapidly toward Internet-based platforms for
their supplier relationships, suppliers must act responsively,
according to the study.
</P>
<P>
By 2010, the report said, there will be three to five top
suppliers for each module or system, down from seven or eight
today. This level of consolidation already exists in seat, brake
and safety systems. Meanwhile, the number of modules or systems
per vehicle will shrink to about ten, from 18 to 20 today.
</P>
<P>
These trends will have a direct impact on suppliers' core
profitability, the report said. Supplier firms will be forced to
sharpen their focus in key areas including customer relations,
innovation, cost, integration, global delivery, and management of
cooperative ventures and merger or acquisition activities.

<HEADLINE> Mexico Goes Up to 13th Place in World Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, May 22 (Xinhua)-- Mexico went up in recent years
from 4th to 13th position in world trade due to its free trade
accords, especially that made with United States and Canada, said
an analyst on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Mexico went up from place 17 in 1993 to 13 in 1999 and will
reach 12 in year 2003, said economist Alfredo Coutino of American
finance studies firm Wharton Econometrics, in an analysis
divulged Monday by the press.
</P>
<P>
Mexico's always greater production apparatus integrating to
North America's economic zone was determinant for the country's
rise in global trade, he added.
</P>
<P>
The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) in force since
1994 with United States and Canada, marked Mexico's globalization,
said Coutino, director of Macroeconomic Analysis for Mexico of
this American firm.
</P>
<P>
Mexico increased by 300 percent its exports and doubled its
imports since NAFTA's application and increased its taking in of
outside direct investments, from 4.4 billion dollars in 1993 to 11
billion in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Mexico is the Latin American country with greatest number of
free trade agreements, including those in force and those signed
with other countries in the region and with European Union and
Israel -which are pending application-, and is negotiating
agreement with Singapore in Asia.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Takes Another Step Against Break-Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Microsoft Corp. filed Monday an
unexpected brief in the federal court, arguing that U.S. calls to
break up the company contradicted the position taken by the
government in a case five years ago that a breakup ran counter to
the public interest.
</P>
<P>
"The government has already admitted that the breakup of
Microsoft would be 'dangerous to the economy's welfare' and '
against the public interest,'" the software giant said an eight-
page filing just two days before a hearing on the case.
</P>
<P>
The government and 17 states asked the court on April 28 to
break the company in two after District Judge Thomas Penfield
Jackson found in early April that the company broke U.S. antitrust
laws.
</P>
<P>
Microsoft rejected the proposal as "extreme" on May 10 and
offered to remedy its behavior. Microsoft's latest filing followed
a government response on May 17 saying that a conduct remedy would
be insufficient.
</P>
<P>
Monday's filing was Microsoft's second response to that
government's break-up plan.
</P>
<P>
"The government had it right in 1995: the law does not
countenance the dismemberment of Microsoft, a remedy that would
clearly 'act against the public interest,'" the latest filing said,
referring to an earlier action against it by the Justice
Department.
</P>
<P>
Microsoft and the Justice Department are to meet in U.S.
District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson's Washington, D.C.,
courtroom on Wednesday for a hearing on how the voluminous case
should proceed.
</P>
<P>
Microsoft has said that if that judge wants to consider a break-
up he should give it until December to prepare and then hold
extensive hearings.

<HEADLINE> Wall Street Stocks Fall in Second Consecutive Session </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stocks fell in the
second consecutive session Monday as investors worried about lower
corporate profits because of higher interest rates.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Security Council to Meet in Annan's Report on Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 22 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Security
Council is scheduled to have a late night meeting Monday to
discuss U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan's report on reinforcing
U.N. forces in southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Annan submitted a report to the Security Council earlier today,
recommending that the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (
UNIFIL) be reinforced in order to carry out its responsibilities
under Resolution 425 of 1978.
</P>
<P>
Annan said the total troop strength for carrying out the tasks
related to confirming the withdrawal of Israeli troops would thus
increase from the present Level of 4,513 to approximately 5,600.
</P>
<P>
Once the Israeli withdrawal is confirmed and if the security
situation permits, the force of UNIFIL would have to be
immediately increased to 7,935 personnel.
</P>
<P>
The report also contains the minimum conditions and
requirements which must be met if resolution 425 is to be
implemented fully and without conditions and if the United Nations
is to be in a position to fulfill its responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the press after the conclusion of Council's
meeting in the afternoon, Russian Ambassador to the United Nations,
Sergey Lavrov, said the Council will have further discussions on
the report this night and a draft resolution is expected to be
voted Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
Israel has informed the United Nations in April that it will
complete withdrawal of all its troops from southern Lebanon by
July.
</P>
<P>
Resolution 425 of 1978 established two requirements. First, the
Security Council called for "strict respect for the territorial
integrity, sovereignty and political independence of Lebanon
within its internationally recognized boundaries. And second, the
Security Council called upon Israel"immediately to cease its
military action against Lebanese territorial integrity and
withdraw its forces from all Lebanese territory.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council also decided "in the light of the request
of the Government of Lebanon, to establish immediately a United
Nations Interim Force for Southern Lebanon aimed at three purposes:
confirming the withdrawal of Israeli troops, restoring
international peace and security and assisting the Government of
Lebanon in ensuring the return of its effective authority in the
area.
