<HEADLINE> Israeli, PA Security Heads Pledge Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Despite mounting tension
between Israel and the Palestinian Authority (PA), security
heads from both sides today reached agreement on increasing
cooperation in fighting against "terror."
</P>
<P>
The pledge was made in Jerusalem, where Israeli Public Security
Minister Avigdor Kahalani held his first meeting with PA security
head Jibril Rajoub. Kahalani described the meeting as successful,
saying the two sides had pledged to increase cooperation in
combating terrorism.
</P>
<P>
The two men agreed to set up a line of communication on
combating terrorism following the Friday suicide bombing in a
Tel Aviv cafe, which killed 4 people and wounded dozens of
others.
</P>
<P>
Rajoub promised he would take all necessary measures to
prevent more bombing attacks against Israel in order to
enable the continuation of the peace process. He also warned
Israel against suspending peace talks.
</P>
<P>
"Co-existence and peace is the only way and the only
option that we have. The Palestinian police and the
(Palestinian) authority would take all necessary measures to
enable the leaders of both sides to continue the peace
process," he said.
</P>
<P>
Israel blamed the PA for being responsible for the Tel
Aviv bombing by giving the green-light for "terrorist attacks" to
militant Palestinian organizations such as Hamas, which claimed
responsibility for the Friday bombing in Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli officials and security experts acknowledged
that the cooperation from the Palestinian security forces was
essential for a success in fighting terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Also today, senior Israeli army officers also held talks
with Palestinian police officials in an attempt to increase
coordination in preventing the infiltration of potential
Palestinian militants. Israel is maintaining a total closure on
the Palestinian territories.
</P>
<P>
The whole Jewish state was keeping high security alert
amid intelligence warnings of more bombing attacks. Road blocks
and checkpoints were set up in main entrances to major
cities, while additional security forces were deployed in city
centers to deter possible attackers.
</P>
<P>
In a sign of current tension, Israeli border guards opened
fire at a Palestinian car in a Jerusalem suburb checkpoint,
wounding two Palestinians who tried to flee from the
security checks.
</P>
<P>
Yair Yitzhak, Jerusalem police chief, warned today suicide
bombings could also take place in Jerusalem and other cities
alike. Although most celebrations on the Purim holiday will be
held as scheduled today and Monday, they will be heavily
guarded as a precaution.
</P>
<P>
Friday's Tel Aviv bombing was the first suicide bombing attack
since late February to early March when a series of suicide
bombings killed over 60 people in major cities of Jerusalem, Tel
Aviv and Asheklon.

<HEADLINE> Tourists at Sino-Russia Border Increased </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, March 23 (Xinhua) -- China and Russian Federation
exchanged a record high of some 300,000 tourists at their border
areas in 1996, latest statistics show.
</P>
<P>
Tourism continued to grow to over 30 percent in the first
two months of this year, authorities of Heilongjiang Province
announced.
</P>
<P>
In the past tourists from Japan, and Hong Kong and Macao made
up the bulk of the relatively small amount of overseas tourists to
this cold northernmost Chinese province. Russia has now become the
largest tourist source to Heilongjiang.
</P>
<P>
Provincial tourist officials attributed the increase of the
tourist exchange to the 24 ports of entry opened along the border,
and the introduction of one-day and multi-day tours offered at
border cities of the both sides.
</P>
<P>
The development of tourism has contributed to the booming of
small cities along the borders and to the swelling of local
coffers, local officials said.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 23 (Xinhua) -- South African Home Affairs
Minister Mangosuthu Buthelezi, who was appointed as acting
president for two days last month, once again accepted the
position today.
</P>
<P>
"It is awe inspiring to be head of state even for a couple of
days, especially as powerful a state as this one," Buthelezi told
reporters in Pretoria, the administrative capital of South Africa
after being sworn in.
</P>
<P>
He said, "it is a greater responsibility to be in charge of a
whole country, but there is really nothing new about it."
</P>
<P>
Buthelezi, a well known opponent in the cabinet, said he
appreciated the trust President Nelson Mandela had placed in him
by appointing him to the position of acting president for the
second time in a few weeks.
</P>
<P>
He would hold the position from Tuesday to Thursday this week,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Mandela is reportedly due to leave for Bangladesh and India on
Monday while Deputy President Thabo Mbeki is in Zaire and is
scheduled to go to visit Angola later.
</P>
<P>
Buthelezi had acted in Mandela's capacity in February while
Mandela and Mbeki attended a meeting of the World Economic Forum
in Davos, Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
Buthelezi will go to Cape Town, the legislative capital of
South Africa on Monday, informed sources said.

<P>
CHENGDU, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Southwest China's Sichuan
province, a leading agricultural province in the country, has used
more than one billion US dollars of foreign capital to develop its
agriculture over the past six years.
</P>
<P>
Most of the investment from overseas flowed to township
enterprises and hydroelectric power plants in the province,
according to local government officials.
</P>
<P>
During the period, Sichuan introduced more than 500 million US
dollars to set up some 300 large township firms with high
technical levels.
</P>
<P>
The province also used 300 million US dollars in building
Shengzhong Reservoir, Wudu Water Conservancy Project and other
major projects.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, overseas funds have gone into the farming, forestry
and animal husbandry sectors.
</P>
<P>
local government officials praised highly the influx of foreign
funds, saying that it made up the scarcity of input in agriculture
and helped introduce advanced techniques and equipment.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian Parliament Expresses Support to Cabinet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 23 (Xinhua) -- The Egyptian parliament today
expressed its confidence in and support for the government of Prime
Minister Kamal el-Ganzouri amid wide speculations that a major
cabinet shake-up is near.
</P>
<P>
The 456-member People's Assembly, at a session under Speaker
Ahmed Fathi Sorour, endorsed the policy statement read out by
Ganzouri before the parliament on December 23.
</P>
<P>
Thirteen members of the parliament from the opposition voted
against the statement and two independents abstained from voting.
</P>
<P>
Yassin Seraguddin, leader of the parliamentary mission of the
opposition Wafd Party, refused to vote for renewing confidence in
the government.
</P>
<P>
Sorour lauded the government for its savvy in the management
of crises and praised President Hosni Mubarak's "wise policy"
that has won international acclaim.
</P>
<P>
Last week, however, there were rumors from local journalists
and political pundits about a major shake-up of the cabinet,
saying that Ganzouri might change as many as 15 ministers.
</P>
<P>
local observers and politicians believe that Ganzouri, who
replaced Atef Sidki on January 2, 1995 in the last cabinet
shake-up, may want to drop those who had been already in place
when he took over.

cypresses, showing their determination not to forget the national
humiliation and their responsibility to revitalize the country.

<HEADLINE> UK Labor Remains 25.5 Points Ahead in Opinion Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 23 (Xinhua) -- The first opinion poll conducted
since Britain's general election date was announced last week
showed that the main opposition Labor Party's lead remains an
extraordinary 25.5 points.
</P>
<P>
A Gallup poll for The Sunday Telegraph, which was conducted in
the second half of last week and was released today, found that
Labor has the backing of a clear majority of voters, 54.5 percent,
while the Conservatives trail on 29 points. The Liberal Democrats
are on 10.5 points.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that this is a setback for Prime Minister John
Major, who has pinned his hopes on the belief that the imminence
of the election will concentrate voters' minds on the threat of an
incoming Labor government.
</P>
<P>
They pointed out that the result of the poll meant that Major's
attempt to catch Labor Party unawares and rally Conservative
support by declaring the election date early has also failed.
</P>
<P>
However, Major insisted that Tory strategy would eventually
bear fruit. The prime minister also hit out at Labor's use of
"dirty tricks" instead of fighting on the central issues of
politics and the economy.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe will mark the World
Tuberculosis (TB) Day on Monday following reports on a sharp TB
increase in the southern African country.
</P>
<P>
A statement from the Ministry of Health and Child Welfare said
today more than 30,000 Zimbabweans died of TB in the past 10
years.
</P>
<P>
The disease kills more people today than at any other time in
history, although almost all of the deaths are preventable, said
the statement.
</P>
<P>
The statement said neglect, AIDS and multi-drug resistance
were the three main driving forces behind the spread of TB.
</P>
<P>
TB cases had decreased in Zimbabwe until the mid-1980s when
the first AIDS case was reported. Since 1987, there has been a
sharp increase of as much as 400 percent, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"It is estimated that TB will be the main killer of HIV-
positive patients by the year 2000. In general, TB is more
vicious and accelerated when associated with HIV infection and,
therefore, lead to more serious clinical symptoms in a short
time," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
Three million people died of TB around the world in 1995,
surpassing the number in the worst years of the epidemic around
1900.

He had worked in two restaurants in Rishion Lezion near Tel
Aviv illegally before launching the suicide attack in protest
against Israel's current actions to build a Jewish settlement in
Har Homa in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Unlike other suicide bombers who were usually single, Ranimat
was married and a father of four children.
</P>
<P>
Demolishing homes of extremists who launched suicide attacks
against the Jewish state has been a usual practice of punishment
taken by Israel.
</P>
<P>
According to the Israeli law, the family of the suicide bomber
can appeal to the country's High Court of Justice which is
certain to reject the request.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Releases 2 Allegedly Involved in Espionage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus today released one Turk
and one Turkish Cypriot, who were held in alleged connection with
a case of espionage against the Republic of Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Police announced that the two were released for lack of
evidence in espionage.
</P>
<P>
The released are 37-year-old Turk Mustafa Omer Konor, who was
married to a Greek Cypriot, and Turkish Cypriot Dijan Nejip, also
37, who lived with a Greek Cypriot.
</P>
<P>
Police also said the two were examined by a U.N. doctor
before being released. The doctor did not find anything wrong
with them.
</P>
<P>
However, a third person, Turkish national Nedjip Sari
Chichekli, is still in custody and is scheduled to appear
before the Assize Court Monday to face charges of espionage.
</P>
<P>
According to an earlier announcement by police, Chichekli had
confessed to spying on National Guard's military positions over
the past 18 months for Turkey, in exchange for 2,500 Cyprus pounds
(about 5,000 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
All three, who were living in the southern coastal town of
Limassol, were arrested on March 8 and detained after police
found military documents, newspaper clippings concerning arms
acquisition program of the National guard and maps outlining army
camps.
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, Petros Clerides, the country's top lawer, announced
here that famous Turkish Cypriot lawyer Ali Nadal will arrive
from the Turkish-occupied northern areas to defend the three
suspects.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the Attorney-General's Office will ensure
that the Republic's interests are safeguarded, so are those
of the charged.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkish troops
occupied the northern third of the island in the wake of
short-lived Greek Cypriot coup seeking union with Greece.

<HEADLINE> Official: Government Forces Have Situation Under </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, March 23 (Xinhua) -- The Sudanese Armed Forces are
holding the reins of the situation in the country, Abdul Rehim
Mohammed Hussein, Minister of Sudanese Presidential Affairs has
said.
</P>
<P>
In a statement printed by daily "Akhbar el Yom" today, the
Sudanese senior official was quoted to have said that the
government troops have moved from the stage of deterrence to that
of advance in their military operations.
</P>
<P>
The government and popular defense forces have destroyed a
number of mechanized vehicles of the opposition and overrun enemy
troops over the past few days, the minister added.
</P>
<P>
On the crash of a Sudanese military aircraft Thursday evening,
the Sudanese minister said it crashed after having completed
its mission. The aircraft, an Antonov, regularly performing
missions beyond the range of anti-aircraft artillery, crashed in
the north of the southern Sudanese city of Juba.
</P>
<P>
Fighting has been raging in the war-torn country since
the beginning of this year between the government forces on the
one side and the northern opposition parties of the National
Democratic Alliance and rebel troops of the Sudan People's
Liberation Army led by John Garang on the other in the Sudanese
eastern and southern border areas.

<HEADLINE> Arabs to Seek Support Again at UN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Arab countries will, for the
second time, resort to the United Nations to confront the
U.S. veto over the U.N. resolution barring a new Israeli
settlement plan in East Jerusalem, the Arab League (AL) chief
said today.
</P>
<P>
"The Arab group at the General Assembly is working to issue a
strong and clear resolution that would back the Arab call on
Israel to halt its settlement expansion in East Jerusalem," AL
Secretary General Esmat Abdul-Meguid told reporters here.
</P>
<P>
The Arab leader regretted that the United States has tarnished
its role as a fair mediator in the Mideast East by using the veto
twice on the resolution that demanded Israel to stop building
6,500 housing units on Har Homa in East Jerusalem, which the
Palestinians want to make their future capital.
</P>
<P>
Following its first veto on March 7, the U.S. again rejected
an Arab-sponsored U.N. Security Council resolution Friday. In
contrast, the General Assembly, where there is no veto, approved
a similar resolution with a vote of 130-2 earlier last week.
</P>
<P>
Friday's vote coincided with a suicide bombing attack at a Tel
Aviv cafe, killing at least three people and wounding 47. The
militant Muslim group of Hamas has claimed responsibility for the
bombing in revenge of Israel's "terror of bulldozers".
</P>
<P>
"Two vetoes in two weeks also lead the Arab and Islamic world
to question the American role as a sponsor of the Middle East
peace process," he added.
</P>
<P>
"It not only raises several question marks, but is also most
regrettable," Meguid said.
</P>
<P>
Although the U.S. veto has encouraged Israel to further its
settlement policy, he affirmed, it will not weaken the Arab
commitment towards the strategic option of peace.
</P>
<P>
"I expect the General Assembly will help defuse violence and
counter-violence that has begun to escalate in the region and
salvage the peace process that has reached one of its most
dangerous phases," he added.
</P>
<P>
The AL chief called upon the U.S., a key sponsor of the peace
process since 1979, to exercise its influence over Israel and
save the peace march.
</P>
<P>
"The Israeli policies require parties concerned,
especially the U.S., to adopt a firmer stance," Meguid told
the press.

<HEADLINE> High-Tech Industry Plays Greater Role in U.S. Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, March 23 (Xinhua) -- High technology has replaced the
traditional cyclical industries as the main driving force for
growth of the United States, according to the latest issue of the
"Business Week".
</P>
<P>
The nation's economic expansion of the 1990s has been fueled
largely by the strong growth of the information technology
industry, rather than housing and autos, it said, adding that it
is not the stock market either to determine how long this
expansion will last.
</P>
<P>
In the past three years, the high-tech sector has contributed
27 percent of the growth in gross domestic product, compared with
14 percent for residential housing and only 4 percent for
residential housing and only 4 percent for the auto sector.
</P>
<P>
Over the past year, it said, a stunning 33 percent of GDP
growth has come from information-technology industries, propelled
by things ranging from the Internet boom to the rise of
direct-broadcast satellite television.
</P>
<P>
There is a new business cycle in the country, which is tied to
the health of the high-tech sector, it said.
</P>
<P>
The computer, software, and communications industries have
grown at a pace far exceeding the rest of the economy over the
past three years, helping to extend the expansion.
</P>
<P>
The high-tech's contribution to the country's GDP totaled 420
billion U.S. dollars in 1996, up 15 percent from 1995. The pace
was much faster than the 2.5 percent increase of GDP.
</P>
<P>
However, it said, with high tech having grown so big, the
economy is now vulnerable to a high-tech slowdown in a way that
was never true before.
</P>
<P>
It indicated that there are already troubling signs of weakness
in those industries that, if prolonged, could foreshadow a wider
slump -- as well as a steep decline in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
The magazine also advised the country's policy makers to turn
their attention to the new trend to avoid policy mistakes. It
warned that an economy is "vulnerable to a downturn when one
sector or industry expands too fast."

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Dinar to Appreciate: Central Bank Governor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Governor of the Iraqi Central
Bank Issam Rashid Huweish today said there will be a steady rise
in the purchasing power of the Iraqi dinar this year.
</P>
<P>
In a statement to the Iraqi news agency here, the governor said
that the current year would witness a steady improvement of the
purchasing power of the Iraqi dinar in view of the increase in
commodity supplies and the U.N. permission to import goods and
other materials to meet domestic needs.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the central bank has instructed national
banks to sell and buy foreign currencies, and to bring in
remittances from abroad in accordance with relevant central bank
law and instructions. The move will be done side by side with the
money exchange firms in Baghdad and other governorates.
</P>
<P>
However, the governor did not say how much the dinar will
appreciate in the near future. The exchange rate of the dinar
against the dollar is 1,165:1 today.
</P>
<P>
The prices of foodstuffs have slightly dropped since the
arrival in Iraq of the first consignment of foodstuffs on March
20, although the consignment was rather small in quantity and
diversity.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi citizens have not expressed much joy as the
dispatched foodstuffs are insufficient for the domestic needs and
as they are unaware when a distribution will take place.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Takes Measures to Protect Domestic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 23 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government has taken
stringent measures to protect local industries from unfair
competition arising from transit goods illegally diverted into
the domestic market.
</P>
<P>
Under the measures, all goods in transit shall be stored in
special godowns licensed by Kenyan Commissioner of Customs and
Excise.
</P>
<P>
The transit godowns should be clearly marked in large letters
and the serial number given by the Commissioner and they should
not be used for storage of any other goods.
</P>
<P>
On sugar imports, licensed transit godowns should be required
to construct a separate part inside for the storage of sugar
only.
</P>
<P>
All existing conditions governing the movement and control of
goods in transit should be fulfilled and during the 45-day period
such goods must be re-exported from Kenya.
</P>
<P>
Goods in transit stored in unlicensed godowns will be liable
to forfeiture and owners of unlicensed godowns will be guilty of
an offense.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that all these measures are mainly aimed at
protecting domestic sugar producers and ensuring that the
government collects its rightful revenue.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, the Federation of Kenya Employers (FKE)
appealed to the government to protect local sugar companies from
unscrupulous importers.
</P>
<P>
Local companies are now having 70,000 tons of sugar in store,
which are unable to sell due to the flooding of Kenyan market by
imported sugar at cheaper prices.
</P>
<P>
Sugar industry sources asserted that imported sugar meant for
neighboring countries is being diverted to the local markets at
low prices because no duties have been paid.
</P>
<P>
Last year most of more-than-400-million-U.S.-Dollar sugar
imported for transit to other countries were dumped on local
markets in the eastern African country.
</P>
<P>
The FKE noted that "it is against the principles of
liberalization of the market and globalization of trade as
importation of cheap sugar does not provide a level-playing
ground or promote fair competition in the local market."
</P>
<P>
According to Kenyan Finance Minister Musalia Mudavadi, the
transportation of the imported sugar meant for Uganda, Rwanda,
Burundi and Zaire is being closely monitored to ensure it is not
sold to consumers locally.

<HEADLINE> Prominent Africans in S. Africa to Form Mediation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Former state leaders and
top government officials from several African countries arrived
here today to form a preventive diplomacy forum of eminent
persons to mediate in political disputes on the continent.
</P>
<P>
The initiative came at a time when Africa is grappling to find
solutions to the crisis in Zaire and the Great Lakes region,
South African Press Association (SAPA) quoted the African Center
for the Constructive Resolution of Disputes (ACCORD)'s statement
as saying.
</P>
<P>
Former President Aristides Perreira of Cape Verde and current
United Nations and Organization of African Unity (OAU) special
representative to the Great Lakes region Ambassador Mohammed
Sahnoun are among those who will serve on the forum.
</P>
<P>
They will be joined by local academics, conflict resolution
practitioners and community leaders like King Makhosonke of
Mpumalanga Province and human rights lawyer Linda Zama, SAPA
said.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will be chaired by the wife of the late Mozambican
President Samora Machel and close companion of South African
President Nelson Mandela, Graca Machel.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will also be attended by representatives of the
U.N. and OAU, the Southern African Development Community (SADC)
and the inter-governmental authority for development, which
mediates in conflicts in the Horn of Africa.
</P>
<P>
The delegates were scheduled to begin their deliberations at a
private dinner with Mandela in Cape Town, the legislative capital
of South Africa tonight, informed sources said.

<HEADLINE> Germany, Saudi Arabia to Boost Economic Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, March 23 (Xinhua) -- German Minister of
Economics Guenter Rexrodt said today that Germany and the
European Union countries were keen to boost economic ties with
Saudi Arabia and other Gulf Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
Rexrodt was telling a press conference in Saudi capital
city of Riyadh after wrapping up his tow-day visit to Saudi
Arabia, Kuwait News Agency said.
</P>
<P>
He asserted that economic cooperation between the European
Union countries and Gulf Cooperation Council states could be
further enhanced once a joint GCC free trade zone is established.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations on unification of the customs tariffs which
would set the stage for the establishment of the free trade
zone is still underway among the GCC states because of
difficulties over an agreement of goods classification.
</P>
<P>
The GCC is a political and economic alliance formed by
regional states of Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates,
Qatar, Oman, Kuwait and Bahrain.
</P>
<P>
Rexrodt arrived in Saudi Arabia Saturday to attend the 12th
meeting of the German-Saudi joint commission on economic and
technical cooperation. During the meeting, both sides discussed
the important role played by the commission.
</P>
<P>
He praised results of his talks with the Saudi officials
which he said would push forward the joint economic
cooperation, pointing out that great opportunities are awaiting
German investors in the Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
But he said "the legal and administrative structure in
Saudi Arabia are not always clear enough for foreign
investors, and the need to find a sponsor in Saudi Arabia
discourages some investors."
</P>
<P>
Oil giant Saudi Arabia said earlier this month it was
taking measures to encourage foreign investment and it was
also reviewing its foreign capital law to introduce more
incentives to international investors.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia will implement steps to provide protection of
foreign investment and ease bureaucratic obstacles in the
licensing of foreign projects.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia is German's main trading partner in the Arab
world. Rexrodt asserted his country's support to Saudi efforts
in joining the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
According to figures of German embassy in Saudi Arabia,
total bilateral trade between the two countries was 4.8
billion marks (2.8 billion U.S. dollars) in Saudi Arabia's
favor in 1995, in the first nine months of 1996, it stood
at 3.7 billion marks (about 2.16 billion dollars).

<HEADLINE> Israel Urges PA to Fight Extremism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Israel today demanded the
Palestinian Authority (PA) to fight extremism and violence "as a
necessary stage in advancing the political process."
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by the Ministerial Committee for National
Security Issues, which met today, urged the Palestinians to
"prevent incitement and hostile propaganda against Israel."
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu convened a meeting of
the committee today, two days after Friday's suicide bombing
attack in Tel Aviv. Confrontations ensued between Israeli
soldiers and Palestinians protesters in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Moussa Ranimat, 28, of Kafr Tsurif near Hebron of
the West Bank, detonated a three-kilogram-TNT bomb packed with
nails and pieces of metal in a coffee shop in the center of Tel
Aviv, killing three Israeli women and wounding 48 others.
</P>
<P>
A closure was imposed on the West Bank and Gaza Strip
immediately following the attack, and the home of Ranimat, a
member of Hamas for the past two years, was sealed.
</P>
<P>
Hamas claimed responsibility for the blast in a phone call to
Israel Television Channel 1 afterwards.
</P>
<P>
Israeli General Security Service chief Ami Ayalon met on
Friday night with PNA security heads and demanded they
immediately rearrest some 150 security prisoners released by the
PNA over the past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Public Security Minister Avigdor Kahalani blasted PNA
President Yasser Arafat for giving the green light to extremist
organizations and for failing to prevent attacks.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, hundreds of Palestinians rushed to the area between
Palestinian and Israeli-controlled Hebron in three separate
clashes Friday and Saturday, leaving dozens of Palestinians and
several Israelis wounded.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli army said that soldiers fired some live bullets
when "their lives were in danger," adding that 12 soldiers and
border policemen as well as an Israeli boy were slightly wounded
in the two days of confrontations.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that the committee was briefed on "how
the PNA led the terrorist organizations to understand that they
had the 'green-light' to commit terrorist attacks."
</P>
<P>
In the statement, the committee also asked the Palestinians to
"process requests for the transfer of terrorists in accordance
with the interim agreement," known as the Oslo II accord, "and
to gather illegal weapons."

<HEADLINE> UN Continues Backing Angola's Peace Process: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, March 23 (Xinhua) -- The international community will
continue its support for Angola's peace process until the country
achieves lasting peace, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said
today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a mass rally in the central city of Kuito, Annan
pledged that the international community, especially the U. N.,
would continue to provide assistance of all kinds to Angola until
it realizes national reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief today toured Kuito in central Angola to
acquaint himself with the peace process and the difficulties
suffered by the local people in one of the cities which had been
hit hardest during the civil war.
</P>
<P>
When civil war erupted again in 1993, fierce battles were
fought in Kuito, destroying nearly all the buildings and taking
the tolls of about 50,000 people.
</P>
<P>
Annan said he was shocked to learn so many were maimed for
life and determined to contribute to ending the production and
sales of land mines in the world.
</P>
<P>
Some 150,000 people braved the rains to meet the U.N. Chief
and listen to his address at the Independence Square in the city.
</P>
<P>
Heavy rains compelled Annan to cancel his trip to Huanbo, and
to Bailundo, headquarters of the National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA) to meet its leader Jonas Savimbi.
</P>
<P>
Annan arrived here on Saturday for a four-day visit from
Namibia. It is the third leg of his African tour. Before Namibia,
he toured South Africa. And after his stay in Angola, he will go
to Togo to attend a special OAU summit on the Zaire crisis.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Appeals for Stronger German Support of Its EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, March 24 (Xinhua) -- One day before German Foreign
Minister Klaus Kinkel starts on a three-day visit to Ankara,
Turkey's ambassador to Germany today called for stronger German
support for its bid for European Union (EU) membership.
</P>
<P>
Turkey feels it is not being treated fairly by the European
countries, said Ambassador Volkan Vural in an interview with the
German newspaper Bild (Monday issue). He added that his country
views itself as European in its history, geography and values.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed that Turkey has only the demand to enjoy the
same treatment as other candidates for EU membership. "It is an
injustice to deny its rights to join the EU or exclude it."
</P>
<P>
"We expect a more active support from Germany. The existing
special relationship with Germany is a factor which enhances these
expectations" he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Kinkel reportedly said in Brussels today that the
Turkish demand for EU membership could not be met in the
foreseeable future given its current economic situation and human
rights problems.
</P>
<P>
According to the German Foreign Ministry, Kinkel is scheduled
to visit Turkey on March 25-27. Turkey's relations with the EU
will be the main topic when he meets with Turkey's Prime Minister
Necmettin Erbakan and Foreign Minister Tansu Ciller.

</P>
<P>
Karasin made the remarks before Chinese Foreign Minister Qian

relations, which he described as "surprisingly active and
comprehensive" in recent years.
</P>
<P>
On the reduction of armed forces in the border areas between
the two countries, Karasin said an agreement on this was to be
signed in April by the leaders of Russia, China, Kazakhstan,
Kirghizia and Tajikistan.
</P>
<P>
China became the fifth largest trading partner of Russia last
year, after Ukraine, Germany, the United States and Belarus,

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scholars Denounce Dalai Lama's Visit of Taiwan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Experts on Taiwan affairs warned
that the Taiwan authorities have taken a new step on the road to
"Taiwan independence" by inviting the Dalai Lama to visit Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing-based Taiwan Studies Society called together a
dozen scholars today to give comments on Dalai Lama's visit to
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The scholars noted that the Dalai Lama was not conducting
purely religious activities in Taiwan, but his visit represented
an open convergence of "Taiwan independence" and "Tibet
independence" forces, nothing less than political activities to
split the motherland.
</P>
<P>
They said the mainland will unswervingly carry out the
eight-point proposal put forward by Chinese President Jiang Zemin
and to promote economic, cultural and personnel exchanges between
the two sides of the Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
Xu Bodong, a professor of Beijing University, said that the
Taiwan authorities, in order to confront the one-China principle
and undermine the peaceful reunification of the motherland, have
gone too far by hanging around the "Tibet independence" forces.
</P>
<P>
The separatist action of the Taiwan authorities will
deteriorate relations across the Straits and be censured by all
Chinese people, including those in Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan, Xu
said.
</P>
<P>
According to Huang Jiashu, a professor of People's University
of China, Taiwan authorities' invitation of the Dalai Lama is
aimed at building the strength of their contention with the
mainland, promoting their "practical diplomacy" with the help of
Dalai Lama's "international influence", and containing Sino-US
relations by creating a new tense situation across the Straits.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the Dalai Lama wants to reinforce his "Tibet
independence" activity with the aid of "Taiwan independence"
forces, and at the same time raise money for his separatist
activities, the professor said.
</P>
<P>
In Taiwan, some senior religious figures refused to meet with
the Dalai Lama, which indicated that he was not engaged in pure
religious activities at all, but that he had political and
economic motives, the professor said.
</P>
<P>
Li Jiaquan, a professor of the Chinese Academy of Social
Sciences, said that some separatist forces and international
anti-China forces have attempted to impose pressures on the
Chinese government by means of political conspiracy to separate
Taiwan and Tibet from the motherland, but they are doomed to
failure.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Concerned About Russian-Armenian Arms Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Turkey said today it is concerned
over the illegal arms shipping from Russia to Armenia, saying it
would adversely affect the situation in this region.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Foreign Ministry Deputy Spokesman Sermet Atacanli told
a weekly press briefing here that there had been some illegal
arms shippings between Russia and Armenia in the past two years.
</P>
<P>
He said that Russian Minister for Cooperation with the
Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) Aman Tuleyev stated on
February 14 that Russia had sold 84 tanks and 50 armored combat
vehicles to Armenia in unlawful ways, and that was confirmed by
Russian Defense Minister Igor Rodionov recently.
</P>
<P>
These incidents have caused much concern from Turkey because
they will bring about a negative impact on peace and stability
in the region, Atacanli added.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the Turkish government hoped that the Russian
side would take all necessary measures to prevent similar
occurrences in the future.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Young Teacher of Arabic Enchanted by Arab Dancing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Wang Lan, a young Chinese lady
holding a doctor's degree of Arabic at a university in Beijing,
has dedicated herself to Arab dancing, in her spare time.
</P>
<P>
Wang, 31, teaches in the Arabic Department of the Beijing
University of Foreign Languages, but she is better known for
studying, performing and teaching Arab dancing.
</P>
<P>
In her middle school years, Wang studied Chinese folk dancing
at a song and dance ensemble for four years in southwest China's
Yunnan Province, acquiring solid dancing skills.
</P>
<P>
In 1982, she enrolled at the university in Beijing to study
Arabic, getting the chance to acquaint herself with Arab culture,
and became enchanted by Arab dancing.
</P>
<P>
"At first, I could only learn Arab dancing with the help of
video tapes, for there were few professional persons or special
institutions in China studying Arab folk arts," Wang said.
</P>
<P>
In 1992, she went to Cairo University to complete her doctor's
thesis in Arabic. In her spare time, she would go to another
university to systematically study Arab dancing. Her dancing
skills were raised to a new level.
</P>
<P>
When an Egyptian educational delegation was visiting China in
1995, Wang Lan orchestrated an evening party called "Wind from
Egypt", which was composed of short drama, dancing, poem recitation,
calligraphy, and chorus with a strong Arab flavor.
</P>
<P>
Her beautiful dance "Egypt in Dream" depicted a modern people's
reminiscence about ancient Egypt and won admiration from the
delegation members.
</P>
<P>
Hussain Kamel Bahaeddin, former Egyptian minister of education,
was quoted as saying that "the day at the (Beijing) university was
the happiest day during my stay in China."
</P>
<P>
In December, 1996, she won praise from the Chinese Ministry of
Culture for directing one Egyptian dance -- "Banana-plucking
Dance", which blended the Egyptian belt dance, club dance, and
courting dance.
</P>
<P>
At present, Wang Lan has indeed become a specialist in Arab
dancing. While lecturing on Arabic, she is also immersed in
teaching and performing Arab dancing, and occasionally
contributing articles to magazines on dancing.
</P>
<P>
However, she is not satisfied. "In addition to the study of
Arab dancing, I will introduce China's splendid folk culture to
Arabian people and enhance the understanding of the people of
China and the Arab world," Wang Lan said.

<HEADLINE> Gore Rules out Cutbacks in U.S. Troops in Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, March 24 (Xinhua) -- United States Vice President Al
Gore, together with Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto,
today ruled out the possibility of any cutbacks in U.S. military
presence in Japan and the rest of Asia.
</P>
<P>
During his 24 hours in Japan, part of an Asian tour that also
includes China and South Korea, Gore made clear that Washington
did not want changes in troop levels in Japan.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters after his one-hour meeting with Hashimoto
that his country would continue to maintain present troop levels
in East Asia, and reiterated the U.S. "commitment to Japan's
security and regional stability."
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto said Japan must fulfill its obligations under the
Japan-U.S. security treaty to provide facilities for the American
military, on a smooth and stable basis as long as the bilateral
relationship lasted.
</P>
<P>
"It is our responsibility to provide land and facilities (to
the U.S. military) in a stable and smooth manner," he said.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, the day of Gore's arrival, Hashimoto announced that
he planned to push through parliament a new law to seek continued
leases on private land used by U.S. bases on Okinawa, which are
due to expire May 14.
</P>
<P>
Anger against American forces in Okinawa boiled over after a
12-year-old girl was raped by three U.S. servicemen in September
1995.
</P>
<P>
An agreement has been reached on moving some U.S. facilities
out of Okinawa, but the island will continue to house more than
half of the 47,000 U.S. military personnel based in Japan, even
though it makes up only one percent of Japan's land mass.
</P>
<P>
The United States at present has about 100,000 troops in East
Asia, including Japan.

<HEADLINE> PNA Denies Accusation of Organizing Terror </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian security head
Jibril Rajoub denied today Israel's accusations that the
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) had given green-light to
terrorist attacks and even organized riots.
</P>
<P>
Rajoub was commenting on the claim issued by Israeli army
intelligence chief Moshe Yaalon at a new conference Sunday
night that Rajoub had played a double game in dealing with
Israel on fighting terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Yaalon was referring to the meeting held between Rajoub and
Israeli Public Security Minister Avigdor Kahalani earlier Sunday,
during which the two pledged to increase security cooperation
in fighting terror and preventing more violence.
</P>
<P>
He said that, on the other hand, Rajoub had organized the
Palestinian riots in the West Bank town of Hebron in the
past days, in which over 100 people were wounded.
</P>
<P>
Rajoub said Yaalon was apparently using the accusations to
cover his failure to prevent violence. He flatly denied his
personal involvement in the current violence. In the past days,
Palestinian police in fact have been trying hard to prevent
protesters from clashing with armed Israeli soldiers.
</P>
<P>
He also rejected the repeated claims by Israeli government
officials that PNA President Yasser Arafat had given the
green-light to extremist groups such as Hamas and Islamic
Jihad to launch terror attacks against Israel.
</P>
<P>
Hamas has claimed responsibility for last Friday's suicide
bombing in central Tel Aviv, which killed four people and
wounded dozens of others.
</P>
<P>
With the war of words escalating, tension remained high
today with Palestinian youths battled with Israeli soldiers for
the fourth day in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
Israeli soldiers had to evacuate Jewish prayers inside the
holy Rachel's Tomb in the West Bank city of Bethlehem after
hundreds of Palestinian protesters threw stones and petrol bombs
into the barbed compound.
</P>
<P>
Sporadic clashes also broke out in Gaza and the West Bank
city of Jericho, where Israeli soldiers fired tear gas and
rubber bullets to disperse the stone-throwing Palestinian youths.
But no major casualties resulted in the clashes as Palestinian
police worked hard to prevent the protesters from charging
forward against the Israeli soldiers.

HONG KONG, March 24 (Xinhua) -- A firm guidance has been
proposed by Hong Kong's Director of Education today for secondary
schools to progressively adopt Chinese as medium of instruction.
</P>
<P>
An official release said schools and sponsoring bodies will be
consulted in April and May before the proposals are finalized.
</P>
<P>
According to research findings, teaching and learning are more
effective if the medium of instruction is the mother tongue.
</P>
<P>
Under the firm guidance, Chinese will be the basic medium of
instruction for all local public sector secondary schools. They
should progressively adopt Chinese as the medium of instruction
for all subjects except English Language and other approved
commercial or technical subjects.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, teaching and learning of the English language in
schools will remain a government priority. Students' English
proficiency will continue to be enhanced.

<HEADLINE> China to Reduce TB Incidence Rate Drastically by Year 2000 (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TB control experts agreed that China, having one fourth of TB
patients in the world, would also have the danger of TB epidemic
if proper steps are not taken immediately.
</P>
<P>
China has reported six million TB patients, including 1.5
million pulmonary TB patients who can infect others. Incidence
rate in rural areas two times that in urban areas.
</P>
<P>
However, health officials said about half of China's counties
and population have not benefited from proper TB curing methods,
and local medics lack both funds and knowledge in battles against
the infectious disease.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Health will strengthen the work of registration
in order to discover new TB patients as soon as possible, building
a complete national network for TB control, and training more
local medics, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
He urged governments at all levels to allocate special funds to
support TB prevention and control work.
</P>
<P>
China has kicked off the world's biggest TB control project
since 1992, which was aided by the World Bank loans and covered a
population of 560 million in 12 provinces and autonomous regions.
</P>
<P>
The project, adopting DOTS or "directly observed treatment,
short course" which was introduced by WHO as the only way to
reduce the transmission of TB, has helped cure 92 percent of
pulmonary TB patients.
</P>
<P>
Impressed by the success of the TB control program, the WHO
director general, Haroshi Nakajima, wrote to Premier Li Peng in
1995, hailing China's progress as a model for the world.

<HEADLINE> China to Reduce TB Incidence Rate Drastically by Year 2000 (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 24 (Xinhua) -- China plans to control the
incidence rate of infectious pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) below
seven persons per 10,000 persons by the year 2000, a drop of 50
percent from 1990's figure.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the average cure rate of pulmonary TB patients will
be raised to 85 percent to meet a 2000-year goal set by the World
Health Organization (WHO), according to Minister of Health Chen
Minzhang.
</P>
<P>
That means, in the next four years, the number of pulmonary TB
patients in China will drop to some 840,000 from 1.5 million at
present.
</P>
<P>
"Considering that 10 to 15 additional people can be infected by
each patient annually, we may expect China to contribute greatly
to the worldwide battle against TB disease," said Prof. Zhang
Lixing, director of the Beijing International Institute for
Tuberculosis and Lung Health.
</P>
<P>
Both the health minister and Prof. Zhang attended a seminar
held here today on the occasion of the World TB Day, which was
launched by the WHO last year not only to mark the announcement by
Dr. Robert Koch in 1882 of the discovery of the bacillus which
causes TB, but also to warn people of the new global epidemic of
TB.
</P>
<P>
"Closely linked with the emergence of multi-drug resistant
strains of TB and the HIV/AIDS epidemic, TB has re-emerged as a
major public health problem in both developed and developing
countries," A.H.Schnur, acting representative of WHO's Beijing
Office, said at the seminar.
</P>
<P>
"This situation led to WHO declaring TB a global health
emergency in April 1993," he said.
</P>
<P>
Breakdowns published by WHO showed that among 1.7 billion
people who have been infected by TB, 20 million have developed
into TB patients, and about 3.5 million of them die every year.
</P>
<P>
The organization also predicted that in the coming decade
another 90 million people will possibly become TB patients and
more than 30 million possibly be killed by the disease.

<HEADLINE> S.Africa to Tighten VIP Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 24 (Xinhua) -- The South African Police
Services (SAPS) has been instructed by Safety and Security Minister
Sydney Mufamadi to tighten protection services for cabinet ministers
following recent burglaries on their houses, said a source here today.
</P>
<P>
Mufamadi has undertaken to ensure the reorganisation of the SAPS's
VIP Protection Unit and increased security around ministers and their
homes, said the source.
</P>
<P>
The measures followed latest burglay on Deputy President Thabo
Mbeki's residence at the government's exclusive Groote Schuur
Estate in Cape Town last Wednesday, in which a music system and a
camera were stolen.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki was out of the country on official business when the theft
was spotted. No forced entry was apparent during the incident.
</P>
<P>
During the past few weeks, a string of thefts from the residences
of ministers at the heavily-guarded Groote Schuur Estate had been
reported during the ministers' absence.
</P>
<P>
Among other goods, police recovered a gold watch belonging to
Finance Minister Trevor Manuel, a leather jacket of Correctional
Services Minister Sipo Mzimela and a clock radio belonging to Defence
Minister Joe Modise.
</P>
<P>
A break-in was also reported at President Nelson Mandela's Houghton
home in Johannesburg last year.
</P>
<P>
The repeated burglaries were a cause for serious concern, with the
ruling African National Congress spokesman Ronnie Mamoepa saying that
it was "mind-boggling" Mbeki's home could be violated in the presence
of members of the SAPS VIP Protection Unit.
</P>
<P>
"It will not be preposterous to suggest collusion or involvement of
the SAPS VIP Protection Unit in the matter," said Mamoepa on Sunday in
a statement in Cape Town.
</P>
<P>
However, the opposition National Party spokesman for safety and
security, Andre Fourie, said in response the police service should be
jacked up to protect the public.
</P>
<P>
Fourie was also critical of the highest attention being paid to
what he termed minor losses by cabinet ministers.
</P>
<P>
"How ridiculous that security for these minor losses by cabinet
ministers all of a sudden requires the highest attention. One can only
ask with tears in one's eyes: What about the man in the street?" he
added. enditem

<HEADLINE> Rafsanjani Calls U.S., Israel Worst Enemies of Muslims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Akbar Hashemi
Rafsanjani described here today the United States and Israel as
the worst enemies of Muslim countries.
</P>
<P>
"At the present time, America and Israel are leading the
hostility towards Muslims," Rafsanjani said when answering a
question at a news conference here.
</P>
<P>
He urged the Muslim countries to enhance their solidarity to
scuttle the conspiracies hatched by imperialist forces to
subjugate Islamic nations.
</P>
<P>
Iran opposes the U.S.-sponsored peace process in Middle East,
he said, there had been chances of revival of violence since the
launching of Washington's initiative.
</P>
<P>
The attitude of the United States towards the U.N. resolutions
condemning the Israeli plans for Jewish settlement had exposed its
real face to the Arab world, Rafsanjani said when responding to
another question.
</P>
<P>
"To me, the face of (U.S. President) Mr. Clinton sitting on a
wheel chair with a broken leg vetoing the resolutions on Palestine
twice within one week is very much similar to the face of (former
Israeli Foreign Minister) Moshe Dayan sitting on a tank shooting
the Palestinian people," he said.
</P>
<P>
"If there is any reward to be given to the world's top
extremist, (Israeli Prime Minister) Mr. Netanyahu should be
nominated for it," he said.
</P>
<P>
The reason was that the hardline shown by Netanyahu has
definitely called Muslims' awakening, he said.
</P>
<P>
"It should be understood that occasionally extremist move on
the other side also could help the Islamic world," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian President also expressed concern over the
"inappropriate" response of the Muslim world towards Israel's
adamant approach to building a Jewish settlement in Jerusalem, and
the U.S. veto on the Security Council resolutions condemning
Israeli moves.

<HEADLINE> NPC Chairman Meets Austrian National Council Delegation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Qiao Shi, chairman of the
Standing Committee of China's National People's Congress (NPC),
met with a delegation from the National Council of Austria led by
its president Heinz Fischer.
</P>
<P>
Extending a welcome to Fischer, an old friend of the Chinese
people who is on his fourth visit to China, Qiao recalled his
visit to Austria in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Qiao said he is convinced that Fischer's current visit is bound
to enhance his understandings about China, push forward the
cooperation between the two parliaments, and promote the
development of Sino-Austrian friendship.
</P>
<P>
Noting that China and Austria are two friendly nations without
any direct conflicts of interest, Qiao said that China has always
paid much attention to the development of long-term and stable
friendship and cooperation with Austria.
</P>
<P>
During the past few years, he said, with concerted efforts from
both sides, bilateral exchanges and cooperation in politics,
economy, trade, science, technology, culture and education have
been continuously expanding, and the friendship and mutual
understanding between the two peoples has gradually deepened.
</P>
<P>
Qiao went on to say that the constant contacts between leaders
of the two sides have created favorable conditions for the overall
development of bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Fischer said that China has scored great achievements in its
reform and opening up drive, as well as in its economic
development, and China is playing an increasingly important role
in international affairs.
</P>
<P>
He said he hoped to further strengthen cooperation between the
two parliaments.
</P>
<P>
At Fischer's request, Qiao talked about the achievements and
experience in China's reform and opening up drive, the coordinated
development of China's regional economies, and the role of the
people's congress in China's political system, as well as the
construction of China's socialist democracy and legal system.
</P>
<P>
Qiao also expressed his views on international situations and
explained China's foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
The Austrian delegation arrived here earlier today on an
official good-will visit to China at the invitation of the NPC
Standing Committee.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Chairman of the NPC Standing Committee Chen Muhua held
talks with Fischer this afternoon.

<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, March 24 (Xinhua) -- A strong explosion rocked a branch
office of the Dresdner Bank in western Germany early this morning,
causing extensive property damage. But there were no immediate
reports of injury.
</P>
<P>
Police investigating the case in Hattingen, in the North-Rhine
Westfalia state, ruled out the possibility that the Dresdner Bank
might be targeted because it, along with another large German
commercial bank, the Deutsche Bank, had participated in a
controversial takeover attempt by the German steel concern
Krupp-Hoesch against its larger rival Thyssen.
</P>
<P>
Two robbers, who were seen running from the scene after the
blast, had apparently tried to blow up a night safe. But they
failed to shift the protective steel mesh inside the safe, police
said.
</P>
<P>
The blast smashed windows, damaged the facade of the bank
building and destroyed the door and a bulletproof window of a
Deutsche Bank branch office on the other side of the street.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Wu Bangguo
conferred with Western Samoan Deputy Prime Minister Tuilaepa
Sailele Malielegaoi here today.
</P>
<P>
Wu said that with joint efforts, Sino-Western Samoan friendly
and cooperative relations have achieved sustained sound, and
stable development since the two countries were linked
diplomatically more than 20 years ago, although the international
situation has changed greatly.
</P>
<P>
He added that leaders of the two countries have had a exchange
of visits over the past years, and that bilateral cooperation has
been expanded year after year in economy, trade, and culture, with
evident progress being made.
</P>
<P>
A trade agreement to be signed between the two sides will help
boost bilateral cooperation on the basis of equality and mutual
benefit, and will provide easy access for smoothly expanding
bilateral trade between the two countries, Wu noted.
</P>
<P>
Tuilaepa Sailele Malielegaoi said that Western Samoa places
importance on advancing its relations with China, and that
bilateral relations have been close since the two countries forged
diplomatic ties.
</P>
<P>
The Western Samoan government adheres to its "one China"
policy, and will continue cooperating with China on issues of
common concern in the international forums, including the United
Nations, Malielegaoi said.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that his government and people thanked the
Chinese government and people for their long-time charitable
assistance and support to Western Samoa.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Wu expressed his appreciations to the Western Samoan
government for adhering to its "one China" stance.
</P>
<P>
Wu also briefed Malielegaoi on China's domestic political and
economic situation.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, both sides agreed that the two governments
should make joint efforts to push bilateral relations forward.

<HEADLINE> EDS-Adds Detail, Quotes US Vice-President Arrives in Beijing to Start China Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 24 (Xinhua) -- US Vice-President Al Gore arrived
in Beijing from Tokyo this evening on a five-day official visit to
China at the invitation of Chinese Premier Li Peng.
</P>
<P>
This is Gore's first trip to China since he took office in
1992. The vice-president is the highest-ranking US official to
visit China since the beginning of the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
In a written statement delivered upon his arrival, Gore said he
is pleased to visit China when the two countries mark the 25th
anniversary of the Shanghai Communique.
</P>
<P>
"I've traveled here to reaffirm the vital importance of
relations between our nations, and to continue building a lasting
peace between China and the United States," said the
vice-president.
</P>
<P>
He cited a poem entitled "On Stork Tower" by Chinese Tang
Dynasty Poet Wang Zhihuan -- "If you desire a grander sight, you
must scale a greater height."
</P>
<P>
To see the "currents of greater confluence" in US-China
relations, said Gore, "we must continue to climb the steps of
Stork Tower. That is why I'm here. And that is why our two
presidents will themselves ascend the tower in the coming months."
</P>
<P>
Gore said he looks forward to the discussions with President
Jiang Zemin, Premier Li Peng and other Chinese leaders.
</P>
<P>
The special plane carrying Gore, his wife, and a delegation
landed at 19:00 at Beijing's Capital Airport. The vice-president
was greeted by Chen Jinhua, chairman of the Chinese Government
Reception Committee and Minister in charge of the State Planning
Commission, Chinese Ambassador to the US Li Daoyu, and Chinese
vice-foreign minister Li Zhaoxing.
</P>
<P>
Among Gore's over-150-member delegation were Leon Fuerth,
assistant to the vice-president for national security affairs,
John Gibbons, science advisor to the president of the Science and
Technology Policy Office, Charles Curtis, deputy secretary of
energy, and other government officials.
</P>
<P>
The Vice-President is scheduled to hold talks with Premier Li
Peng on Tuesday following a welcome ceremony. He will also meet
with President Jiang Zemin, Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji,
Vice-President Rong Yiren, and Vice-Chairman of the Standing
committee of the National People's Congress Tian Jiyun during his
stay in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The vice-president's tight schedule covers participation in a
Sino-US seminar on environment and development, a speech on
Sino-US relations at Qinghua University, and a meeting with
Chinese scholars. He also will visit a high school and the Palace
Museum and go sightseeing at the Great Wall.
</P>
<P>
Apart from Beijing, Gore and his party will tour Xi'an, capital
city of northwest China's Shaanxi province, and China's biggest
metropolis of Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Gore's visit comes as Sino-US relations are improving after
President Jiang Zemin and President Bill Clinton met in Manila
last November. The visit is also seen as paving the way for the
exchange of state visits between Jiang and Clinton later this year
and the next.
</P>
<P>
US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright visited Beijing a
month ago, exchanging views with the Chinese side on bilateral
relations and international issues. That visit was seen by both
sides as being "helpful to maintaining the favorable momentum" in
bilateral ties.

<HEADLINE> Commentary: Effort to Evoke Colonialism Bound to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 24 (Xinhua) -- A spectre of colonialism is
still hovering over Africa.
</P>
<P>
Certain people, reluctant to lose their past paradise, are
nostalgically dreaming of a comeback of old and neo-colonialism
swept out of the African continent 30 years ago by the
torrential, surging tide of national independence.
</P>
<P>
Since last autumn, this handful of people, making an uproar
from both sides of the Atlantic, are doing their utmost to call
back colonialism, long cast aside by mankind as filth and dirt,
and advocating that the only way out for Africa is "reversing the
whole process (of decolonisation)" and actually "recolonising the
region."
</P>
<P>
Trevor Royle, autor of the book "Winds of Change: the End of
Empire in Africa", can be regarded as one of the outstanding
advocates of the "reversal" theory. Basing himself on the Great
Lakes crisis in central Africa which he describes as "African
nightmare", he has asserted that the "Africans are incapable of
ruling themselves", that only the European whites can save them.
He even went so far as to say that to stabilise the situation,
"any means necessary" can be resorted to, even if that meant
"bringing back the old system", including "the white man", who
Royle claims "still has a role to play in many African
countries", and so on and so forth.
</P>
<P>
Royle does not come singly. John Keegan, a so-called British
historian, also jumps out to preach "recolonisation". He wrote in
the Daily Telegraph that "the only way to curtail the bloodshed
and carnage" in Africa "was to reverse the decolonisation
process" and revive "old imperial values". In Royle's words, it
is "restoring a British presence in the region". Here "presence"
means out and out colonial rule.
</P>
<P>
While preaching "recolonisation" in Africa, these guardians of
colonialism also vigorously propagate the theory of "doom" for
Africa. Political columnist Matthew Parris of the Times in London
is a typical representative of those denounced by Kenyan
newspapers as "pessimists". He used his poisonous pen to give a
big publicity to the various negative sides of Africa, taking
much delight in talking about civil wars, violence, crisis,
natural calamities, refugees and Aids, etc. as though Africa is a
hell of misery. He then lamented that "things seem to be falling
apart across the African continent" and that "there is no hope
for Africa, no hope at all". Taking this lamentation of Parris'
as a treasure, Royle further declared that "the process of
decolonisation has been a dreadful failure", and hence returned
to his starting point that the only way out for Africa is
"recolonisation".

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Meanwhile, there is no lack of
such "heroes" like Royle on the other side of the Atlantic. These
"heroes" wantonly vilify one African country as having no
"democracy" and slander another one as depriving the people of
"human rights". They even insult African leaders by name. Their
representative is no other than Joshua Hammer, a former Nairobi
Bureau chief of the Newsweek magazine. After basking in the
sunshine and tasting the rich flavour of coffee in Kenya for
years, Hammer turned his face and said that he "is happy to be
out of Kenya" because Kenya would "collapse". He predicted that
Kenya will "disintegrate" when President Moi retires from
politics. Kenyan media naturally rejected this absurdity, saying
that contrary to Hammer's wishes, Kenya did not split in the
past, nor will it in the future. It is the "stability of Kenya"
that "has annoyed all those prophets of doom," a Kenyan newspaper
said.
</P>
<P>
Like Europe and America, Africa has its own problems. However,
all the scars and wounds in Africa can find their expressions on
the corpse of colonialism. Since Trevor Royle and Jushua Hammer
and their ilk can write books, they are certainly not ignorant of
the history of Africa.
</P>
<P>
History tells us that before the 15th century, Africa was
already renowned in the world for its Nile and Congo river
civilisations and not much backward compared with Europe except
that it was not so expansionist and predatory by nature as those
European pirates, while the U.S.A. was yet to be born. It was
after the intrusion of the first Portuguese merchandise ship into
Africa in the year 1415 that Europeans began thronging into this
continent and opened their history of invading Africa. They sold
black slaves, plundered resources, seized land, devided spheres
of influence among themselves, established colonial rule,
sabotaged and thwarted the economic and social development in
Africa and brought endless miseries to the African people.
</P>
<P>
The Second World War changed the face of the world and also
the fate of Africa. The post war 20-year history was just a
history of colonialism being buried in Africa. Beginning from
1950s, the surging tide of national liberation and independence
drove the colonialists out of the African continent. Trevor Royle
himself has admitted that even a few years ago no one dared to
say that "empire was better than independence".

<P>
NAIROBI, March 24 (Xinhua) -- However, it is just those who
built the Union Jack empire on the skeletons of Africans, those
who stood under the Stars and Stripes with their hands stained
with the blood of African freedom fighters such as Patrice
Lumumba and those who stirred up disturbances with their
"multiparty democracy" in Africa that are now laughing in
arrogance at the backwardness and unrest in Africa. While
discrediting Africa, they try to stage a comeback and restore
colonialism. They criticize Africa as having no "democracy", no
"human rights". Yet when Africa needs the joint effort of
international community to solve Zaire conflict, to save the tens
of thousands of refugees suffering in the flames of war and
groaning in illness, they cast their "human rights" to the winds,
hold their tongues and keep silent. Why so? They have their own
purposes. A Western ally of the United States describes this as a
"conspiracy of silence".
</P>
<P>
It is thought-provoking that those people who prescribed
"multiparty democracy" for Africa a few years ago are now
prescribing "recolonisation" for Africa. They first want to
reform Africa on their Western model, and then come back to rule
Africa once again. In advocating the restoration of colonialism,
they are actually bent on restoring their lost paradise.
</P>
<P>
The days are gone forever when colonialists could order about
in Africa. The African people have stood up firmly on their feet.
They are politically mature and progressing socially and
economically. They are doing their best and making painstaking
effort to solve their own problems. The Nairobi Summit 1, Nairobi
Summit 2 and the forthcoming Nairobi Summit 3 soon to be held in
Lome, capital of Togo, are evidence that Africans are capable of
managing their own affairs.

<HEADLINE> Israel Requests Arafat's Personal Intervention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Foreign Minister David
Levy today called on Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, currently
abroad, to return home to intervene personally in the current
crisis.
</P>
<P>
Levy said that Arafat should return home from abroad
immediately to make efforts to defuse the rising tension between
the two sides, the state-run Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Arafat is currently in Pakistan attending the summit of
Islamic Conference in a new bid to muster Arab and international
support in the dispute over Israel's plan to build a new Jewish
neighborhood in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
In a speech to the summit Sunday, Arafat appealed to the Muslim
world for help to save the holy city of Jerusalem from Israel's
policies.
</P>
<P>
Levy said the current crisis needed the highest level
intervention, so a summit meeting between Arafat and Israeli
Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu should be held to find a
solution.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister said he thought the peace process must
continue despite the difficulties, while reiterating Israel's
demands on Arafat's fulfilment of his obligations to combat
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Levy issued the call following a Palestinian spokesman's
rejection of Israel's demands on the Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) to take tougher measures to fight terrorism.
</P>
<P>
A statement released after the cabinet meeting Sunday night put
forward six points on demanding the PNA strengthen the fight
against terror and stop the anti-Israeli propaganda and violence.
</P>
<P>
The statement made it clear that no progress in the peace
process could be achieved before the PNA lived up to its
obligations of fighting against terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Nabil Abu Rudeineh, Arafat's media adviser, denounced the
Israeli demands as violations of the Interim Agreement signed by
the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Following the calls from Palestinian officials on his
mediation in the current crisis, Israeli President Ezer Weizman
held a meeting today with the United States' ambassador to Israel
Martin Indyk.
</P>
<P>
But it remained unclear whether the two had discussed
seeking ways to defuse the current Israeli-Palestinian tension
and revive the stalled peace talks.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 24 (Xinhua) -- The long-term cooperation between
US aircraft giant McDonnell Douglas and China will be even
stronger after the company merges with Boeing, said John
F. McDonnell, chairman of the Board of Directors of MD Corp, today
in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
After the merger, which creates the world's largest aircraft
and space corporation, is completed, no production line will be
arbitrarily closed, and the market will be identified according to
demand, Mr. McDonnell told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The merger, which was announced last December, is waiting for
approval from the US government and the shareholders of both
companies, but is expected to materialize this year.
</P>
<P>
Mr. McDonnell is here to review the progress of MD Corp.'s
co-production of MD-90 trunk aircraft with China and to
demonstrate the company's strong support to the program, he said.
</P>
<P>
"I will visit the four Chinese aircraft makers in Shenyang,
Xi'an, Chengdu and Shanghai, where the program is being
undertaken. I will also meet relevant Chinese officials of the
industry", he said.
</P>
<P>
Mr. McDonnell, who will become a member of the board of the
merged company, said that the new company will continue to support
both the production and sales of the China-produced MD-90 aircraft.
</P>
<P>
After reviewing MDC's 22-years cooperation with China, the
chairman said that China has already become a key market for MDC.
</P>
<P>
"The pace of China's development is amazing. We expect to
expand our cooperation with China", he said.
</P>
<P>
While MDC now holds about 20 percent of China's commercial
aircraft market, Mr. McDonnell expects the new company will hold a
majority market share and will continue to be committed to provide
the highest quality aircraft along with superior customer and
product support.

<P>
LUSAKA, March 24 (Xinhua) -- At least three children are killed
monthly in Lusaka in traffic accidents during their
water-fetching errands, a civic organization has claimed.
</P>
<P>
Zambia Independent Monitoring Team (ZIMT) President Alfred Zulu
said here on Sunday that his organization's recent survey shows that
apart from the traffic accident deaths, children and women are
under-going other inhuman ordeals like rape while they toil to fetch
water.
</P>
<P>
The Times of Zambia today quoted him as saying that some other
children fall into wells or eaten by crocodiles while drawing water.
</P>
<P>
He called on the government and authorities concerned to invest
heavily in the water sector and make water easily and safely
available to all.
</P>
<P>
Zulu said Zambia has the highest water availability per capita in
the southern African region which can be tapped through a huge
injection of private and public investment and appropriate
technologies.
</P>
<P>
Zulu made the remarks after touring water projects and plants in
rural areas as part of the commemoration of the World Water Day.

<HEADLINE> 3 Convicted Killers Hanged in Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Three Muslim Extremists convicted
of assassinating a prominent Sunni Muslim cleric were hanged at
dawn today in Beirut's Central Prison.
</P>
<P>
Their deaths raised to 11 the overall number of executions
since the end of Lebanon's civil war in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Those hanged were two Lebanese, Khaled Hamed, 27, and Ahmed
Al-Kassem, 24, and a Palestinian, Munir Abboud. They confessed
to be members of a radical Sunni group calling itself Osbat
Al-Ansar, or Partisans League.
</P>
<P>
The three were found guilty of murdering Sheikh Nizar Habali
as he emerged from his Beirut apartment to climb into his car on
July 31, 1995.
</P>
<P>
They were arrested shortly after they raked Halabi's
limousine with sub-machinegun fire in Beirut's Tarik Al-Jedideh
residential neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
Halabi headed the Islamic Welfare Projects Association, a
pro-Syrian Sunni group also known as Ahbash.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese President Elias Hrawi signed the death sentence last
Friday despite pleas for mercy made by several radical Muslim
groups.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese army and police took tightened security measures
since Sunday in Beirut and other major cities to head off
possible protests against the executions.

Nigeria on Sunday.
</P>

Local media reported today that the tragedy occurred at around
10:am in the town of Sagamu, Ogun State, when the nozzel of a pumping
machine fell to the concrete ground as anxious drivers were fighting
for it.

With a daily production of two million barrels of crude oil,
Nigeria is one of the largest oil producing country in the world.

<P>
LISBON, March 24 (Xinhua) -- World rally championship leader
Colin McRae of Britain took the lead in the Rally of Portugal
after the fourth stage on Monday in Figueira Da Foz.
</P>
<P>
The Subaru driver had led the event after the opening spectator
stage on Sunday but the results were declared null due to a damage
sustained to Finn Tommi Makinen's Mitsubishi brakes.
</P>
<P>
The problem, most likely caused when the car was weighed, meant
that Makinen was unable to put in a competitive time and was 12
seconds slower than McRae. Mitsubishi successfully appealed for
the stage results to be cancelled out.
</P>
<P>
Carlos Sainz of Spain also criticised the opening day's stage,
which was shortened from 3.7 kilometers to 1.5 because of
spectator problems. The Ford driver finished third at the end of
the fourth stage, seven second adrift of McRae.
</P>
<P>
However, the Spaniard announced to pull out of the fifth stage
due to gearbox trouble.

DAR ES SALAAM, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania's production of
prawns fell from 1,500 tonnes in 1978 to 500 tonnes in 1996.

<P>
Several sub-committees have been established for training a
total of 52,000 census conductors who would be mainly
college lecturers and students, high school teachers and senior
technicians.
</P>
<P>
The first census was conducted in Mozambique in 1980 when the

<HEADLINE> W. African Gas Project Runs into Hitch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 24 (Xinhua) -- The West African Gas Pipeline
Project, designed to transport Nigeria's natural gas to Ghana,
Togo and Benin, has run into a hitch.
</P>
<P>
According to a local newspaper, the Business Concord, today,
necessary funds and infrastructure are not yet in place.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a developer has not been appointed for the
260-million-U.S.-Dollar project, which is also being frustrated
by bureaucratic bottlenecks, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The four countries involved signed an agreement in September
1995 for the construction, maintenance and operation of the gas
pipeline, and a steering committee was later established
comprising ministers responsible for petroleum or their
representatives in the four countries.
</P>
<P>
However, the committee has failed in coordinating the requests
for funds from various international sources and appointing a
project developer, it said.
</P>
<P>
The project, which will make use of the associated gas being
flared in oil fields in Nigeria, is expected to save up to 500
million U.S. Dollars in energy costs over a 10-year period for
Ghana, Togo and Benin.
</P>
<P>
With the delay in beginning the construction, it is doubtful
whether the 1998 target for completion of the pipeline and other
facilities will be met.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai, China's industrial and
financial center, will continue to strengthen city infrastructure
construction and the development and opening up of the Pudong New
Area, and to guide fixed assets investment toward the service
trade.
</P>
<P>
An official of the municipal Statistics Bureau said that
Shanghai has invested 9.885 billion yuan (about 1.18 billion US
dollars) in fixed assets during the first two months of 1997, an
increase of 44 percent over the same period of 1996.
</P>
<P>
The investment in real estate was three billion yuan (about 357
million US dollars), up 2.1 billion yuan (about 250 million US
dollars) from the corresponding 1996 period, accounting for 30
percent of the municipal total fixed assets investment.
</P>
<P>
Spending on city infrastructure facilities, housing and service
trade in the first two months in 1997 was higher than the same
period of 1996. The Pudong New Area is still the construction
magnet, and has attracted a total investment of 3.035 billion yuan
(361 million US dollars), representing a 94 percent increase over
the same period of 1996.
</P>
<P>
Of the investment, the portion of domestic loans and foreign
funds has increased by 4.3 percentage points and 1.1 percentage
points, respectively, since the beginning of this year.

ISLAMABAD, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Akbar Hashemi
Rafsanjani said here today that his talks with the Arab leaders at
the OIC special summit helped clear the misunderstandings between
Iran and its Gulf neighbors "to a certain extent."
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani, who attended the OIC special summit held here
Sunday to celebrate Pakistan's golden jubilee, made the remarks
when answering a question at a news conference here today.
</P>
<P>
To another question, Rafsanjani said Iran had offered a gas
pipeline to India through Pakistan, However, Islamabad and New
Delhi could not strike an agreement and the proposed pipeline
would end in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
He said a "difficult and costly," project was under
consideration to provide gas to India through sea waters.
</P>
<P>
When asked about reports of a possible U.S. attack on Iran, he
said, "there are chances of any incident to take place at any
time."
</P>
<P>
However, he said Washington never benefited from harboring
animosity against Tehran.
</P>
<P>
On Afghanistan, the Iranian President said Iran did not provide
military assistance to any of the Afghan groups as "we are opposed
to war."
</P>
<P>
However, he said, Tehran had been providing humanitarian
assistance to Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Iran was not opposed to holding talks with the Afghan Taliban
militia, he said.
</P>
<P>
Teheran had invited the Taliban to attend the inter-Afghan
dialogue it hosted, but it did not turn up at the meeting, he
said.
</P>
<P>
When asked about the establishment of a economic community
among the Muslim countries, Rafsanjani said that it could not be
achieved until the economies of these countries develop to similar
levels.

<HEADLINE> Commentary: Effort to Evoke Colonialism Bound to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 24 (Xinhua) -- The following is a commentary
entitled "Effort to Evoke Colonialism Bound to Fail" by
correspondents Zhang Xijun and Chen Qimin:
</P>
<P>
A spectre of colonialism is still hovering over Africa.
</P>
<P>
Certain people, reluctant to lose their past paradise, are
nostalgically dreaming of a comeback of old and neo-colonialism
swept out of the African continent 30 years ago by the
torrential, surging tide of national independence.
</P>
<P>
Since last autumn, this handful of people, making an uproar
from both sides of the Atlantic, are doing their utmost to call
back colonialism, long cast aside by mankind as filth and dirt,
and advocating that the only way out for Africa is "reversing the
whole process (of decolonisation)" and actually "recolonising the
region."
</P>
<P>
Trevor Royle, autor of the book "Winds of Change: the End of
Empire in Africa", can be regarded as one of the outstanding
advocates of the "reversal" theory. Basing himself on the Great
Lakes crisis in central Africa which he describes as "African
nightmare", he has asserted that the "Africans are incapable of
ruling themselves", that only the European whites can save them.
He even went so far as to say that to stabilise the situation,
"any means necessary" can be resorted to, even if that meant
"bringing back the old system", including "the white man", who
Royle claims "still has a role to play in many African
countries", and so on and so forth.
</P>
<P>
Royle does not come singly. John Keegan, a so-called British
historian, also jumps out to preach "recolonisation". He wrote in
the Daily Telegraph that "the only way to curtail the bloodshed
and carnage" in Africa "was to reverse the decolonisation
process" and revive "old imperial values". In Royle's words, it
is "restoring a British presence in the region". Here "presence"
means out and out colonial rule.
</P>
<P>
While preaching "recolonisation" in Africa, these guardians of
colonialism also vigorously propagate the theory of "doom" for
Africa. Political columnist Matthew Parris of the Times in London
is a typical representative of those denounced by Kenyan
newspapers as "pessimists". He used his poisonous pen to give a
big publicity to the various negative sides of Africa, taking
much delight in talking about civil wars, violence, crisis,
natural calamities, refugees and Aids, etc. as though Africa is a
hell of misery. He then lamented that "things seem to be falling
apart across the African continent" and that "there is no hope
for Africa, no hope at all". Taking this lamentation of Parris'
as a treasure, Royle further declared that "the process of
decolonisation has been a dreadful failure", and hence returned
to his starting point that the only way out for Africa is
"recolonisation".
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, there is no lack of such "heroes" like Royle on the
other side of the Atlantic. These "heroes" wantonly vilify one
African country as having no "democracy" and slander another one
as depriving the people of "human rights". They even insult
African leaders by name. Their representative is no other than
Joshua Hammer, a former Nairobi Bureau chief of the Newsweek
magazine. After basking in the sunshine and tasting the rich
flavour of coffee in Kenya for years, Hammer turned his face and
said that he "is happy to be out of Kenya" because Kenya would
"collapse". He predicted that Kenya will "disintegrate" when
President Moi retires from politics. Kenyan media naturally
rejected this absurdity, saying that contrary to Hammer's wishes,
Kenya did not split in the past, nor will it in the future. It is
the "stability of Kenya" that "has annoyed all those prophets of
doom," a Kenyan newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Like Europe and America, Africa has its own problems. However,
all the scars and wounds in Africa can find their expressions on
the corpse of colonialism. Since Trevor Royle and Jushua Hammer
and their ilk can write books, they are certainly not ignorant of
the history of Africa.
</P>
<P>
History tells us that before the 15th century, Africa was
already renowned in the world for its Nile and Congo river
civilisations and not much backward compared with Europe except
that it was not so expansionist and predatory by nature as those
European pirates, while the U.S.A was yet to be born. It was
after the intrusion of the first Portuguese merchandise ship into
Africa in the year 1415 that Europeans began thronging into this
continent and opened their history of invading Africa. They sold
black slaves, plundered resources, seized land, devided spheres
of influence among themselves, established colonial rule,
sabotaged and thwarted the economic and social development in
Africa and brought endless miseries to the African people.
</P>
<P>
The Second World War changed the face of the world and also
the fate of Africa. The post war 20-year history was just a
history of colonialism being buried in Africa. Beginning from
1950s, the surging tide of national liberation and independence
drove the colonialists out of the African continent. Trevor Royle
himself has admitted that even a few years ago no one dared to
say that "empire was better than independence".
</P>
<P>
However, it is just those who built the Union Jack empire on
the skeletons of Africans, those who stood under the Stars and
Stripes with their hands stained with the blood of African
freedom fighters such as Patrice Lumumba and those who stirred up
disturbances with their "multiparty democracy" in Africa that are
now laughing in arrogance at the backwardness and unrest in
Africa. While discrediting Africa, they try to stage a comeback
and restore colonialism. They criticize Africa as having no
"democracy", no "human rights". Yet when Africa needs the joint
effort of international community to solve Zaire conflict, to
save the tens of thousands of refugees suffering in the flames of
war and groaning in illness, they cast their "human rights" to
the winds, hold their tongues and keep silent. Why so? They have
their own purposes. A Western ally of the United States describes
this as a "conspiracy of silence".
</P>
<P>
It is thought-provoking that those people who prescribed
"multiparty democracy" for Africa a few years ago are now
prescribing "recolonisation" for Africa. They first want to
reform Africa on their Western model, and then come back to rule
Africa once again. In advocating the restoration of colonialism,
they are actually bent on restoring their lost paradise.
</P>
<P>
The days are gone forever when colonialists could order about
in Africa. The African people have stood up firmly on their feet.
They are politically mature and progressing socially and
economically. They are doing their best and making painstaking
effort to solve their own problems. The Nairobi Summit 1, Nairobi
Summit 2 and the forthcoming Nairobi Summit 3 soon to be held in
Lome, capital of Togo, are evidence that Africans are capable of
managing their own affairs.

magazine. After basking in the sunshine and tasting the rich
flavour of coffee in Kenya for years, Hammer turned his face and
said that he "is happy to be out of Kenya" because Kenya would
"collapse". He predicted that Kenya will "disintegrate" when
President Moi retires from politics. Kenyan media naturally
rejected this absurdity, saying that contrary to Hammer's wishes,
Kenya did not split in the past, nor will it in the future. It is
the "stability of Kenya" that "has annoyed all those prophets of
doom," a Kenyan newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Like Europe and America, Africa has its own problems. However,
all the scars and wounds in Africa can find their expressions on
the corpse of colonialism. Since Trevor Royle and Jushua Hammer
and their ilk can write books, they are certainly not ignorant of
the history of Africa.
</P>
<P>
History tells us that before the 15th century, Africa was
already renowned in the world for its Nile and Congo river
civilisations and not much backward compared with Europe except
that it was not so expansionist and predatory by nature as those
European pirates, while the U.S.A. was yet to be born. It was
after the intrusion of the first Portuguese merchandise ship into
Africa in the year 1415 that Europeans began thronging into this
continent and opened their history of invading Africa. They sold
black slaves, plundered resources, seized land, devided spheres
of influence among themselves, established colonial rule,
sabotaged and thwarted the economic and social development in
Africa and brought endless miseries to the African people.
</P>
<P>
The Second World War changed the face of the world and also
the fate of Africa. The post war 20-year history was just a
history of colonialism being buried in Africa. Beginning from
1950s, the surging tide of national liberation and independence
drove the colonialists out of the African continent. Trevor Royle
himself has admitted that even a few years ago no one dared to
say that "empire was better than independence".
</P>
<P>
However, it is just those who built the Union Jack empire on
the skeletons of Africans, those who stood under the Stars and
Stripes with their hands stained with the blood of African
freedom fighters such as Patrice Lumumba and those who stirred up
disturbances with their "multiparty democracy" in Africa that are
now laughing in arrogance at the backwardness and unrest in
Africa. While discrediting Africa, they try to stage a comeback
and restore colonialism. They criticize Africa as having no
"democracy", no "human rights". Yet when Africa needs the joint
effort of international community to solve Zaire conflict, to
save the tens of thousands of refugees suffering in the flames of
war and groaning in illness, they cast their "human rights" to
the winds, hold their tongues and keep silent. Why so? They have
their own purposes. A Western ally of the United States describes
this as a "conspiracy of silence".
</P>
<P>
It is thought-provoking that those people who prescribed
"multiparty democracy" for Africa a few years ago are now
prescribing "recolonisation" for Africa. They first want to
reform Africa on their Western model, and then come back to rule
Africa once again. In advocating the restoration of colonialism,
they are actually bent on restoring their lost paradise.
</P>
<P>
The days are gone forever when colonialists could order about
in Africa. The African people have stood up firmly on their feet.
They are politically mature and progressing socially and
economically. They are doing their best and making painstaking
effort to solve their own problems. The Nairobi Summit 1, Nairobi
Summit 2 and the forthcoming Nairobi Summit 3 soon to be held in
Lome, capital of Togo, are evidence that Africans are capable of
managing their own affairs.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Ends Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 24 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar closed
higher today as the market awaits news on a possible rate-hike in
the States.
</P>
<P>
It ended at 78.68 US cents from 78.40 at Friday's close and
traded between 78.61 and 78.75 on the day.
</P>
<P>
A foreign exchange dealer said the local market was holding
short positions ahead of the long-awaited meeting concerning the
Federal Reserve's monetary policy.
</P>
<P>
This is because a rise in US official rates will reduce their
margin to Australian rates, making local securities less
attractive to global investors.
</P>
<P>
He forecast the local currency would fall below 78 US cents in
the short term, if a rate cut eventuated.
</P>
<P>
On the cross-rate, the Australian dollar was mixed, it ended at
96.74 from 96.84 against the Japanese yen, and at 1.3292 from
1.3235 against the Deutsche marks.

<HEADLINE> China Encourages Light Industrial Giant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 24 (Xinhua) -- China will encourage more mergers
and acquisition in its light industrial sector, hoping to form 100
conglomerates with annual sales volume of more than two billion
yuan by the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
"Such redistribution of assets allows the companies to expand
at a low cost and will help to increase their competitiveness
greatly," said an official with the General Association of Light
Industry.
</P>
<P>
The government will also grant financial support to industry
leaders in the sector, for mergers of poorly-performing
enterprises and technical upgrading.
</P>
<P>
Firms of a certain size will be authorized to open non-banking
institutions and financial companies of their own, and will raise
funds by floating corporate bonds and stocks.
</P>
<P>
They will also receive more freedom for exports to promote
their product image in the international market and build up their
own strength.
</P>
<P>
China's light industry rose at a stable rate last year, with
the export of its products keeping relatively high growth.
</P>
<P>
Industrial leaders have emerged in the sector, dominating the
market as their strength increases. Producers of refrigerators,
freezers, washing machines and air conditioners already have
increased their market share to 93 percent, 88 percent, 83 percent
and 58 percent, respectively.

<HEADLINE> Retail of Consumer Goods Grows in Shanghai in February </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Recent data show that retail of
consumer goods in Shanghai has kept growing in the past two
months, hitting 11 billion yuan in total value in February, up
five percent from February 1996.
</P>
<P>
Official sources say that the actual growth of the sales volume
of retailed consumer goods was 4.1 percent, if the factors of
inflation were excluded.
</P>
<P>
All Chinese people celebrated their traditional Spring Festival
and the Lantern Festival in February this year, which continued
the brisk purchasing of Shanghai people from the beginning of this
year, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Major department stores, including those in Huangpu District
and Nanjing Street, in Shanghai, also grabbed the chance to sell
their wares through numerous promotion activities.
</P>
<P>
The sales volume of consumer goods for daily use surge 5.1
percent in February from the same period of last year, topping
4.35 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the sale of color TV sets in 16 major department
stores increased by more than 30 percent, with the sale of video
compact disc machines 11 times that in last February.
</P>
<P>
A sharp growth of gold ornaments was also seen in February
because of a price cut. The combined monthly sales volume of two
major stores of gold products rose by 23.2 percent, to 84.8
million yuan last month.
</P>
<P>
Brisk sales of consumer goods also took place in the suburban
Shanghai, that saw a growth rate of retailed consumer goods above

<HEADLINE> Roundup: African Leaders Step Up Peace Efforts to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOME, March 24 (Xinhua) -- An extraordinary summit of the
Organization of African Unity (OAU) will be held in Lome, capital
of Togo, on March 26 on the escalating Zairean crisis.
</P>
<P>
Just on the eve of the OAU mini-summit, a meeting called
Nairobi Summit III will also be convened here to seek a lasting
peaceful solution to the Zaire conflict.
</P>
<P>
It is apparent that African leaders are stepping up their
efforts to bring peace to the war-torn country, indicating
Africa's commitment to resolving its own problems.
</P>
<P>
Since taking up arms in eastern Zairea last October, the
Tutsi-led rebels have controlled one fifth of the Zairean
territory, the third largest country in Africa.
</P>
<P>
They are still advancing on several fronts, threatening to end
the 32-year-old rule of President Mobutu Sese Seko and topple his
government.
</P>
<P>
Asked about which side the OAU supports, OAU Secretary-General
Salim Ahmed Salim said that "we support the end of the conflict
and the work toward this goal", stressing that "we are totally
committed to the unity, stability, security and territorial
integrity of Zaire".
</P>
<P>
Considering that Africa's conflicts must be resolved by
itself, African leaders have been making diplomatic efforts to
end the Zaire conflict affecting the entire Great Lakes region
since its outbreak.
</P>
<P>
Until now, Kenya has hosted three regional summits initiated
by President Daniel arap Moi to discuss how to bring peace back
to Zaire.
</P>
<P>
The African leaders present at the Nairobi Summit I on
November 5 recommended that the United Nations deploy a neutral
security force in eastern Zaire to open up temporary sanctuaries
and safe corridors for displaced persons and returning refugees
to Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
And the December 16 Nairobi Summit II mandated four heads of
state of Kenya, Zimbabwe, South Africa and Cameroun to work out a
formula for the restoration of peace in Zaire.
</P>
<P>
Early this year, Kenyan President Moi went to Zaire to meet
Zairean President Mobutu and discussed with him the worsening
situation in Zaire and the peace efforts of the regional leaders.
</P>
<P>
All these peace efforts by African leaders have contributed to
the adoption of a five-point peace plan on Zaire by the United
Nations Security Council on February 18.
</P>
<P>
The peace plan provides for an immediate ceasefire, the
withdrawal of all foreign forces from Zaire, negotiations and
elections and the protection of refugees.
</P>
<P>
The Zairean government has accepted the peace plan while the
rebels still insist on negotiations before a ceasefire.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: African Leaders Step Up Peace Efforts to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOME, March 24 (Xinhua) -- The conflicting parties were urged
to "unconditionally accept and implement" the peace plan by the
African leaders at the March 19 summit in Nairobi, capital of
Kenya, which called for a truce and talks.
</P>
<P>
They also underscored the importance of establishing a
mechanism for the implementation of the U.N. peace plan, to which
they said Africa should make "its own significant contributions".
</P>
<P>
At the summit, Zaire was represented by Prime Minister Kengo
wa Dondo and it is the first time that Zaire has attended such a
meeting. "With Zaire's participation" in the one-day summit, "the
search for peace will indeed gain considerable momentum", said
President Moi.
</P>
<P>
Zaire did not turn up in the last two Nairobi summits for the
attendance of Uganda and Rwanda, which are accused by Zaire of
sending troops to fight in eastern Zaire along with the rebels.
Both deny the charge.
</P>
<P>
Late February, South African President Nelson Mandela met a
special envoy of President Mobutu and rebel leader Laurent Kabila
separatedly to explore possibilities of direct negotiations
between the two warring sides.
</P>
<P>
Mandela's bid for peace in Zaire could be the start of a
genuine African effort to seize the initiative in resolving
Africa's conflicts, analysts noted.
</P>
<P>
One of his advisers said President Mandela is anxious to bring
the initiative for conflict resolution and control of the process
back to the African continent, because he sometimes feels that
western countries do not always act in the best interests of
Africa.
</P>
<P>
With the exception of France which has been calling for
international intervention, western powers like the United States
are reluctant to send troops for peacekeeping in Zaire.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said as Zaire has lost its strategic importance,
western powers turn cold shoulders to the Zairean crisis.
</P>
<P>
However, in his talks with Mandela on March 20, U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan urged African countries including
South Africa to play a larger role in peace-keeping operations in
their own continent.
</P>
<P>
Both Annan and Mandela said they are optimistic about a
peaceful solution to the Zairean conflict.
</P>
<P>
This special OAU summit is expected to focus, among other
things, on how to persuade the two warring sides to pursue an
immediate ceasefire and direct negotiations which would create
the necessary environment to facilitate a peaceful settlement to
the crisis.

<HEADLINE> Forged Zambian Currency Notes in Circulation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Bank of Zambia has warned the
public that forged local currency notes with the highest

LUSAKA, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Government leaders of the Common
Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) are expected to
discuss the introduction of a U.S. Dollar-pegged currency for the
region and the establishment of zero tariffs among member states.
</P>
<P>
This was revealed here on Sunday by COMESA Acting General
Secretary Joel Mwenche who said a COMESA summit meeting will be
convened in Lusaka early next month.
</P>
<P>
The proposed new regional currency is to replace the recently
abolished Uapta currency that was used in the organization in the
past. Mwenche said: "The issue has been approved by COMESA
central bank governors."
</P>
<P>
Apart from approving the new currency, the heads of states
will also seriously consider the movement of COMESA member states
towards the establishment of zero tariffs among them, which should
be in place by the year 2000, according to Mwenche.
</P>
<P>
COMESA was formed by 20 countries in eastern and southern
Africa in 1994 to replace the old organization of Preferential
Trade Area (PTA) of Eastern and Southern Africa for further
economic integration in the region.

<P>
SHANGHAI, March 24 (Xinhua) -- The first plant in China to
produce maintenance-free car batteries has been launched in
Pudong, Shanghai, the country's trade and financial hub.
</P>
<P>
The plant was jointly set up by the American Delphi Automotive
Systems, and the Shanghai Electronics Company. The two partners
poured 55 million US dollars in total investment in the project.
</P>
<P>
Delphi officials said that the plant is the biggest project in
China that Delphi Automotive System has been involved in. The
companies had set up 11 joint ventures in China previously.
</P>
<P>
Production is to start early next year. The plant expects to
output one million batteries by the the end of the year.

Some anti-pollution devices will be installed in the plant to
keep water, air, and noise pollution to a minimum.
</P>
<P>
Industrial sources noted that there is a lot to be tapped in
Shanghai's market of auto-parts, since automobile industry is a

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 24 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong and Thailand
governments today signed an air services agreement, an official
announcement said today.
</P>
<P>
A Hong Kong government spokesman said the agreement would
provide the necessary legal framework to ensure Hong Kong's air
links with Thailand would continue smoothly after June 30, 1997.
</P>
<P>
He said the Thailand market was important for Hong Kong's
Cathay Pacific and Dragonair. Cathay Pacific currently operates 35
services per week to Bangkok and Dragonair three services per week
to Phuket. Both airlines together carried a total of some 0.9
million passengers in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The Thai Airways operates 46 services per week to Hong Kong,
carrying some 1.04 million passengers in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Rebels Penetrate Southwestern Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Rebels of the Allied
Democratic Forces (ADF) have penetrated into southwestern Uganda
since they had sustained heavy loss in the west, "the New Vision"
reported today.
</P>
<P>
"While the number of ADF rebels in Rwenzori mountain ranges in
Kasese is steadly decreasing, there are reports about increased
rebel movements in forests of Bushenyi, Rukungiri and Kisoro
districts," a security official in Kasese district told the
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The security official asking to be remained anonymous said
there has been a bitter clash between the government troops and
ADF rebels in Bushenyi district on Wednesday. An unspecified
number of rebels were killed in the battle, and some government
soldiers had also been wounded.
</P>
<P>
ADF initially intended to establish their bases in the
Rwenzori Mountain areas in Kasese District in the west since they
invaded Uganda last November. Two months later, the Ugandan
authority announced they have uprooted the hideouts of ADF rebels in
the mountain, but there were still some remnants in the district.
Later reports said some ADF rebels surviving the mopping-up
operations of the government troops infiltrated into Kabarole
district east of Kasese, and Bushenyi district south of Kasese
district. Rugungiri and Kisoro are still south of Bushenyi and
are bordering Zaire.
</P>
<P>
ADF had some 1,000 soldiers in its ranks last November but now
has some small scattered groups. But an earlier report said ADF
rebels abducted some 800 civilians and are trying to
train them.
</P>
<P>
More than 20,000 local people have been displaced since
February in Kasese District due to the persistent harassment of
ADF, a local official told the newspaper.

<HEADLINE> Interview: HK Association of Banks Chairman Confident in HK's Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Chris Langley, chairman of the
Hong Kong Association of Banks, has voiced full confidence in the
future of Hong Kong as an international financial center.
</P>
<P>
"To me, there is no question Hong Kong is already a preeminent
international financial center," Langley said in a recent
interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
"And what is going to ensure the continuing preeminence of Hong
Kong is its increasingly close linkage with the economy of the
Chinese mainland as that economy continues to grow and prosper,"
the banker noted.
</P>
<P>
Langley is also general manager Hong Kong and China of the
Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (HongkongBank), the
largest bank in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"I'm naturally very pleased to have the opportunity to be the
chairman (of the association) in the very special year," he said.
</P>
<P>
The association is a representative body of all licensed banks
in Hong Kong and its chairmanship rotates among the three
note-issuing banks -- Bank of China, HongkongBank and Standard
Chartered Bank.
</P>
<P>
Langley pointed out that Hong Kong is "the only international
financial center which can represent itself as a gateway to and a
services center for China."
</P>
<P>
The very favorable location will "become more and more
favorable" as the economy of the Chinese mainland develops, he
said.
</P>
<P>
And in terms of corporate regional headquarters, Hong Kong
outnumbered every other country and region in Southeast Asia put
together, he said.
</P>
<P>
That's very important statistics as a certain number of centers
like to "talk quite loudly" about their success in attracting
regional headquarters, he added.
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure they are successful, but they are not in the same
league as Hong Kong is, because no other centers can replicate the
basic advantages of location, scales and the success record that
Hong Kong has."
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong is well-known as a place where "the entire range of
financial services, from insurance to most sophisticated financial
 derivatives, are all available," Langley stressed, adding that
over 85 of the world's top 100 banks operate in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
And after the handover, the financial system of Hong Kong will
remain unchanged as guaranteed by the Basic Law and the principle
of "one country, two systems".
</P>
<P>
So briefly, "I'm very confident indeed of the future of Hong
Kong as an international financial center," Langley said.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the morale of local financial sector in the final
lap of the transition period, the chairman claimed: "The
confidence level of the industry remains very high."
</P>
<P>
"Our bank has always taken a view that on July 1 and
thereafter, it's going to be business as usual," he added.
</P>
<P>
"And business as usual, as far as we can tell, from projections
we have and projections government has, means good business," he
explained.
</P>
<P>
Based on last year's 4.6 percent rise in the gross domestic
product, a higher rate -- 5.5 percent -- was predicted for this
year.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong stepped into the year 1997 with very buoyant stock
and property markets, with consumer spending being maintained at
high levels.
</P>
<P>
Besides, good tourist figures are foreseeable as there will be
a lot of interest in Hong Kong during the historic year, while
trade volumes are expected to rise as well.
</P>
<P>
"So confidence is there and people are looking forward to a
better year in 1997 than in 1996," Langley reassured.
</P>
<P>
The whole spectrum of the banking sector performed very well in
1996, with an average of 21 percent profit growth recorded,
according to figures released here last week by a global
investment bank, Lehman Brothers.
</P>
<P>
The 53-year-old banker has served the HSBC Group, of which
HongkongBank is a founding member, for more than 30
years. Responsible for HongkongBank's operations in both Hong Kong
and the Chinese mainland, Langley called himself "a regular
visitor" to Beijing, Shanghai and other major Chinese cities.
</P>
<P>
"I was always most impressed by the progress I see," he said.
</P>
<P>
HongkongBank has six branches and four representative offices
in the mainland and is still expanding its business involvement
there.
</P>
<P>
"We are very interested in increasing our presence. We regard
China as a very major opportunity for our bank," the banker said.
</P>
<P>
He expected much more "cross-flow business opportunities" for
Hong Kong and the mainland after the handover.
</P>
<P>
Although there is already a huge amount of business done
between Hong Kong and the interior areas, it is just the
beginning, he said. "We are on the first step of a very, very
exciting power."

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 24 (Xinhua) -- The Commonwealth Africa
Investment Fund (COMAFIN), an initiative setup to assist the
development of Commonwealth states, would join forces with South
African companies interested in investing in neighboring and
regional countries.
</P>
<P>
The local daily Companies and Markets today quoted COMAFIN
Chairman Joseph Pillay as saying that the organization would be
holding discussions with interested businessmen and he hoped the
discussions would lead to joint venture partnerships in the near
future.
</P>
<P>
The organization was launched by South African President
Nelson Mandela in London last July in a bid to link Commonwealth
states in Africa with their counterparts across the world through
cross-border investments and project initiatives, Pillay said.
</P>
<P>
Investors in the fund included the Commonwealth Development
Corporation, the Development Bank of South Africa, and the
governments or investment agencies of Botswana, Brunei, Malaysia,
Singapore and Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
COMAFIN had already committed about 63.5 million U.S. dollars
for projects in Commonwealth Africa.
</P>
<P>
Of the total, 7.3 million U.S. dollars has been invested in
four projects in Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
These projects covered the areas of intensive agriculture,

<HEADLINE> Geographic Information System Makes Social Research Easy: Workshop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Researchers attending a
workshop here today explored the advances in using a geographic
information system (GIS) in population analysis and economic
development.
</P>
<P>
The GIS is a computerized system for collecting geographic data
 and information from various sources such as satellite or aerial
pictures. These data can be used to study landscape, to analyze
population changes, to develop social and economic policies and
even to work out marketing strategies.
</P>
<P>
A workshop, organized by the Chinese University of Hong Kong,
was opened here today to provide chances for researchers to
exchange their views on how to apply the system worldwide. The
participants came from Hong Kong, Taiwan, the Chinese mainland,
the United States and the United Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Professor Lin Hui of the Chinese University of Hong Kong, also
chairman of the two-day workshop, said that the GIS is of great
help to those who have to handle a great deal of data carefully
and precisely when they devise development strategies or tap
geographical issues such as migration, urbanization and
environmental changes.
</P>
<P>
Relying the GIS, Prof. Lin would speak at the workshop about
the economic implications of the Beijing-Kowloon railway in
China. Other topics include the role of the GIS in handling
population problems in China, Europe and the United States, and
many other social and economic issues.

<HEADLINE> IMAX Film on African Elephant being Shot in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 24 (Xinhua) -- An IMAX film on the African
elephant is being shot by an Australian crew in the Amboseli
National Park of Kenya, the East African Standard reported today.
</P>
<P>
The film is expected to be completed in July this year and to
be seen by more than 100 million people the world over in 1998,
the paper said.
</P>
<P>
According to Michael Laulfield, Producer/Director of the film
"the African Elephant", the decision on Kenya as a location was
made after rejecting other sites in Africa, including South
Africa, Tanzania, Zimbabwe and Botswana.
</P>
<P>
There has been a lot of research on the elephant in the park
for the last 23 years, resulting in extensive data about African
elephants.
</P>
<P>
Because of this, Laulfield noted, the scientific consultant of
the film was very favorable of Amboseli as the location.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that the 40 minutes large-than-life IMAX screen
feature will not be shown in Kenya as there are only 200 IMAX
screens in the world and only one in Africa.
</P>
<P>
The film producer noted that his crew is taking pictures in
the open jungle using a platform, adding that in the Amboseli,
one can get closer to the elephant than anywhere else in the
world.
</P>
<P>
"The elephants come right up to the platform and some even use
their trunks to nudge our feet, which is impossible elsewhere,"
he disclosed.
</P>
<P>
Laulfield paid tribute to Kenyans on what they are doing in
the conservation of wildlife, but said that the conflict between
the people and the elephant should be discussed fully.
</P>
<P>
The film director described the wildlife as an enormous
economic asset and an "important African resource", adding that
the lifting of the ban on ivory trade would be disastrous.
</P>
<P>
The film's scientific consultant, Ian Douglas Humilton, who
has been working with the African elephant for the last 30 years,
believed that the lifting of the ban on ivory trade would wipe
out the elephant population in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Hamilton, who has written two books on the African elephant
including "Battle for the Elephant in 1992", noted that since the
implementation of the ban, the number of the African elephant had
stabilized, if not increased.

<HEADLINE> Bean Inoculation Recommended </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, March 24 (Xinhua) -- A Ugandan scientist recommended
bean inoculation to boost growth and increase production of soyabenas
in the field, the New Vision reported today.
</P>
<P>
Martin Wamaniala, a sicentist working with Agribusiness
Development Center of Uganda, said that soyabean crop responds
positively to application of inoculation prior to planting.
</P>
<P>
The recommended inoculant is rhizobium produced by the
Department of Soil Science and Kakira Oil Mill's laboratory in
Makerere University here.
</P>
<P>
Inoculation of the seeds for planting should be done on the
planting day and if the planting is not done then the seeds should be
inoculated again before planting to secure the seeds are properly
inoculated.
</P>
<P>
Ten kilogram of seed should be mixed with a liter of water to
which one tea spoon of sugar is added to assist the rhizobium to
stick to the seeds. enditem

BONN, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Latvian Prime Minister
Andris Skele said today that it was dangerous to keep the Baltic
states out of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and
the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
In a speech to German bankers in Frankfurt, Skele warned that
it could create a breeding ground for conflict between the East

the two organizations.
</P>
<P>
"We think it is impermissible to leave any grey zone where
conflict between the East and the West could germinate anew,"
Skele was quoted by the Deutsche Presse-Agentur as saying.
</P>
<P>
The NATO and EU memberships would contribute to the security of
the Baltic states as well as the rest of Europe, he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that his country needed to further integrate its
economy into Western Europe.

<HEADLINE> Rafsanjani Calls U.S., Israel Worst Enemies of Muslims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Akbar Hashemi
Rafsanjani described here today the United States and Israel as
the worst enemies of Muslim countries.
</P>
<P>
"At the present time, America and Israel are leading the
hostility towards Muslims," Rafsanjani said when answering a
question at a news conference here.
</P>
<P>
He urged the Muslim countries to enhance their solidarity to
scuttle the conspiracies hatched by imperialist forces to
subjugate Islamic nations.
</P>
<P>
Iran opposes the U.S.-sponsored peace process in Middle East,
he said, there had been chances of revival of violence since the
launching of Washington's initiative.
</P>
<P>
The attitude of the United States towards the U.N. resolutions
condemning the Israeli plans for Jewish settlement had exposed its
real face to the Arab world, Rafsanjani said when responding to
another question.
</P>
<P>
"To me, the face of (U.S. President) Mr. Clinton sitting on a
wheel chair with a broken leg vetoing the resolutions on Palestine
twice within one week is very much similar to the face of (former
Israeli Foreign Minister) Moshe Dayan sitting on a tank shooting
the Palestinian people," he said.
</P>
<P>
"If there is any reward to be given to the world's top
extremist, (Israeli President Benjamin) Mr. Natanyahu should be
nominated for it," he said.
</P>
<P>
The reason was that the hardline shown by Natanyahu has
definitely called Muslims' awakening, he said.
</P>
<P>
"It should be understood that occasionally extremist move on
the other side also could help the Islamic world," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian President also expressed concern over the
"inappropriate" response of the Muslim world towards Israel's
adamant approach to building a Jewish settlement in Jerusalem, and
the U.S. veto on the Security Council resolutions condemning
Israeli moves.

<P>
ABU DHABI, March 24 (Xinhua) -- The Sultanate of Oman has
rejected Israel's application for participating in an
international fair it hosts in October in view of the stalemated
Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Al Ettehad, a United Arab Emirates daily, today quoted Ali Saed
Alhaeg, general director of the Omani company of the fair and the
international trade, as confirming that the Omani authorities
turned down Israel's application in the 4th Muscat event.
</P>
<P>
As for the reasons for the refusal, the official said that the
stumbling of peace process in the Middle East was one of the
reasons.
</P>
<P>
All Arab states will participate in the fair so Oman decided
not to accept the Israeli request, he added.
</P>
<P>
Israel established economic relations with Oman last
May. However, the Omani government declared to stop all trade ties
with Israel at the meeting of Declaration of Damascus held last
December in Cairo, Egypt.

</P>
<P>
The eight streets to be rebuilt include "Fu'an Street" and
"Rongye Street", which are about a century old. After being
rebuilt, these streets will be widened to 30 to 40 meters, putting
on a new face.
</P>
<P>
Modern buildings will be built along both sides of the eight
streets for residents to live in, who have moved out from those
shattered houses.
</P>
<P>
Sources say that local residents have been so pleased with the
government's move that they call it a "Benefit People" project.
</P>
<P>
Tianjin has paid great attention to construction of roads over
the past few years, having built three ring roads around the city
and 14 roads radiating to connect the city's center with its outer
areas.
</P>
<P>
But traffic jams still took place in the crowded old urban
areas frequently, and the houses there were ruined.
</P>
<P>
So the Tianjin municipal government raised 1.6 billion yuan
this year to fund reconstruction of the old urban areas.
</P>
<P>
Local observers say that this is a stepping-stone for Tianjin
to build itself into an international metropolis.

<HEADLINE> Asian Power Industry To Offer More Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 24 (Xinhua) -- The power industry in Asia is
predicted to offer more investment opportunities than any other
sectors in the next five years.
</P>
<P>
Thomas Chesser, head of regional power research of BZW Asia
Limited, said that the power industry has become a favorite with
institutional investors because of its stability in profit
earning, transparency in operation and predictability in future
performance.
</P>
<P>
He estimated that independent power producers (IPPs) will
account for 30 to 40 percent of all new generating assets over the
next few years thanks to the liberation of power markets in many
Asian countries. The IPPs are set to play a more important role in
boosting the regional electricity output.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the total market capitalization of Asian power
stocks has reached 69 billion US dollars, of which only 35 percent
are free float shares, according to BZW Asia. Moreover, about
half of the free float stocks are dominated by Hong Kong power
generators, showing that the power sectors in most part of Asia
are still undergoing a process of liberalization.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Chesser forecast that the free float shares will double in
two or three years to make Asian power stocks a lucrative
investment. BZW Asia estimated that initial public offerings by
Asian power companies will amount to 15 to 20 billion US dollars
in the next two years, and China, pushed by huge demand, will take
the lion's share of the increased generating power.
</P>
<P>
BZW, a division of Barclays Bank PLC, is responsible for
wholesale banking, securities dealing and investment banking
services within the Barclays Group.

The Beijing Telecommunication's GSM network, first launched in
April 1995, now has a capacity of 250,000 handsets with more than
200,000 subscribers.
</P>
<P>
Over the past two years, Beijing has expanded the mobile
telecommunications network three times.
</P>
<P>
China's telecommunication GSM network has been linked with more
than 250 prefectures and 1,170 counties across the country and
opened roaming function in several countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
By the end of this year, the country will offer the GSM service
in 300 prefectures and 1,400 counties, according to a national
plan.

<HEADLINE> World TB Day Held in Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong Opened its World TB
Day in Time Square this morning to call for concerted effort to
combat tuberculosis in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
At the opening ceremony of the "World TB Day" held here this
morning, Katherine Fok, secretary for Health and Welfare, said
that despite all the breakthroughs in the prevention and treatment
of the disease, tuberculosis remains a threat to the world.
</P>
<P>
She said that tuberculosis can become a main cause of death in
Hong Kong if people are not on the vigilance in combating the
disease.
</P>
<P>
In Hong Kong, there are about 6,000 new TB cases each year and
the situation should not be overlooked.
</P>
<P>
She said that appropriate treatment and strengthening of public
education remain the most effective ways to prevent and combat
tuberculosis.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that about one third of the world's population
are infected with the disease which claims some 3 million lives a
year.
</P>
<P>
She noted that the World Health Organization had called for the
adoption of the DOTS (Directly Observed Treatment Short-course)
treatment which Hong Kong had already adopted in the 1970s and
should be considered very advance on this aspect.
</P>
<P>
In addition, there are 17 TB and Chests Clinics under the
Department of Health which provide free services to TB patients
throughout the territory.
</P>
<P>
On public education, she said she hoped that the community
could render their support to activities that promote
understanding of tuberculosis.
</P>
<P>
The World TB Day exhibition held in Times Square today was
organized by the Department of Health, Hospital Authority and the
Hong Kong Tuberculosis, Chest and Heart Disease Association.

WASHINGTON, March 23 (Xinhua) -- European ATP Tour players have

<P>
The group was founded last week with world number-two Thomas
Muster of Austria tipped to represent top ten players.

There are 64 Europeans among the ATP's top 100 players, and

unhappy to see the circuit's European office moved from Monaco to
London.
</P>
<P>
ATP chief executive officer Mark Miles said greater political
involvement by European players was welcome and that their voting
power, if organized, could ensure a European member on the board

<HEADLINE> PNA Rejects Israel's New Demands on Advancing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 24 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) today rejected Israel's demands that conditioned
progress in the peace process on its hardening fight against
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Nabil Abu Rudeineh, media adviser to PNA President Yasser
Arafat, told the Israel Radio that he was "shocked" at the new
conditions set by the Israeli government on advancing the peace
process which is facing a deepening crisis following the recent
wave of violence.
</P>
<P>
In a statement released after the inner cabinet meeting
Sunday night, the Israeli government requested the PNA to
strengthen security cooperation with Israel in fighting against
"terrorism" and to stop incitement and hostile propaganda against
Israel.
</P>
<P>
It also called on the PNA to launch an effective and
systematic crackdown on "terrorist" organizations, to punish and
transfer "terrorists" to Israel for trials and to collect illegal
weapons.
</P>
<P>
Rudeineh said the PNA would not accept these demands, which he
described as violating the interim agreement signed by the two
sides, the radio said.
</P>
<P>
In another development, Palestinian officials were reportedly
asking Israeli President Ezer Weizman to mediate the current
crisis in order to resume the stalled peace talks, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
Weizman, the ceremonial head of state in Israel, has long
played a mediating role between the two sides during times of
difficulties in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
PNA Minister of Culture and Information Yasser Abed Rabbo was
said to be ready to talk with Weizman on finding ways to break
the current deadlock that fueled the tense situation. But so far
it remained unclear if Weizman had agreed to accept the
Palestinian request, the report added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israel continued tightening screw on the PNA for
strengthening its fight against "terrorism" following last
Friday's suicide bombing in central Tel Aviv that killed three
Israelis and the bomber and injured more than 40 others.
</P>
<P>
The bombing was carried out by the Islamic militant group
Hamas which has been engaging in attacks against Israel. But the
Israeli government held the PNA directly responsible for the
attack.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference Sunday night, Israeli army intelligence
chief Moshe Yaalon and Chief of Staff Amonon Lipkin Shahak clearly
blamed Arafat for giving the green light to Hamas and other
radical groups to launch attacks in protests over Israel's recent
moves to begin building a Jewish neighborhood in Arab East
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Yaalon said that, while it was difficult to prove that Arafat
had specifically told the radical groups to carry out the
attacks, Arafat obviously sent out a message of approval during
a meeting with leaders of these organizations upon his return
from the United States two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
He claimed that Arafat had changed tactics to violent
confrontation because he felt threatened in his plans to set up
a Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital.
</P>
<P>
Shahak warned that the current situation could still
deteriorate because the radical groups had a tacit agreement
with the PNA allowing them to carry out more attacks.
</P>
<P>
Israeli security forces are keeping high alert throughout the
country as security has been beefed up in public places in all
major cities. The total closure on the Palestinian territories
imposed following the Tel Aviv bombing remains in force to
prevent possible infiltration of extremists.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia's Export Earning Declines by 9 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia has announced that its
export earning declined by nine percent while its balance-of-payment
deficit rose to 3.8 billion Birr (about 590 million dollars) in
the 1995/96 budget year.
</P>
<P>
A report from the Ministry of Trade and Industry said the
country in 1995-96 got 2.8 billion Birr (about 430 million
dollars) from foreign trade, accounting for 74 percent of the
targeted 3.8 billion Birr (about 590 million dollars) export
earnings.
</P>
<P>
The ministry primarily attributed the dramatic fall in the
export earning to the drop in the price of coffee on the world
market, and significant shortfalls in the hard currency earnings
of livestock, leather products and vegetables and fruit exports.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia exported 101,823 tons of coffee, which generated 64
percent or 1.8 billion Birr (about 280 million dollars) of the
total trade revenue.
</P>
<P>
The ministry pointed out that despite a 30 percent increase in
the volume of coffee export, earnings from the commodity declined
by 6 percent in 1995/96 compared with the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, according to the ministry, Ethiopia's import
expenditure dramatically rose to 6.6 billion birr (over one
billion dollars) in 1995/96, creating a 3.8 billion birr (about
590 million dollars) trade deficit. In the 1994/95
budget year, the import expenditure was 4.2 billion birr (about
660 million dollars) and the deficit was only 1.2 billion birr
(about 190 million dollars). enditem

KUALA LUMPUR, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian King Tuanku
Ja'afar today stressed the need for high values and social ethics
to overcome the social problems facing the country.

"We are confident that the Islamic Development Department will
be able to help the government tackle moral decline among the
youth and other social ills like drug abuse and AIDS," he said
when opening the first meeting of the third term of the ninth
Parliament here today.
</P>
<P>
He said the influx of illegal immigrants had caused various
problems like illegal settlements, forged travel documents,
doubtful marriages with locals and a rise in health care and
education costs.
</P>
<P>
"The government takes a serious view of these problems because
they pose a threat to national security, peace and harmony," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He said that in view of the social problems facing the
society, the task of molding the young generation required
cautious handling and an integrated approach by everyone.
</P>
<P>
"Efforts will be stepped up to strengthen the family
institution because the government believes that a healthy, stable
and resilient family will produce citizens of caliber with
self-respect, he said.
</P>
<P>
Towards this end, the King said, religious teachings and faith
must be inculcated through various educational programs,
especially among the young generation, "to create high values and
social ethics like self-discipline, tolerance, love and respect
for each other".

<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian King Tuanku
Ja'afar today called upon the people in the country to make the
Multimedia Super Corridor (MSC) project a success.
</P>
<P>
All the people must make the MSC project a success if they do
not want Malaysia to be left behind in mastering information
technology, the King said when opening the first meeting of the
third term of the ninth Parliament here today.
</P>
<P>
Discussions on the MSC will be given priority with several
cyber bills to be tabled at this session, according to official
sources.
</P>
<P>
The development of the MSC is the Malaysian government's most
important effort this year and a big effort by Malaysia to master
the information field which would shape the future development of
the world.
</P>
<P>
The MSC is a 15 kilometers by 50 kilometers zone stretching
southward from central Kuala Lumpur, which is specially designed
for high-tech projects.
</P>
<P>
The King said "the MSC offers a conducive environment that is
specially designed to facilitate the merging of operators and
companies to reap the benefits of the information age."
</P>
<P>
He said more emphasis should be made on science and technology
so that the country would be more capable of using, adapting and
upgrading imported technology besides developing local technology.
</P>
<P>
"Investments in new technology will give the country a
competitive edge in the field of information technology. To
achieve this, the government will draft the Telecommunication
Master Plan," he said.

Biscayne, Florida on Sunday night.

<P>
After conceding the first set 3-6, the Croatian won the two
succeeding sets to sail further in the tournament 3-6, 7-6 and 6-4.

Spadea jumped to a 5-3 lead and served out the first set with
two more aces in the final game.
</P>
<P>
Ivanisevic squandered a set point by netting a backhand before
taking the tiebreaker 7-4.

In the decider set, the atmosphere turned ugly when the umpire
overruled two Ivanisevic double-faults in the eighth
game.

As Spadea lost his composure the fourth seed took advantage by
breaking Spadea for a 5-4 lead before serving out his own game.

<HEADLINE> Unabated Growth of Slums Reported in India's Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 24 (Xinhua) -- The increasing number of slums
and large-scale encroachments on public land have made New Delhi,
capital of India, one of the largest slum-infested cities in the
country, according to a committee for urban affairs.
</P>
<P>
In its latest report tabled in the Lower House of Parliament
recently, the committee said "Spate of illegal and unauthorized
colonies have hampered the systematic and planned growth of
Delhi."
</P>
<P>
While the urban population of the country has been increasing
at the rate of about three percent a year, that of the urban slums
increasing at a rate of nine percent per year, said K.K.
Bhatnagar, chairman of the Housing and Urban Development
Corporation.
</P>
<P>
The unprecedented growth of urban slum population was due to
the lack of development of basic infrastructure facilities and the
inadequate availability of serviced land within affordable reach
of economically weaker sections of society, he said.
</P>
<P>
In its report, the committee has expressed its unhappiness with
the slow pace of construction of houses and flats for allotment to
wait-list registrants.
</P>
<P>
All-out efforts should have been made to construct and allot
the houses by this time, it said.
</P>
<P>
Necessary corrective measures should be taken immediately to
prevent the unabated growth of slums, encroachment of public land
and other unauthorized activities, the committee suggested.

<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Prime Minister Goh
Chok Tong left here today for Vientiane on a two-day official
visit to Laos, the first by a Singapore prime minister to the
country, the Prime Minister's Office announced today.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, which is Goh's first trip to the country, the
prime minister will witness the signing of the Singapore-Laos
Investment Guarantee Agreement.
</P>
<P>
Goh is accompanied by senior government officials and about 20
Singapore businessmen on the visit.
</P>
<P>
In Vientiane, Goh will also call Lao President Nouhak
Phoumsavan, and hold talks with Prime Minister Khamtay Siphandone,
the Prime Minister's Office said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
During Goh's stay there, a seminar on investment opportunities
in Laos will hold for the Singapore delegation to brief the
Singapore businessmen on the country's efforts to woo foreign
investors.
</P>
<P>
Though Singapore's investment in Laos is small compared to its
investment in Vietnam and Myanmar, there is growing interest in
the country among Singapore businessmen, local media noted.
</P>
<P>
Singapore is now the 14th largest investor in Laos, with
investments mainly in hotels and infrastructure projects.
</P>
<P>
Singapore is also one of Laos's largest trading partners, with
total bilateral trade amounting to around 45 million US dollars
last year, according to the Singapore Trade Development Board
figures.
</P>
<P>
Laos is keen on joining the Association of the Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN) and many observers expect it to do so later this
year, together with Cambodia and Myanmar, to bring the membership
of the regional group to ten in the year when the ASEAN marks its
30th anniversary.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Prepares Action Plan to Push Service Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 24 (Xinhua) -- The Thai Commerce Ministry and
the Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT) are jointly working on an
action plan to spur Thai exports of services as the country is
facing a slowdown in its exports of industrial goods.
</P>
<P>
Medical, catering, entertainment and health-care services could
be among the rising foreign exchange earners in Thailand,
according to the Export Promotion Department of the ministry.
</P>
<P>
The action plan, which is expected to be completed within the
coming two months, will help generate about 4 billion U.S. dollars
from the country's service exports, the department said.
</P>
<P>
Currently, Thailand's competitiveness in textiles, jewelry,
leather, furniture and decorative items is declining and the
department indicated that there is a need to explore the country's
services sector to reinforce its exports, in particular to the
Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
Thai entertainment products like music and movie have a great
potential for export, according to the department.
</P>
<P>
The plan is also aimed at attracting more foreign tourists to
Thailand to enjoy Thai-style services and helping the country
bring down its current account deficits, local newspapers said.

<P>
NEW DELHI, March 24 (Xinhua) -- A total of 38 Indian teenagers
came back to Mumbai (Bombay) Sunday night from Pakistan's port
city Karachi, local press said here today.
</P>
<P>
In a goodwill gesture, Pakistan sent back 38 Indian boys
allegedly straying into that country's territorial waters. The
boys had worked as crew on board fishing vessels sailing out of
Gujarat state in southern India.
</P>
<P>
They spent three years in Pakistan and most of them were taken
out of jail and rehabilitated by a local social worker Abudul
Sattar Edhi in children's homes in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
"This gesture will help the relations between the two
countries," said Devjibhai Tandel, former member of Parliament
from Gujarat who arrived at the airport to receive the boys.
</P>
<P>
With the resumption of talks between foreign secretaries of
India and Pakistan from March 28 to 31, Indian External Affairs
Minister I.K. Gujral announced a number of steps to improve
people-to-people contacts with Pakistan in the Lower House on
March 20.
</P>
<P>
The steps included exemption to young and elderly Pakistan
visitors from reporting to the police, waiving visa fees for
senior citizens from across the border, increasing the number of
religious shrines in India open to Pakistan pilgrims and allowing
import of Pakistan books and periodicals.
</P>
<P>
These measures were designed to add to the goodwill between the
peoples of the two countries, Gujral said.

<HEADLINE> Nepal Observes World TB Day with Emphasis on New </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Nepal today observed the World
Tuberculosis (TB) Day by organizing various programs with an
emphasis on a newly introduced treatment, which doctors believe
would effectively cure the disease.
</P>
<P>
TB control officials here said that the Directly Observed
Treatment Short Course (DOTS) method, introduced in the country
last year, has been found effective in curbing the TB disease as
patients are given drugs under the strict supervision of doctors
or health workers.
</P>
<P>
Nepal's National Tuberculosis Center (NTC) last year launched a
program to implement the DOTS method, recommended by the World
Health Organization (WHO), in four of the country's 75 districts
on the trial basis.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary reports show, they said.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that about 16,000 people die of tuberculosis
every year in Nepal and some 50,000 new cases are recorded in the
meantime.
</P>
<P>
Doctors working in the field said that the patients' failure to
complete their full course of drugs and TB's close linkage with
AIDS have made the disease more dangerous.
</P>
<P>
There is an urgent need to strengthen supervision on local
levels to ensure an expansion of the implementation of the DOTS
program, they said.
</P>
<P>
Nepali King Birendra in a message issued today on the occasion
of the World TB Day wished all concerned success in promoting
public awareness about the diagnosis, prevention and treatment of
the disease.

HONG KONG, March 24 (Xinhua) -- With Hong Kong's transition
entering the final 99-day period, Hong Kong newspapers today
carried commentaries to urge the people to unite and to contribute
wisdom to ensure Hong Kong's smooth transition.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong Commercial Daily said that Hong Kong's return to her
motherland is a major event for the Chinese nation. Toward this
end, the whole Hong Kong people should be united to promote Hong
Kong's handover.
</P>
<P>
It is a great creation that the Chinese government settles the
Hong Kong issue by peaceful means and implementation of the
principles of "One Country, Two Systems", "Hong Kong People
Governing Hong Kong" and high degree of autonomy, it said.
</P>
<P>
It stressed that unity is the impetus for the progress as well
as serves as a cornerstone for stability, adding that only the
unity of various sectors can guarantee Hong Kong's smooth
transition.

worry about an instable situation in the territory around 1997 is
unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
It said that the continued economic reforms and opening up and
sustained economic growth in the Chinese mainland will ensure the
implementation of the principle of "One Country, Two Systems" and
"Hong Kong People Governing Hong Kong".
</P>
<P>

return to China in less than 100 days, various sectors in the
territory should seek common ground while reserve differences so
as to preserve Hong Kong's prosperity and stability.
</P>
<P>
Ta Kung Pao said since it is less than 100 days from Hong
Kong's return to her motherland, the Provisional Legislative
Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) is
facing heavy task.
</P>
<P>
It said that there are sufficient legal basis for the PLC to
legislate before June 30 this year.
</P>
<P>
It called on the PLC members to take the overall interests of
the all the Hong Kong people into account to accelerate its work.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka's Opposition Protests Arrest of Party Leaders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 24 (Xinhua) -- The main opposition Bangladesh
Nationalist Party (BNP) will hold a public meeting here today to
protest the attack and arrest of party workers and leaders
occurred on Sunday's nationwide strike.
</P>
<P>
The eight-hour strike enforced by the BNP was marked by
sporadic violence that left more than 200 injured including former
Home Minister Matin Chowdhury. At least 150 persons were arrested
in Dhaka on charge of damaging vehicles and disrupting normal
life.
</P>
<P>
BNP Secretary General Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan told a press
conference Sunday night that his party had no plan now to call a
fresh strike. The next course of action will depend on the
government's performance, he added.
</P>
<P>
The BNP called Sunday's strike to protest what it called the
government's giving transit facility to India and planned import
of power from that country, move to form a sub-regional grouping
and the crisis of power across Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
It was the first strike during the nine-month-old government of
Sheikh Hasina, who defeated BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia on last
June election.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some business leaders expressed concern over the
renewed incidence of strikes and urged the BNP to avoid political
agitation taking into consideration its adverse impacts on the
growth of the economy.
</P>
<P>
Vice President of the Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce and
Industry Laila Kabir said the renewed political agitation would
jeopardize the prospects for economic growth.
</P>
<P>
"We want development and foreign investment. Any threat to
political stability would diminish our chances of doing well," she
said.

<P>
BANGKOK, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's investment in Vietnam
is expected to hit 1 billion U.S. dollars, a record high since
Thai investors entered Vietnam 10 years ago, according to a
leading Thai commercial bank.
</P>
<P>
Thai investment proved most fruitful since 1993 as major Thai
companies penetrated into the Vietnamese market and businesses
expanded to include poultry processing and entertainment and
sports facilities, said the Bangkok Bank in a report release
recently.
</P>
<P>
The year 1994 turned out to be the most active year for Thai
investment in Vietnam with 20 projects launched and 174.2 million
dollars involved.
</P>
<P>
The 20 projects included hotels, sports and recreation centers,
a fish net factory and two gas concerns, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
However, the bank pointed out that in 1995, the number of Thai
investment projects declined to 12, with the total investment
value posting 134 million dollars, but including a motorcycle
parts manufacturing plant, a glass factory, an electronics plant
and a plain factory.
</P>
<P>
Although official investment statistics on Thai investment in
Vietnam are not available for 1996, the bank said that as of July
in the year, one car project and one power project one launched by
Thai investors involved 214 million dollars.

CHANGSHA, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Better-off farmers in Qidong
County of central China's Hunan Province have taken out five
million yuan from their pockets to sponsor local social welfare
projects, as a way to help their peers still locked in poverty.
</P>
<P>
Some 170 households of farmers have bid farewell to their

rich with the progress of reform and opening.
</P>
<P>
Also, some 100 kilometers of roads and more than 100 bridges

SAN JOSE, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Costa Rica grabbed a narrow 3-2
victory over the United States on Sunday in the final round of the
CONCACAF World Cup qualifiers, thanks to a 76th minute goal from
striker Ronald Gomez.
</P>
<P>
The victory left Costa Rica alongside Mexico atop the CONCACAF

United States also notched four points but from three matches. The
top three teams will advance to the World Cup finals in France.
</P>
<P>
Costa Rica, which beat the United States 2-1 at home in the
semifinal round, pressed from the outset and took the lead after
only 10 minutes when Hernan Medford received a cross and beat two
American defenders before slamming home the opener.
</P>
<P>
American forward Eric Wynalda tied it in the 24th, only to see
Mauricio Solis restoring the lead 13 minutes before halftime.
</P>
<P>
The second half saw the Americans back to picture when
substitute Roy Lassiter scored in the 68th by wrongfooting two
defenders at the top of the penalty area and beating Costa Rican
keeper Hermidio Barrantes to the long side.
</P>
<P>
Then came the fatal 76th minute goal with Harold Wallace of

<P>
Canada, Jamaica and El Salvador are the other teams in the
final round of qualifying.

<HEADLINE> Tax Breaks Urged in Italy for Foreign Fund and Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Italian Foreign Trade Minister
Augusto Fantozzi called Sunday for tax breaks for companies
specializing in exports and foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
"Exports, an important voice for the Italian economy, must be
paid the attention they deserve, including fiscal measures for
those investing for exports and buying companies in other
countries," Fantozzi told a round-table discussion held on the
future of small and medium-sized enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that tax breaks for investing abroad and
exports does not mean taking work away from the country. "On the
contrary, it guarantees more," he said.
</P>
<P>
Exportation is important for Italy's gold industry as it offers
115,000 jobs and generates an annual turnover of some 20 trillion
lire (1.186 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Present at Sunday's discussion was Antonio Zucchi, president of
the Arezzo Industrialists Association, who criticized that tax
penalties imposed on exporting companies and insufficient
coordination between all agencies designed to support exports are
hindering the internationalization of Italian economy.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Plans to Stop Using Leaded Petrol by 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 24 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government has
decided that leaded petrol will no longer be used in the country
by 1999, as part of the national effort to reduce air pollution
emitted by motor vehicles, a senior official said.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Mines and Energy Ida Bagus Sujana said here on
Sunday that leaded petrol will be gradually phased out and
replaced by unleaded petrol, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The state oil and gas company has already begun to produce and
sell unleaded petrol, but the more environment-friendly fuel is
yet to prove popular with motorists, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
The government is also trying to promote the use of compressed
natural gas (CNG) or liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) as an
alternative fuel to petrol.
</P>
<P>
According to official sources, the number of motor vehicles in
Indonesia is increasing at an average rate of 12 percent a year.
In 1995 the total number of registered motor vehicles in the
country stood at 12,833,536, of which 25 percent were operating in
the capital city.
</P>
<P>
The Jakarta administration has forged a cooperation agreement
with the Association of National Oil and Gas Companies to
construct a total of 21 automotive gas filling stations in the
city over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
The project is part of the "blue sky" program launched by the
city administration a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
A research conducted recently by an environment enforcement
board showed that the level of pollution in big cities especially
Jakarta has reached some 1,200 tons monthly, and anxiously 67
percent of air pollution is caused by transportation activities.

<P>
MEXICO CITY, March 23 (Xinhua) -- A friendly soccer
international between Bolivia and Jamaica turned into a farce on
Sunday as the Jamaicans, unable to cope with the altitude, began
clowning around on the field.
</P>
<P>
The match was played at 3,800 metres above sea level in the
mining town of Oruro, Bolivia, where the rarified air makes simply
walking a streuous exercise.
</P>
<P>
On several occasions, Jamaican players burst out laughing as
Bolivian players sped past them. Some Jamaican players also
collapsed to the ground during the match, pretending they had
fainted.
</P>
<P>
When the Jamaicans got near the ball they simply whacked it as
far as they possibly could, in any direction.
</P>
<P>
The serious football stopped in the 13th minute when Oscar
Sanchez put Bolivia in front. Then the Jamaicans began venting
their frustration on their opponents, finishing with nine men and
a 6-0 rout.

TIRANA, March 23 (Xinhua) -- The medical aid provided by the
Italian government to Albania arrived today in Vlora, a southern
town of Albania.

<P>
It was reported that the lot of medicines could be used by
300,000 people for six months.
</P>
<P>
The first materials of the Italian assistance sent to the
country on March 21 was military supplies offered to Albania's
interior ministry.
</P>
<P>
Italy is a neighboring country of Albania. Since the situation
was tense in the Balkan country, Italian officials urged many
times that the European Union should coordinate the policy toward
Albania, and provide humanitarian, financial and other material
aid to the country.
</P>
<P>
According to reports reaching here, Italian Foreign Minister
Lamberto Dini said today that the time was now ripe for
humanitarian aid to Albania, while "getting involved in a military
situation was not opportune".
</P>
<P>
Talking to reporters on the sidelines of a rally in Rome on
Sunday, Dini said Italy has a responsibility to shelter needy
refugees but not "the illegal immigration that is now being
reorganized by crime gangs who put people on boats in exchange for
money".
</P>
<P>
It was reported that there are some 10,000 Albanian refugees
having fled into Italy.

<P>
SHENYANG, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Shenyang, capital of northeast
China's Liaoning Province, has taken a move to rein in discharges
of wastes from local industrial enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The city is one of the well-known industrial bases of China,
but the deterioration of the local environment in recent years has
endangered the health and normal life of local people.
</P>
<P>
Official sources say that local environmental protection units
have set up warning signs that can be easily seen at the locations
of 1,000 sources of wastes, including the 408 enterprises that
pipe out about 65 percent of the waste water, gas, and residue of
the city every year.
</P>
<P>
The 50 outlets generating toxic waste have larger signs, with
black characters written on yellow board.
</P>
<P>
The signs helped arouse the public's concern over pollution,
and gave them better a understanding of what the environment meant
to their lives, according to local observers.
</P>
<P>
An old worker in a Shenyang-based transformer plant said that
he did not know that his plant was generating wastes harmful to
him and his colleagues until he saw the signs.
</P>
<P>
The environmental protection units will create a computer
archive for each of the waste outlets, and conduct regular tests
of the outlets for data on the discharged wastes.
</P>
<P>
Places generating intense noise also have signs erected to warn
workers at these businesses and people in the neighborhood of
noise pollution.

resolve the Kashmir dispute which is the basic cause of tension
between India and Pakistan and support the efforts of the Pakistan

ammunition to all Afghan parties.
</P>
<P>
They reiterated the need for early political reconciliation in
Afghanistan and supported the efforts of OIC and United Nations in

<P>
It was also imperative that the international community
provides adequate assistance for rehabilitation and reconstruction
in Afghanistan including for the repatriation of Afghan refugees,
the declaration said.

<HEADLINE> Investment in Poor Countries Reaches Record Level </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Private foreign investment in
developing countries surged at a record rate last year, but
official aid from governments declined sharply, the World Bank
said in a report today.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank report said that private investment in poor
countries jumped by 60 billion U.S. dollars last year to a record
244 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Much of the private investment capital is going to build the
infrastructures of the recipient countries, particularly in
communications, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Investment in China rose by 7 billion to 42 billion dollars.
Significant advances also occurred elsewhere in Asia, notably in
Indonesia and Thailand, and in Brazil and Argentina in Latin
America.
</P>
<P>
In Africa, private capital flows remained modest but are 10
times greater than they were at the start of the 1990s, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
"The growth of private capital flows should continue (in 1997),
as more developing countries improve (economic) management and
open their markets to competition," said James Stiglitz, the
World Bank's chief economist.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank report also said that official foreign aid fell
by 1 billion U.S. dollars last year, back to 1990 levels.
</P>
<P>
It said that U.S. foreign aid totaled about 12.5 billion
dollars in the fiscal year of 1996, down almost 9 percent from the
previous year's 13.7 billion.

<HEADLINE> SDA Official Denies Plan To Divide Bosnia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, March 23 (Xinhua) -- A senior official of the Party
of Democratic Action (SDA) denied the report that the Bosnian
Muslim leaders were preparing for a tacit division of Bosnia,
according to a press report on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Sarajevo Daily Oslobodjenje in its report quoted SDA vice
president Edhem Bicakcic as saying that the party would keep
fighting for an integrated and democratic Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
"Our only option is an integrated and single Bosnia," said
Bicakcic, who is also prime minister of the Bosnian Federation.
</P>
<P>
But he admitted that the non-implementation of the Dayton peace
accords could result in Muslims accepting Bosnia's division, with
its borders being redrawn with a new war.
</P>
<P>
Bicakcic's remarks were in response to press reports about
Muslim leadership's readiness to accept division of Bosnia
according to ethnic lines.
</P>
<P>
A recent public opinion survey showed that 22 percent of Muslim
favored a separate single-nation state.
</P>
<P>
Slobodna Bosnia, a weekly, reported that there were even
private discussions among officials of three ethnic nations on
territorial exchanges in order to facilitate the division of
Bosnia.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Chances, Challenges for OAU Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOME, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Chances and challenges loom over
the Wednesday Lome summit of the Organization of African Unity
(OAU) on ending the exploding Zaire crisis which has shocked the
whole continent.
</P>
<P>
As the crisis could cause huge bloodshed, mass migration, arms
proliferation and unrest in central Africa, the special summit is
catching much more attention not only from African countries but
from the rest of the international community.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, OAU Chief Salim Ahmed Salim
and about 30 heads of state in Africa or their representatives
will attend the summit focusing on how to pursue an immediate
cease-fire, negotiations and elections in Zaire.
</P>
<P>
The deployment of a peace-keeping force in Zaire may be
discussed at the summit trying to broker peace between the
warring sides in the central African country.
</P>
<P>
Several signals indicate that the summit might produce some
positive results and thus bring a ray of hope to a negotiated
settlement of the bloodshed. Chances do exist.
</P>
<P>
First, to end conflicts, African countries generally stand for
seeking common ground while reserving differences, saying they
are willing to join efforts in bringing about reconciliation
between the warring sides.
</P>
<P>
They also agree that the national sovereignty and territorial
integrity of Zaire should be safeguarded and maintained.
</P>
<P>
Second, the Lome summit will be held on the basis of three
Nairobi summits on the Zairean war and the mediation efforts by
South African President Nelson Mandela to explore the
possibilities of direct dialogue between the Zairean government
and the rebels.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the host country of Togo, along with other African
countries, claimed they have confidence and determination to deal
with the deteriorating situation in Zaire with their own wisdom
and abilities.
</P>
<P>
The African countries have accumulated some successful
experiences in the process of resolving conflicts in the
continent, for example, in Sierra Leone, Liberia and the Central
African Republic.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, both President Mobutu Sese Seko and rebel leader
Laurent Kabila have a desire for a peaceful solution to the
crisis. The Zairean government has accepted the U.N. five-point
peace plan and Mobutu is calling for an immediate cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
Despite victories in the battlefield, Kabila has stated that
talks are "important." He insists on direct negotiations with
Mobutu and opposes to seceding Zaire.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the United States and France, two major players
among western powers in the Zaire crisis, have coordinated their
positions on the issue and called for "an immediate truce and
negotiations" between the warring parties in the country.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Chief Annan said during his earlier visit to South Africa
that he is optimistic that the Lome summit would put Zaire on the
road to peace.
</P>
<P>
However, there poise serious obstacles which might thwart the
peace efforts by African countries and the U.N. Challenges seem
bigger.
</P>
<P>
The development in Zaire is unpredictable and situation there
seems worsening. Up to now, it is hard to achieve cease-fire as
rebel leader Kabila sticks to talks before a truce.
</P>
<P>
Since rising in revolt in eastern Zaire last October, the
Tutsi-dominated rebels have seized one third of the country,
including the third largest city Kisangani, and vowed to press on
to take Zaire's capital Kinshasa in June.
</P>
<P>
No truce before negotiations, no end to fighting before
Zairean President Mobutu steps down, Kabila said time and again
and his troops are advancing toward Zaire's second largest city
Lubumbashi.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Zairean government army argued that they lost
only battles, not wars, and an ailing Mobutu returned to Kinshasa
from France Friday in attempts to reverse the situation.
</P>
<P>
The government troops will "continue to fight" against the
rebels, Chief of the General Staff of the army Lieko Bokungu
declared.
</P>
<P>
And before a cease-fire is realized, it is too early to mention
the deployment of a peace-keeping force in Zaire and it is also
not easy to raise funds to keep up such a force.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the rebels have refused to accept intervention by
sending such a force to Zaire.
</P>
<P>
Just as OAU chief Salim put it in an interview with Xinhua on
Saturday that how to make the two warring sides accept a
cease-fire unconditionally is "one of the challenges facing the
summit," maybe the biggest.
