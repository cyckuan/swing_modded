IRA Agrees To Disarm Soon
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- A breakthrough that makes lasting peace
possible in Northern Ireland after 30 years of bloodshed came Saturday when the
Irish Republican Army said that it will soon start to disarm. The British and
Irish governments warmly welcomed the IRA's long-sought pledge, saying it met
their requirements and should clear the way for restoring power to Northern
Ireland's Catholic-Protestant administration on May 22. The province had gotten
a measure of self-rule when the power-sharing administration was formed in
December. But Britain reimposed direct rule some two months later because of the
IRA's refusal to give any disarmament commitment.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Elian Gonzalez and his family left their secluded retreat
in Maryland on Saturday to visit the home of prominent Democratic Party
benefactors in Washington's Georgetown neighborhood. Elian, the 6-year-old Cuban
castaway who has become the focus of a heated battle over his future, has been
staying with his father, stepmother and younger half brother at the Wye River
Plantation, about 55 miles east of Washington, since April 25. Gregory Craig,
attorney for Elian's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, declined to talk about the
gathering when contacted at home afterward.

Rebels Advance Toward Sierra Leone Capital

<P>
   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) -- Using civilians as human shields, rebels
advanced Saturday night toward Freetown, and battled U.N. forces in the interior
of the country, a U.N. official said. The rebels, which have taken hundreds of
U.N. personnel hostage since Monday, moved Saturday afternoon from the town of
Lunsar, 45 miles northeast of Freetown, the capital, and were heading toward the
town of Masiaka, said U.N. spokesman Philip Winslow. He said the rebel force was
estimated to be between 500 and 1,000 men carrying ''infantry-type'' weapons.

Clinton Announces Listeria Measures
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government will require companies that churn out hot
dogs and cold cuts to test their plants for the deadly listeria bacterium,
President Clinton announced Saturday. The goal is to reduce listeria-caused
illnesses by one-half over five years. While poisoning fewer people than
pathogens such as salmonella, Listeria monocytogenes is estimated to kill 500
Americans a year and sicken 2,000 more. A third of the cases involve pregnant
women and their babies, experts say.

<HEADLINE> 12 Historic Travel Sites Named  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- As Americans prepare for summer travel, a
group that promotes preservation of the nation's historic sites has
chosen the 12 vacation destinations that best remember their
histories and shun urban sprawl.
</P>
<P>
   ''The communities we've named to this list are pockets of
serenity amid the sprawl, clutter and homogenization that have
overwhelmed so many American vacation spots,'' said Richard Moe,
president of the National Trust for Historic Preservation.
</P>
<P>
   The trust selected the communities according to their ability to
maintain well-managed growth, dynamic downtown areas, commitments
to historic preservation and economic bases of locally owned
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Typical of cities chosen:
</P>
<P>
   --San Luis Obispo, Calif., for its history as the site of one of
California's original Catholic missions, established by Father
Junipero Serra in the 1700s. The downtown business area has been
revitalized in the past decade around Mission San Luis Obispo de
Tolosa, which remains as the city's centerpiece.
</P>
<P>
   --Lowell, Mass., as an opportunity for visitors to study powerful
fluctuations of the nation's Industrial Revolution against the
backdrop of its new high-tech center and growing cultural
diversity.
</P>
<P>
   --Boulder, Colo., for its intersection of culture, the great
outdoors and its magnificent Rocky Mountain vistas. The trust
credits a movement in the city government in the 1960s that limited
allowable heights in buildings, restricted residential growth and
set down a historic preservation code for protecting the city's way
of life.
</P>
<P>
   These are the 12:
</P>
<P>
   San Luis Obispo, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Boulder, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   Thomasville, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence, Kan.
</P>
<P>
   Lowell, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Petoskey, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   Cooperstown, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Pittman Center, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   Fredericksburg, Texas
</P>
<P>
   Lexington, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Port Townsend, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   Chippewa Falls, Wis.

<HEADLINE> Cuban Player Leaves Minn. Group  </HEADLINE>
By STEVE KARNOWSKI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- A member of a Cuban baseball team visiting
here got into a car and sped off Saturday in a possible defection
as his team was leaving the terminal at Minneapolis-St. Paul
International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   The player was a member of ''Equipo Caribe,'' Team Caribbean,
which is made up mostly of students from the University of Havana
and some students from a technical institute in the Cuban capital,
said Doug Hennes, a spokesman for the University of St. Thomas,
which is sponsoring the visit.
</P>
<P>
   After a welcoming ceremony about 3 p.m., the student walked out
of the Hubert Humphrey Terminal along with other players, coaches,
staff and faculty members.
</P>
<P>
   Hennes identified the missing man as Mario Miguel Chaoui.
</P>
<P>
   Chaoui did not contact his group or government authorities, and
his whereabouts remained unknown Saturday night, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We haven't heard hide nor hair of him,'' said Jim Winterer,
another spokesman for the St. Paul college. ''He just got in the
car and is gone.''
</P>
<P>
   The team is in Minnesota to return a visit to Cuba by the St.
Thomas baseball team last winter.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Dennis Dease, president of St. Thomas, who was at the
charter and international arrivals terminal to welcome the Cuban
delegation, said he hoped the player would contact the group and
return to the team.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is always a possibility of this happening,'' Dease said
in a statement. ''We need to leave it to immigration officials to
sort out.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Elian Gonzalez and his family left their
secluded retreat in Maryland on Saturday to visit the home of
prominent Democratic Party benefactors in Washington's Georgetown
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Elian, the 6-year-old Cuban castaway who has become the focus of
a heated battle over his future, has been staying with his father,
stepmother and younger half brother at the Wye River Plantation,
about 55 miles east of Washington, since April 25.
</P>
<P>
   But Saturday night they went by police-escorted motorcade to the
home of Smith and Elizabeth Bagley, who have been active in
Democratic fund-raising efforts. Bagley is a foundation president
and his wife is a former U.S. ambassador to Portugal. They are
frequently guests at official White House dinners, including the
White House Millennium Dinner last New Year's Eve and a state
dinner for the king of Spain in February.
</P>
<P>
   After about four hours at the Bagley home, the Gonzalez family
sped away in their motorcade, apparently headed back to the
Maryland retreat.
</P>
<P>
   Gregory Craig, attorney for Elian's father, Juan Miguel
Gonzalez, declined to talk about the gathering when contacted at
home afterward. Craig, also a prominent Democrat with close ties to
the White House, had been at the Bagley residence with his clients.
</P>
<P>
   Elian was rescued off the Florida coast last Thanksgiving after
a boat carrying him and others sank. His mother drowned and he was
placed in the custody of relatives in Miami. Federal agents seized
him from their home on April 22 after they refused orders by the
Justice Department to turn him over to his father.

<HEADLINE> Rangers 11, Athletics 10  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN MARSHALL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- Luis Alicea's RBI single in the ninth
inning gave Texas an 11-10 victory over Oakland on Saturday night,
the second straight game the Rangers won with both teams scoring in
double figures.
</P>
<P>
   A day after blowing a 15-7 lead and losing 17-16, the Athletics
wasted leads of 6-1 in the third, 8-6 in the seventh and 10-9 in
the ninth on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Chad Curtis started the Texas ninth with a single off Jason
Isringhausen (1-2), and Jason McDonald singled Curtis to third with
one out. Royce Clayton then hit a potential double-play grounder,
but third baseman Eric Chavez threw the ball into right-field for
an error, allowing Curtis to score the tying run and sending
McDonald to third.
</P>
<P>
   Alicea then singled in the game-winner off reliever T.J.
Mathews.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Giambi hit two-run homers in the seventh and ninth innings
to give the A's short-lived leads.
</P>
<P>
   The two teams combined for 54 runs and 67 hits in the two wild
games.
</P>
<P>
   Giambi's homer in the ninth off of John Wetteland (2-1)
prevented him from earning his 300th career save, but he got the
victory for the second straight night when Texas rallied in the
bottom of the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Giambi's ninth-inning homer was his 13th, and he now holds the
major league lead in home runs and RBIs (34). Giambi's homer off
Rangers starter Kenny Rogers broke a 6-6 tie.
</P>
<P>
   David Segui's two-run single in the eighth inning gave the
Rangers a 9-8 lead that Giambi turned around with his second homer.
Oakland's Ben Grieve was 3-for-4 for his third consecutive
three-hit game.
</P>
<P>
   Oakland starter Tim Hudson allowed six runs -- four earned -- on
eight hits in six innings. Rogers allowed eight runs -- six earned --
on 12 hits in seven innings. The 12 hits allowed tied his career
high.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Menechino had a run-scoring double and Miguel Tejada drove
in a run with a single in Oakland's four-run second. Rogers added a
two-run error, throwing into left field trying to get the lead
runner on a bunt by Jeremy Giambi.
</P>
<P>
   Tejada drove in two runs, his third straight game with multiple
RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   Texas' Chad Curtis had a run-scoring single in the second, and
McDonald hit his first homer of the season, a solo shot, in the
third. Rafael Palmeiro added a sacrifice fly, making it 6-3.
</P>
<P>
   Texas tied it with three runs in the fourth with just one hit.
Oakland had one error in the inning and Hudson walked four,
including one with the bases loaded. Alicea knocked in a run with a
groundout to second.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Segui, scratched from Friday's lineup with a strained right
hip flexor, was back at first base Saturday. He finished 2-for-5.
... Oakland had lost its last six games at Texas. ... Jason
Giambi's errorless streak ended at 78 games when he threw into left
field trying to start a double play in the fourth inning. ...
Texas' Ruben Mateo went 3-for-5 to extend his hitting streak to 10
games. ... Rogers picked off two runners.

<HEADLINE> Dodgers 9, Astros 6  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Todd Hundley capped a six-run third inning
with a grand slam and threw out his first baserunner in 19 steal
attempts this season as the Los Angeles Dodgers beat the Houston
Astros 9-6 Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Karros hit a two-run homer, helping stake Darren Dreifort
(2-1) to an 8-3 lead through five innings. The right-hander, who
was given a 10-2 cushion to work with last Saturday night against
Florida in his previous start -- only to end up with a no-decision --
was charged with five runs and nine hits in 5 2-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Grudzielanek's ground-rule double and Hundley's sixth
career grand slam were the only hits in the sixth by the Dodgers,
who sent nine men to the plate and built a 6-1 lead against Octavio
Dotel (1-3). The right-hander was charged with eight runs and five
hits in 4 1-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Dotel walked two of his first three batters in the third before
Alex Cora scored on a ground-rule double by Grudzielanek. Todd
Hollandsworth came home on a groundout by Gary Sheffield, giving
the Dodgers a 2-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Shawn Green was hit by a pitch and Karros walked, loading the
bases, and Hundley drove a 2-2 pitch into the right-field seats for
his sixth homer of the season and fifth in 14 games.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Bagwell led off the fourth with a double and tried to steal
third. But he was tagged out when Jose Vizcaino lunged to grab a
wide throw by Hundley -- ending a collective 0-for-22 drought this
season by Hundley and backup catcher Chad Kreuter.
</P>
<P>
   Hundley, who underwent reconstructive elbow surgery in September
1997 that limited him to 53 games in 1998 with the New York Mets,
threw out only 23 of 129 would-be basestealers last season and was
booed by fans at Dodger Stadium whenever someone would steal on
him.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Caminiti gave the Astros a 1-0 lead in the second with his
sixth homer, and Dreifort hit the next batter, Richard Hidalgo, on
the arm. Hidalgo stared down Dreifort on the way to first base, but
Hundley and plate umpire Gerry Davis intervened and no one came out
of either dugout.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Hansen tripled in the sixth and scored the Dodgers' ninth
run on Grudzielanek's sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   Houston, which outhit the Dodgers 12-7, scored its other runs on
an RBI single by Caminiti, run-scoring groundouts by Craig Biggio,
Bill Spiers and pinch-hitter Daryle Ward and a ninth-inning passed
ball by Hundley.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Sixteen of Caminiti's 23 career home runs against the
Dodgers have been hit in Los Angeles. ... Hidalgo has been hit by a
pitch a major league-leading eight times in 115 plate appearances --
after getting plunked only seven times in 749 plate appearances
prior to this season. He was hit three times on April 19 at Dodger
Stadium -- twice by Orel Hershiser, who set a modern major league
record that night by hitting four batters. ... Dotel, with 20
strikeouts in 13 innings in his two previous starts against the
Dodgers, fanned his first two batters and did not record another
strikeout.

</P>
<P>
   Meola raised his league-leading total to six shutouts for Kansas

play.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Hartman stopped Mo Johnston's shot in the 38th minute to

Mathis in the 43rd, and Cobi Jones during first-half injury time.
After the break, he denied Ibsen, Mauricio Cienfuegos, Roy Myers,

</P>
<P>
   The Galaxy led 16-10 in shots and 8-1 in shots on goal. The
Wizards did not take a shot in the second half or overtime.

<HEADLINE> Rebels Battle U.N. in Sierra Leone  </HEADLINE>
By ALEXANDRA ZAVIS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) -- Rebel forces battled U.N.
peacekeepers in the interior of this West African country on
Saturday, a U.N. spokesman said. In the capital, U.N. troops
mobilized on the ground and in the air.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels, who had agreed to a U.N.-mediated peace agreement in
July, are believed to have launched an offensive from the town of
Lunsar, 50 miles northeast of Freetown, the capital, U.N. spokesman
Philip Winslow said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We tried to stop the rebels using all the resources at our
disposal,'' Winslow said.
</P>
<P>
   The clash with the Revolutionary United Front fighters occurred
southwest of Lunsar, between the towns of Rogberi and Masiaka,
Winslow said early Sunday. That would put the rebels closer to
Freetown than where they launched their offensive. Masiaka is about
35 miles east of Freetown, the capital. Rogberi is 20 miles north
of Masiaka.
</P>
<P>
   The fighting violates the peace deal that brought the rebels
into the government and ended an eight-year civil war.
</P>
<P>
   Winslow said the rebels numbered between 500 and 1,000 and were
carrying ''infantry-type'' weapons. They were using vehicles they
had captured from U.N. peacekeepers, he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the U.N. peacekeepers fought with the RUF rebels and
''hit them with some force.'' The United Nations had no reports of
casualties, he said.
</P>
<P>
   RUF leader Foday Sankoh, who could not be independently reached
for comment, was continuing to insist that no attack was under way,
Winslow said.
</P>
<P>
   Early Sunday, Winslow said he couldn't confirm his earlier
report that the rebels were using civilians as human shields as
they clashed with U.N. peacekeepers. He said reports by him and the
U.N. spokesman in New York, Fred Eckhard, that a helicopter spotted
two to three clusters of rebels at the village of Masiaka -- heading
south to the capital -- also couldn't be confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   Winslow attributed the mix-up to poor communications in a
terribly chaotic situation in which at least 300 U.N. peacekeepers
have been taken hostage by rebels this week. However, bureaucratic
wrangling over the flow of information out of Freetown may also be
to blame for the miscommunication.
</P>
<P>
   At present, there are about 2,100 U.N. troops in the capital --
about 500 Jordanians and 1,600 Nigerians, U.N. officials said. U.N.
vehicles filled with soldiers could be seen moving through the
city's streets, and helicopters clattered overhead regularly in the
early morning hours Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Sierra Leonean Information Minister Julius Spencer confirmed
that there had been a battle between the rebels and U.N. forces,
but had no further information on the fighting.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't understand how they could be doing this,'' he said,
pointing out that the rebels had promised to disarm.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of Western aid workers and missionaries, meanwhile, were
gathering with packed suitcases in the parking lots of the city's
two major hotels, seeking protection and potential evacuation. Some
90 non-U.N. aid workers and family members were evacuated from the
city Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Since Monday, hundreds of U.N. personnel have been taken hostage
by the rebels, and at least four are presumed dead following
clashes.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, the U.N. said they had lost contact with a 200-man
peacekeeper unit near the town of Makeni.
</P>
<P>
   If the U.N. peacekeepers, all of them Zambian, have been
captured by the rebels, that would bring the number of U.N. staff
being held by the RUF to nearly 500.
</P>
<P>
   In talks Saturday involving Sankoh, the United Nations and a
Libyan delegation, the rebel leader agreed to a joint delegation to
leave Freetown on Sunday ''to areas where there have been security
problems,'' Winslow said.
</P>
<P>
   Given the fighting Saturday night, though, it seemed highly
doubtful that any such mission would go forward.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. officials emphasized earlier that the world body had no
plans to withdraw from Sierra Leone. The mission had been
dispatched in December to oversee the peace deal ending the civil
war, which left tens of thousands of people dead and thousands more
maimed in this diamond-rich nation.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels, though, have insisted all along that they were
neither holding hostages nor launching an offensive. The missing
U.N. soldiers are simply lost in the jungle, they have said.
</P>
<P>
   ''These people, they are foreigners here, they do not know the
terrain,'' Sankoh told The Associated Press in an interview
Saturday afternoon in front of his heavily guarded home. ''As time
goes on, I think all of them will come out. My men are helping to
look for them.''
</P>
<P>
   ''If they are being held by the RUF combatants, I'm sure they
will be released,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Nigerian, Malian and Libyan delegations have met with Sankoh.
Many other diplomats -- African, European and American -- have also
reached out to the rebel leader.
</P>
<P>
   But Sankoh is a mercurial man long accustomed to confrontations
with the United Nations and the Sierra Leonean government, and has
often ignored their pleadings in the past.
</P>
<P>
   The peace agreement brought the RUF into a power-sharing
government. But relations have remained deeply strained between the
rebels and the government, despite their erstwhile alliance, and
thousands of rebels have refused to disarm.
</P>
<P>
   In Freetown, residents have been fearing an attack for the past
couple days. Earlier Saturday, radio stations broadcast notices
that religious services and other meetings were canceled ''because
of the security situation.''
</P>
<P>
   But government and U.N. officials both said the city was
well-defended, and the United Nations continued to appeal for
international help. Earlier Saturday, Eckhard said the United
Nations would continue trying to speed up deployment of the
remaining three battalions -- Indian, Bangladeshi and Jordanian --
due to arrive in mid-July to complete the 11,100-strong force.
</P>
<P>
   Four Kenyan U.N. peacekeepers are believed to have been killed
in the clashes that began Monday. The fighting began as the
Nigerian-led West African intervention, which has fought the rebels
for years as the de facto Sierra Leonean army, made its final
withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations says 12 people were wounded in the fighting
and the RUF says six rebels were killed.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels claim the clashes began because peacekeepers were
forcibly disarming RUF fighters -- a charge U.N. officials deny.

IRA Agrees To Disarm Soon
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- A breakthrough that makes lasting peace
possible in Northern Ireland after 30 years of bloodshed came Saturday when the
Irish Republican Army said that it will soon start to disarm. The British and
Irish governments warmly welcomed the IRA's long-sought pledge, saying it met
their requirements and should clear the way for restoring power to Northern
Ireland's Catholic-Protestant administration on May 22. The province had gotten
a measure of self-rule when the power-sharing administration was formed in
December. But Britain reimposed direct rule some two months later because of the
IRA's refusal to give any disarmament commitment.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government will require companies that churn out hot

President Clinton announced Saturday. The goal is to reduce listeria-caused
illnesses by one-half over five years. While poisoning fewer people than
pathogens such as salmonella, Listeria monocytogenes is estimated to kill 500
Americans a year and sicken 2,000 more. A third of the cases involve pregnant

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- As Americans prepare for summer travel, a group that
promotes preservation of the nation's historic sites has chosen the 12 vacation
destinations that best remember their histories and shun urban sprawl. ''The
communities we've named to this list are pockets of serenity amid the sprawl,
clutter and homogenization that have overwhelmed so many American vacation
spots,'' said Richard Moe, president of the National Trust for Historic
Preservation. The trust selected the communities according to their ability to
maintain well-managed growth, dynamic downtown areas, commitments to historic
preservation and economic bases of locally owned businesses.

<P>
   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- A moderate earthquake struck eastern
Taiwan on Sunday, seismologists said. No damage or injuries were
immediately reported.
</P>
<P>
   The 5.0-magnitude quake was centered nine miles west of the
Hualien city on Taiwan's eastern coast, the Central Weather Bureau
said. Hualien is about 90 miles southeast of Taipei.

<HEADLINE> Asian Nations Back Currency Plan  </HEADLINE>
By PATRICK McDOWELL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHIANG MAI, Thailand (AP) -- The United States on Sunday
cautiously welcomed a landmark currency cooperation agreement
between 13 East Asian nations to fight future economic crises.
</P>
<P>
   Washington shot down more ambitious proposals by Japan in 1997
to create an Asian monetary fund to bail out regional economies
collapsing under the financial meltdowns that hit one nation after
another.
</P>
<P>
   The United States at the time felt an Asian fund would rival the
Washington-based International Monetary Fund's ability to deal with
economic crises. But the IMF's admitted mishandling of the Asian
crisis, which made the recession deeper than it needed to be, kept
the dream of an Asian-led plan alive.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, the top U.S. official at the annual meeting of the
Asian Development Bank reacted positively to Saturday's deal
between the East Asian nations to a swap plan to protect each
other's currencies in times of crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Edwin M. Truman, the Treasury Department's assistant secretary
for international affairs, told a news conference that Washington
supported the idea in general but was awaiting the details.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have long supported regional cooperation, in this region
and others,'' Truman said. ''We think this is a fine idea. But the
nature of financial arrangements depends on the details.''
</P>
<P>
   The so-called Chiang Mai Initiative, named for this northern
Thai city, brings together the 10 members of the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations plus Japan, China and South Korea in a
pledge to rescue currencies in case of speculative attacks or other
problems.
</P>
<P>
   The groups will need to work out details such as the amount of
money and whether fixed exchange-rate bands will be involved.
</P>
<P>
   The mechanism would revolve around currency swaps, which in
theory could allow the financial authorities of troubled countries
to gain access to the reserves of allies to use in buying up their
own currencies -- and keeping up exchange rates.
</P>
<P>
   Kiichi Miyazawa, the Japanese finance minister, said Sunday that
the monetary cooperation would lead to a stronger region. The
result would be ''improving regulatory frameworks and accounting
systems to ensure greater transparency,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The currency-swap scheme builds on a plan adopted two months ago
by ASEAN finance ministers and expands it to the Northeast Asian
powers, part of a vague but continued drive to give Asia more clout
on the global stage against the North American Free Trade Agreement
and European Union.
</P>
<P>
   ASEAN comprises Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia,
Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   About 4,000 marched to the hotel where bank officials held their
annual meeting Sunday, pushing against outnumbered police before
they were allowed greater access to the area. Many were protesting
the bank's funding support of a mammoth wastewater treatment plant
outside Bangkok, the capital.

<HEADLINE> Man Arrested for Stalking Ronstadt  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUN CITY, Ariz. (AP) -- A man infatuated with Linda Ronstadt was
arrested for allegedly stalking the singer as she was preparing for
a concert here, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Bernard A. Ortiz, 55, was taken into custody Saturday on an
outstanding felony warrant for stalking out of Tucson, Ariz.,
Ronstadt's hometown.
</P>
<P>
   ''I love her,'' Ortiz told reporters as he was being transported
to jail in Phoenix. ''I just wanted to be there for her. That's
all.''
</P>
<P>
   Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio said Tucson police alerted
his office after being tipped off that Ortiz planned to attend
Ronstadt's show at the Sundome.
</P>
<P>
   Arpaio said Ortiz was easy to spot since he was dressed in a
white tuxedo and carrying a rose for the singer. He was arrested
some three hours before Ronstadt took the stage.
</P>
<P>
   Ronstadt's representatives did not immediately return calls
seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   ''For three years, he's been stalking this entertainer,'' Arpaio
said. ''We're glad to get him off the street.''
</P>
<P>
   Officers later searched Ortiz's car and found that he obtained
tickets to Saturday's concert by having them mailed to him in
Denver under a fake name.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said Ortiz has been sending Ronstadt cards and love
letters for years. He was sentenced to a 10-month prison term in
August 1998 for stalking her.
</P>
<P>
   Ronstadt has had a nearly 30-year singing career with numerous
hit singles like ''Blue Bayou'' and ''Living In The U.S.A''
although she has concentrated on Mexican music in recent years.

<HEADLINE> Researchers Split on Soccer Risks  </HEADLINE>
By IRA DREYFUSS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Researchers are split on whether repeatedly
bouncing a soccer ball off a young player's head can dent the
child's thinking ability.
</P>
<P>
   Some studies have found that players who suffer repeated blows
to the head can have impaired cognition years later. But players
can suffer head injury by running into other players or a goal
post, or striking their head on the ground in a fall. Experts at a
Washington conference generally agreed it's too soon to blame
heading the ball.
</P>
<P>
   One researcher, however, said his work on crash test dummies
indicates the impact of a ball is powerful enough to warrant head
protection.
</P>
<P>
   The conference was called by the Consumer Product Safety
Commission. ''One of the interests for us is whether subtle effects
are present as a result of head contact with the ball,'' said Ron
Medford, assistant executive director for hazard identification and
reduction. CPSC was looking for information, not trying to make
soccer rules, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The CPSC study was a response to research such as a study in the
Journal of the American Medical Association in 1999 which reported
that amateur soccer players scored lower than amateur athletes in
other sports on tests of memory and planning. The researchers
suspected that repeated blows to the head may be the reason. Other
studies, in Europe, found similar problems in elite players.
</P>
<P>
   An unpublished study presented at the CPSC conference tried to
find the effect of the impact when a ball is headed. Researcher
Mariusz Ziejewski of North Dakota State University tested the
impact of soccer balls of crash test dummy heads, and used computer
modeling to estimate what those results could mean in terms of
brain injury. The balls struck the heads with 150-200 pounds of
force, which Ziejewski considered to be less than those which can
occur in a game.
</P>
<P>
   In a properly headed ball, the forehead takes the impact, and
bent knees absorb much of the force. But in an improperly headed
ball, by an inexperienced player who may be caught by surprise,
movement of the head creates rotational force on the brain,
Ziejewski said.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the impacts would be sufficient to create shearing
stresses that could stretch and deform brain tissue, if the ball is
not headed properly, Ziejewski concluded. ''If you execute the
header properly ... the effect on your brain most likely is very
minimal,'' he said. ''If you get hit in the head and you don't
expect it, it could be a different story.''
</P>
<P>
   Use of padded headgear could reduce the effect of low impacts to
minimal levels, Ziejewski said, based on his study, which was
funded through a research grant to the university from SoccerDocs,
a St. Paul, Minn., company that makes the headgear.
</P>
<P>
   However, knowing what happens in a crash test dummy is not the
same as knowing what happens in a player's brain. And other
participants at the conference questioned Ziejewski's definition of
a potential injury level. Researchers can't tell the amount of
impact necessary to cause mild deficits, said Trey Crisco, an
associate professor of orthopedics and engineering at Brown
University. Crisco and other experts also questioned whether there
is a need for players to wear head protection.
</P>
<P>
   There are few reported cases of concussion, which itself is not
always easy to identify, and the problem of milder injuries, which
was a major focus of the CPSC conference, would be even harder to
pick up, Crisco said.
</P>
<P>
   However, a 1998 National Institutes of Health consensus
statement on traumatic brain injury estimated ''90 percent of
sports-related TBIs are mild and may go unreported.'' Risk factors
for such injuries are rarely studied, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Head protection conceivably could make matters worse by giving
players a false sense of security, which could encourage them to
take more risks, said Bill Mason, senior member of the referee
committee at the American Youth Soccer Organization. If young
players are hurt from heading the ball, it's probably a rare event,
he said. However, he considered the issue worth watching,
especially when the header comes off a ball kicked high and
downfield.
</P>
<P>
   The youth soccer group said that coaches should not insist that
players head the ball if they don't want to, but it said teaching
the skill is imperative for those who do want to.

<HEADLINE> Part of Prehistoric Beast Unearthed  </HEADLINE>
By TOM GARDNER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   GARDNERVILLE, Nev. (AP) -- Time and archaeological graverobbers
are finally taking their toll on a prehistoric gem that has
withstood millions of years of geologic upheaval.
</P>
<P>
   Within a month of the chance discovery of the fossilized remains
of a mastodon in late March and before excavation could begin,
looters had moved in, taking some artifacts and damaging others.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Lugaski, director of the W.M. Keck Museum at the University
of Nevada, Reno, is optimistic they left the best stuff behind.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's like Christmas time with all these packages around
here,'' he said as the dig got under way at the end of April.
</P>
<P>
   To his right, a shallow pile of crushed ribs bore testimony to
the work of vandals. But to his left, some 20 scientists, students
and volunteers picked and chipped around the partially exposed leg
of the creature, which roamed what was then a marshy western Nevada
some 3 million to 3.5 million years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The surprising find was made at the end of March by two
teen-agers who were riding motorcycles in the steep and rocky
canyons of the Pine Nut Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Derek Prosser and Dustin Turner not only recognized the object
sticking out of the rock as a large bone, but reported their find
to the federal Bureau of Land Management.
</P>
<P>
   Prosser, 18, said he had seen enough bones to know these weren't
just an outcropping of rock, especially when he spotted the
crystallized marrow.
</P>
<P>
   ''After taking a close look, it kind of shocked me. I knew it
was something very unusual,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The boys took some specimens to the bureau.
</P>
<P>
   ''They did everything exactly right. We're lucky they found the
bones and even luckier they reported it,'' the bureau's historical
archaeologist Gary Bowyer said. The find is on BLM-administered
land.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the rugged remoteness of the site, word leaked out of
its whereabouts and there have been signs of non-scientific
exploration, Bowyer said. That put pressure on the experts to
interrupt their Easter weekend before there's any lasting damage.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is an emergency excavation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Using tools ranging from pressure bars to hammers and chisels to
soft brushes, workers hunkered down in a pit about 10 feet in
diameter to remove the fairly soft sandstone from around the buried
bone.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have the front leg, from the shoulder down to the foot,''
Lugaski said. ''At this point, we don't know if there is any more
that we can see. It would be nice if we could find the whole thing,
but they die and disintegrate.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the foreleg alone is a rich reward.
</P>
<P>
   ''Most often, you'll get a piece of tooth, a piece of leg bone.
A whole front leg starts to get fairly rare. What's important is
they're finding more and more pieces of it.''
</P>
<P>
   A fist-sized chunk of skull and the fragments of rib bones leave
Lugaski optimistic that more work will unearth discoveries that
range beyond just the leg.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hopefully there'll be some more out there. It could be
scattered over hundreds of feet. You never know,'' Lugaski said.
</P>
<P>
   The dig is on hold until workers remove dirt and rocks the
centuries have deposited in the rocky canyon uphill from the
excavation.

<P>
   The paleontologically rich area already has yielded remains of
camels, horses and extinct bears, which help establish the date of
the American mastodon as being at the upper end of the species'
reign in North America. They first appeared about 3.75 million
years ago and abruptly disappeared 10,000 years ago at the
beginning of the Ice Age.
</P>
<P>
   A youngster had little trouble gathering ancient non-mastodon
teeth lying on the steep hillside above the dig to turn over to the
researchers. Walking off with archaeological trophies can bring a
stiff fine.
</P>
<P>
   The site now almost exactly one mile above sea level originally
was some 700 feet lower and was much wetter since the Sierra were
still forming and Pacific storms could easily cross into the
valley, according to Pat Cashman, an associate professor of geology
at UNR.
</P>
<P>
   The climate encouraged the growth of shrubs and small trees in
great enough abundance to keep the elephant-like animals well fed.
</P>
<P>
   ''They'd clear off this whole hillside in no time today,''
Cashman said, gesturing toward the spotty growth of juniper and
sagebrush.
</P>
<P>
   Mastodons were smaller than their towering relatives, the
mammoths, and were squatter and longer than modern elephants,
averaging 6 feet to 10 feet at the shoulder and about 15 feet from
the root of the tusks to the start of their tail. They were covered
by a coarse, reddish-brown hair.
</P>
<P>
   The age of this mastodon makes it a rare find but also makes
radioactive carbon dating impossible since that is accurate only to
about 500,000 years, according to UNR graduate student Tom Mantean.
Other dating methods and fossilized material around the excavation
will make more accurate dating possible as the remains are studied
in greater detail at the university.

<HEADLINE> Weather Program Could Hurt Farmers  </HEADLINE>
By ROXANA HEGEMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   Atop his tractor, Dennis Franklin watches time and again as
storm clouds gather over his parched farmland in northwest Kansas
and a handful of small planes appear, releasing dry ice and flares
into the base of the storm in an attempt to stop hail from forming.
</P>
<P>
   Then he looks on as the storm clouds dissipate, instead of
dumping a soaking rain on his wheat, corn and milo fields.
</P>
<P>
   Franklin and his neighbors wonder whether the Kansas Weather
Modification Program, which expanded its cloud seeding into
northwest Kansas in 1997 to suppress crop-destroying hail, actually
is robbing them of precious rainfall.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is basically a farming area, and you are messing with our
livelihood,'' said Franklin, who farms in Rawlins and Thomas
counties. ''We have lived here quite a few years and taken it as it
came. But that is part of farming. We don't need anybody
influencing it, especially when they don't have any more control
than they do.''
</P>
<P>
   In response to the weather program, one of the largest of its
kind in the nation, Franklin and a few neighbors formed a group
called Citizens for Natural Weather. Soon the dissident group grew
to more than 550 people from Cheyenne, Rawlins, Decatur, Sherman
and Thomas counties, among others.
</P>
<P>
   Last April, Cheyenne County in Kansas passed a resolution of
non-support of the cloud seeding program. Two months later, Rawlins
County decided to end its participation. This past February,
Decatur County commissioners also wanted out. A petition is
currently circulating in Thomas County to bring the issue to a vote
there. In neighboring Colorado, Kit Carson County withdrew from the
cloud seeding program.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, those who have been doing weather modification in
southwest Kansas for 25 years dismiss the groundswell of opposition
as simply a public misunderstanding of the science of weather
modification.
</P>
<P>
   ''Those people are not meteorologists, they are not
scientists,'' said Keith Lebbin, manager of the Western Kansas
Groundwater Management District. ''It is impossible to delete their
rainfall and make it fall downwind. If this program is as bad as
those people indicate, we wouldn't be doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Now part of the debate is a new study released by Kansas State
University, done by Brian Vulgamore for his graduate degree
program. Vulgamore, 23, works his Scott City family farm with his
father and brother. They grow more than 8,000 acres of crop and
finish about 2,000 head of Herefords on two small feedlots.
</P>
<P>
   ''I always thought they did something positive, but I wasn't
sure,'' Vulgamore said about the weather modification programs.
''Being a farmer, I wanted to know if there is a possibility they
are reducing my rainfall. Are they reducing hail?''
</P>
<P>
   Vulgamore examined rainfall data for affected counties dating
back to the 1940s and looked at hail data dating to 1948. He
concluded it couldn't be scientifically proven that the cloud
seeding program was affecting rainfall or hail in the region.
</P>
<P>
   That is because to come up with a statistically significant
reduction -- given the wide variability of western Kansas weather --
the program would have to suppress hail by 60 percent. That is
something nobody is claiming the weather modification program can
do.
</P>
<P>
   But if the cloud seeding succeeds in reducing hail even by just
3 percent, the program would pay for itself just in the savings to
farmers, Vulgamore said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is a good technology,'' he said. ''There is a huge
possibility of benefit to this technology.''
</P>
<P>
   Vulgamore found that counties within the program's target area
had a 15 percent drop in hail-related crop loss when compared with
neighboring counties not in the target area. But he was quick to
also note that such a reduction could be as easily attributed to
natural hail patterns.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that every one of the five to seven evaluations of the
weather modification program done by the Kansas Water Office and
other researchers through the years has come back with different
results.
</P>
<P>
   And Vulgamore was especially critical of a 1994 study published
last year in the Journal of Weather Modification that concluded the
Kansas Weather Modification Program was decreasing rainfall by
seven-tenths of an inch, while claiming that such an amount wasn't
economically significant.
</P>
<P>
   ''They can't say that with scientific certainty,'' he said.
''But if they are changing rainfall by even a small amount, it will
be economically significant.''
</P>
<P>
   An added inch of rain during the growing season in arid western
Kansas can mean an economic gain of about $18 million to farmers
there, according to Vulgamore's study. A 1-inch loss of rainfall
during the growing season translates into economic losses in excess
of $19 million for western Kansas, the study found.
</P>
<P>
   At the Western Kansas Groundwater Management District, Lebbin
said he had ''no problem'' with Vulgamore's study, saying it
closely correlates to other studies done by the Kansas water
office.
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas Weather Modification Program covers 16,000 square
miles, or 10.2 million acres. Last year, it included 16 full and
six partial northwest Kansas counties and portions of three
Colorado counties. It was begun in 1975 in southwest Kansas by the
Groundwater Management District in Lakin. It expanded in 1997 into
northwest Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   Texas has 10 similar projects, and the entire state of Oklahoma
has a weather modification program, as does western North Dakota,
among others.
</P>
<P>
   The latest scientific findings do little to ease the fears of
Franklin, a fourth-generation farmer who runs cattle in addition to
raising crops. He said the latest study could be interpreted many
ways.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've farmed for 25 years and I never saw clouds dissipate in
the way I've seen them in the last few years,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Wayne Bossert, the manager of the Northwest Kansas
Groundwater Management District, said that when clouds fall apart,
it doesn't mean cloud seeding is responsible. That phenomenon is
caused by the dew point where the clouds form, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lebbin also dismissed Franklin's observations: ''That is just
not true. If you have that kind of power with the program, it would
be awesome. But it doesn't work that way.''

<P>
   The Kansas Weather Modification program resumed its cloud
seeding flights April 20 but kept its planes out of the three
northwest Kansas counties embroiled in the controversy over the
seeding.
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas program flies nine aircraft, tracking storms as they
develop through their radar facilities in Lakin and Colby. Cloud
seeding usually ends around Sept. 20.
</P>
<P>
   Most flights are aimed at suppressing hail.
</P>
<P>
   Hailstones are created when ice forms around windblown dust and
soil particles in clouds, called ice nuclei, as the temperature
cools. The idea behind cloud seeding is to provide more of these
nuclei for the water droplets to form so either the hail never
forms or at least decreases the size of the hailstones, according
to the program's Web page.
</P>
<P>
   To do that, the cloud seeding plane flies at the base of the
storm where strong updrafts occur. Here it releases dry ice or
flares.
</P>
<P>
   In southwest Kansas, the counties and Western Kansas Groundwater
District put up $507,000 for the program, with another $340,000 in
state funds from the Kansas Water Authority, said Keith Lebbin,
manager for the Western Kansas Groundwater Management District.
</P>
<P>
   In northwest Kansas, the Northwestern Kansas Groundwater
Management District contracted with the existing program in
southwestern Kansas to provide weather modification services. The
groundwater district spent $181,000 for its share of the program,
with the state kicking in matching funds, said Wayne Bossert,
manager for the Northwestern Kansas Groundwater Management
District.
</P>
<P>
   The state of Kansas has been trying to entice the 39 western
Kansas counties to join the seed clouding program by providing
matching funds from a $390,000 state pot for weather modification,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The state withheld $41,000 from this year's program when some of
the counties began pulling out, Bossert said.

<HEADLINE> Gore Team Juggle Clinton Issue  </HEADLINE>
By SONYA ROSS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Publicly, President Clinton takes a back seat
when it comes to Vice President Al Gore's campaign. Privately, he
is more involved than any other modern president in trying to help
his vice president become his successor.
</P>
<P>
   Wistful over the end of his own two terms in office, Clinton can
seem like an overeager parent at times, shameless in his plugs,
insistent in his unsolicited help.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton praises the vice president effusively while raising
money from the Democratic faithful. But his effort doesn't stop
there. He is also quick to telephone Gore to share ideas. And
occasionally, when Gore comes across as clumsy, he'll put his own
smoothness on display almost as if he were giving Gore an
on-the-job tutorial.
</P>
<P>
   ''The president has been through this before, so from time to
time he has some thoughts. They talk,'' says White House spokesman
Joe Lockhart. ''The president is always interested in how it's
going out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart adds, ''I wouldn't say that's a major part of his
effort, to be providing campaign advice. He certainly believes this
is the vice president's campaign to run.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, according to a high-ranking administration official,
Clinton sometimes comments on Gore's campaign during meetings in
the White House residence, saying ''I would handle it this way''
or, ''Here's what I would do.''
</P>
<P>
   The official, who commented only on condition of anonymity,
described the president as frustrated that he can't do more.
</P>
<P>
   History doesn't offer great hope for a successful handoff. Only
four vice presidents have succeeded their bosses: John Adams,
Thomas Jefferson, Martin Van Buren and George Bush.
</P>
<P>
   None got much support from the retiring president.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Reagan made several campaign appearances for Bush, but
steered clear of blatant boosterism. Endorsing his vice president
at a May 1988 fund-raiser, he mispronounced Bush's name to rhyme
with ''rush.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Clinton made his support clear well before Gore
formally entered the race. He sent out fund-raising letters on
Gore's behalf in May 1999. His aides huddled with women activists
last year to glean advice on issues, a session that gave Gore a
jump on endorsements. Though he has joined Gore on the campaign
trail only twice in the past two months, he acts in tandem with the
vice president on stump issues almost every day.
</P>
<P>
   For example, on Thursday, a day before Gore unveiled his plan to
improve teacher quality, Clinton was in Columbus, Ohio, urging
voters to pay attention to the proposal Gore was offering.
</P>
<P>
   ''He came and talked to me about this,'' Clinton said. ''It was
entirely his idea, not mine.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Clinton joined Gore in lambasting a videotape of a
National Rifle Association official touting the NRA's potential
influence in the administration of Gore's rival, Gov. George W.
Bush, the former president's son. Clinton accidentally called the
Texas governor ''President Bush'' and had to correct himself.
</P>
<P>
   At a New York fund-raiser last month, Clinton portrayed his
involvement in Gore's campaign as a logical extension of his close
relationship with his No. 2.
</P>
<P>
   ''I probably know more about him than anybody but Tipper,''
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   He went on to describe Gore as having a say in ''every difficult
decision we ever made, every controversial one, every one that
could have wrecked both our careers.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Gore joked, ''I thought you were a little stingy
with those comments. You could have laid it on a little thicker
than that, and it would have been fine with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Dave Rohde, political scientist at Michigan State University,
said Gore's situation is awkward.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's almost a necessity that, at least on public policy
questions, the president is going to eclipse the candidate,'' Rohde
said. ''Gore has to be sensitive to the president's feelings ... so
as not to provoke a negative reaction from the president or among
his supporters.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore sometimes shows publicly that he lacks Clinton's finesse.
</P>
<P>
   Take a reception in Los Angeles last month. It was Gore's moment
to shine before donors who ponied up $2.8 million. But he wound up
egg-faced when he compared electing a Republican as president to
rejecting an Oscar-winning team in favor of the producers of the
Hollywood clunker ''Howard the Duck.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the evening's hosts, Jeffrey Katzenberg, was a driving
force behind ''Howard the Duck.'' The crowd tittered.
</P>
<P>
   In came Clinton. He recited a litany of great presidents --
''Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln, Roosevelt, Gore'' -- and, after
whispered prompting from Gore, added, ''Oh yeah, put Clinton in
there somewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Then came an unsolicited assist: ''I actually liked 'Howard the
Duck.'''

<HEADLINE> On trade with China, a Democrat decides while another mulls  </HEADLINE>
By LAURENCE ARNOLD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Rep. Rob Andrews wondered whether China needs
the United States more than the United States needs China. Rep. Bob
Menendez weighed human rights abuses in the communist nation. Both
worried about retraining American workers whose jobs go overseas.
</P>
<P>
   As the final two fence-sitters in New Jersey's House delegation
on the subject of permanent trade relations with China, Menendez
and Andrews last week were considering a variety of factors, both
local and global.
</P>
<P>
   One finally decided, while the other continued to mull.
</P>
<P>
   To an unusual degree, the debate over trade with China is
forcing Democrats in Congress to make agonizing choices.
</P>
<P>
   Do they support labor and environmental groups, their
traditional allies, who oppose the deal? Or do they side with
business, a group with which Democrats have tried to make inroads?
Do they vote with President Clinton, their party's titular head and
a supporter of China trade, or follow the lead of House Minority
Leader Dick Gephardt of Missouri, who opposes the deal?
</P>
<P>
   An Associated Press poll last week -- three weeks before a
showdown vote -- showed that nearly half of the House's 211
Democrats say they will oppose the China trade package. Roughly 150
of the House's 222 Republicans are expected to support the
legislation that would bestow normal permanent trade relations on
China and end the current practice of annual reviews.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey Democratic Reps. Frank Pallone, Bill Pascrell, Steve
Rothman and Rush Holt have said they will oppose the trade deal,
while Rep. Donald Payne is leaning against it.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey's House Republicans are split on the issue. Reps.
Marge Roukema, Bob Franks and Rodney Frelinghuysen support normal
trade status; Reps. Frank LoBiondo, Jim Saxton and Chris Smith
oppose it.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, when Menendez revealed he will vote against normal
trade relations with China, human rights was the first reason he
cited.
</P>
<P>
   Menendez, D-Union City, said a quarter century of engagement has
not stopped ''forced abortions, arrested dissidents, prison camp
labor, slave labor'' and other human rights abuses from taking
place in China.
</P>
<P>
   He wondered as well whether China will follow the rules of free
trade, opening their market to goods.
</P>
<P>
   From proponents of the deal, Menendez said, ''all I heard is,
'We'll do more business.' But I'm sure today we're doing more
business in China than we were before, and we have a bigger trade
deficit than we had before.''
</P>
<P>
   Menendez voted consistently over the years against most-favored
nation status for China -- the annual vote that would no longer be
necessary under if permanent trade status is approved.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are winners and losers in trade, and unfortunately I've
represented a good number of the losers -- textiles, garments, small
manufacturers,'' Menendez said. ''And in those cases, the
government has done a lousy job (at helping) displaced workers, and
the private sector just (views them) as the casualties of economic
war.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrews, D-Haddon Heights, said Thursday he was still undecided.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm listening to both sides,'' he said. ''I'm speaking to
business representatives and the (Clinton) administration on the
one hand, and labor and environmental groups on the other.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrews said he asked proponents of the trade deal three
questions:
</P>
<P>
   How many manufacturers will take their business and their jobs
to China?
</P>
<P>
   If trade with China is not normalized now, will the United
States retain leverage, or will China merely trade with Asians and
Europeans?
</P>
<P>
   Will Americans who lose their jobs as a result of the deal get
job retraining and continued health insurance?
</P>
<P>
   Andrews opposed most-favored nation status for China his first
few years in Congress but later supported it, believing that ''we
have to have some level of engagement with the Chinese.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Menendez, Andrews said China's human rights abuses will
not affect his decision.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe that increased trade with China will improve human
rights in China,'' he said. ''I take that as a given.''

<HEADLINE> Elian Raid Echoes for Photographer  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT TANNER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The photograph he snapped still troubles the
nation, but it isn't the images that disturb Alan Diaz's dreams. It
is the sounds.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks after Diaz caught on film the instant when federal
agents with goggles and assault weapons snatched a crying Elian
Gonzalez from his Miami relatives, the moment still burns. Now the
boy is reunited with his Cuban father in Maryland as the
international custody dispute continues. New photos show him
smiling.
</P>
<P>
   For Diaz, a 43-year-old free-lance photographer on assignment
for The Associated Press, it often seems as if he never left the
all-day, all-night vigils outside the Little Havana home.
</P>
<P>
   Now Diaz, who is in New York to speak at the AP annual meeting
Monday, sleeps up to 16 hours a day, piecemeal, after nearly five
months of constant watch broken by occasional half-hour naps. But
rest is elusive. ''I snooze off, I'm there. I'm still there, you
know?''
</P>
<P>
   ''All I hear is that kid's crying,'' said Diaz, who has raised
four children of his own. ''The most awful cry you could ever hear
in your life.''
</P>
<P>
   He can't shake the sounds of the crowd, either -- the hundreds
crowded outside the family's home on weekends and evenings, the
dozens that spent the night talking, praying, sipping coffee.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can hear this noise of the Cuban protesters,'' Diaz said.
''It was like a monster breathing, but with the sounds of some
talking, some chanting. ... I can hear that every day, every
night.''
</P>
<P>
   Diaz, Bronx-born and of Cuban descent, refuses to offer a
judgment on who might be right and who wrong, or even the emotions
his photo inspired. ''To me, it was just another assignment.''
</P>
<P>
   He gained the trust of the boy's great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez,
respecting his wishes.
</P>
<P>
   Diaz is crystal-clear on what he saw, heard and did in the few
minutes that he sprinted from the fence of the family's yard in the
pre-dawn darkness ahead of the agents, flew through the house and
into the room where the boy was held in the arms of a fisherman who
found him, months earlier, floating on an inner tube off the
Florida coast.
</P>
<P>
   But he cannot say what occurred outside the frame of his camera
viewfinder.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, he doesn't know whether federal agents tore the
bedroom door off its hinges. Diaz said he saw the door kicked open,
and his photos show a crack in the door. But they don't show the
door trampled to the floor, as does a photo taken later in the day
when the family showed the damage. Diaz doesn't know what happened.
</P>
<P>
   Though the boy's cousin, Marisleysis Gonzalez, accused agents of
cursing at her, Diaz cannot say.
</P>
<P>
   As the agents came through the home's front door, ''I heard
noise, but I couldn't hear what was said. My mind wasn't set on
that,'' he said. He was up against the bedroom's back wall, taking
a shot of the boy and the fisherman crouched in the closet.
</P>
<P>
   And neither could he say whether the family had pushed a sofa
across the front door, as agents said in their reports. After he
and a TV cameraman came inside, the door was slammed shut behind
him and two men in the house stood against it.
</P>
<P>
   Diaz still hopes to go to Maryland and shoot more photos of
Elian, though there's been no media access at the retreat where the
boy and his father are staying pending a court decision on the
case. In the meantime, he's got a baseball game to shoot this week.
</P>
<P>
   ''All this craziness out of this photo,'' he said. ''All I did
was do my job.''

<HEADLINE> Sens., Gore At Odds on Retirement  </HEADLINE>
By CURT ANDERSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- At odds with Vice President Al Gore, two
Democratic senators and a Republican colleague said Sunday a
portion of Social Security taxes should be invested in private
markets to help people save more for retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has sharply criticized Republican presidential candidate
George W. Bush for advocating a similar approach, but Democratic
Sens. Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York and Bob Kerrey of
Nebraska say it would not be risky if designed right.
</P>
<P>
   ''You're not risking anything like your retirement benefits,''
Moynihan said on ''Fox News Sunday.'' ''They're fixed. They're
guaranteed. This is just an extra thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Moynihan, Kerrey and Sen. Rick Santorum, R-Pa., say the system
would be similar to the diverse investments made now by 401(k) and
pension fund managers. They added, however, that millions of
middle-class people who are not covered by private plans have scant
retirement savings.
</P>
<P>
   ''No one is suggesting that we eliminate the basic benefit of
Social Security,'' Santorum said on CBS' ''Face the Nation.'' ''We
are denying over half the people of this country the greatest
source of wealth, which is gains in the stock market.''
</P>
<P>
   Moynihan, for example, outlined a bill that would enable a
worker to voluntarily invest 2 percentage points of the 12.4
percent Social Security tax now shared by employers and employees.
The government would designate which types of investments would be
offered, but federal officials would not control the choices made.
</P>
<P>
   ''Lower-income people would come to retirement and they'd have a
little wealth,'' Moynihan said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush last week announced he favored unspecified Social Security
individual investment accounts, which Gore immediately called a
''stock market roulette'' threat to the program.
</P>
<P>
   Also appearing on CBS, Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., said any
talk of investing Social Security money in the stock market removes
a ''safe floor'' that people always should be able to count on.
</P>
<P>
   Like Gore, Schumer said Bush should release a detailed plan
before the November elections. Advisers say Bush will discuss his
ideas more in depth this week.
</P>
<P>
   ''If Bush has a plan to radically change Social Security, he
ought to lay it out before the American people before the
election,'' Schumer said. ''There should be no secret plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said on CNN's ''Late Edition'' that
such details are rarely hashed over in a presidential race. ''Very
seldom in a campaign do you write a bill,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kerrey said on CBS that Gore campaign chairman Tony Coelho had
called to ask about setting up a meeting between the vice president
and Democrats who back the legislation creating personal accounts.
But Kerrey added: ''I don't know that there's any leeway'' in
Gore's position.
</P>
<P>
   Moynihan, the senior Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee,
said Social Security itself must be shored up before the huge baby
boom generation begins retiring. Two things that should be done
immediately, he said, are adjusting the consumer price index and
bringing people into the system who are newly hired at state and
local governments.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he thought most Democrats would support private
investment accounts, Moynihan said ''No, we have a great capacity
for missing opportunities.''

<HEADLINE> 'Good Person of New Haven' seeks to make better community  </HEADLINE>
By DIANE SCARPONI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) -- In the opening scene of ''The Good
Person of New Haven,'' an angel surveying the city for a good
person remarks: ''Don't know why they call it New Haven. Ought to
call it No Haven.''
</P>
<P>
   Right after that, the citizens of New Haven act together to
prove the angel wrong.
</P>
<P>
   The play, opening at the Long Wharf Theatre Wednesday, marks a
three-year effort to bring a community show to the city. But it's
more than a show about the community -- the community is the show.
</P>
<P>
   More than 600 people of all races, background, neighborhoods and
ages around New Haven spoke with the Cornerstone Theater Company of
Los Angeles as the script was drafted. About 300 people from
diverse backgrounds auditioned to be in the show.
</P>
<P>
   The musical play features 24 actors from the city and
surrounding towns, acting side-by-side with professional actors to
tell a story about the community.
</P>
<P>
   Adelaida Nunez, 31, a single mother of two, said the show has
been fun and rewarding -- both because of the thrill of being on
stage and because of the people she's met.
</P>
<P>
   ''I probably would have passed them 10 times in the street and
not known who they were'' were it not for the play, Nunez said.
''This has made us realize it's OK to be different because we
accept each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Leaders at the Long Wharf Theatre wanted to do such a show to
learn about the city and what is important to its residents, said
Michael Ross, the theater's managing director.
</P>
<P>
   Over 18 months, the theater hired Cornerstone to meet with city
residents, adapt a script to the city and put on the show.
</P>
<P>
   The theater is hosting several ''pay what you can nights'' and
is providing buses to help people from remoter parts of the city
get to Long Wharf.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not going to be about people having to pay for it. It's
about providing something for the people of the community,'' Ross
said. ''It's more important that this be seen by as many people as
we can.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The Good Person of New Haven'' is adapted from ''The Good
Person of Szechwan,'' a classic play in German by Bertolt Brecht.
</P>
<P>
   In the play, angels looking for a good person bestow a large
cash gift on Tyesha, a young woman who has turned to prostitution
to support herself. She uses the money to buy a convenience store
and commits herself to doing good. Tyesha's life goes on a
roller-coaster ride as she tries to do good without being taken
advantage of.
</P>
<P>
   The play takes funny and dramatic twists, and is sprinkled with
music and New Haven-area flavor, from the city's famous pizza
parlors to a typical city convenience store.
</P>
<P>
   Alison Carey, who adapted the play, said she learned in talking
with city residents that it seemed the whole city is grappling with
Tyesha's problem: how to be good and survive and meet everyone's
needs at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   Carey said she tried to put that struggle into words, while
expressing city residents' love of their community.
</P>
<P>
   ''New Haven has somewhat of a bad reputation. People in New
Haven seem very aware of that. They love their city, and when
people say bad things about it they don't believe them,'' Carey
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''People have the sense they have the ability to make things
better,'' Carey said. ''The question of how to be good -- how to
make things better -- is very important to people in New Haven.''
</P>
<P>
   Edi Jackson, 48, a local actress who teaches in city schools,
said she hoped the play would show that people from around the city
can come together to get things done.
</P>
<P>
   ''This shows when we pull together, we can get something
positive out of it and be friends afterwards,'' said Jackson, a
resident of the Dwight neighborhood.

<HEADLINE> Turnpike proposes tollbooths on sports complex ramp  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HACKENSACK, N.J. (AP) -- The New Jersey Turnpike Authority has
proposed a plan to charge drivers leaving the Meadowlands sports
complex and heading north -- a route that has been free for more
than 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   The plan for new tollbooths at a ramp just north of Exit 18W,
which could come as early as January 2003, depends on construction
of a proposed mega-mall that would bring millions of drivers to the
Hackensack Meadowlands each year. The new toll would cost drivers
about 55 cents, turnpike officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The ramps to and from the sports complex are now open only
during sports events. Drivers leaving the sports complex heading
south pay a toll after getting tickets at the 18W plaza, but
northbound drivers ride free.
</P>
<P>
   ''Today you don't pay for that, and you should,'' turnpike
Executive Director Edward Gross told The Record of Hackensack in
Sunday's editions. ''We maintain that facility, and in fairness, it
should be tolled. As soon as it becomes economically feasible,
we're going to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   But many officials in northern New Jersey said they oppose the
plan, which if approved would be the first time in 18 years the
Turnpike Authority put new tollbooths in a place that was
previously free. They say it's a way to charge drivers for a
segment of Route 95 that was to be free under a 1992 agreement with
the state.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's sneaky at best,'' said Bergen County Freeholder
J. William Van Dyke, a vice chairman of the North Jersey
Transportation Planning Authority, which oversees federal funds for
transportation projects. ''I don't see us approving any other
funding for the turnpike if they are going to do things like
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the Federal Highway Administration said the
proposal doesn't appear to violate any previous agreement with the
state, but would need closer inspection.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the first I've heard of it, and obviously we'd have to
look at this in more detail,'' said Robert Arnold, the federal
agency's assistant division administrator in Trenton.
</P>
<P>
   Turnpike Chief Engineer John Kunna argued that motorists have
alternatives to the Route 95 section, which was bought from the
state by the turnpike in 1992 for $400 million, and are not forced
to pay the toll. He said the tolls pay for another stretch of road
further south.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't buy that at all,'' said East Rutherford Mayor James
Cassella, adding that a new toll plaza could send drivers onto
already crowded roads in Moonachie and Little Ferry. ''A toll plaza
doesn't enhance anything other than the finances of the turnpike.''

<HEADLINE> Naked people, lost drivers, robbers take toll on Thruway workers  </HEADLINE>
By MARNIE EISENSTADT, 
The Daily Gazette
<TEXT>
<P>
   GUILDERLAND, N.Y. (AP) -- Off-key strains of ''Welcome to the
Jungle'' filtered over the public address system as Thruway workers
trickled across traffic in fluorescent orange vests.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Betor had just reached his tollbooth at the Exit 24 plaza.
He took his cash drawer out of the steel cabinet at the end of the
booth, opened his register and switched the red ''X'' above his
booth to a green arrow.
</P>
<P>
   Rush hour could now begin.
</P>
<P>
   It was only 2:30 p.m., but traffic at the state's most heavily
used toll plaza was already starting to line up. The driver of the
first car to come through his lane needed to know how to get to a
store. Without a second's hesitation, Betor told her, while doling
out her change.
</P>
<P>
   The woman was the first of about 1,500 drivers who would pass
through his lane that Wednesday. Some would just pay a toll, some
would need directions and others needed a joke to finish off the
day on a high note.
</P>
<P>
   But then there are the unpredictable tasks, such as reporting
people who are drinking alcohol as they pass through his lane.
Coaxing confused French-speaking drivers out of the E-Z Pass lane.
Averting his eyes and trying not to laugh when the next naked
driver flies through, an occurrence more common than most would
think.
</P>
<P>
   In a day, Betor deals with more people than most of us see over
the course of a month.
</P>
<P>
   He is a nine-year veteran of the Thruway system. The 32-year-old
has been stationed at a few different toll plazas, but his favorite
is where he works now. The action at 24 is constant, whereas places
like 26 and 25A can be dead for hours at a time. More than 24
million people pass through the Exit 24 Toll Plaza, which is the
confluence of the Thruway and the Adirondack Northway.
</P>
<P>
   ''No two days are the same,'' Betor said, making change for a $5
without glancing down at the drawer. But neither naked people nor
those who attempt sex while cruising through the tollbooth are
among the strangest things Betor said he's seen.
</P>
<P>
   The thing that confounds him year after year are the parents who
come to their children's graduation at the University at Albany
having no idea where the campus is.
</P>
<P>
   ''These people really don't know where their kids are. That's
strange,'' Betor said.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, he gives the directions, sometimes with a gentle
wisecrack. And at least the parents know what they are looking for.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of people just ask how to get home,'' he said, wondering
how people can have no concept of where they are and how they got
there. But not all of the problems can be solved with a few quips
and questions.
</P>
<P>
   Road rage has become an increasing concern for Betor and the
roughly 400 other full- and part-time tollbooth workers in the
Capital Region. Betor recounted an incident just a few days before
when a woman was screaming out her window at a man riding a
motorcycle. The motorcycle rider responded by revving his engine as
loud as he could.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was out of my lane like a bullet,'' Betor said. The woman
who had been screaming complained to Betor, but didn't want him to
call the police, which is all he can do. He was not required to
report the incident or any others that happen in his lane.
</P>
<P>
   Betor and others are instructed to be watchful of motorists who
pass through their lanes, but to make their own decisions about
what to report and what to let slide.
</P>
<P>
   ''Are they required to report things? No. Are they encouraged
to? I think so,'' said Ernie Davis, who trains tollbooth workers
from New York City to Albany.
</P>
<P>
   Workers are reminded that if they do report something, such as a
driver with a gun on a seat, they could be called to testify in
court. Betor said he and the other workers all have different
standards about what they report to state troopers.
</P>
<P>
   A father himself, he said he rarely hesitates to call in drivers
who have neglected to put their young children in car seats. But
other situations are less concrete.
</P>
<P>
   Davis said workers are told, over and over again, that they need
to consider their safety first and foremost. When an injured person
comes through their lane, workers are encouraged not to provide
first-aid assistance. They are instructed, instead, to contact the
dispatcher and request medical help.
</P>
<P>
   During the five days of training they get before starting the
job, tollbooth workers are told how to handle everything from
accidents and robberies to bloodied toll tickets.
</P>
<P>
   In the Toll Collector Orientation Workbook, ticket takers are
given step-by-step instructions for handling robberies and
gun-wielding customers.
</P>
<P>
   ''If shot at, slam the booth door, retreat to the rear of the
booth and dive for the floor,'' the book instructs. Davis also said
that, while the tollbooths are not made from bullet-proof
materials, they can deflect most types of ammunition.
</P>
<P>
   There are phones in the booths that give workers a direct line
to a central dispatch center, which then sends for the Thruway
division of the state police.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of a robbery or catastrophic accident, a toll worker
can summon police with a distress code using the phone system.
</P>
<P>
   Trooper Shelley Levin Ferro said that people who commit crimes
often head to the Thruway to escape the police, hoping to blend in
with the hundreds of other drivers. About five years ago, the
suspects in an armed robbery of a Capital Region jewelry store
headed south on the Thruway after holding up the store. Ferro said
the group was stopped in Coxsackie after asking a tollbooth worker
for directions to New York City. Six people were arrested and guns
and jewels were recovered.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want them to notice as much as they can,'' Ferro said. But
with all situations, Ferro said troopers want the toll workers to
watch, not get involved. ''Their safety is paramount,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   This was just the case when tollbooth workers found a naked man
urinating in a flowerpot in a closed toll lane. He seemed
disoriented, most likely drunk. He left his car running and his
windshield wipers going, even though it wasn't raining, Ferro said.
Instead of allowing him to get back into his car and proceed,
workers assumed that he might have been intoxicated and called
Thruway police.

<HEADLINE> Greystone patient who collapsed died of heart disease  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PARSIPPANY, N.J. (AP) -- An autopsy Sunday determined that a
56-year-old patient who collapsed at a cafeteria in Greystone Park
Psychiatric Hospital died of heart disease, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   The patient -- identified in Sunday's editions of The Star-Ledger
of Newark as Dominick Constantino -- collapsed Saturday after
finishing dinner in the Central Avenue complex of the institution,
which was ordered closed by Gov. Christie Whitman last week after
decades of problems.
</P>
<P>
   Capt. Christopher Linne, a spokesman for the Morris County
Prosecutor's Office, said Sunday that the patient died of heart
disease.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Mulcahy, a spokeswoman for the state Department of
Human Services, which oversees Greystone, said a doctor and three
nurses began cardiopulmonary resuscitation but were unable to
revive the patient. He was pronounced dead at the scene.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman ordered the hospital closed on April 28, citing a series
of problems that included patient assaults, suicides and
overcrowding.

Big Game May Exceed $300M   
By DAVID PITT
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- The jackpot in the Big Game lottery, already a
record $300 million, could go even higher.
</P>
<P>
   Lottery officials from the seven states that sell Big Game
tickets will confer by telephone Monday morning to decide whether
weekend sales were enough to justify a bigger jackpot for Tuesday
night's drawing. They'll talk again Tuesday morning to set the
final amount.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's previous record lottery jackpot was $295.7 million,
set in the multistate Powerball game in 1998. That prize was shared
by 13 machinists from Westerville, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   The frantic pace of ticket sales leading up to Friday's drawing
had increased the jackpot from $230 million to $250 million just in
the hours before that night's numbers were picked.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we're going to see the same thing. People will be
pooling their money,'' said Virginia Haines, New Jersey Lottery
executive director.
</P>
<P>
   ''If sales are going strong or are higher than anticipated or if
the bond interest rates go higher -- that also helps us increase the
jackpot,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Total sales from last Tuesday's drawing to Friday night exceeded
$122 million. New Jersey led with sales of nearly $34 million. The
game also is played in Georgia, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts,
Michigan and Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Haines attributed record New Jersey sales to large volumes of
ticket buyers from New York and Pennsylvania, states which don't
participate in multistate games.
</P>
<P>
   With the number of players drawn by the huge jackpot, lottery
officials predicted multiple winners.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have so many people playing across the country, when we
have a winner it seems logical to me that there might be 10 people
across America that have the same six digits,'' said Penelope W.
Kyle, executive director of the Virginia Lottery.
</P>
<P>
   Haines agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would be nice if we get a lot of winners,'' she said.
''When you have people pooling together a lot of money, they're
splitting it up among each other and (still getting) enough to help
them.''

<HEADLINE> Mellencamp Sheds College Gown  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BLOOMINGTON, Ind. (AP) -- Commencement formality doesn't much
impress John Mellencamp.
</P>
<P>
   The temperature was in the 80s when he approached the lectern to
address Indiana University's Class of 2000 on Saturday, so
Mellencamp shed his heavy academic gown.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's too hot,'' the Indiana rocker explained to the crowd of
35,000.
</P>
<P>
   Mellencamp, 48, told the graduates that it's nearly impossible
for people in their early 20s to know what to do with their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ''Take the pressure off yourself. I'm not talking about being
lazy. I'm talking about taking time for yourself and finding out
who the hell you are,'' said Mellencamp, a native of Seymour, Ind.
</P>
<P>
   ''If someone were to ask me casually about life, I would simply
say 'play it like you feel it, baby, and live it up, kid. You'll be
all right,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mellencamp was awarded an honorary doctor of music degree.

Budget includes debt reform, but not back-door borrowing ban

<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- State lawmakers voted overwhelmingly to
approve new debt-control measures in the 2000-01 budget, but some
were critical that a ban on the so-called back-door borrowing --
bonding not approved beforehand by voters -- was not included.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know that it isn't in here and I am disappointed that it
isn't,'' state Sen. Richard Dollinger said before the debt bill
sailed through his chamber.
</P>
<P>
   The Rochester Democrat pointed out it makes little sense to go
after general obligation debt, which requires voter approval, and
ignore back-door borrowing. He said the state is ''reforming the
part that we're not too bad on and letting that part that we're
terrible on go on.''
</P>
<P>
   In the other chamber, state Assemblyman John Flanagan echoed the
same thoughts and said lawmakers were missing a ''golden
opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   ''You can't tell the public you're serious about debt reduction
if you go only half way,'' the Nassau County Republican said.
''That is a bad fiscal practice that we failed to change.''
</P>
<P>
   Back-door borrowing, also known as appropriations bonding, has
been blamed in part for New York's poor credit rating. The state's
accumulated debt of $37.5 billion is the highest in the nation, and
New York is ranked at the bottom of states in credit-worthiness by
Moody's Investors Service and second-to-last by Standard and
Poor's.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Gov. George Pataki had advocated a
constitutional amendment that would limit how much the state could
borrow as well as ban back-door borrowing. But during budget
negotiations, the amendment idea, which could not become law until
November 2001 at the earliest, was dropped. Legislative leaders
instead agreed to a statute that set borrowing and debt-service
caps and tripled the state's debt reserves.
</P>
<P>
   It would require a constitutional amendment to change back-door
borrowing practices, not a statute.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki applauded passage of the Debt Reform Act last week, but
added that he would ''continue to push for the adoption of a
constitutional amendment to ban back-door borrowing and make these
changes a permanent part of the state constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   State Comptroller H. Carl McCall, who is considering running for
governor in 2002, blasted the debt-reform measure. Not only did
lawmakers not prohibit back-door borrowing, they approved an
additional $3 billion in back-door debt in the 2000-01 state
budget, he complained.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not debt reform. It's a business-as-usual wolf
disguised in reform clothing,'' McCall said.
</P>
<P>
   The comptroller had previously proposed banning back-door
borrowing by public authorities and replace it with bonding
supported by state revenues, which would also not require voter
approval. In 1995, voters rejected a McCall-backed amendment to the
state constitution which would have reformed debt practices and
curtailed back-door borrowing.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki aides countered McCall's criticism by questioning why he
did not lobby the Democratic Assembly to include a back-door
borrowing ban in the debt reform package.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Joseph Bruno said his chamber last year
approved a debt reform bill which would have put the brakes on
back-door borrowing, but it did not get through the Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   ''We passed a bill that prohibited back-door borrowing, pure and
simple,'' Bruno said. ''But the Assembly didn't do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver countered the charge, saying the
Debt Reform Act in the new budget is sufficient.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've done a debt reform bill and it's significant and
important,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The borrowing bill approved last week would prohibit the kind of
fiscal gimmicks, like the state's ''sale'' of the Attica state
prison, that have been used to justify some back-door borrowing in
the past.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street analysts said back-door borrowing is not necessarily
bad and is commonly used by many states. Lawmakers need them at
times for unpopular programs like prison construction that would be
voted down by voters. States also don't have enough cash to fund
all programs through pay-as-you-go systems, said Colleen Woodell,
director of public finance at Standard and Poor's
</P>
<P>
   ''You could get up in a little bit of a jam (without them). The
state does need to borrow sometimes,'' Woodell said.
</P>
<P>
   What sets New York apart from higher-rated states is that it has
so much debt and no strong control of its borrowing practices, she
said. Quasi-state agencies such as the Dormitory Authority and the
Thruway Authority often borrow on the New York state's credit
whereas other states have a stricter grip on the taking on of debt.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Kurtter, a senior vice president at Moody's Investors
Service, said New York legislators are exacerbating the situation
by using back-door debt ''as a tool for budget stabilization,'' not
for capital projects.
</P>
<P>
   ''Debt has been viewed as a free good,'' Kurtter, a former state
Assembly fiscal aide, said.
</P>
<P>
   Kurtter estimated that 75 percent of tax-supported debt in New
York is back-door debt. Woodell places it at 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Curtailing back-door borrowing alone will not solve New York's
credit-rating problem. Both Woodell and Kurtter said a complete ban
on the practice would have to be complemented by appropriate
alternative measures like revenue bonding and using cash in flush
times to pay off outstanding debt or in pay-as-you-go measures.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Kevin Spacey likes challenges. It's success
that worries the two-time Oscar winner.
</P>
<P>
   ''The longer I choose to do things that are challenging and
difficult and even scare me, the better the work will be,'' says
the 40-year-old actor. ''If I start getting a cocky attitude about
it and actually believe all the nice comments, then I'll probably
be on the rocks in no time.''
</P>
<P>
   Spacey, who just finished shooting ''Pay It Forward,'' is humble
about his chances of winning another Oscar nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ''If I'm sick of me, I can only imagine how other people feel,''
he told the Daily News of Los Angeles for a story Sunday. ''So I
think I'll probably sit it out next year. I mean, by the law of
averages, I'm due to get hit by a bus any day now.''

<HEADLINE> Hanks Shed 55 Pounds for Role  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Playing a solo castaway on a tropical island
turned out to be hard work for Tom Hanks.
</P>
<P>
   Hanks' character in ''Cast Away'' is marooned for four years, so
co-star Helen Hunt wasn't around for the scenes filmed in Fiji.
</P>
<P>
   ''It makes you crazy,'' he told Time magazine of playing a
character who is all by himself. ''You're not sharing the
storytelling lifting with someone you can react off of.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's almost like making a silent movie. You have to tell every
aspect of the story physically, being totally alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Hanks also had to drop 55 to 60 pounds for his role.
</P>
<P>
   ''Cast Away'' is set for a Christmas release.

<HEADLINE> Jason Brooks Adapts To Hawaii  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) -- Jason Brooks didn't even remotely
resemble a beach bum when he joined the cast of ''Baywatch
Hawaii.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The first day, I showed up with ear plugs and the nose plug
and was almost laughed out of swimming class,'' said the 6-foot-2
Brooks, who plays Sean Monroe, the captain of the TV series' elite
rescue team.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks, who played a villain on the soap opera ''Days of Our
Lives'' before jumping to ''Baywatch,'' now spends half the year
shooting in Hawaii and has become an expert in canoe surfing.
</P>
<P>
   He's also learning to cope with the Hawaiian climate.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some days we spend 10 hours in the hot sun and the water. It's
not easy to squeeze your body into five inches of available
shade,'' Brooks said.

<HEADLINE> Rail Slay Suspect Trial To Begin  </HEADLINE>
By MARK BABINECK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON (AP) -- Drifter Angel Maturino Resendiz goes on trial
Monday for only one of the nine slayings he is suspected of
committing while riding freight trains around the country. But
prosecutors might end up confronting him with all of the deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Opening arguments were to begin in the capital murder trial of
Maturino Resendiz, the 40-year-old Mexican citizen who surrendered
last July, 23 days after he was added to the FBI's 10 Most Wanted
list.
</P>
<P>
   He faces the death penalty if convicted of the December 1998
slaying of Dr. Claudia Benton at her home in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Maturino Resendiz is suspected of killing six people in Texas,
two in Illinois and one in Kentucky from 1997 to 1999. The slayings
all took place near train tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors are expected to present fingerprints and genetic
samples linking Maturino Resendiz to Benton's robbery, rape and
murder. In addition, Maturino Resendiz's wife turned in jewelry he
is suspected of stealing from Benton's home.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is good, hard physical evidence that will be difficult
to refute,'' said police Sgt. Ken Macha. ''I'm very confident the
evidence will speak for itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, prosecutor Devon Anderson is cautious.
</P>
<P>
   ''If it's one thing I've learned, juries are unpredictable,''
Anderson said before State District Judge Bill Harmon imposed a gag
order last week barring attorneys in the case from talking to
reporters. ''I think we have a good case, but I'm not taking
anything for granted.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the judge was expected to first consider a defense
change-of-ventue motion. If that is not granted, testimony could
last about one week.
</P>
<P>
   If Maturino Resendiz is convicted of killing Benton, Anderson
intends to present evidence from the other eight cases during the
trial's penalty phase.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't want to overwhelm the jury with all these capital
murders, but I still want to prove them beyond a reasonable
doubt,'' Anderson said.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Maturino Resendiz is sent to death row for Benton's
murder, prosecutors in Illinois and Kentucky have insisted they
also will try him for the slayings in their states.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with the wealth of circumstantial evidence in the Benton
slaying, court-appointed attorneys Allen Tanner and Rudy Duarte
were preparing an insanity defense. However, Maturino Resendiz has
told Harmon that he does not want to use it.
</P>
<P>
   Maturino Resendiz initially refused to talk with a
court-appointed psychiatrist after being examined by a defense
doctor. After the judge threatened to limit use of the insanity
defense if he continued to resist, Maturino Resendiz began talking
to the court expert in April.
</P>
<P>
   Maturino Resendiz has complained that the possibility of
execution violates the humane treatment his family requested when
he gave up after a six-week international manhunt, arranging to
surrender to a Texas Ranger on a remote border crossing between
Zaragosa, Mexico, and El Paso.
</P>
<P>
   Tanner said his client expected to be treated as he might have
been in Mexico, which has no death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   ''That was his understanding, and his family's understanding,''
Tanner said.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities still aren't sure why the killer chose Benton's
home.
</P>
<P>
   Benton, who was researching a rare genetic disorder known as
Angelman syndrome at the Baylor College of Medicine, was home alone
because her husband and twin daughters were out of state.
</P>
<P>
   ''We usually get calls on people walking around the neighborhood
who don't look like they belong there,'' Macha said. ''It's too
lucky for him to pick that house out of all the ones in the
neighborhood and to find her alone. How and why he picked her is a
mystery.''

<HEADLINE> MA Man May Plead Guilty to NM Slay  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARLSBAD, N.M. (AP) -- A Massachusetts man is expected to plead
no contest to charges he stabbed his best friend to death in the
arid back country of Carlsbad Caverns National Park last summer.
</P>
<P>
   In a plea agreement with prosecutors, Raffi Kodikian will enter
the plea Monday to a reduced charge of second-degree murder and
then testify about what he has called a mercy killing during a
sentencing hearing, said attorney Gary Mitchell. He had been
charged with first-degree murder.
</P>
<P>
   Kodikian, 25, has told investigators David Coughlin pleaded with
him to end his pain after the two got lost and ran out of water
while camping in the park. Kodikian said they believed they would
die.
</P>
<P>
   He faces up to 15 years in prison. But his plea will be given
with the condition that he has the right to appeal an earlier
ruling that barred a dehydration-dementia defense of temporary
insanity, Mitchell said.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence will be presented by both sides, expert witnesses will
testify about dehydration, and Kodikian will take the witness stand
himself, the attorney said.
</P>
<P>
   Kodikian, of Boston, had been traveling with Coughlin, 26, of
Millis, Mass., to California, where Coughlin had planned to begin
graduate studies at U.C. Santa Barbara.
</P>
<P>
   ''The boys were the best of friends, never meant any harm to
anybody, including themselves,'' Mitchell said. ''They get lost,
have no water for three days, are severely dehydrated, both in
extreme agony, and both attempt suicide.
</P>
<P>
   ''David pleads with Raffi to end his life, and Raffi -- in what
most people call a mercy killing -- does as his best friend
wishes,'' Mitchell said.
</P>
<P>
   An Aug. 8 journal entry by Kodikian details Coughlin's death:
''I killed and buried my friend today. ... David had been in pain
all night. At around 5 or 6 (a.m.) he turned to me &AMP; begged that I
put a knife in his chest. I did, &AMP; a second time when he wouldn't
die.''
</P>
<P>
   Park personnel rescued Kodikian about six hours after Coughlin
died.
</P>
<P>
   ''If they'd been there six hours earlier, we wouldn't be here
today,'' Mitchell said.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell said he will ask District Judge Jay Forbes for
leniency, suggesting Kodikian could perform community service by
appearing before groups to tell his story as a warning for desert
campers.
</P>
<P>
   The judge wouldn't allow the dementia defense, Mitchell said,
''because New Mexico's involuntary intoxication defense requires
the involuntary intake of some type of substance. ... In this case,
it's the failure or inability to take in a substance, due to the
unavailability of that substance: water.''
</P>
<P>
   In 23 years defending clients, Mitchell said it's a first.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've represented people in mercy killings before, asked judges
to allow doctors to remove life-support systems, but never have I
had one like this.''
</P>
<P>
   The state Office of the Medical Investigator concluded Coughlin
was in moderate to severe dehydration but that his body fluids were
not yet lethally low when he was killed.
</P>
<P>
   Survival experts will testify about how far someone can walk
without water, Mitchell said, and what humans can and cannot do
under such circumstances. Military survival accounts will be
included in evidence, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think a lot of their questions are going to be answered by
Raffi's testimony,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> WV Man, 85, Runs for Congress Again  </HEADLINE>
By RANDY COLEMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ELKINS, W.Va. (AP) -- The candidates' luncheon is over, but
85-year-old Ken Hechler would rather hit the streets and promote
his congressional campaign than climb into his red Jeep for the
3-hour drive back to Charleston.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you don't mind, I'd rather not leave just yet,'' Hechler
says. ''I want to campaign a little downtown.''
</P>
<P>
   And off he goes, walking into snow and a brisk wind toward the
business district of the town of 5,000.
</P>
<P>
   Hechler, a Democrat, is one of West Virginia's most recognizable
citizens after more than 40 years in public life. On this day, he
strolls through Elkins hugging women and pumping hands, never
meeting a stranger.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a beautiful day to be in Randolph County!'' he crows.
</P>
<P>
   The 2nd Congressional District stretches across the state's
midsection and has no incumbent; Rep. Bob Wise is running for the
Democratic nomination for governor.
</P>
<P>
   The winner of Tuesday's Democratic primary is heavily favored to
defeat Republican Shelley Moore Capito of Charleston and
Libertarian John Brown of Hurricane, both of whom are unopposed in
the primary.
</P>
<P>
   Hechler's political career dates back to the New Deal. Since
1984, he has been secretary of state. While he hasn't stated a
clear reason for abandoning what most would consider an ideal
pre-retirement perch, his comments suggest he misses the prestige
and power of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   He has been a tireless advocate for campaign finance reform, but
now trails an opponent who has pumped $3 million of his own money
into the congressional race. Jim Humphreys, a Charleston lawyer who
became rich winning class-action asbestos lawsuits, insists he
needs to spend millions to overcome Hechler's formidable name
recognition.
</P>
<P>
   The tactic appears to be working as two recent polls show
Humphreys with 40 percent of the vote. Hechler and a third
opponent, state Sen. Martha Walker, each tallied about 20 percent.
A fourth candidate -- Harrison County Commissioner Beth Taylor -- is
in single digits.
</P>
<P>
   Hechler has been a part of the Mountain State's political scene
so long that it's easy to forget that he was born in Long Island,
N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   A former Columbia University professor, research assistant to
President Harry Truman and author, Hechler came to West Virginia in
1957 on a whim, to take an interim political science teaching job
at Marshall College, now Marshall University.
</P>
<P>
   He never left, although he did spend 18 years, from 1959 through
1977, in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Hechler brought a liberal ideology, charming personality and
theatrical flair to the state. Little has changed.
</P>
<P>
   In 2000, he still runs short television spots and sings corny
songs composed by a banjo-picking cohort.
</P>
<P>
   His age is not an issue in a state with the nation's oldest
median age, 38.9. Its governor, Cecil Underwood, is 77, and one of
its senators, Robert Byrd, is 82.
</P>
<P>
   Hechler says his years have made him wiser and he challenges
anyone who doubts his energy level to a tennis match.
</P>
<P>
   Although hunting is popular in West Virginia, those entering the
Secretary of State's office are greeted by a stuffed black bear and
the message: ''We reserve the right to arm bears.''
</P>
<P>
   When it wasn't fashionable, Hechler challenged union leaders,
fought strip mining and battled big business. He consistently sides
with environmentalists in a state that serves as a regulatory
battleground over water, air and mining rights issues.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sometimes I just raise a little hell because somebody's got to
do it,'' he says.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Begins Airlift in Sierra Leone  </HEADLINE>
By WILLIAM C. MANN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States warned Americans against
traveling to Sierra Leone, ordered nonessential personnel out of
the embassy in the capital of Freetown and began a helicopter
airlift Sunday for Americans who want to leave the West African
country.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department said the international airport in Freetown
''is subject to suspension of operations without warning.''
</P>
<P>
   About 170 American civilians, many working with international
charities, and 10 embassy staff live in Sierra Leone, a U.S.
official said. Sunday's first two helicopter flights carried 25
people to the U.S. Embassy in Conakry, capital of neighboring
Guinea.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Department of State warns U.S. citizens against travel to
Sierra Leone and strongly urges U.S. citizens in-country to
depart,'' the travel warning said.
</P>
<P>
   Sierra Leone has been under various levels of travel warnings
for at least five years. Sunday's statement replaced one issued
last September, updating the security situation and announcing that
embassy staff were being withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear how many official Americans will be left after
the withdrawal of nonemergency people. The U.S. official, speaking
on condition of anonymity, said Ambassador Joe Melrose will stay
with an undetermined number of aides.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. forces were reported mobilizing Saturday in Freetown to
counter advancing fighters of the rebel Revolutionary United Front,
who the United Nations said mounted an offensive early Sunday from
Lunsar, 50 miles northeast of the capital. Fighting between the two
sides was reported in the Sierra Leone interior.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels agreed to a U.N.-mediated peace agreement in July.
The new fighting violates the peace deal, which brought the rebels
into the government and ended an eight-year civil war. RUF leader
Foday Sankoh has insisted that no attack was under way, U.N.
spokesman Philip Winslow said.
</P>
<P>
   At least 300 U.N. peacekeepers were taken hostage by rebels last
week.

<HEADLINE> Cuban Hoop Player Vanishes in Minn.  </HEADLINE>
By BRIAN BAKST, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- Members of a Cuban college basketball
team downplayed the possible defection of a teammate Sunday by
going forward with a sightseeing tour of the Twin Cities.
</P>
<P>
   ''We came to the states to have a sports exchange and academics
exchange, not to have a migration exchange,'' team captain Osmar
Ernesto Fernandez said through an interpreter.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the University of Havana team nor the host campus, the
University of St. Thomas, had heard from Mario Miguel Chaoui since
he left the airport shortly after arriving from Cuba on Saturday.
Outside the airport, Chaoui got into a car that sped off.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Hennes, a St. Thomas spokesman, has been in contact with
the Immigration and Naturalization Service, but he said the agency
has limited authority.
</P>
<P>
   ''They can't do much other than wait for phone calls,'' Hennes
said. ''Legally, the guy is in the United States on a 30-day visa,
so he is not breaking any laws. He is away without leave from the
team.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Equipo Caribe,'' or Team Caribbean, is made up mostly of
students from the university and some students from a technical
institute in Havana.
</P>
<P>
   As he toured the state Capitol on Sunday, Fernandez struggled to
explain why his teammate would leave.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't know why he has made this decision,'' said Fernandez,
26, who has known Chaoui since boyhood. ''In Cuba, we have
everything we need.''
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez said the team is trying to downplay the situation as
it looks ahead to a Tuesday game against St. Thomas, but he
acknowledged that many players were angry when they heard the news.
</P>

<HEADLINE> New Jersey tops Giuliani's list for out-of-state donors  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HACKENSACK, N.J. (AP) -- Almost half the $32 million in
contributions that have been showered on the candidates in New
York's Senate campaign comes from outside the state, with northern
New Jersey topping the list for Rudolph Giuliani and Los Angeles
County the primary funding source for Hillary Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Through the end of last year, the New York City mayor netted
more than $650,000 from more than 600 contributors in New Jersey,
his primary source of out-of-state funding.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles County is the No. 1 source of out-of-state cash for
Clinton's war chest, with checks from the likes of Candice Bergen,
Michael Douglas, Nicole Kidman and Paul Newman.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton raised just over $202,000 from 211 New Jersey donors.
</P>
<P>
   ''There has never been a Senate race like this before,'' said
Larry Makinson, executive director of the Center for Responsive
Politics, a Washington-based watchdog group.
</P>
<P>
   Makinson told The Record of Hackensack for Sunday's editions
that Giuliani has begun one of the most sophisticated direct-mail
campaigns in history, seeking money from Republicans around the
country.
</P>
<P>
   ''Almost all this out-of-state money is coming in not because of
Rudolph Giuliani, but because people either love or hate
(Clinton),'' he said. ''And these are the kinds of people you can
incite to contribute through direct mail.''
</P>
<P>
   Bergen, Morris, Monmouth and Essex counties are among the most
lucrative for Giuliani: all four rank in the top 10 as sources for
out-of-state contributions. Florham Park and Short Hills both rank
in the mayor's top 10 zip codes.
</P>
<P>
   No New Jersey towns or counties rank in the top 10 for donations
to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say while anti-Clinton sentiment drives many of
Giuliani's out-of-state contributions, other factors should also be
taken into consideration for New Jersey donors.
</P>
<P>
   Voter polls in New York show Giuliani running strongest in the
suburbs. A Quinnipiac College poll released May 1 measured the race
in a dead heat, but showed the mayor ahead 52 percent to 38 percent
in the suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   Maurice Carroll, director of the polling institute at
Quinnipiac, said suburban residents in New York have much in common
with the New Jersey residents making out checks to the mayor's
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ''New Jersey is commuter territory,'' Carroll said. ''And for
commuters, he's been one hell of a mayor.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's campaign has also attracted donations from the kind
of white-collar business and financial workers that make up a large
part of New Jersey's population. More than $300,000 of his
donations come from people who list themselves as investors, and
$138,000 from physicians.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, in contrast, received $84,980 from writers and more
than $75,000 from actors.
</P>
<P>
   The 3-to-1 advantage Giuliani has over Clinton in New Jersey is
not reflected in the overall trend for the state. In 1999,
Democratic candidates received 55 percent of the $18.5 million in
contributions of $200 or more made by New Jersey residents.
</P>
<P>
   ''For visitors to New York, he's been an exceptionally good
mayor,'' Carroll said. ''If you come in from Bergenfield and want
to have dinner, you really notice that you don't have to worry
about your windows being broken anymore and that you don't have to
deal with squeegee men.''

<HEADLINE> Deposed Sudan Leader Remains Active  </HEADLINE>
By MOHAMED OSMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) -- Openly defying President Omar el-Bashir,
Sudan's deposed Islamic ideologue said Sunday that he will continue
his political activities -- despite being sacked from a high-ranking
political post in a power struggle with the president.
</P>
<P>
   More than 1,000 supporters of Hassan Turabi rallied outside his
house, chanting slogans against el-Bashir.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will stay loyal to Turabi's leadership,'' the demonstrators
shouted. ''It is for divine cause that we are out,'' others
screamed.
</P>
<P>
   El-Bashir fired Turabi Saturday as the secretary-general of the
ruling National Congress Party and banned him and his aides from
political activities at state and national levels.
</P>
<P>
   The developments have created an air of uncertainty and raised
fears of confrontation between Turabi's supporters and the armed
forces. However, no troops were seen outside Turabi's house or in
downtown Khartoum Sunday, an indication that el-Bashir did not fear
Turabi would be able to attract serious support.
</P>
<P>
   El-Bashir had been chipping away at Turabi's powers since last
year. In December el-Bashir imposed disbanded the parliament -- of
which Turabi was the speaker, accusing him of undermining the
president's office and inciting security forces.
</P>
<P>
   The crackdown on Turabi won support from almost all Arab
countries, who have been wary of his hard-line Islamic views and
his support for fundamentalist groups, some of whom are fighting to
overthrow their governments. El-Bashir also is believed to have the
army's support.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing his supporters outside his house, Turabi said his
firing was unconstitutional and that he would defy el-Bashir's
orders.
</P>
<P>
   ''What happened was in violation of religion and of the
constitution. Our activities will continue,'' Turabi said.
</P>
<P>
   Turabi was the chief political and religious ideologue of Sudan
and is believed to have masterminded the 1989 coup that brought
el-Bashir, an army lieutenant general, to power. For years,
el-Bashir was seen as a frontman for Turabi until he began
asserting his presidential authority.
</P>
<P>
   Ali Al-Hajj Mohammed, a close aide to Turabi, said similar
demonstrations were taking place all over Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   ''A president cannot freeze ideas and thoughts or stop us unless
he resorts to arms ... el-Bashir can rule by sheer force but not by
Koran,'' Al-Hajj said, referring to the Islamic holy book.

<HEADLINE> Suspect Said Had bin Laden Links  </HEADLINE>
By JAMAL HALABY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) -- A witness in the trial of 28 suspected
terrorists testified Sunday that one defendant offered him military
training under the Saudi dissident accused of two U.S. embassy
bombings that killed 224 people.
</P>
<P>
   Rami Mohammed Halaweh, 23, testified that defendant Khader Abu
Hosher ''told me that I can receive training with Osama bin
Laden.''
</P>
<P>
   Halaweh said Abu Hosher, 36, also sought to enlist him in
''attacks against infidels, Jews and Christians.'' He said Abu
Hosher's targets included Amman's five-star Radisson SAS Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   ''He told me it was owned by Jews, its customers are Jews and
that it would be good to strike at it,'' Halaweh said.
</P>
<P>
   After the two met in Jordan in 1998, Halaweh said, he went to
Pakistan with the intention of proceeding on to Afghanistan, where
bin Laden is believed to be hiding. But he came back to Jordan
after spending 10 days in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   Halaweh, testifying before the three-judge, no-jury State
Security Court, is the first prosecution witness in the trial that
opened April 20. Thirteen of the defendants remain at large and are
being tried in absentia.
</P>
<P>
   Jordanian officials say the accused, many of whom are Jordanians
of Palestinian descent, planned bomb attacks on U.S. and Israeli
tourists during New Year's celebrations. The targeted sites were
Mount Nebo, where tradition says Moses saw the Promised Land, and a
Christian settlement along the Jordan River said to be the site
where John baptized Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   The defendants have been charged with possession of explosives
and affiliation with ''an outlawed group'' involved in a
''conspiracy to carry out terrorist attacks'' in Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   The outlawed group they allegedly belong to has not been
identified in the formal indictment. But military prosecutor Lt.
Col. Mahmoud Obeidat has told reporters that the suspects were
linked to al-Qaida, or ''the base,'' a terrorist organization
allegedly headed by bin Laden. The Saudi dissident is on the United
States' list of most-wanted terrorists for the 1998 bombings of
U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
   Halaweh, the first witness, was taken into custody in January
but was freed when he agreed to become a state witness. While he
was giving his testimony Sunday, Abu Hosher shouted from the dock:
''Say the truth, Rami. Fear God.''
</P>
<P>
   Two other prosecution witnesses also took the stand Sunday to
implicate Abu Hosher and two other defendants -- Raed Bdeir, 27, and
Samer Jibara, 23. The hearing was later adjourned until Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Before the hearing began, defendant Issam Barqawi, 40, told
reporters that ''the accusations were exaggerated.''
</P>
<P>
   ''So what if (police) seized two machine-guns and two pistols
from young men who thought of fighting Jews,'' he said. ''Is that
terrorism?''

<HEADLINE> Charges of Fraud in Iran's Elections  </HEADLINE>
By ALI AKBAR DAREINI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) -- Hard-liners said Sunday they had found
evidence of vote fraud in Iran's February elections that were swept
by reformers, raising fears that they would annul victories of
candidates who support loosening the conservative clergy's rule.
</P>
<P>
   The suspected fraud was in the capital of Tehran, where
reformists won 29 of 30 seats in the 290-seat parliament. Tehran
was the top prize in a nationwide victory for reformers, who ousted
conservatives from control of the legislature for the first time
since the 1979 Islamic revolution brought the clergy to power.
</P>
<P>
   Upon the request of losing candidates, the Guardians Council, a
hard-line body that oversees elections, ordered a recount. In a
statement Sunday, the council said it had found unspecified
discrepancies of more than 10 percent. Some 88 percent of boxes had
so far been recounted, according to state-run radio, which quoted
the statement.
</P>
<P>
   ''As we continue to count more votes in Tehran, we see more
discrepancies in the votes,'' the council's statement said.
</P>
<P>
   The reformists won about 120 seats on Feb. 18 and between 47 and
52 more seats in run-off elections Friday. The hard-liners control
no more than 70 seats.
</P>
<P>
   The council statement said the recounting of votes in Tehran
revealed in one case that 1,022 votes for a candidate had not been
counted and another candidate had been given 977 extra votes.
</P>
<P>
   The council has already annulled 12 reformist victories outside
Tehran and given two of those seats to hard-liners.
</P>
<P>
   The Guardians Council is but one way the hard-liners have tried
to contain the reformist program of moderate President Mohammad
Khatami, who was popularly elected in 1997. The hard-liners, who
control the military, the state-media and the judiciary, banned 16
reformist newspapers last month and detained several prominent
reformist leaders and activists.
</P>
<P>
   The reformists fear that the hard-liners are now trying to
reduce their influence in the next Majlis, the Iranian parliament.
Because all the heavyweight reformists are from Tehran, a
parliament without them would be virtually toothless.
</P>
<P>
   But the Guardians Council said that despite the vote fraud in
Tehran, it does ''not want to draw any conclusions at this time.''
</P>
<P>
   ''What the hard-liners want is a weak, incapable Majlis,
especially after their disappointment in the runoffs,'' said Ahmad
Ziedabadi, a political columnist who used to write for a number of
reformist newspapers that were closed down.
</P>
<P>
   Hard-line dailies on Sunday ignored the reformers' victory in
Friday's runoff. But the seven moderate newspapers that survived
the hard-line crackdown splashed the news across their front pages.
</P>
<P>
   The moderate Bayan daily quoted several outgoing hard-line
members of parliament calling the reformist victories a
''disgrace.'' They also expressed fears that the new Majlis would
do away with key hard-line institutions, including the Guardians
Council and the Special Clerical Court, which has been responsible
for jailing reformist clerics.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm worried that the new Majlis will move against official
institutions of the Constitution. These are real threats on the eve
of the new Majlis,'' the paper quoted outgoing hard-line legislator
Morteza Nabavi as saying.

<HEADLINE> EU May Soften Austria Stance  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT WIELAARD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   FURNAS, Azores Islands (AP) -- Some European Union ministers
appeared Sunday to be softening their stance against Austria, which
has been ostracized within the EU for three months for forming a
government with the far right Freedom Party.
</P>
<P>
   Since February, Austria's partners have boycotted photo
sessions, walked out as Austrian delegates spoke or refused to
shake hands with them. But at a meeting of EU foreign ministers on
Portugal's mid-Atlantic Azores islands this weekend, all 15
ministers posed together for a picture -- including Austria's.
</P>
<P>
   Another indication of the changing mood came from Italian
Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini, who said he feared a backlash
against the EU in Austria because of the sanctions, which include
freezing most bilateral contacts and bans on sports and cultural
events.
</P>
<P>
   Austrian Foreign Minister Benita Ferrero-Waldner and others said
a growing number of nations now favored ending the anti-Austria
measures. She listed Ireland, Italy, Finland, Spain, Denmark and
Greece.
</P>
<P>
   While the bilateral sanctions imposed by the other 14 EU nations
on Feb. 6 are mild, Austria argues they poison the atmosphere in
the EU as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   France, Belgium, Luxembourg and Portugal have been the most
outspoken critics of Austrian Chancellor Wolfgang Schuessel's
decision to bring the Freedom Party into government.
</P>
<P>
   Ferrero-Waldner told her colleagues Austria has moved to
safeguard private and human rights, that the Freedom Party has
softened its extreme right-wing views and that Joerg Haider, who
has praised Nazi German policies, has stepped down as party leader.
She said Austria would welcome close monitoring of its human rights
situation.
</P>
<P>
   But Belgian Foreign Minister Louis Michel insisted the Freedom
Party had ''become more combative than repentant'' since taking
office.
</P>
<P>
   Portuguese Foreign Minister Jaime Gama said no decision has been
made to end the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Ferrero-Waldner said an EU summit in Santa Maria de Feira,
Portugal, next month should bring a resolution.
</P>
<P>
   ''The longer the sanctions are in place, the more extensive the
damage to Austria,'' she said. Austrians support EU membership, but
''surveys indicate an increasing bitterness over the sanctions,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Schuessel's government has warned that if sanctions are not
ended by summer, Austria may stage a nonbinding referendum in the
fall giving Austrians a chance to express their opposition to the
measures.

<HEADLINE> All-Night Alps Race Tests the Tough  </HEADLINE>
By CLARE NULLIS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ZERMATT, Switzerland (AP) -- Yodels and cheers echoed through the
chilly night air this weekend as hundreds of competitors laden with
skis, ice picks and ropes set out in an arduous race across the
Alps' glaciers and peaks.
</P>
<P>
   Called Patrol of the Glaciers, the race originated in maneuvers
to defend neutral Switzerland against the Nazi threat during World
War II and has evolved into one of the world's most prestigious
mountain competitions.
</P>
<P>
   The race, which begins in darkness after midnight, stretches
from the resort of Zermatt to Verbier. It attracted 2,300
participants this year.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a celebration of the majesty of the Alps,'' Bernard
Mayor, commander of the Swiss army's 10th mountain division, told
competitors packed into Zermatt's main church just before they set
out early Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Each three-person team carried skis, radio receivers, avalanche
beepers, altimeters, ropes, ice picks, snow shovels, food and water
for a route that involves running, climbing and skiing. Hundreds of
locals climbed mountains or chartered helicopters in the middle of
the night to cheer on the patrols.
</P>
<P>
   As the crow flies, the start and finish lines are about 19 miles
apart. But on the ground, competitors covered 32 miles, trekking up
and down the landscape of glaciers, ravines and potentially
treacherous peaks. The course's highest point stands at 9,850 feet
above sea level on the Tete Blanche mountain.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were asked if we fancied having a go, and we said yes,''
said Billy Rodgers, a Scottish native with the Royal Marines. ''It
should be a good laugh,'' he declared just before setting out with
teammates Kian Murphy and Craig Haslam.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve hours and 35 minutes later, the trio sprinted in ski
boots across the finish line in Verbier -- a 25th place finish.
''Yes, it was a good laugh,'' panted a flushed but jubilant
Rodgers.
</P>
<P>
   A Swiss border guard patrol broke the course record, finishing
in 7 hours and three minutes for the victory.
</P>
<P>
   For the vast majority, finishing rather than winning was the
main goal in the race, held every two years. There was no prize
money, just medals, photographs and personal pride.
</P>
<P>
   The logistical challenge was huge: The race involves 42 tons of
equipment and 900 support staff, including guides and doctors
scattered throughout the mountains.
</P>
<P>
   The race was conceived during Switzerland's general wartime
mobilization by two captains in the mountain brigade charged with
defending the central Alps. To test soldiers' endurance, they
organized a contest for three-man patrols over the Zermatt to
Verbier route in 1943.
</P>
<P>
   A 1949 race met with tragedy when one of the teams fell into a
glacier crevasse. That incident sparked such a national uproar that
the government banned the competition for 35 years.
</P>
<P>
   When resurrected in 1984, the race was opened to nonmilitary
participants. Some two-thirds of the patrols this weekend were from
sporting clubs rather than the army.
</P>
<P>
   Especially notable was the increase in female competitors -- up
from a handful in 1984 to 300 this year.
</P>
<P>
   ''We won! we won!'' Cristina Favre screamed in delight as her
team defended its 1998 female title, finishing in 9 hours and 47
minutes. They won despite getting lost in the forest just before
Verbier while trying to take a short cut.
</P>
<P>
   Favre, who has a 2{-year-old child and is still nursing her
9-month infant, said she had an added motive to post a fast time.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had to get back to feed the baby,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Six Rescued at N.Y. River Lock  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   GLENVILLE, N.Y. (AP) -- Seventy-five firefighters using boats and
rappelling cords rescued six people stranded at the base of an open
river lock after their boats capsized in a powerful current.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Hafler, 46, of Rotterdam, and Julie Curran, whose age was
not released, were fishing on the Mohawk River about 3 p.m.
Saturday when their boat capsized after drifting too close to the
current flowing into the partially open lock.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Davis, fishing in a boat nearby with three pre-teen
children, steered over to help, but his boat was also caught by the
current and overturned.
</P>
<P>
   ''Basically the boats were sucked in,'' said Scotia firefighter
David Briggs. ''One was flipped over, one tipped on its side.''
</P>
<P>
   Carl Eldridge Jr. and Richard Roadenmaker were fishing nearby
and paddled their canoe over to help. Using an anchor rope, they
were able to help five of the six boaters onto a ledge of the lock
just above the waterline.
</P>
<P>
   Curran was trapped for at least 15 minutes in an air pocket
under the boat in water Briggs said was about 50 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   ''She was underwater for an undetermined amount of time and was
shaking and losing her body strength from hypothermia,'' said Don
Gerding, second assistant chief of the Beukendaal Fire Department.
</P>
<P>
   Briggs said that some of the boaters had crawled out and were
standing on the ledge of the lock, with frigid water spilling over
them like a waterfall. Briggs said that a couple of the boaters
were told to jump into the water, where they were pulled by ropes
onto boats.
</P>
<P>
   The rappellers trying to reach them were continuniously slammed
by the cold water as they scooped the boaters to safety, Briggs
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's one of those situations where it's probably the worst
case scenario for a water rescue -- in a dam or waterfall -- because
there's churning water,'' Briggs said. ''That's how a lot of people
drown.''
</P>
<P>
   All six boaters were treated at hospitals for minor injuries and
released Saturday night, a spokeswoman said Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Levi Strauss &AMP; Co. Reveals Finances  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Privately held Levi Strauss &AMP; Co. has filed
records with federal regulators showing the gravity of the jeans
maker's financial situation.
</P>
<P>
   Profits fell to $5.4 million in 1999, down from $102.5 million
in 1998. Revenue fell from $6 billion to $5.1 billion in the same
period.
</P>
<P>
   The 147-year-old company, which is not required to disclose
financial figures to the public, filed its report Thursday with the
federal Securities and Exchange Commission. It is the first time
since 1986 that the company has filed with the SEC.
</P>
<P>
   The filing was required so that Levi Strauss could register $800
million in bonds the company sold privately to investors several
years ago. After SEC approval, investors can sell the notes to the
public.
</P>
<P>
   ''It allows us the opportunity to raise more money in the
investment bond market later on,'' Levi's chief executive Philip
Marineau told the San Francisco Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   The company has no plans to offer its shares to the public, but
will begin filing quarterly reports including sales and income
figures.
</P>
<P>
   The family-owned company has struggled in recent years, faced
with competition from younger brands like Tommy Hilfiger. Levi's
has eliminated 18,500 jobs and closed 29 plants.
</P>
<P>
   ''Levi's has been losing market share for many years due to the
lack of innovation in its product cycle and over-distribution of
the product,'' said Todd Slater, an analyst at Lazard Freres &AMP; Co.
LLC. ''I don't think they will ever be able to regain their
leadership position in the premium categories.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first quarter of 2000, Levi Strauss reported income of
$65.2 million on sales of $1.1 billion, compared to a loss of $237
million on sales of $1.3 billion for the same quarter last year.
</P>
<P>
   Cash flow declined to $295 million in fiscal 1999, from $479
million in 1998 and as much as $861 million in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The company's long-term debt was $2.4 billion on Nov. 28, 1999.
Interest expense rose from $178 million in fiscal 1998 to $183
million in fiscal 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Although the figures may cause concern, Marineau emphasized the
company is making progress in rebuilding relationships with
retailers and consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't expect to turn sales around for some time, but we
have a strong fall sales line ... and our performance is
improving,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> 3 Investigated For French Bombing  </HEADLINE>
By PIERRE-ANTOINE SOUCHARD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- Three members of a Breton separatist group were
placed under formal investigation Sunday in connection with the
bombing of a McDonald's last month that killed an employee.
</P>
<P>
   Two of those placed under investigation are ranking members of
Emgann, meaning ''combat'' in the Breton language of coastal
northwestern France, according to judicial officials.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators describe Emgann as the legal front for the
clandestine Breton Revolutionary Army. However, in a statement
Sunday, Emgann denied any formal links to the group.
</P>
<P>
   The Breton Revolutionary Army, known by its French initials,
ARB, has denied responsibility for the April 19 bombing at the fast
food restaurant in Quevert, about 250 miles west of Paris, in the
Brittany region.
</P>
<P>
   A 27-year-old employee was killed in the blast.
</P>
<P>
   However, the ARB claimed responsibility for a smaller April 14
bombing of a McDonald's in the town of Pornic. No one was injured
in the Pornic explosion, initially thought to have been a prank.
</P>
<P>
   Small groups of Breton separatists have long sought autonomy for
Brittany, which has maintained a strong cultural identity
reflecting the Bretons' Celtic origins.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement Sunday, Emgann called for the ''immediate
release'' of those imprisoned, denounced violence and said it had
''no structural link, formal or informal, with ARB.'' The statement
condemned the attack on the Quevert McDonald's.
</P>
<P>
   Interior Minister Jean-Pierre Chevenement said last week that
Emgann and the ARB are ''nearly the same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   In Paris, Investigating Magistrate Gilbert Thiel placed three
suspects under investigation, which under French law is one step
short of placing charges.
</P>
<P>
   Christian Georgeault, 47, described as Emgann's secretary for
internal affairs, is suspected of participation in several attacks,
including the deadly McDonald's bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Emgann spokesman Gael Roblin, 27, is suspected of delivering an
ARB statement to the press claiming responsibility for the Pornic
attack and of having participated in past attacks.
</P>
<P>
   A 34-year-old electrician, Pascal Laize, is suspected as a
bombmaker for attacks in 1998 and 1999, the judicial sources said.
Police found bomb-making material, including electrical wiring, a
detonator and a timing device, in his car.
</P>
<P>
   About a dozen people have been detained for questioning over the
past week in connection with the two McDonald's bombings.

<HEADLINE> Pres Angry Over Austria's Nazi Role  </HEADLINE>
By MELISSA EDDY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- At Austria's most infamous Nazi
concentration camp, President Thomas Klestil expressed anger Sunday
at the role his country played in the horrors of the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   Klestil spoke at ceremonies marking the 55th anniversary of the
liberation of the Mauthausen camp by the Allies. Those ceremonies
culminated with the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra's performance of
Beethoven's Ninth Symphony -- criticized by some as out of place for
a death camp.
</P>
<P>
   But guest conductor Sir Simon Rattle hoped the performance --
complete with the climactic Ode to Joy -- would sound a message
through the world: Think of where we are playing and never forget.
</P>
<P>
   ''None of us consider this to be a concert,'' Rattle told
reporters Saturday. ''But in some way, a ritual that makes a
gesture to heal.''
</P>
<P>
   Austria's efforts to deal with its Nazi past have gained urgency
for many after the entry into government this year of the far-right
Freedom Party -- criticised for its anti-immigrant policies and its
leader's past comments praising aspects of the Nazi regime.
</P>
<P>
   At Mauthausen, Klestil, who has been a vocal critic of the
Freedom Party, spoke before about 7,000 visitors, many of them
former inmates. He expressed ''sorrow over the deaths'' at the camp
and ''anger and rage that Austrians as well participated'' in Nazi
crimes culminating in the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   Austrians fervently supported Adolf Hitler, their native son.
According to the Vienna-based Jewish Documentation Center,
Austrians were accountable in some way for the death of 3 million
Jews -- about half those killed in the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   Although more than 99 percent of Austrians purportedly voted for
their country's annexation by Germany in 1938, the country since
that war has depicted itself as a victim of Hitler's policies.
</P>
<P>
   Political leaders first began acknowledging that Austria was
also a perpetrator during the Nazi era in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ''We cannot look away when it comes to crimes committed here and
elsewhere, also by Austrians,'' Klestil said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics have also pointed out the Philharmonic's reluctance
to come to terms with its Nazi past. The orchestra has only
relatively recently acknowledged that 47 percent of its members
also belonged to the Nazi party. Five Jewish members perished in
the camps.
</P>
<P>
   The idea for the concert at the camp was born five years ago,
the brainchild of Leon Zelman, a 72-year-old Holocaust survivor who
now heads Vienna's Jewish Welcome Service. Zelman wanted to mark
the new millenium's first anniversary of the camp's liberation in a
special way that young people would remember.
</P>
<P>
   Some 200,000 people, -- not only Jews, but also political
prisoners from Russia, Poland, the Czech Republic, Spain and France
-- were interned at Mauthausen. Half of them were worked to death or
otherwise killed before it was liberated May 5, 1945.
</P>
<P>
   ''You shouldn't make a concert at a concentration camp,'' said
Harry Weber, whose mother perished at Mauthausen. ''Especially not
the Ode to Joy.''
</P>
<P>
   But the political climate made the musicians more determined
that Beethoven's musical call for goodwill be played.
</P>
<P>
   ''Maybe I'm naive, but when I hear Beethoven's words 'All men
will become brothers,' these are the words of the New Europe,''
said Zelman.
</P>
<P>
   Even the most basic elements of a normal concert, such as
applause, became an issue for the Mauthausen performance. The
orchestra ecided to let people clap after the piece, before a
moment of silence and lighting of candles in remembrance of the
dead.
</P>
<P>
   ''We do not want to disturb the dead. On the contrary, those
anonymous dead, who were not even ashes, will come alive again,''
said Zelman. ''And a message will go into the world: Never
Forget.''

<HEADLINE> Ex-St. Kitts and Nevis Premier Dies  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BASSETERRE, St. Kitts (AP) -- Former premier of St. Kitts and
Nevis, Sir Lee Llewellyn Moore, has died in a New York hospital
following a prolonged illness. He was 61.
</P>
<P>
   Moore died Saturday afternoon at Columbia Presbyterian Hospital
in New York, surrounded by relatives, Prime Minister Denzil Douglas
announced.
</P>
<P>
   Moore, who served as premier in 1979-1980, had been the
Caribbean island nation's ambassador to the United Nations since
1995.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sir Lee was a man who strongly believed in the integration of
the Caribbean ... in forging paths of development in anticipation
of the present global economy and challenges,'' Douglas said in a
televised radio and television address Saturday evening.
</P>
<P>
   The former premier had undergone surgery last year and returned
to the hospital several times before slipping into a coma on April
21, Douglas said.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas did not give specific information about Moore's illness,
but unconfirmed reports said he suffered from prostate cancer.

<HEADLINE> Tamil Tiger Supporters Arrested  </HEADLINE>
By K.N. ARUN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MADRAS, India (AP) -- Police arrested 200 people seeking to rally
support Sunday for Tamil Tiger rebels fighting a critical battle
with government forces in neighboring Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
   The arrests -- the first Indian government crackdown on rebel
backers -- came after a pair of pro-rebel groups organized a
conference in support of the rebels in Chidambaram, a town 125
miles south of southern Tamil Nadu state's capital, Madras, police
said.
</P>
<P>
   The conference was banned and nearly 1,000 policeman were
deployed in the town.
</P>
<P>
   The Tamil rebels have been fighting for a separate homeland in
the north and east of Sri Lanka since 1983, accusing the majority
Sinhalese community of widespread discrimination in education and
jobs. The Sinhalese control the government and military.
</P>
<P>
   Rebels last month mounted a major offensive against government
forces in an attempt to retake their former base in Jaffna, on Sri
Lanka's northern tip, sending a stream of Tamil refugees across the
25-mile channel dividing the island from India.
</P>
<P>
   Sri Lanka's 3.2 million Tamils are linked by language, culture
and family ties to the 55 million people of Tamil Nadu. Tamil
guerrillas from Sri Lanka received training in the southern
province and other parts of India in the early 1980s and still
reportedly maintain contacts in the area.
</P>
<P>
   India has outlawed the rebel Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam,
who inflicted heavy losses on Indian troops sent to Sri Lanka to
observe an aborted peace agreement between the sides in the late
1980s.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels assassinated former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi in
retaliation for sending the Indian force to Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee has ruled out military
intervention in the battle for Jaffna, but said India could provide
medicine or food if requested by the Sri Lankan government.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, armored vehicles moved at least 50 air force
personnel to Rameswaram, at the southernmost tip of India, and
surveillance infrastructure was beefed up in the area to monitor
the activities of Tamil rebels across the sea, UNI quoted local
officials saying.

<HEADLINE> German Co's. Pushed On Compensation  </HEADLINE>
By TONY CZUCZKA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- A fund to compensate Nazi-era slave and forced
laborers may publicize the names of reluctant German companies to
pressure them to contribute, the fund's spokesman said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   German industry and the government agreed last December that
each would contribute half the planned $4.6 billion for the fund,
but industry has so far come up with only $1.3 billion -- little
more than half its share.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will intensify efforts in the coming weeks and approach
firms in various ways,'' said Wolfgang Gibowski, spokesman for the
fund. ''I would not rule out naming names publicly.''
</P>
<P>
   He rejected a newspaper report Sunday suggesting the effort
might collapse.
</P>
<P>
   Jewish leaders, meanwhile, suggested that an international
campaign exposing the holdouts would help bring pledges to the
fund, which was launched by major German corporations but has been
slow to attract donations from other firms.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can't have companies ... that profited wash their hands of
it and think they can get away,'' said Michel Friedman, vice
president of the Central Council of Jews in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   German officials are hoping industry will pledge its full share
by the time President Clinton visits Germany on June 2-3 so he and
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder can announce the breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
   That would presumably allow payments to start this year to the
often old and sick victims who were forced to work in Nazi
factories producing war materiel and other goods.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have probably reached the point where we have to say which
rich companies were implicated that could now make more of an
effort,'' Karl Brozik, head of the German office of the Jewish
Claims Conference, told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Otto Lambsdorff, Germany's chief negotiator in talks with the
United States, Israel and East European countries, said he was
confident German companies will pay up.
</P>
<P>
   ''German industry ... will fulfill its pledge, period,''
Lambsdorff said in an interview published Sunday in the weekly Der
Spiegel. ''German industry will not allow itself such an
embarrassment.''
</P>
<P>
   Germany's parliament could approve the law officially setting up
the fund by July 14 ''if everything goes smoothly,'' Lambsdorff
said.

<HEADLINE> Russia Bombs Chechnya, Several Die  </HEADLINE>
By YURI BAGROV, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAZRAN, Russia (AP) -- Russian airstrikes intended to drive
rebels from their southern strongholds killed a woman and a child
and wounded several other civilians Sunday, an official said.
</P>
<P>
   Planes and helicopters were bombing areas along the border with
Georgia and the Russian republic of Dagestan, where rebels have
taken refuge. The woman and child in the town of Verkhneye Vedeno
were killed by falling bombs, said the official on condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The West has accused Russia of using unnecessary force in
Chechnya and causing needless civilian casualties. Russia denies
the claims, saying it is taking necessary steps to eradicate
terrorists who made Chechnya a no-go zone after Russian troops were
driven out at the end of a 1994-96 war.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov again called for
talks with Moscow to end the conflict, saying fighting had
stalemated.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm ready for talks without any preliminary conditions,''
Maskhadov said in a videotaped message seen by an APTN cameraman,
said to have been recorded May 5. ''I think that the current crisis
can be solved and the war can be stopped only on the basis of
talks.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia sent ground troops into Chechnya following weeks of
airstrikes, after Chechnya-based Islamic militants invaded Dagestan
in August.
</P>
<P>
   Russian forces quickly took control of the northern two-thirds
of Chechnya, but fighting has since bogged down in the southern
mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow has indicated in recent weeks it is looking for a
political solution, but has said repeatedly it will not negotiate
with rebels unless they give up their weapons and turn over any
hostages. In addition, Maskhadov is not believed to have enough
authority over the fractured rebel command to enforce a cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
   Su-24 and Su-25 attack jets and Mi-24 helicopter gunships flew
numerous missions over Chechnya Sunday, military headquarters said,
and Russian troops were on high alert against attacks during
President Vladimir Putin's inauguration in Moscow. No major
incidents of fighting were reported.
</P>
<P>
   The military command said rebels were also planning action to
mar celebrations Tuesday of the 55th anniversary of the Soviet
army's victory over Nazi Germany.
</P>
<P>
   It said Russian forces uncovered a large rebel weapons cache in
the village of Dargo, containing hundreds of grenades, 270 mines
and 61,000 rounds of rifle ammunition.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Tries To Contain Chemical Leak  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- The Egyptian navy and coast guard stepped up
efforts Sunday to contain a leak of an acidic chemical from a
Syrian cargo ship that sank in the Mediterranean, security
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Dalya-S capsized Saturday after its cargo of liquid nitrate
started leaking and damaged part of its hull, the officials said on
condition they not be identified.
</P>
<P>
   Another cargo ship sailing nearby rescued the crew of ten
Syrians and one Palestinian before the ship went down off the coast
of Alexandria, 125 miles northwest of Cairo.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said navy personnel and army helicopters were
trying to determine the size of the damage caused by the leak and
to contain it. Environment Minister Nadia Makram Ebeid is
supervising the efforts, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Ebeid was quoted by Egypt's Middle East News Agency as saying
that the initial tests didn't show any unnatural changes in the
water due to the small amount of the liquid chemical that had
leaked so far. Nitrate is a dangerous acid that requires extra
precautions while handling it.
</P>
<P>
   All ships have been told to avoid sailing in the area, which
falls in the main navigation route between northern and eastern
Mediterranean ports.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors were questioning officials in nearby ports and Port
Authority officials were checking the ship's records to determine
who should file an environmental damage report.

<HEADLINE> Researcher links new chromosome to schizophrenia  </HEADLINE>
By LINDA A. JOHNSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- Scientists trying to fathom the mystery of
schizophrenia say they have found the strongest evidence to date
that the disabling psychiatric disorder is caused by gene
abnormalities, according to a researcher at two state universities.
</P>
<P>
   A team led by Dr. Linda Brzustowicz, an assistant professor of
neuroscience at Rutgers University's Center for Molecular and
Behavioral Neuroscience in Newark, studied the DNA of dozens of
members of 22 families in which multiple generations suffered from
schizophrenia.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers recently published evidence that they found
abnormalities contributing to development of schizophrenia in a
region of Chromosome 1, one of the 23 chromosomes pairs that
contain a person's entire genetic code. Based on a statistical
analysis, their evidence linking that region to development of
schizophrenia was about 100 times stronger than any prior research,
Brzustowicz said last week.
</P>
<P>
   The team also found statistically weaker data implicating a
region of Chromosome 13 in the same families.
</P>
<P>
   ''Right now we are focusing on trying to identify the specific
gene on Chromosome 1 that's involved in this,'' said Brzustowicz,
who also is an assistant professor of psychiatry at University of
Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey in Newark.
</P>
<P>
   The search is similar to trying to find a specific address upon
locating the right neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ''When we find it, we'll be able to say ... how does a defect in
that gene end up causing schizophrenia,'' Brzustowicz said. ''That
might give us insights into better ways of making drugs that treat
schizophrenia.''
</P>
<P>
   But Brzustowicz and other experts emphasized that it will be at
least a decade before new, safer schizophrenia drugs result. That's
partly because developing new drugs typically takes a decade, but
also because scientists have much to learn about the genetic and
environmental factors believed to contribute to schizophrenia.
</P>
<P>
   The disorder afflicts 2 million to 3 million Americans. It's
characterized by disturbed behavior, illogical thinking and speech,
depression and withdrawal from social interaction, and eventually,
delusional fixations and hallucinations. It usually surfaces
between the ages of 15 and 25.
</P>
<P>
   About 50 percent to 70 percent of schizophrenics hear
''voices,'' and antipsychotic drugs don't silence the voices for
about 20 percent. Those drugs also cause side effects from
sluggishness, blurry vision and facial twitches to liver and kidney
damage.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many genetic disorders such as cystic fibrosis and
Tay-Sachs disease where anyone inheriting a flawed gene develops
the disease, scientists believe schizophrenia is caused by the
interaction of possibly dozens of abnormal genes, said Dr. Kenneth
Kendler, professor of psychiatry and human genetics at Virginia
Commonwealth University and a member of the scientific advisory
board of the National Alliance for Research on Schizophrenia and
Depression.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, researchers suspect schizophrenia might not occur
without one of the ''environmental'' triggers under study. Those
include exposure to viral infections, malnutrition or other stress
during pregnancy, and birth trauma such as the baby getting too
little oxygen during delivery.
</P>
<P>
   Dwight C. German, a professor of psychiatry at University of
Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, said the study by
Brzustowicz and colleagues, published in the April 28 issue of
Science magazine, ''really may well be a landmark paper.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It may well be the way they've designed their experiment ...
allowed them to get a stronger finding'' than prior studies, German
said.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at the University of Toronto and the University of
British Columbia tracked down 288 members of 22 Canadian families,
all of whom were of Celtic or German descent, taking blood samples
from those with and without the disorder. Nearly half the families
had schizophrenics in three or more generations; past studies
generally have focused on identical twins or at least a single
generation.
</P>
<P>
   Brzustowicz and other collaborators in New Jersey analyzed each
person's DNA, segment by segment on each chromosome.
</P>
<P>
   ''We tried to match the pattern of inheritance of the pieces of
chromosome with the pattern of inheritance of the disease,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Using computer analysis, they determined that there was only a
1-in-5,000 chance that the region where they found genetic
variations does not contribute to schizophrenia.
</P>
<P>
   Prior schizophrenia research has produced statistically weaker
evidence implicating regions of other chromosomes. But because the
studies often use different designs or ethnic groups, new studies
often contradict the results of earlier ones, Kendler said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everybody wants to know which one is right,'' he said, adding
that the Brzustowicz study ''is about the largest statistical
evidence'' to date.

<HEADLINE> Newspaper: Edwards Juror Had Doubts  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) -- The juror dismissed from former Gov.
Edwin Edwards' federal racketeering trial asked to be released and
felt that other jurors were intimidating him because he had doubts
about the case, The Advocate of Baton Rouge reported.
</P>
<P>
   The doubts were described in a note that Juror No. 68 sent to
U.S. District Judge Frank Polozola on April 27. Polozola placed the
note under seal, but The Advocate said it obtained a copy.
</P>
<P>
   Polozola dismissed the juror Thursday, saying he refused to
follow instructions. Defense attorneys were furious with the ruling
and immediately asked for a mistrial, a motion that was denied.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining 11 jurors will begin their third week of
deliberations Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The note expressed concerns about the juror's role in the case,
The Advocate reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ''As much as I do not want to request it, I would request to be
dismissed,'' the note said. ''Do I have to explain the doubts in my
mind? I am being very intimidated because of how I may feel.''
</P>
<P>
   After No. 68 had been dismissed, Polozola warned the remaining
11 not to intimidate or pressure anyone about their decisions.
</P>
<P>
   The juror described himself during jury selection as a
40-year-old white male who said he believed Edwards was somewhat to
blame for corruption in the state's riverboat casino industry.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards, his son, Stephen, state Sen. Greg Tarver and four
others are accused in a series of extortion schemes to manipulate
the licensing of Louisiana riverboat casinos from 1991 through
1997. If convicted on all counts, Edwards, 72, could get more than
300 years in prison.

<HEADLINE> Indians 10, Blue Jays 8  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- Travis Fryman hit an RBI single in the 12th
inning as the Cleveland Indians overcame a six-run deficit to beat
the Toronto Blue Jays 10-8 on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians, who trailed 6-0, tied the game with two runs in the
ninth inning before winning it in the 12th. Eric Gunderson (0-1)
walked Jim Thome to open the inning and Richie Sexson followed with
a single.
</P>
<P>
   Fryman broke the tie with a single to right center and Einar
Diaz added an RBI groundout to make it 10-8.
</P>
<P>
   David Justice went 3-for-5 with five RBIs, including an RBI
double off Billy Koch in the ninth inning that helped Cleveland tie
it.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians, who are near the bottom of the AL in nearly every
major offensive category, have scored 28 runs in the last three
games.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Shuey (2-1) pitched 2 1-3 innings for the win. Steve Karsay
pitched the 12th for his sixth save.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Cruz Jr. hit his 13th homer and Raul Mondesi hit his
seventh for Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   Cruz, who hit 14 homers last season shuttling back and forth
from the minors, tied Oakland's Jason Giambi for the major league
lead.
</P>
<P>
   Cruz made a spectacular catch in the eighth inning to stifle a
Cleveland rally. Down 8-6, the Indians had a runner at second when
Fryman hit a ball into the gap in right center that looked like it
would drop for a double. But Cruz made a sprawling catch to end the
inning.
</P>
<P>
   Koch blew his second save of the season in the ninth by allowing
RBI doubles to Justice and Manny Ramirez.
</P>
<P>
   Down 6-0 after Mondesi's second-inning homer, the Indians closed
to 8-6 in the seventh on Justice's three-run homer off reliever
Pedro Borbon.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto starter Frank Castillo pitched three perfect innings
before Cleveland cut the Blue Jays lead to 6-3 in the fourth on
Justice's RBI double, and Sexson's two-run single.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Jays jumped out to a 3-0 lead in the first on Carlos
Delgado's RBI single, Brad Fullmer's run-scoring single and Marty
Cordova's RBI single.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland starter Bobby Witt gave up six runs and eight hits in
1 2-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Delgado's RBI double, and Fullmer's run-scoring single made it
8-6 in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Castillo allowed five runs and five hits in 6 2-3 innings. He
struck out six and walked four.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Justice tied his career high in RBIs. ... The Blue Jays
have hit 46 homers in 18 games at SkyDome this season. ... C Sandy
Alomar, on the 15-day DL with a strained right hamstring, will
rejoin the Indians on Monday. Alomar caught nine innings Saturday
in a rehab start in Winter Haven. ... Toronto's Roy Halladay, who
is 2-4 with a 11.53 ERA, has been taken out of the starting
rotation. Manager Jim Fregosi hopes Halladay will work out his
problems in the bullpen. LHP Lance Painter will start in his place
Wednesday. Painter made four starts with St. Louis last season.

<HEADLINE> Loudon Wins MBNA Foxhall Cup  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Tiffani Loudon rode penalty-free over the show
jumping course Sunday to win the inaugural MBNA Foxhall Cup, a U.S.
Equestrian Team selection trial for the 2000 Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ''It really hasn't hit me that I won an Olympic trial,'' said
Loudon of Blythewood, S.C., who won $55,000 of the $205,000 purse.
''It's very exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   Loudon, 24, and her mount, Makabi, jumped cleanly and quickly to
finish their first day score of 42.6 penalties which they carried
in from the opening dressage phase and maintained with a clean
cross country ride on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   That allowed her to hold the edge over second-place finisher
Phillip Dutton of Australia, a 1996 Olympic team gold medalist, who
finished with 49.4 penalties on House Doctor and won $30,000.
</P>
<P>
   Finishing third was 1999 Pan American Games team gold medalist
Abigail Lufkin of Middleburg, Va., who scored 55.4 penalties on
Hannigan and won $20,000.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to serving as an Olympic qualifier, the three-day
MBNA Foxhall Cup was also the American Horse Shows Association
National Eventing Championship and the U.S. Equestrian Team Spring
Three-Star Championship.

<HEADLINE> Brazilian Truckers End Strike  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- Striking truck drivers returned to
work this weekend, ending a six-day stoppage that halted food and
gasoline deliveries in some states and export revenue losses of
several million dollars.
</P>
<P>
   But union leader Nelio Botelho on Sunday warned another strike
would be called if the government fails to implement a series of
measures promised earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   The government said truckers would not have to pay tolls through
May 11 and that it would create a ''toll voucher'' to be paid by
shippers. Truckers would also not be penalized for carrying excess
cargo.
</P>
<P>
   Botelho, the president of the Brazilian Truckers Union, which
organized the strike, said by phone that a decision whether or not
to strike again would be made in 60 days.
</P>
<P>
   The truckers went on strike on May 1, demanding a toll limit of
1 real (56 cents) per axle, a retirement plan, tax breaks on new
trucks, a freight shipping rate scale and a revision of the point
system for traffic fines.
</P>
<P>
   He said leaders decided to end the strike on Saturday after
numerous truckers in some southern and southeastern states reported
they were beaten by police. Transportation Minister, Eliseu Padilha
denied that police had used violence against the strikers.
</P>
<P>
   Television footage earlier this week showed trucks with flat
tires and windshields shattered by rocks and bullets, as strikers
pressured colleagues to stop work.
</P>
<P>
   The government estimated that only 10 percent to 15 percent of
the nation's 1.5 million truckers joined the strike that began May
1, but Botelho said the number of strikers was closer to 750,000,
or 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   News reports said the strike caused a 60 percent drop in
activity in the port of Santos, Latin America's largest and that it
had cost soy exporters an estimated $60 million a day.

<HEADLINE> Fusaichi Pegasus Takes Flight  </HEADLINE>
By ED SCHUYLER JR., AP Racing Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- After being bothered by flies on his walk
to the paddock, Fusaichi Pegasus took flight in the Kentucky Derby,
the first step of what some trainers think will be a Triple Crown
journey.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's a Triple Crown horse right there,'' said Jenine Sahadi,
trainer of The Deputy, 14th as the second favorite in a field of 19
at Churchill Downs.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you ask me, he's a Triple Crown winner,'' said Alex
Hassinger, trainer of Anees, the 1999 2-year-old champion who
finished 13th.
</P>
<P>
   Trainer Neil Drysdale, however, refused on Sunday to commit
Fusaichi Pegasus to the Preakness.
</P>
<P>
   Told that Drysdale was undecided about the May 20 race, trainer
D. Wayne Lukas, whose three starters were not among the first 10
finishers, said: ''Count Neil in.''
</P>
<P>
   Fusaichi Pegasus can get feisty but was a cool professional in
becoming the first favorite to win the Derby since Spectacular Bid
in 1979. He did kick up his heels in front of the stands on his way
to be saddled.
</P>
<P>
   ''He got a little hot going over,'' Drysdale said. ''Some flies
got on him and he got irritated with the flies. I threw a fly sheet
over him and it annoyed him, so I took it off.''
</P>
<P>
   The colt finished 1{ lengths ahead of Aptitude. The time of 2:01
for 1\ miles tied the sixth fastest in 126 Derbys.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was very rewarding,'' Drysdale said.
</P>
<P>
   The colt was hand ridden by Kent Desormeaux through the stretch.
Drysdale was asked if the margin of victory could have been
greater.
</P>
<P>
   ''The winning margin is not as important as people make it out
to be,'' he said. ''The idea is to win the race.''
</P>
<P>
   That's something Fusaichi Pegasus has done in five starts since
he finished second in his only start as a 2-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   ''When he's good, he's good,'' Lukas said. ''I'm hoping he's not
good every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Fusao Skeiguchi of Japan, who bought Fusaichi Pegasus as a
yearling for $4 million, said he would like to aim for the Triple
Crown.
</P>
<P>
   ''But this will depend on how Mr. Drysdale thinks about it,'' he
said. ''I will leave the decision up to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Drysdale said he probably won't make a decision until after the
colt has two workouts at Churchill Downs. The second workout will
be next week.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have to see how it comes out of this race before we go on to
the next one,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Drysdale also was undecided about the next race for War Chant,
ninth in the Derby.
</P>
<P>
   Should Fusaichi Pegasus go to Baltimore and win the Preakness,
he would be the fourth straight Derby winner to have a shot at
becoming the 12th Triple Crown champion.
</P>
<P>
   Silver Charm (1997) and Real Quiet (1998) finished second in the
Belmont Stakes and Charismatic finished third last year. The Triple
Crown winner was Affirmed in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   Lukas, at a loss to explain the 15th-place finish of High Yield,
said the Blue Grass winner will run in the Preakness. His other two
Derby starters, Exchange Rate (11th) and Commendable (17th), will
not.
</P>
<P>
   ''I haven't made up my mind yet,'' said Harold Rose, the
88-year-old owner-trainer of Florida Derby winner Hal's Hope, who
finished 16th after leading for the first three-quarters of a mile.
He said the colt stumbled leaving the gate and sustained some cuts
on his left foreleg.
</P>
<P>
   Hassinger said he did not know what is next for Anees, but
Sahadi said The Deputy will go back to California and return to
racing on the grass, a surface he raced on in his five starts in
England last year and for his U.S. debut Jan. 2.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's not to say he won't run on dirt again,'' said Sahadi,
who was trying to become the first female trainer to win a Kentucky
Derby.
</P>
<P>
   ''Obviously, I'm disappointed, but I'm grateful the horse is
fine. Chris (McCarron, the jockey) said he never was comfortable,
that he never was really into it.''
</P>
<P>
   Trainer Bobby Frankel said the stretch-running Aptitude will
skip the 1 3-16 Preakness and aim for the 1{-mile Belmont Stakes.
</P>
<P>
   Impeachment, More Than Ready and Wheelaway, third through fifth,
respectively, in the Derby, are possible Preakness starters.
</P>
<P>
   Three colts, who did not run in Derby, but are being considered
for the Preakness are Red Bullet, second to Fusaichi Pegasus in the
Wood Memorial; Snuck In, runner-up in the Arkansas Derby; and
Performing Magic, the Derby Trial winner.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Lukas was elected to National Racing Hall of Fame
during Derby week, then won the race with Charismatic. On Tuesday,
Drysdale was elected to the hall, as was A.P. Indy, the colt he had
to scratch the morning of the 1992 Derby because of a foot problem.
A.P. Indy went on to become Horse of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   In beating Aptitude, Fusaichi Pegasus, a son of the great sire
Mr. Prospector, defeated a son of A.P. Indy.

<HEADLINE> NY Rallies For Condemned Murderer  </HEADLINE>
By CHRIS OLERT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Six thousand people crammed a theater to show
support for condemned murderer and radio journalist Mumia Abu-Jamal
on Sunday afternoon, while off-duty police officers held a counter
rally for the Philadelphia officer Jamal was convicted of killing.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mumia is all of us. Mumia is the defining figure in the
racist, criminal justice system,'' said Monica Moorehead, an
organizer told supporters in the cool of the Theater at the Garden.
</P>
<P>
   Tickets at $15 each sold out three days before the rally,
according to Moorehead.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile outside Madison Square Garden, 150 off-duty New York
City police officers held a counter rally for Philadelphia police
officer Danny Faulkner, who Abu-Jamal was convicted of killing 19
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens wore blue-and-white T-shirts reading, ''Officer Danny
Faulkner was murdered by Mumia Abu-Jamal.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We're just trying to counter the anti-police sentiment -- not
just in New York City -- but throughout the country,'' said Police
Officer Joseph A. Alejandro, treasurer of the New York City
Patrolmen's Benevolent Association.
</P>
<P>
   Abu-Jamal was convicted of Faulkner's slaying in 1981. The
officer was shot after stopping Abu-Jamal's brother for driving the
wrong way down a Philadelphia street. Abu-Jamal was arrested at the
scene.
</P>
<P>
   The former Black Panther leader's execution was stayed last
October, sparking another round of appeals. He is jailed in
Pennsylvania.

<HEADLINE> Thai Prime Minister Asks For Probe  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai has
instructed the Foreign Ministry to investigate the case of a
two-year-old Thai boy who was apparently used as a decoy in a
scheme to smuggle people into the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The boy and a man and woman pretending to be his parents flew
into Los Angeles on April 11. Inspectors determined that the
adults' Singaporean passports were phony.
</P>
<P>
   The Singaporean man and Chinese woman were deported to Thailand
but the boy, Khaisri, is being temporarily held in the United
States. He was flown into United States under a false name.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have instructed the Foreign Ministry to get me the truth
about this matter, how the boy was smuggled out, whether this is an
isolated case and are there similar cases in the past,'' Chuan was
quoted saying by the newspaper The Nation on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. authorities believe the boy was used as a prop to give the
impression the people with whom he was traveling were a family on
vacation.
</P>
<P>
   Suspicion that his natural mother was in on the scheme has
delayed his return to Thailand while the issue of custody is
debated. The mother has denied any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Thai authorities have already deported the man, identified as
Suseno Karjorpanoto of Indonesia, who was convicted on April 25 of
using a fake passport.
</P>
<P>
   The deported Chinese woman, identified as Sue Mei Long, 22, is
free on bail court and is expected to report to criminal court on
May 15, police said.
</P>
<P>
   A Malaysian man living in Bangkok who may have supplied the fake
passports was arrested Friday, Thai newspapers reported.
</P>
<P>
   Chang Chan Sing was in possession of several fake passports and
a large quantity of bootleg video CDs, the Bangkok Post newspaper
reported Sunday. It said he denied knowing the two who traveled
with the toddler to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Thai immigration police will investigate whether their fellow
officers were involved in the smuggling scheme, an investigator
said Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Report: Gates Wants Yacht Team  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Microsoft billionaire Bill Gates is part of a
''secretive'' American syndicate that has approached New Zealand's
championship America's Cup team to race for the United States, the
Observer reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The syndicate wants the New Zealanders to sail under the Stars
and Stripes for the next America's Cup in 2003.
</P>
<P>
   The Observer said 20 of the team's 30 members have been offered
a total of $200,000 with the promise of American citizenship if
they switch sides.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft spokesman Dan Leach told The Associated Press the
company does not comment ''on any employee's personal life.''
</P>
<P>
   The paper said the New Zealand team had been approached by Sean
Reeves, a lawyer and former team adviser, offering $60,000
signing-on fees and $150,000 annual salaries, guaranteed for six
years.
</P>
<P>
   The move is being made now so the crew could meet the 2-year
residency qualification for competing in 2003.
</P>
<P>
   The Observer did not cite anyone confirming the approach but
quoted New Zealand tactician Brad Butterworth as saying it would be
''devastating'' if any of his team agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would knock the heart of team New Zealand,'' Butterworth
said. ''But they would go because they had an offer they could not
refuse. They are being offered two or three times what they would
earn in New Zealand.''
</P>
<P>
   New Zealand's Black Magic retained the America's Cup on March 1,
sweeping Italy's Prada. It was the first time in the 150-year
history of the event no U.S. boat was in the finals.
</P>
<P>
   Recent America's Cups have featured big-money efforts. But New
Zealand has won the last two events largely on innovative boat
design and sailing teamwork rather than a generous bankroll.
</P>
<P>
   Team New Zealand leader Russell Coutts expects to lose a couple
of sailors to bigger syndicates from the United States and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   But he has said he will fight to keep his team together, and
find out if these offers come from genuine syndicates.
</P>
<P>
   ''None of these teams have entered the Cup yet, except for
Italy,'' Coutts told the New Zealand Herald. ''Are they real teams?
There's nothing to substantiate whether these offers that have been
presented to our guys are real.
</P>
<P>
   ''To be honest, there will be some changes, and it's Team New
Zealand's job to manage their way through them. But we do know that
no one in our team has gone yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Team New Zealand has little to offer its sailors but
reassurances, while the sign-over arrangements from the old power
structure to the new one are being negotiated.
</P>
<P>
   Coutts, the team's skipper in the last two America's Cups, is
now one of three sailors in top management roles. He said the
change would take place within the month, then Team New Zealand
could offer contracts to its sailors.
</P>
<P>
   Another new leader, Tom Schnackenberg, said it's natural to lose
crewmen to challenging teams.
</P>
<P>
   ''I suppose it's a no-brainer for a challenging syndicate to try
to get people from us,'' he said. ''We lost four people last time.
But I'm pretty sure the bulk of the team would rather work for Team
New Zealand,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't imagine working for another team, given the level of
support we've enjoyed. Even if I was in another industry, I would
want quite a lot of money to live in another country, compared with
living here in Auckland.''

<HEADLINE> Royals 12, White Sox 8  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Carlos Beltran's three-run double keyed
a five-run eighth inning as the Kansas City Royals beat the Chicago
White Sox 12-8 Sunday for a three-game sweep.
</P>
<P>
   Jermaine Dye hit his 13th home run as the Royals completed an
8-3 homestand.
</P>
<P>
   Johnny Damon's single marked the 10th straight game in which
he's led off with a hit for Kansas City. It's the longest such
streak since 1975 -- the Elias Sports Bureau was unable to research
the obscure stat before then.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Lee and Greg Norton hit RBI singles off Royals reliever
Ricky Bottalico (4-1) in the top of the eighth to tie it at 7.
</P>
<P>
   In the bottom half, Mike Sweeney singled off the top of the wall
and Rey Sanchez beat the relay throw home for the go-ahead run.
After Dye was intentionally walked to load the bases, Beltran
doubled.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly Wunsch (0-2) took the loss.
</P>
<P>
   The White Sox, playing under manager Jerry Manuel for the first
time since he served an eight-game suspension, dropped to 1-6 in
May after posting a team-record 17 wins in April.
</P>
<P>
   Magglio Ordonez homered, doubled and singled in his first game
back from a five-game suspension. Ordonez and Manuel were penalized
for a brawl-filled game between the White Sox and Detroit earlier
this season.
</P>
<P>
   Dave McCarty walked with the bases loaded to drive in the
go-ahead run and Jorge Fabregas' single was Kansas City's only hit
in a three-run fifth inning that gave the Royals a 7-4 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Royals took a 4-3 lead in the fourth on Sanchez's two-out,
RBI single. Chicago tied it in the fifth on Jose Valentin's RBI
double.
</P>
<P>
   Ordonez hit a solo home run in his first at-bat back from his
suspension. Rat Durham also homered for the White Sox.
</P>
<P>
Notes: New Royals owner David Glass was honored before the game by
commissioner Bud Selig. ... Damon extended his hitting streak to 14
games with his first-inning single. He leads the league in stolen
bases with 13 and has not been caught this season. ... The Royals
lead the league in stolen bases with 36 in 39 attempts. ... Royals
3B Joe Randa had a strong defensive game, making a diving stop down
the line in the fourth on Paul Konerko and a one-handed play on
Lee's slow roller in the fifth. ... The White Sox were 3-5 during
Manuel's suspension. ... The Royals, having finished their longest
homestand of the season, now depart on a 13-game road trip that is
their longest of the year. ... Dye has a major-league high 100
total bases and leads the AL in slugging percentage (.813) and the
major extra base hits (27).

<HEADLINE> Hardaway, Ewing Overcome Injuries  </HEADLINE>
By MARK LONG, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Tim Hardaway looked left, then right, checking over
both shoulders for any of the New York Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami Heat point guard could not believe he was all alone as
he drove toward the basket. Not with his bad knees, and certainly
not with his bad ankle.
</P>
<P>
   Hardaway, playing for the first time since April 16, had six
points and seven assists Sunday in the Heat's 87-83 victory over
New York. Like Hardaway, Knicks center Patrick Ewing overcame an
injury to play in Game 1 of the best-of-seven Eastern Conference
semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   They both proved to be invaluable to their teams.
</P>
<P>
   Ewing played 40 minutes despite having back spasms in practice
last week. He had 17 points and nine rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Hardaway set the tempo for the Heat, getting the ball up court
and to an open player.
</P>
<P>
   ''Tim, by far, is our floor general,'' center Alonzo Mourning
said. ''Athletically, he's not where he wants to be. Physically,
he's not where he wants to be. But mentally he's there. Based on
his experience alone, he's going to do things to help us.''
</P>
<P>
   After sitting out the Heat's first-round series against Detroit,
Hardaway started and played 30 minutes in Game 1 despite leaving
the court for seven minutes in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Hardaway turned his ankle while planting on Charlie Ward's
driving layup with about nine minutes to play in the quarter. He
limped back to the locker room, where he got the ankle re-taped.
</P>
<P>
   ''With one leg or one arm, I still want him on the floor,''
Mourning said. ''He's going to get the ball where it needs to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later, Hardaway was back, giving the Heat a boost with
his presence and his play.
</P>
<P>
   He had an assist on their first possession, putting Miami ahead
66-63. Down 72-71 in the fourth, he got a steal in the backcourt
and dribbled the length of the floor for an uncontested layup.
</P>
<P>
   ''I couldn't believe nobody caught me,'' Hardaway said.
</P>
<P>
   In the closing minutes of the game, and with Miami leading
83-81, Hardaway tried to seal the victory with two 3-point
attempts. But he missed them both.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was thinking about doing my T.H. thing,'' Hardaway said,
poking fun at the ''L'' Larry Johnson of the Knicks makes with his
arms after he hits a big shot.
</P>
<P>
   Ewing was equally instrumental in keeping his team in the game.
His injury was obvious, especially when he wasn't on the court. On
the bench, he sat with his back heavily wrapped.
</P>
<P>
   ''He looked fine,'' Knicks coach Jeff Van Gundy said.
</P>
<P>
   On the court, he did. But Ewing picked up his fifth foul with
2:49 to play, and Mourning took advantage of it. Mourning hit two
shots in the final minute, both coming against Ewing, that gave
Miami the win.
</P>
<P>
   ''We beat ourselves,'' Ewing said. ''We missed some easy shots
that we normally knock down. It's obvious that these two teams are
very close. We just needed to execute better down the stretch.''
</P>
<P>
   And keep Ewing in the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   ''You have to admire his attitude and his determination,''
Mourning said. ''That's one of the things I admired when I started
watching him at the age of 12. A lot of his determination has
rubbed off on me.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's got a warrior's mentality.''

<HEADLINE> Lindros Suffers Another Concussion  </HEADLINE>
By ROB MAADDI, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Eric Lindros' comeback plans are in
jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   Lindros sustained another concussion -- his third since January --
after a collision during a practice drill Thursday. He was hoping
to return to the Philadelphia Flyers for the Eastern Conference
finals.
</P>
<P>
   It appears Lindros might be out for the season, though his
doctor, James Kelly of Chicago, did not confirm it in a report sent
to the team Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly diagnosed Lindros with a Grade II concussion after a phone
interview and submitted his report to Flyers management. Team
chairman Ed Snider said the report had ''no mention whatsoever of
him being out for the season.''
</P>
<P>
   A Grade II concussion means Lindros would have to be
symptom-free for at least two weeks before he can be cleared to
skate. That would rule him out of the Eastern Conference finals
should the Flyers advance.
</P>
<P>
   ''We haven't been told by anyone that he is out for the
season,'' Flyers spokesman Zack Hill said after Philadelphia's 6-3
victory over Pittsburgh on Sunday in Game 5 of the Eastern
Conference semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   The Flyers lead Pittsburgh 3-2 in the best-of-seven series.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am very saddened for Eric and certainly disappointed from
the point of view of our team because we obviously felt that Eric
would be a big help to us if we were able to go further in the
playoffs,'' Snider said, reacting to an earlier report in The
Toronto Star that Lindros would be out for the season.
</P>
<P>
   Lindros has been recovering from a Grade II concussion that had
sidelined him since March 13. The latest concussion is his fifth in
two years.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a shame to see a player get hurt again,'' Flyers interim
coach Craig Ramsay said. ''It's very upsetting to Eric because he
had visions of coming back.''
</P>
<P>
   Carl Lindros, Eric's father and agent, called the injury ''a
significant setback.'' Brett Lindros, Eric's younger brother,
retired from hockey in May 1996 because of concussion-related
health problems.
</P>
<P>
   Snider said he was informed of the severity of the injury prior
to Sunday's game.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm surprised to hear it secondhand and I'm surprised that the
organization was not informed first,'' Snider said.
</P>
<P>
   Snider appeared to be having a heated discussion with team
physician Dr. Gary Dorshimer after the game. Neither would comment.
</P>
<P>
   Lindros had planned to visit Kelly in Chicago on Thursday before
being injured in a collision with Francis Lessard of the AHL's
Philadelphia Phantoms during what was supposed to be a non-contact
scrimmage. Lindros needed 20 stitches to close a cut on his lip.
</P>
<P>
   He was bothered by headaches once again and returned to Toronto
to resume therapy.
</P>
<P>
   Lindros missed 27 games in the regular season with injuries
ranging from a viral infection to back spasms to two concussions.
</P>
<P>
   He sustained his second concussion on a hit from Boston's Hal
Gill on March 4. After criticizing the team's medical staff for
failing to immediately diagnose the injury, Lindros was stripped of
his captaincy.
</P>
<P>
   Ramsay said the team is focused on its next game
</P>
<P>
   ''We realized the fact a long time ago that Eric wasn't going to
be available for us and if he did, it was going to be a bonus,''
Flyers forward Mark Recchi said. ''And if he didn't, we had a team
here that was prepared to go out and play hard and do what we've
been doing without him.''
</P>
<P>
   Lindros is in the final year of a one-year, $8.5 million
contract. He becomes an unrestricted free agent unless the Flyers
tender him a qualifying offer.
</P>
<P>
   General manager Bob Clarke has said the team will make the offer
-- which assures it will receive five first-round draft picks if
Lindros signs elsewhere. But it is not known what the team will do
now considering the latest injury.
</P>
<P>
   Snider would not address the subject following Sunday's game.

<HEADLINE> Webb Wins Ladies Nichirei Cup  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   INAGI, Japan (AP) -- Fighting swirling winds, Karrie Webb shot a
final-round 1-over-par 73 Sunday, but that was enough for her to
pick up her sixth victory of the season, winning the Nichirei Cup
World Ladies by nine strokes.
</P>
<P>
   Webb, the LPGA's earnings leader last season, birdied the par-4
14th, but bogeyed No. 5 and the final hole after starting the day
with an eight-stroke lead.
</P>
<P>
   The 26-year-old Queenslander finished the 72-hole event over the
6,387-yard, par-72 Tokyo Yomiuri Country Club at 12-under 276, nine
shots ahead of Yuri Fudoh and Junko Yasui.
</P>
<P>
   The victory, her first in Japan, was worth $99,500 from a purse
of $550,000.
</P>
<P>
   Her nine-shot victory was the second largest winning margin in
Nichirei Cup history. Beth Daniel won by 10 strokes in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   So far this season, Webb also has won four LPGA tournaments and
a non-tour event in Australia.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think I used up all my birdies yesterday. I had only one
birdie today,'' said Webb. ''It's hard to play with a big lead, and
it was so windy today the course was very difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Fudoh, seeking her second career victory, and Yasui, a veteran
with 12 victories, each shot 74s to share second at 285.
</P>
<P>
   Ayako Okamoto, formerly a regular on the LPGA Tour, went around
in 72 for a share of fourth at 287 with Nayoko Yoshikawa, who had a
73.
</P>
<P>
   Okamoto was seeking her 63rd career victory, while Yoshikawa
needs one more win, her 30th, for Japan's permanent exempt status.
</P>
<P>
   Ikuyo Shiotani, the Japanese tour's 1992 and 1995 earnings
leader, matched par and was alone in sixth at 289.
</P>
<P>
   Tied for seventh at 290 were Taiwan's Tseng Hsiu-feng, winner of
last week's Kachidoki Queens, Higo Kaori and Sweden's Whitmore
Gronberg.
</P>
<P>
   South Korean Se Ri Pak, the LPGA rookie of the year in 1998, had
a 72 for a share of 10th at 3-over 291.

<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Braves pitcher Terry Mulholland was taken to a
hospital Sunday after having difficulty breathing during a game
against the Philadelphia Phillies.
</P>
<P>
   The 37-year-old left-hander underwent tests at the Piedmont
Hospital emergency room, where doctors determined he may have
suffered heat-related problems. The temperature climbed to 89
degrees in the Atlanta area.
</P>
<P>
   ''It couldn't have been too serious, because he's already
gone,'' said Lil Shirkey, the hospital's weekend supervisor. ''He
walked in under his own power and he walked out under his own
power.''
</P>
<P>
   Mulholland left the mound with one out in the fourth inning,
having allowed eight hits and five runs.
</P>
<P>
   ''He had something in his throat and tried to cough,'' manager
Bobby Cox said. ''When he coughed, he did something in his back or
chest. It was scary for a moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Mulholland, making his seventh start of the season, was still at
the hospital when the Braves left for their charter flight to
Florida, where they begin a four-game series Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Team officials said Mulholland was expected to take a later
flight.

<HEADLINE> Phillies 7, Braves 4  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL NEWBERRY, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- The Philadelphia Phillies weren't exactly the
leading candidate to become the first visiting team to win a series
at Turner Field this season.
</P>
<P>
   The last-place Phillies came to Atlanta already 11 games behind
the first-place Braves in the NL East. Then, to make matters worse,
Philadelphia squandered a ninth-inning lead Friday night, losing
when Andruw Jones hit a two-run homer.
</P>
<P>
   But the Phillies bounced back to win two in a row, including a
7-4 victory Sunday when Mike Lieberthal hit a two-run homer and
pitcher Andy Ashby helped himself at the plate with a two-run
single.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves threatened in the ninth, scoring a run and loading
the bases with one out before Wayne Gomes, who gave up the homer to
Jones two days earlier, struck out Bobby Bonilla and got Javy Lopez
on a grounder.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was big to get this series against the best team in the
National League,'' said Lieberthal, who tied his career high with
four hits.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta, which already set a modern franchise record with a
15-game winning streak and a record for any era with 12 straight
home victories, lost two in a row for only the second time this
season.
</P>
<P>
   In those games, the Braves had 22 hits but went 2-for-20 with
runners in scoring position, resulting in 21 runners left on base.
The home winning streak ended Saturday night when Curt Schilling
threw an 11-hit shutout.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's the story the last two days,'' Chipper Jones said.
''We're swinging the bat well but we're just not getting the big
hit.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves have lost only two of their last 21 series at home,
having won their first five this season.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were probably due for a little drought like that,'' said
Trenidad Hubbard, who made his second straight start in right with
Brian Jordan ailing. ''Also, we've faced two pretty good pitchers.
You might get one or two each at-bat and you've got to capitalize.
We haven't been able to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Ashby (2-3) surrendered 10 hits in seven innings but stranded
seven runners. Down 7-3, Atlanta loaded the bases with no outs in
the ninth before Jones hit a sacrifice fly to the warning track
against Gomes.
</P>
<P>
   Andres Galarraga walked to reload the bases, but Gomes escaped
for his fifth save.
</P>
<P>
   In what is becoming a daily occurrence for the Braves, two more
players left the game with physical problems.
</P>
<P>
   Starting pitcher Terry Mulholland (3-3), pounded for eight hits
and five runs in 3 1-3 innings, walked off the mound after
experiencing difficulty breathing. He underwent tests at Piedmont
Hospital, where doctors determined he may have suffered
heat-related problems on an 89-degree day.
</P>
<P>
   Mulholland was released from the emergency room late Sunday
afternoon and expected to join the team in Florida, where the
Braves begin a four-game series Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was scary for a moment,'' manager Bobby Cox said.
</P>
<P>
   After the fourth, second baseman Quilvio Veras took himself out
because of a sore right wrist. He expects to play Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Already in the past week, the Braves lost backup catcher Eddie
Perez with a torn rotator cuff, placed Reggie Sanders on the 15-day
disabled list with a sprained ankle and have gone two straight
games without Jordan, who has a strained rib cage muscle.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia jumped ahead with two runs in the second, then
added three more in the fourth. Scott Rolen and Lieberthal began
the inning with singles, Kevin Jordan loaded the bases with a
one-out hit and Desi Relaford made it 3-0 by dumping a single to
right.
</P>
<P>
   Ashby, a .127 career hitter, followed with a single to right,
bringing home two more runners. Mulholland left the game after
giving up that hit.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves finally broke through on Andruw Jones' eighth homer
leading off the bottom of the fourth, then cut the Phillies' lead
to 5-2 when Galarraga scored from third on a wild-pitch third
strike to Rafael Furcal, who reached first when Lieberthal threw
high for an error.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberthal redeemed himself with his eighth homer, a two-out
shot in the seventh against Bruce Chen.
</P>
<P>
   Galarraga had an RBI single in the bottom half, but the Braves'
day was epitomized by Lopez's at-bat the previous inning. After the
first two hitters singled, Lopez worked the count against Ashby to
2-0 before fouling out.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez snapped the bat over his knee in frustration.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Atlanta's record at home dropped to 14-4. ... Ashby has
pitched at least six innings in all but one of his seven starts.
... Former Braves closer Kerry Ligtenberg, struggling to come back
from elbow surgery, pitched a scoreless inning but only because
Andruw Jones threw out Kevin Jordan at the plate for the final out.
... Lieberthal, who also doubled and singled, came to the plate in
the ninth inning needing a triple for the cycle. He singled to left
against Chen.

<HEADLINE> 5 Each Killed In Miss; Wis. Crashes  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSS POINT, Miss. (AP) -- A chain reaction of collisions
involving 16 cars, two tour buses and two 18-wheelers left at least
five people dead, authorities said. Heavy fog and smoke from a
forest fire reduced visibility and was believed to have been a
factor in the wreck early Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   In Wisconsin, five people died Sunday in a nearly head-on
collision of two vehicles near Neillsville in the central part of
the state. Authorities said four victims were in one car, and the
other was in another vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Troopers said the Mississippi accident happened just after 5
a.m. on Interstate 10 near the Alabama state line. Fifty to 70
people were involved, said Master Sgt. David Kenny of the state
Highway Patrol. At least 24 were injured in pileup.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities were still trying to determine what caused the
accident, but they believe a heavy fog was part of the reason, as
well as thick smoke from a forest fire during the night.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was one accident and then bam, bam, bam all the way down
the line,'' Scottie McCarroll of Citronelle, Ala., said. ''You
could hear other traffic coming very fast and hitting on breaks and
hitting each other and crashing and screaming and all kind of
sounds and you couldn't do anything.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the two tour buses involved in the accident was carrying
a group of Spanish speaking laborers from Texas to North Carolina.
Another bus, operated by Preferred Charters, was heading from Texas
and carrying a rhythm and blues band to Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty ambulances from five different companies carried injured
drivers and passengers to Singing River Hospital in Pascagoula and
Knollwood Hospital in Mobile, Ala.

<HEADLINE> Eritrea, Ethiopia Peace Talks Break  </HEADLINE>
By NICOLE WINFIELD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The Security Council decided Sunday to
send seven of its ambassadors -- currently visiting central Africa
to discuss peace in the Congo -- to Eritrea and Ethiopia to try to
revive stalled peace talks to resolve their 2-year-old border war.
</P>
<P>
   The mission will urge both sides ''to refrain from resorting to
force and further hostilities and to commit immediately, seriously
and without precondition to negotiations,'' according to the terms
for the mission agreed on Sunday after emergency consultations.
</P>
<P>
   The Congo mission, headed by U.S. Ambassador Richard Holbrooke,
is currently in Kampala, Uganda and was scheduled to wrap up its
work on Monday. Details of the follow-on mission to the Horn of
Africa were being worked out Sunday evening, said the council
president, Wang Yingfan of China in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats said the seven ambassadors, representing the United
States, Britain, France, Mali, Tunisia, Nigeria and the
Netherlands, could fly to Addis Ababa and Asmara in the U.N. plane
that has been shuttling them around central Africa for the past
week.
</P>
<P>
   Proximity talks between Eritrea and Ethiopia broke down on
Thursday in Algiers after four days. Ethiopia's foreign minister
accused Eritrea on Saturday of derailing the talks, saying Eritrea
had set preconditions for negotiations to resolve their 23-month
border dispute.
</P>
<P>
   In comments to reporters in the Ethiopian capital on Saturday,
the foreign minister, Seyoum Mesfin, spoke ominously of evaporating
hopes for peace in the sporadic conflict that has already left tens
of thousands of soldiers and civilians dead.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have now reached a critical period when prospects for a
peaceful resolution of the conflict have been blocked by Eritrea,''
Seyoum said.
</P>
<P>
   The two Horn of Africa countries went to war in May 1998 over
their frontier, which has not been demarcated since Eritrea gained
independence from Ethiopia in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Both Eritrea and Ethiopia have accepted a framework peace
agreement and a broad implementation strategy drafted by the
Organization of African Unity.
</P>
<P>
   Ethiopia, however, has questioned the technical arrangements for
implementing the accord, particularly the possibility that
peacekeepers would be stationed in contested areas along the
disputed 620-mile (1,000-kilometer) border.
</P>
<P>
   At the Algiers talks, Seyoum said Eritrea demanded the two sides
sign the framework agreement, the implementation strategy and a
cease-fire accord as a prerequisite for any substantive
discussions. Ethiopia rejected the demands.

<HEADLINE> Athletics 7, Rangers 6  </HEADLINE>
By CHARLES RICHARDS, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- Jeremy Giambi had three hits and drove
in three runs and the Oakland Athletics held off the Texas Rangers
7-6 Sunday, salvaging the wrapup of a wild series.
</P>
<P>
   Texas won 17-16 on Friday night and came back for an 11-10
victory Saturday night. The teams combined for 67 runs and 88 hits
in the three-game set.
</P>
<P>
   Giambi's brother, Jason, who hit a pair of two-run homers the
previous day, added an RBI double in the eighth that put the
Athletics ahead 7-4.
</P>
<P>
   Omar Olivares (3-3) got the victory, helping himself by starting
a fourth-inning double play that got him out of a bases-loaded jam.
The A's also backed him with double plays in each of the next three
innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers got a seventh-inning homer from Jason McDonald and
solo shots in eighth from Rafael Palmeiro and Ruben Mateo that cut
the Oakland lead to 7-6.
</P>
<P>
   Texas, which rallied in the late innings on both Friday and
Saturday, threatened to take the lead later in the eighth. Singles
by Chad Curtis and Mike Lamb put with runners on first and third,
but reliever Doug Jones struck out McDonald.
</P>
<P>
   Jones got his first save of the season and 302nd of his career.
</P>
<P>
   Oakland scored three runs in the first inning on three walks and
two hits against Doug Davis (0-1).
</P>
<P>
   Making his first start of the season, Davis had a 37-pitch first
inning reminiscent of his major league debut last year against
Toronto when the Blue Jays pounded him for 11 hits and 10 runs 2
1-3 innings of relief.
</P>
<P>
   The left-hander was in trouble again in the second after another
walk and a single, then gave Rangers fans a glimpse of why he was
the franchise's minor league pitcher of the year last season.
</P>
<P>
   Davis retired the next 10 batters, striking out six of seven
hitters from the second to fifth innings.
</P>
<P>
   Davis lost his control again in the fifth, giving up two-out
walks to Jason Giambi and Olmedo Saenz and a single to Ben Grieve
that loaded the bases.
</P>
<P>
   Jeremy Giambi, who singled in one of Oakland's runs in the first
inning, greeted Francisco Cordero with a two-run single and Frank
Menechino singled another run home.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Mateo stretched his hitting streak to 11 games. ... With
Davis striking out six, four Rangers relievers combined for 12
strikeouts, a team high for the season. ... Jason Giambi and Saenz
each walked their first two times up and scored both times,
accounting for four Oakland runs.

   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- The death toll from a powerful
earthquake that caused extensive damage in eastern Indonesia grew

</P>
<P>
   The 6.5-magnitude quake that struck before noon Thursday,
damaged hundreds of homes and buildings along a broad stretch of
eastern Sulawesi and the offshore islands of Peleng and Banggai.
</P>
<P>
   Sgt. Sarifudin Arifat, a spokesman for the military base in
Luwuk, a town on Sulawesi island's eastern coast, said more bodies
were uncovered as rescuers dug through the ruins of buildings and
homes.
</P>
<P>
   At least 148 people were injured, with 43 in serious condition,
he added.
</P>
<P>
   Arifat said rescuers and army soldiers were providing food for
the survivors and erecting tents for those who could not return to
their damaged houses.
</P>
<P>
   Local officials have said that 237 government buildings and more
than 13,000 houses on Banggai island, 1,100 miles northeast of
Jakarta, were damaged or destroyed.

<HEADLINE> Burnie Brewer Bombs in Milwaukee  </HEADLINE>
By GREG BEACHAM, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Usually, Jeromy Burnitz is a pretty funny guy.
No matter how bad things get for his Milwaukee Brewers, the
slugging right fielder is able to shrug it off and find a little
self-deprecating humor.
</P>
<P>
   But the All-Star outfielder isn't feeling very funny right now.
</P>
<P>
   With the Brewers off to another terrible start, Burnitz is mired
in one of the worst slumps of his career. These occurrences are
related: Burnitz, the Brewers' leader in homers and RBIs in each of
the past three years, was being heavily relied upon to produce in
Milwaukee's depleted lineup.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've been pretty horrible for about a month,'' Burnitz said.
''Guys are throwing whatever they want up there, and I'm swinging
at anything. It's embarrassing to be struggling like this as a
veteran player.''
</P>
<P>
   Burnitz went 2-for-5 against Montreal on Sunday with a
first-inning homer. It was his first multi-hit game since April 26
and his first homer since April 8, the second-longest homerless
span of his four years in Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   It was also the first sign of life in weeks from Burnitz, who
had three hits in his last 34 at-bats before Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's been pressing because he's a guy that isn't used to
failure,'' Milwaukee manager Davey Lopes said. ''This is something
that guys go through in their careers, and I have no doubt he'll
work out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Burnitz, a starter at last season's All-Star game, hit five
homers in the season's first week, but hadn't gone deep again until
Sunday. In fact, since going 8-for-20 with five home runs in the
season's first six games, Burnitz hasn't done much.
</P>
<P>
   Entering Sunday's game, he had 14 hits in his last 86 at-bats
(.163) with no homers, four doubles and nine RBIs. He has struck
out 20 times this year, including four in the Brewers' 10-2 loss to
the Expos on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Even extra sessions with new hitting coach Rod Carew haven't
yielded results for Burnitz, who by his own admission is swinging
at everything near the plate this year. Combine this lack of
choosiness with one of the game's most violent and erratic swings,
and the results are grim.
</P>
<P>
   ''When he connects, it's beautiful, but he hasn't been
connecting as much as he should,'' Lopes said. ''He knows what he
has to work on, and that's what he's doing, but it's a long process
sometimes when you get down in a slump.''
</P>
<P>
   Burnitz started spring training amid controversy and then failed
to produce despite moving from the cleanup spot to No. 3 in the
lineup, which he said he prefers. He drew flak from Lopes when he
publicly criticized the team's offseason moves and questioned
whether the Brewers had any hope of winning this season.
</P>
<P>
   ''In a situation like this, we all need to concentrate on fixing
what's wrong with us personally,'' Burnitz said. ''I'm slumping,
and I'm the only person I can get out of a slump.''
</P>
<P>
   Trouble is, when Burnitz slumps, so do the Brewers. The team
fell from respectability last season when Burnitz missed a month
after the All-Star game with a broken bone in his right hand.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Milwaukee is off to an 11-20 start, its worst since
the Seattle Pilots found out during 1970 spring training that they
were moving to Milwaukee and becoming the Brewers. They lost 20 of
26 to start that season.
</P>
<P>
   Burnitz is in a tricky situation this season. While he enjoys
being the focus of Milwaukee's offense, he will likely become trade
bait as the Brewers' troubles continue.
</P>
<P>
   But if he doesn't bring his game back to its former level, he
won't have much trade value. He is making $4.46 million this year
in the next-to-last year of a contract that's a bargain rate for a
player who has averaged 33 homers and 104 RBIs in the last three
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not worried about it,'' Burnitz said. ''I'm not thinking
about the future, I'm not thinking about the past. I'm just
thinking about my next at-bat.''

   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) -- Three gunmen entered a tavern
Saturday night and, after demanding money from the owner, opened
fire on about 30 people inside, killing nine and wounding 10,
police said.

<P>
   The robbers made off with $190 and a cellular phone in the
attack on the shebeen, or informal tavern, in Elsburg township east

<P>
   It was unclear if the assailants were the same ones who on April
21 entered a tavern in nearby Greenfields township and opened fire
with assault rifles and pistols, killing all six people inside and
wounded nine bystanders while fleeing.

<HEADLINE> 75 firefighters called to rescue six people at New York river lock  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   GLENVILLE, N.Y. (AP) -- A fisherman, his girlfriend and a
would-be rescuer with three children were trapped in the undertow
at a river lock after their boats capsized, calling for a rescue
involving some 75 firefighters from eight departments.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Hafler, 46, of Rotterdam, and Julie Curran, whose age was
not released, were fishing on the Mohawk River about 3 p.m.
Saturday when their boat collapsed after getting too close to the
raging, frigid current flowing into the partially open lock.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Davis, fishing in a boat nearby with three children,
steered over to help.
</P>
<P>
   ''I said to the kids, 'They're getting too close to the lock.'
No sooner had the words got out of my mouth when their boat
capsized,'' Davis said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, 50, and the three boys, aged 10, 12, and 12, threw the
couple their boat's flotation devices and steered the boat over
toward them.
</P>
<P>
   Curran was nowhere in sight, and Hafler was unable to grab hold
of Davis' boat.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was looking him dead in the eye. He said 'please help us,
help us,''' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   That's when Davis' boat began filling with water from the
sluiceway.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Eldridge Jr. and Richard Roadenmaker were fishing nearby
and paddled their canoe over to help. Using an anchor rope, they
were able to help five of the six boaters onto a ledge of the lock
just above the waterline.
</P>
<P>
   ''We sat there for a long time and all of a sudden boats and
helicopters started to come,'' 10-year-old Ryan Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   Curran was trapped for at least 15 minutes in an air pocket
under the boat, in water rescuers said was a ''freezing'' 50
degrees.
</P>
<P>
   ''She was underwater for an undetermined amount of time and was
shaking and losing her body strength from hypothermia,'' said Don
Gerding, second assistant chief of the Beukendaal Fire Department.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the boaters had crawled out and were standing on the
ledge of the lock, with frigid water spilling over them like a
waterfall.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of the boaters were told to jump into the water, where
they were pulled by ropes onto boats.
</P>
<P>
   The rappellers trying to reach them were continuously slammed by
the cold water as they scooped the boaters to safety, Scotia
Firefighter David Briggs said.
</P>
<P>
   Briggs tried to coordinate the many ropes needed to lift
rescuers and boaters to safety.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everybody has a different role,'' he said. ''As soon as people
were on top of the bridgework they were passed on to people in
(emergency medical services) ... You're only standing on two planks
of wood. You want to get 'em on and get 'em off.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's one of those situations where it's probably the worst
case scenario for a water rescue -- in a dam or waterfall -- because
there's churning water. That's how a lot of people drown.''
</P>
<P>
   All six boaters were treated at hospitals for minor injuries and
released Saturday night, a spokeswoman said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Davis said he now needs to rescue his boat, which was still
caught against the lock Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's ironic. I waited all my life for a boat and now it's
sitting under Lock 9, submerged,'' Davis said.

<HEADLINE> Pres. Angry Over Austria's Nazi Role  </HEADLINE>
By MELISSA EDDY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- At Austria's most infamous Nazi
concentration camp, President Thomas Klestil expressed anger Sunday
at the role his country played in the horrors of the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   Klestil spoke at ceremonies marking the 55th anniversary of the
liberation of the Mauthausen camp by the Allies. Those ceremonies
culminated with the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra's performance of
Beethoven's Ninth Symphony -- criticized by some as out of place for
a death camp.
</P>
<P>
   As the final strains of the symphony's Ode to Joy faded over the
stone walls of Mauthausen's quarry, where thousands of inmates were
worked to death removing stones to build the camp, a silent
audience of more than 7,000 people raised small, white candles.
</P>
<P>
   ''None of us consider this to be a concert,'' conductor Sir
Simon Rattle had told reporters Saturday. ''But in some way, a
ritual that makes a gesture to heal.''
</P>
<P>
   Austria's efforts to deal with its Nazi past have gained urgency
for many after the entry into government this year of the far-right
Freedom Party -- criticised for its anti-immigrant policies and its
leader's past comments praising aspects of the Nazi regime.
</P>
<P>
   At Mauthausen, Klestil, who has been a vocal critic of the
Freedom Party, spoke before about 7,000 visitors, many of them
former inmates. He expressed ''sorrow over the deaths'' at the camp
and ''anger and rage that Austrians as well participated'' in Nazi
crimes culminating in the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   Austrians fervently supported Adolf Hitler, their native son.
According to the Vienna-based Jewish Documentation Center,
Austrians were accountable in some way for the death of 3 million
Jews -- about half those killed in the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   Although more than 99 percent of Austrians purportedly voted for
their country's annexation by Germany in 1938, the country since
that war has depicted itself as a victim of Hitler's policies.
</P>
<P>
   Political leaders first began acknowledging that Austria was
also a perpetrator during the Nazi era in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ''We cannot look away when it comes to crimes committed here and
elsewhere, also by Austrians,'' Klestil said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics have also pointed out the Philharmonic's reluctance
to come to terms with its Nazi past. The orchestra has only
relatively recently acknowledged that 47 percent of its members
also belonged to the Nazi party. Five Jewish members perished in
the camps.
</P>
<P>
   The idea for the concert at the camp was born five years ago,
the brainchild of Leon Zelman, a 72-year-old Holocaust survivor who
now heads Vienna's Jewish Welcome Service. Zelman wanted to mark
the new millenium's first anniversary of the camp's liberation in a
special way that young people would remember.
</P>
<P>
   Some 200,000 people, -- not only Jews, but also political
prisoners from Russia, Poland, the Czech Republic, Spain and France
-- were interned at Mauthausen. Half of them were worked to death or
otherwise killed before it was liberated May 5, 1945.
</P>
<P>
   ''You shouldn't make a concert at a concentration camp,'' said
Harry Weber, whose mother perished at Mauthausen. ''Especially not
the Ode to Joy.''
</P>
<P>
   But the political climate made the musicians more determined
that Beethoven's musical call for goodwill be played.
</P>
<P>
   ''Maybe I'm naive, but when I hear Beethoven's words 'All men
will become brothers,' these are the words of the New Europe,''
said Zelman.
</P>
<P>
   Even the most basic elements of a normal concert, such as
applause, became an issue for the Mauthausen performance. The
orchestra decided to let people clap after the piece, before a
moment of silence and lighting of candles in remembrance of the
dead.
</P>
<P>
   ''We do not want to disturb the dead. On the contrary, those
anonymous dead, who were not even ashes, will come alive again,''
said Zelman. ''And a message will go into the world: Never
Forget.''

<HEADLINE> Mexican Candidate Speaks In Calif.  </HEADLINE>
By MICHELLE RAY ORTIZ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAKERSFIELD, Calif. (AP) -- Vicente Fox, the opposition candidate
who poses the most serious threat to Mexico's ruling party in
July's presidential election, brought his campaign to central
California on Sunday to woo the migrant workers who could help him
win.
</P>
<P>
   The millions of Mexican-born immigrants in the United States
cannot vote from abroad. But Fox, candidate of the center-right
National Action Party, believes their influence with friends and
family in Mexico could sway the race.
</P>
<P>
   Another opposition candidate, Cuauhtemoc Cardenas of the
left-of-center Democratic Revolution Party, is testing the same
theory. Cardenas was scheduled to arrive in Los Angeles on Sunday
night.
</P>
<P>
   About 500 people turned out to hear Fox in Bakersfield, far
below the 5,000 expected.
</P>
<P>
   Fox saluted immigrant workers as ''perhaps the greatest
patrimony that our country has.'' Their success shows what Mexicans
can do given the right opportunities, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Fox said under his presidency, Mexicans abroad would have the
right to vote. He pledged he would get rid of obstacles that hinder
Mexicans returning home for visits and fight for the free transit
of people across the border by expanding the North American Free
Trade Agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Foz also promised more jobs and financing programs for rural
communities in Mexico -- the kinds of towns whose inhabitants are
often forced to seek work in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   He was enthusiastically received by the small crowd. Some
audience members waved signs denouncing the ruling Institutional
Revolutionary Party, or PRI, and proclaiming ''Death to PRI.''
</P>
<P>
   Atanacio Avalos Campos, a 65-year-old farm worker, drove 3{
hours from Oxnard to hear Fox.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want the corruption of the PRI to end,'' said Avalos, whose
wife and family live in the western Mexican state of Michoacan.
''There's no work in Mexico. That's why we're here -- to make a
change.''
</P>
<P>
   Mexican expatriots send home some $7 billion a year, making
their earnings the third-largest source of income for their home
country, behind oil and tourism.
</P>
<P>
   Fox is in a statistical dead heat with Francisco Labastida, the
nominee of the PRI, which has governed Mexico uninterrupted for 71
years.

<HEADLINE> NJ's 4 nuclear plants seeking 'homes' for spent fuel rods  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   FORKED RIVER, N.J. (AP) -- The operator of the Oyster Creek
Nuclear Generating Station, the nation's oldest commercial nuclear
plant, again is seeking permission to squeeze more spent fuel rods
into a cramped tank designed for temporary storage.
</P>
<P>
   It's the fourth time in 23 years that Oyster Creek officials
have asked the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to allow them to store
more highly radioactive, used fuel in the plant's towering
cooled-water repository.
</P>
<P>
   There are 5,955 nuclear fuel assemblies, each holding dozens of
spent fuel rods accumulated at New Jersey's four nuclear power
plants, all within 50 miles of 9 million people. That makes
disposing of the used, highly radioactive fuel a growing problem.
The potentially lethal fuel will remain radioactive for tens of
thousands of years.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think we can get any more space out of the existing
spent-fuel pools,'' said Skip Sindoni, a spokesman for Public
Service Electric &AMP; Gas, which operates the Hope Creek and Salem 1
and 2 reactors in Lower Alloways Creek Township along the Delaware
River.
</P>
<P>
   Those three plants aren't in as dire straits as Oyster Creek,
but Hope Creek's fuel pool, for example, will run out of room in
2007, Sindoni told The Press of Atlantic City for Sunday's
editions.
</P>
<P>
   GPU Nuclear, which operates the 31-year-old Oyster Creek plant,
wants the NRC to allow it to cram another 390 fuel assemblies into
the small storage pool on the plant's top floor, 119 feet above the
ground. The pool already holds 154,880 nuclear fuel rods bundled
into 2,420 fuel assemblies.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the NRC wrote Oyster Creek officials that their plan
could cause the pool's basin to rupture.
</P>
<P>
   The plant's nuclear safety manager, George Busch, said such an
accident is extremely unlikely and would not endanger the public.
Valves would prevent the cooling water from draining out if the
pool ruptured, and neutron-absorbing boron, the element used to
shut down a reactor core, is sandwiched between the spent fuel rods
in the tank to absorb most of the radioactivity, Busch said.
</P>
<P>
   If the NRC rejects Oyster Creek's request, the plant would have
to store its spent fuel outdoors in concrete casks. Sindoni said
PSE&AMP;G is considering a similar storage system for its plants.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, 40 million tons of spent reactor fuel is in some
sort of temporary storage at 72 nuclear plants in 31 states.
</P>
<P>
   Oyster Creek spokeswoman Debra Piana told the newspaper the
plant's used fuel is safe now.
</P>
<P>
   ''Think about the community,'' she added. ''They don't want that
here. The Department of Energy has made a commitment and they need
to fulfill it.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1982, Congress ordered the Energy Department to develop a
permanent atomic fuel storage facility by 1998. Despite years of
squabbling over politics and technical problems, the DOE doesn't
expect to open a storage facility before 2010.
</P>
<P>
   Worse yet, the planned site is 660 feet under Nevada's Yucca
Mountain, a location strongly opposed by many scientists and
environmentalists because the area is prone to earthquakes.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every projection has said groundwater will be contaminated if
the waste is put in this leaking, earthquake-prone mountain,'' said
Michael Mariotte, executive director of the Nuclear Information and
Resource Service, a Washington, D.C.-based watchdog group.
</P>
<P>
   Norm Cohen, coordinator of UNPLUG Salem, a New Jersey group that
wants the problem-plagued Salem 1 and 2 reactors permanently
closed, said nuclear scientists still haven't found a completely
safe way to store used atomic fuel.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've had 20 or 30 years now knowing this problem was coming
and their answer has been, 'Bury it in a hole,''' he told The
Press. ''That doesn't work.''
</P>
<P>
   The nuclear power industry, though, has been critical of
President Clinton's recent veto of a bill that would have allowed
plants to begin shipping waste in seven years to Yucca Mountain,
where it would be stored outside until the permanent repository is
ready.
</P>
<P>
   Last Tuesday, the Senate barely failed to override Clinton's
veto, partly because many senators are worried that if the Yucca
Mountain project is later scrapped, the waste would have to be
moved again. That would invite a second chance for highway or
railway accidents as the fuel is transported.

<HEADLINE> Diamondbacks 8, Padres 1  </HEADLINE>
By BOB BAUM, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX (AP) -- Todd Stottlemyre became the National League's
third six-game winner as the Arizona Diamondbacks won their fourth
in a row, beating the San Diego Padres 8-1 on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Luis Gonzalez broke out of a 2-for-25 slump with a single and a
two-run double, in a seven-run fifth inning that helped Arizona
complete the three-game sweep.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Finley had a two-run single, while Damian Miller and Tony
Womack each had RBI doubles in the uprising for Arizona, which had
a six-run second inning in Saturday's 10-5 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Stottlemyre (6-1) allowed one run and seven hits in 5 2-3
innings to join teammate Randy Johnson (7-0) and Darryl Kile of St.
Louis (6-1) as the NL's only six-game winners.
</P>
<P>
   Stottlemyre, who pitches with a partially torn rotator cuff
after coming back from the injury without surgery last season,
struck out seven, his most in two seasons with Arizona. He walked
two and hit a batter.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Owens, who had reached base safely in all 27 of his games
until Saturday, was 2-for-3 for the Padres.
</P>
<P>
   The game was tied at 1 until starter Matt Clement (4-1) fell
apart in the fifth. He walked two of the first three batters and,
with Gonzalez's single, the bases were loaded with no outs when
Finley singled to right to drive in two. Travis Lee hit into a
fielder's choice to drive in another run, then Miller doubled in
the fourth run of the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Stottlemyre's infield single, the fourth hit by an Arizona
pitcher in the series, put runners on first and third. Womack
doubled in a run and Gonzalez's two-run double with two outs made
it 8-1.
</P>
<P>
   Clement, who failed in his bid to become the first Padres'
pitcher to start 5-0 since Andy Hawkins in 1985, allowed eight runs
and nine hits in 4 2-3 innings. He walked five and struck out one.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego's only run came on Ryan Klesko's RBI single with two
outs in the third.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Padres are 4-13 at Bank One Ballpark, 1-9 the last two
seasons. ... In Stottlemyre's seven starts, the Diamondbacks have
scored 54 runs. ... With Stottlemyre's infield single in the fifth,
pitchers have gone 6-for-13 against the Padres in their last six
games. ... The Diamondbacks' Erubiel Durazo extended his hitting
streak to 10 games with a leadoff single in the sixth. ... Arizona
outscored San Diego in the series 23-9. ... The Diamondbacks are
21-10 but have lost three of five against San Francisco, the only
team they've played that has a winning record.

<HEADLINE> Tyco Buying Connector Business  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   EXETER, N.H. (AP) -- Tyco International Ltd. announced an
agreement Sunday to acquire the electronic equipment manufacturing
division of Thomas &AMP; Betts for $750 million in cash.
</P>
<P>
   Tyco, a conglomerate that makes electrical and electronic parts
for telecommunications and fire protection systems, said the
purchase will expand the company's product line and improve
efficiency in manufacturing, research, marketing and other areas.
</P>
<P>
   ''This business is an excellent fit with Tyco Electronics,''
said L. Dennis Kozlowski, Tyco's chairman and chief executive
officer. ''The high quality brand name products that will be
acquired are extremely complementary to those of Tyco
Electronics.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas &AMP; Betts' electronic original equipment business includes
connectors and components, that transmit, store and manage
electronic signals in computers, cellular phones and automobiles.
The brand names being acquired from its original equipment
manufacturing business include Augat sockets, Alco switches and
Ansley-Holbert connectors.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas &AMP; Betts, based in Memphis, Tenn., said in a statement it
plans to use the proceeds from the sale primarily to reduce debt,
initiate a share repurchase program and implement its e-commerce
strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ''While our Electronic OEM business is profitable and growing,
its fundamental nature is significantly different from our
electrical and communication businesses,'' said Thomas &AMP; Betts'
chairman Clyde R. Moore. ''Divesting this business will allow us to
refocus on what we do best -- manufacturing, marketing and
distributing electrical and related components -- as we build our
leadership position in industrial B2B commerce.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas &AMP; Betts had 1999 profits of $148.3 million on sales of
$2.5 billion. Tyco's profits were $985 million on sales of $22.5
billion. The division being sold had revenues of $687 million in
1999.
</P>
<P>
   Kozlowski said he expects the acquisition to boost the company's
earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Since its last acquisition, Tyco has been hit with a Securities
and Exchange Commission inquiry and several shareholder lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   After Tyco bought AMP Inc. for $11. 3 billion last year, a money
manager criticized the company's accounting methods, causing its
stock price to drop more than 25 percent. The price fell even
further when the SEC launched its inquiry in December.
</P>
<P>
   Investors also have filed class-action lawsuits in Florida, New
York and New Hampshire, accusing top company officials of
misleading stockholders while selling millions of their own shares
at near-peak prices.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials have denied any wrongdoing, and despite a
rocky first year, analysts in January said the buyout remained
financially solid.
</P>
<P>
   Tyco is based in Bermuda and has its U.S. headquarters in
Exeter. Its acquisition of Thomas &AMP; Betts is subject to regulatory
approval.

By The Associated PressDouglas Fairbanks Jr.
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Douglas Fairbanks Jr., the rakishly handsome
actor, producer, author and businessman who was a real-life war
hero and friend of royalty, died Sunday. He was 90.
</P>
<P>
   The son of the swashbuckling superstar of silent films,
Fairbanks made his own mark in some 75 movies, including
''Catherine the Great,'' ''The Prisoner of Zenda,'' ''Gunga Din,''
''Little Caesar,'' ''Sinbad the Sailor'' and ''State Secret.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I never tried to emulate my father. Anyone trying to do that
would be a second-rate carbon copy,'' he once said.
</P>
<P>
   Fairbanks became the first American officer to command a British
flotilla of raiding craft during a commando operation in World War
II. He served under Adm. Lord Louis Mountbatten, who later
introduced him to his nephew, Prince Philip, the husband of Queen
Elizabeth.
</P>
<P>
   Fairbanks became a favorite of the royal couple, entertaining
them at his home, much to the chagrin of Mayfair society.
</P>
<P>
   Fairbanks was born in New York City on Dec. 9, 1909 -- the only
son of Douglas Fairbanks and his first wife, Anna.
</P>
<P>
   Fairbanks' movie career began at age 13 with an appearance in
''Stephen Steps Out.'' The film was not a success and he resumed
his studies for a time. But in 1925 he made several more films, and
the influential movie magazine ''Photoplay'' said of Fairbanks,
''he is considered a real bet, with much of his father's charm and
artistry.''
</P>
<P>
   He made his stage debut in Los Angeles in 1927, earning good
reviews. He began getting better movie roles, appearing with Greta
Garbo in ''A Woman of Affairs'' and in a Frank Capra film, ''The
Power of the Press,'' both 1928.
</P>
<P>
   His career picked up with the arrival of sound. In the early
1930s, he had a string of film successes, including a showy role in
''Little Caesar,'' then was able to write his own ticket.
Cye Mandel
</P>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Cye Mandel, who for more than 20 years owned two
premiere restaurants frequented by celebrities and politicians
alike, died Thursday at Miami Heart Institute after a
two-month-long illness. He was 71.
</P>
<P>
   Mandel moved to Miami from New York in the 1950s. He owned two
restaurants in Miami -- the Hasta and Cye's Rivergate. Movers and
shakers, including late banker Bebe Rebozo and actor Kirk Douglas,
frequented the restaurants, said longtime friend Paul Goldberg.
</P>
<P>
   Both restaurants were sold at the height of their success,
Goldberg said -- the Hasta to Tony Roma's during the 1960s and Cye's
Rivergate to a New York businessman in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   Mandel's customer list included Paul Newman, Jimmy The Greek,
Ralph Renick and Hank Goldberg. Late President Richard Nixon dined
at his restaurant before his historic trip to China.
Lee Llewellyn Moore
</P>
<P>
   BASSETERRE, St. Kitts (AP) -- Sir Lee Llewellyn Moore, the former
premier of St. Kitts and Nevis, died Saturday in a New York
hospital following a prolonged illness. He was 61.
</P>
<P>
   Moore died at Columbia Presbyterian Hospital in New York,
surrounded by relatives, Prime Minister Denzil Douglas announced.
</P>
<P>
   Moore, who served as premier in 1979-1980, had been the
Caribbean island nation's ambassador to the United Nations since
1995.

<HEADLINE> S.D. Janitors Reach Tentative Deal  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Striking janitors and six downtown cleaning
companies reached a tentative contract agreement, nearly a month
after workers walked off the job, the union said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Service Employees International Union, Local 2028
were scheduled to vote on the three-year contract Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''This goes to show that when workers stand together, there is
no greater power,'' said Ignacio Quinones, who was among a group of
striking janitors who fasted for 10 days in protest of the stalled
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Union officials and representatives for the cleaning companies
met Saturday for about seven hours with the help of Mayor Susan
Golding.
</P>
<P>
   Janitors currently earn about $7 an hour. The new contract calls
for a 50 cent-an-hour increase in the first year, a 40 cent-an-hour
increase in the second year, and in the third year, the companies
will contribute $171 a month toward employees health insurance in
the third year.
</P>
<P>
   About 275 janitors walked off the job on April 9 in protest of
the stalled negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the employers, Dick Davis, did not immediately
return a phone message seeking comment on Sunday afternoon.

<HEADLINE> Rescued Cubans Released To Relatives  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Fourteen sunburned and blistered Cubans were
reunited with their relatives, a day after they were found at sea
suffering from severe dehydration.
</P>
<P>
   The group was rescued Friday by the U.S. Coast Guard about seven
miles off Miami after their aluminum boat was spotted by a
freighter. They said they had been at sea for 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   The immigrants were immediately brought to three Miami
Beach-area hospitals for treatment. The 12 men and two women were
reunited with family members and friends Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm here to work, and to live in a real country -- a free
country,'' said Alfredo Lorenzo Rodriguez, 37, after he embraced
his uncle and his aunt.
</P>
<P>
   The group told the Coast Guard they left the Matanzas province
in a small boat they built from discarded aluminum pipes.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly afterward, they stopped on a small island to hide from
Cuban border patrol boats and, in the confusion, lost their
rations.
</P>
<P>
   For the remainder of the trip, they shared a small bag of
crackers. They said they drank salt water and their own urine.
</P>
<P>
   Under U.S. immigration policy, Cuban refugees who reach land
usually are allowed to remain in the country. Those intercepted
before setting foot on U.S. soil usually are returned to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The migrants in this case will be permitted to stay, because all
were brought ashore because of their medical needs.

<HEADLINE> Prayer, Tributes For O'Connor  </HEADLINE>
By BETH J. HARPAZ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Cardinal John O'Connor was remembered in prayers
and tributes at Masses throughout the day Sunday at St. Patrick's
Cathedral, where his body lay in state on the altar in a red
velvet-lined casket.
</P>
<P>
   ''We celebrate his life today as we mourn his passing,'' said
the Rev. John Ferry, who presided over the Sunday morning Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Archbishop Edwin O'Brien, who heads the Catholic Archdiocese for
the U.S. Military and was close to O'Connor, led an afternoon Mass
dedicated to the ''earlier priestly works of Father John
O'Connor,'' including his years as a teacher at St. James High
School in his native Philadelphia, a chaplain in the Navy and
Marines, and bishop of Scranton.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor, he recalled, once said: ''First and foremost, the
chaplain is there to save souls.''
</P>
<P>
   A Mass held later in the day was presided over by Cardinal
Bernard Law of Boston, a close friend of O'Connor's. Law thanked
those in attendance, mentioning that O'Connor's family members
''are so consoled by the continual outpouring of the faithful
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Brucato, an administrator at the archdiocese, recalled
how when O'Connor was installed, he said the use of media was the
greatest tool to spread the gospel.
</P>
<P>
   ''This way his words are recorded and have not blown away like
dust,'' Brucato said.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the cathedral, hundreds of people lined up in the
90-degree heat to pay their respects to O'Connor, 80, who died
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''He'll be greatly missed,'' said Leo Gualtieri. ''We hope the
next cardinal will follow in his footsteps.''
</P>
<P>
   Bishop Edward Michael Egan of Bridgeport, Conn., 68, is said to
be a leading contender to replace O'Connor. Bishop Henry Mansell,
62, of Buffalo, and O'Brien, 60, have also been mentioned.
</P>
<P>
   The archbishop of New York is considered the most influential
Catholic post in the United States. O'Connor made an art of using
the position to weigh in on the news of the day, often injecting
himself into political debates on issues like abortion or
attempting to heal rifts in controversies involving race.
</P>
<P>
   Dignitaries expected to attend O'Connor's funeral Monday include
President Clinton and first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton; Vice
President Al Gore; former President George Bush and his son,
Republican presidential candidate George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor will be interred Monday in the crypt beneath the
cathedral's altar, where all the previous archbishops of New York
are buried.

<HEADLINE> Allegations Amuse Devils' Stevens  </HEADLINE>
By TOM CANAVAN, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- At the mention of the words ''dirty
play,'' a smile briefly appeared on the face of New Jersey Devils
defenseman Scott Stevens.
</P>
<P>
   It was hard to tell whether the Devils captain was laughing at
the accusations the Toronto Maple Leafs are making about him or
wondering how anybody could confuse tough physical play with being
dirty.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, Stevens didn't really care Sunday after the Devils
held a short team meeting. All that was important was Game 6 of the
Eastern Conference semifinal on Monday night at the Continental
Airlines Arena.
</P>
<P>
   If the Devils win, they advance to the conference championship
round for the first time since winning the Stanley Cup in 1995 and
they extend the Maple Leafs' Cup drought to 33 years.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey moved within a game of the conference final by
beating the Maple Leafs 4-3 in Toronto. Stevens helped set the tone
Saturday night with devastating open-ice hits on Tomas Kaberle and
Kevyn Adams.
</P>
<P>
   Those hits didn't upset the Maple Leafs as much as what they
claim are little extra whacks and punches that Stevens takes during
plays. Toronto claims they have not been called by the referees in
the series.
</P>
<P>
   After 18 NHL seasons, Stevens admits it's upsetting being called
a dirty player for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ''I find that hard to understand,'' Stevens said. ''I know what
type of player I am and it doesn't bother me. Sometimes you have to
look at the source. I feel I am a very clean hockey player. I
always keep my elbows down and use my shoulder, and I'm not going
to change.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we don't see enough of that anymore,'' Stevens said
about his physical play. ''I think it's too much of a free-style
European game and we need more of the good, hard hitting,
personally. I think it makes for a good hockey game, and we need to
get back to it a little.''
</P>
<P>
   In his own defense, Stevens noted that for all the hits he has
made in nine games since the playoffs started, he's only been
called for two minor penalties.
</P>
<P>
   The other positive for the Devils is that Stevens has helped
take out the opposition's top lines since the postseason began.
</P>
<P>
   Pavel Bure, who led the league with 58 regular-season goals, had
just one goal in the first round. Stevens was his constant
companion on the ice.
</P>
<P>
   Against Toronto, Stevens has been matched against the Maple
Leafs' top line of Mats Sundin, Steve Thomas and Jonas Hoglund.
That trio had 10 goals in an opening-round win over Ottawa. It has
one in five games against New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Hence the gripes, Stevens said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I must be hurting them a bit,'' he said. ''They must be
feeling it a bit. If they are concerned about hitting, I think it's
great. It's fun and I enjoy it. It's a big part of hockey. I have
always played that way, since I was small. I think it's very
important in playoff hockey to be a physical team and finish your
checks.''
</P>
<P>
   The end to Saturday night's game was ugly, with the teams
scuffling in front of the Devils' net after the final horn. Stevens
got in the middle of that incident after leaving the penalty box,
which doesn't violate league rules because the game was over.
</P>
<P>
   While calling Stevens a great defenseman, Toronto forward Darcy
Tucker also questioned his play.
</P>
<P>
   ''When the guy doesn't have the puck and he's getting punched in
the face and getting crosschecked in the back, it's tough to get
anything going,'' Tucker said.
</P>
<P>
   If the Maple Leafs are going to come back, they have to get
their power-play on track. They have not scored a power-play goal
since Game 3 of the Ottawa series and are 2-for-41 overall.
</P>
<P>
   ''We know we can win at New Jersey. We've done that already,''
Tucker said. ''We have to go in there and take it period by period,
and bring it back home here.''
</P>
<P>
   Going back to Toronto is the last thing the Devils want. They
lost a seven-game series in the opening round with Pittsburgh last
year and they are still haunted by playoff collapses the past two
years.	   ''We have to approach every game like it's a Game 7,'' Devils
center Bobby Holik said. ''We played that way in Toronto and
hopefully we'll bring that same attitude to this game and not let
up for one second.''

<HEADLINE> Storm Swamps Eastern Missouri  </HEADLINE>
By CONNIE FARROW, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNION, Mo. (AP) -- Flash floods washed out roads, inundated homes
and killed at least two people early Sunday after more than a foot
of rain swamped east-central Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   The National Guard was sent to help with rescues and cleanup in
hard-hit Franklin County, west of St. Louis, and Jefferson County,
south of the city.
</P>
<P>
   The floods were caused by a storm system that arrived late
Saturday after lumbering northeastward from Oklahoma, where
hundreds of families were evacuated earlier that day. The same
slow-moving system had been blamed for thunderstorms in the
southern Plains and western Gulf Coast states for much of last
week.
</P>
<P>
   So much rain fell so fast that many in Union, in southern
Franklin County, were unaware they were in peril until tornado
sirens sounded about 1 a.m. Sunday. In a neighborhood near Flat
Creek, normally just a small stream, people opened their doors to
see white-capped water rushing past.
</P>
<P>
   Rhonda Gipson and her 31-year-old son, who has Down syndrome,
grabbed their small dog and tried to run to higher ground. Gipson
was washed over a 3-foot-high chainlink fence and screamed for help
in the darkness, gripping the dog with one arm and her son's hand
with the other. Firefighters rescued them two hours later.
</P>
<P>
   ''The water was moving so quickly, it pushed me into the fence,
but that was a good thing because it gave me something to hold
onto,'' Gipson said.
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen inches of rain fell during the night at St. Clair as
the storm stalled over Franklin County for about six hours,
repeatedly redeveloping and ''hitting the same area over and over
and over again'' before dissipating, said meteorologist Thomas
Spriggs of the National Weather Service in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of people were evacuated through the night as creeks
quickly rose out of their banks, floating cars, mobile homes and
propane tanks, sheriff's Capt. Don Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   Connie Barnes, 19, of St. Clair, died Sunday morning several
hours after the car she was in overturned in water on a washed-out
road, the Missouri State Highway Patrol said. Six other people in
the car were injured.
</P>
<P>
   Another person was killed, apparently when a vehicle was caught
by a flash flood near Robertsville, Sheriff Gary Toelke said.
Flooding also was blamed for the death of a motorist in Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   Flooding also occurred at Washington, along the Missouri River.
Shelters were opened in churches and public buildings, but
authorities said many people went to stay with relatives.
</P>
<P>
   At Washington, high water along small tributaries of the
Missouri River inundated a half-dozen business in a low-lying
industrial park just west of downtown.
</P>
<P>
   At the Canam Steel plant, all that showed above the water of
five parked tractor-trailer rigs were the tops of their cabs.
</P>
<P>
   The plant's general manager, John Greene, stood on high ground
watching water rush past the plant where about 200 people work.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't think it would be this bad,'' he said. Greee called
it worse than the flood of 1993, which inundated huge areas of the
Mississippi and Missouri river valleys but developed slowly and
gave businesses time to deploy pumps and sandbags.
</P>
<P>
   More than 400 homes were flooded early Saturday in several
Oklahoma communities and parts of Tulsa, state officials said. More
than 8 inches of rain fell in parts of Creek County.
</P>
<P>
   At Sapulpa, Okla., where 200 homes and 12 businesses were
flooded, creeks were back in their banks Sunday, but the gray sky
gave Creek County Emergency Management Director B.J. Pope reason to
worry.
</P>
<P>
   ''Until it can run and creeks can be emptied, we're still in
danger,'' he said. ''We couldn't stand another 2 inches of rain.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray and Joan Andis spent Sunday morning ripping soaked carpet
out of their home in Sapulpa.
</P>
<P>
   ''What took six or seven hours to destroy, it's going to take
that many weeks to straighten out,'' Ray Andis said.

<HEADLINE> Rwanda To Pull Troops From Congo War  </HEADLINE>
By GLENN McKENZIE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) -- Rwanda agreed on Sunday to begin
withdrawing from the war in neighboring Congo, where its troops
have aided various rebel factions.
</P>
<P>
   The pledge came during a visit by a seven-member U.N. Security
Council delegation aimed at boosting peace prospects and paving the
way for U.N. observers in Congo.
</P>
<P>
   ''The government of Rwanda is prepared to move quickly to
implement a phased withdrawal,'' a Rwandan government spokesman
said, reading from a joint U.N.-Rwandan statement released at the
end of the visit, led by America's U.N. ambassador, Richard
Holbrooke.
</P>
<P>
   Rebels took up arms in eastern Congo in August 1998 to oust
Congolese President Laurent Kabila. Rwanda and Uganda backed the
rebels, citing security concerns along their borders with Congo,
while Kabila enlisted the support of Angola, Zimbabwe and Namibia.
</P>
<P>
   Last Thursday, Holbrooke's mission convinced the Congolese
government to sign a cooperation agreement giving security and
access guarantees to a 5,537-member U.N. observer mission,
including 500 monitors and about 3,700 combat troops to protect
them.
</P>
<P>
   The Security Council delegation also met Sunday with Rwanda's
rebel allies in Kigali before leaving for Uganda, where a meeting
with President Yoweri Museveni was scheduled for Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Rwanda's withdrawal announcement on Sunday is not the first time
the country has pledged to pull troops from its vast Central
African neighbor. In early April, Rwanda and Uganda both signed an
agreement committing themselves to a gradual pullout. So far, no
troops have withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
   Kabila has repeatedly warned that a permanent peace is
impossible until all foreign ''invaders'' leave.
</P>
<P>
   Uganda and Rwanda -- nominal allies whose forces clashed in the
northern Congolese city of Kisangani on Friday -- both requested
urgent deployment of U.N. observers in the city, which is held by
troops from both countries, Holbrooke said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, the Security Council mission met with one of the
Congo government's most important allies, Zimbabwe's leader Robert
Mugabe, in the Zimbabwean capital of Harare.
</P>
<P>
   The extraction and sale of minerals -- including uranium, gold,
diamonds and other precious gems -- has kept some of the warring
sides fighting for territory.
</P>
<P>
   In a surprise development Sunday, the Security Council cleared
Holbrooke's delegation to embark on a peace mission to Ethiopia and
Eritrea beginning Monday evening, aides to Holbrooke said.
</P>
<P>
   The east African countries have fought infrequent, but bloody
border clashes for more than a year. A recent round of talks in
Algeria collapsed.

<HEADLINE> Pres. Bush Urges Normal China Trade  </HEADLINE>
By JUAN A. LOZANO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON (AP) -- Extending permanent trade benefits to China will
not flood the U.S. market with cheap goods or encourage the
government in Beijing to ignore human rights at home, former
President Bush said Sunday in expressing his support for pending
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not special,'' Bush said. ''It's a normal trade status we
give to other countries. Other countries have received this trade
status, and we have human-rights differences with them. We have to
work diplomatically with China, and not through bashing.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who was the chief U.S. liaison officer to China from 1974
to 1976, said trade with that country is one of the most important
foreign policy issues facing the United States.
</P>
<P>
   He met with a group of reporters for about 20 minutes in the
living room of his home here before leaving for his summer
residence in Kennebunkport, Maine.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also was asked about Sen. John McCain as a potential
running mate for his son, presumptive Republican presidential
nominee George W. Bush. The elder Bush declined to comment but said
he was glad the two former rivals for the nomination planned to
meet Tuesday in Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   The House is expected to vote later this month on a bill to
extend permanent trade status with China, granting it the same
permanent low-tariff access to American markets that is routinely
extended to most U.S. trading partners. Currently, China's status
must be renewed every year.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation also would ease China's long-sought entry into
the World Trade Organization, the Geneva-based body that regulates
world trade.
</P>
<P>
   If the House approves the bill, its passage by the Senate
appears assured.
</P>
<P>
   The issue has been the focus of intense lobbying on Capitol
Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters, including the Clinton administration, Republican
leaders and business groups, say U.S. global leadership and
American companies would suffer without the opportunity to sell
their goods to China's 1.2 billion consumers. Opponents, including
labor unions, human rights groups and top House Democrats, say the
measure would end the annual trade reviews that critics of China's
communist government have used to push for improvements in
religious, labor and human rights.
</P>
<P>
   In a written statement issued before he addressed reporters, the
elder Bush said: ''In supporting (permanent normal trade relations)
and the opening of the China market to the United States, I believe
that we are encouraging China's reforms, exposing the Chinese
people to our perspectives and values, and strengthening those
Chinese there who share our ideas about how prosperity and promise
transform people's lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Both George W. Bush and Democratic presidential rival Al Gore
support normalizing trade relations with China.

<HEADLINE> Jazz Confident of Adjusting  </HEADLINE>
By LANDON HALL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- The Utah Jazz are optimistic about
regrouping for Game 2 of their playoff series against Portland.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a seven-game series, not a one-game series,'' Jazz
forward Karl Malone said after Sunday's 94-75 loss.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need to make some adjustments and come back and win. We
need more intensity. We showed some signs. The second team played
well. And we were only down four entering the fourth.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the extent of Malone's comments. After a question about
Scottie Pippen he didn't like, Malone cursed and cut his interview
short in the locker room.
</P>
<P>
   Malone also didn't talk about his left knee, injured when
teammate Armen Gilliam was going for a loose ball and ran into
Malone's chair.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not sure what happened,'' Gilliam said. ''I got pushed out
of bounds and ran into the bench. But (Malone) doesn't want to talk
about it. I want to respect that, so I won't talk about it,
either.''
</P>
<P>
   A series loss will renew talk that Utah's terrific run of
success is almost over. The starting five is the oldest in NBA
history with an average age of 35 years, five months -- Malone turns
37 in July, point guard John Stockton is 38, and Jeff Hornacek, who
is retiring after the playoffs, is 37.
</P>
<P>
   Utah can no longer keep up with the athletic Blazers, and it
hasn't been able to win in Portland, even in its heyday. Utah is
just 1-13 in the playoffs here, and this season it lost four of
five to the Blazers. In those games, the Jazz shot 39 percent, well
off their 46-percent season average.
</P>
<P>
   ''We just need more of everything, and we need to start with
more intensity,'' Utah point guard John Stockton said. ''I don't
know what happened. I'll try to figure it out (Monday).''
</P>
<P>
   Utah stayed close early, but its poor shooting allowed the
Blazers to take a 23-15 lead. Jazz coach Jerry Sloan benched the
starters for the entire second quarter, and reserves Gilliam,
Howard Eisley and Jacque Vaughn came out with energy and cut the
lead to 32-30.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our first group looked like we just wanted to hang out and try
to get the game over,'' Sloan said. ''We put the other guys in
there with the hopes of competing.''
</P>
<P>
   Portland's reserves provided the lift in the fourth quarter,
which began with Utah down 65-61. Greg Anthony scored 12 points in
the period, hitting two 3-pointers, and Brian Grant had four points
and six rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Grant, who had some memorable, bruising battles with Malone in
the playoffs last year but has been reduced to a reserve role by
injuries this season, ripped away a rebound from three Jazz players
with 8:45 to go. That set up a short jumper by Pippen that pushed
the lead to 71-63.
</P>
<P>
   After hitting a layup later in the quarter, Grant ran down a
missed jumper by Pippen, diving onto media row to save the ball.
Pippen then hit a 3-pointer that made it 80-67 with 5:39 left.
</P>
<P>
   ''What was big was the energy he brought to us all game,''
Pippen said of Grant. ''That's something he's given to us all
season -- some cockiness and energy off the bench.''

<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The World Press Freedom Committee on Sunday
urged governments that attempt to limit the spread of information
and opinion to change their policies regarding freedom of speech
and the press.
</P>
<P>
   The WPFC also issued a warning against governments that attempt
to control Internet content. The committee specifically cited
China, Russia, Singapore and Turkey, accusing them of seeking ''to
enforce political censorship and/or surveillance.
</P>
<P>
   At its biennial meeting, the WPFC said governments seeking to
limit the spread of information are not sound democracies and have
a tendency toward authoritarianism.
</P>
<P>
   The committee reaffirmed its conviction that ''insult laws'' --
which provide special protection to government authorities and
official institutions -- are inappropriate in countries that call
themselves democracies, and urged such countries to repeal them.
</P>
<P>
   The WPFC also issued a resolution, urging governments and
international organizations to honor ''the public right to know
information held by official bodies.''
</P>
<P>
   The committee voted to re-elect James H. Ottaway Jr. as chairman
of the WPFC.
</P>
<P>
   The WPFC, which includes 44 news organizations on six
continents, is based in Reston, Virginia.

<HEADLINE> 6 More Vieques Protesters Detained  </HEADLINE>
By EILEEN McNAMARA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- Six more people have been detained
for trespassing on U.S. Navy property on the island of Vieques, a
Navy official said Sunday, days after federal agents removed
hundreds of protesters from a bombing range.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Cmdr. Mark McDonald said that authorities detained and
released four people Saturday and two on Friday. He did not know
specifically where on the Navy property the trespassers had been
found.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Marshals Service processed and released the detainees
at Camp Garcia, the Navy's facility on Vieques, McDonald said.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, hundreds of U.S. Marshals and FBI agents cleared
216 protesters, some of whom had occupied parts of Camp Garcia's
training range since April 1999, after a civilian Navy guard was
killed in an accidental bombing.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters detained Thursday were sent to a Navy base on the
main island of Puerto Rico, but some returned triumphantly to
Vieques by boat in the hours after they were released. Activists
have set up a new, legal camp next to the Navy's land.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities have said that anyone who tries to re-enter the
range could face up to 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine.
</P>
<P>
   One of the protest leaders, fisherman Carlos Zenon, said two of
the eight people who remained in secret camps on the range after
Tuesday's federal raid were among those detained Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ''They made a mistake,'' Zenon said of those detained. ''They
got out to stretch their legs or something and they had a dog with
them ... when the guards heard the dog they followed it to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Zenon said that he had been in contact with the protesters
Sunday and that there were still six people left on the range,
spread out in three camps, stocked with food and water.
</P>
<P>
   One man from a U.S. religious group has been hiding on the range
by himself and was considering turning himself in because his water
supply was running low, Zenon said.
</P>
<P>
   McDonald said he could not confirm Zenon's claims that more
people were staying in secret camps. The military forces guarding
the range have been routinely patrolling the restricted area since
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're very serious about removing any trespassers from the
live impact area,'' McDonald said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   CICERO, Ill. (AP) -- Lu Ravi won the $300,000 Sixty Sails
Handicap on Sunday at Sportsman's Park, beating Tap to Music by two
lengths to top the $1 million mark in career earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Lu Ravi, ridden by Pat Day ran 1 1-8 miles in 1:49.15, and paid
$4, $2.80 and $2.20. The 5-year-old daughter of A.P. Indy earned
$180,000 for her seventh victory in 18 starts to increase her
career total to $1,002,581.
</P>
<P>
   ''She did all the work. I just guided her around,'' Day said.
''Coming down the stretch I didn't want to put her to the task too
soon. I was confident I had some horse left.''
</P>
<P>
   Tap to Music returned $3.60 and $2.80, and Batuka paid $2.40 to
show.

straight after losing six in a row. ... Bartolo Colon, on the
15-day DL with a pulled left oblique muscle, made a rehab start
Sunday for Triple-A Buffalo. Colon allowed one run and six hits in
five innings. Fifty of his 67 pitches were strikes. Colon will

</P>
<P>
   BALTIMORE: Mike Bordick went 0-for-4, ending his 10-game hitting

starting Monday, then return to Camden Yards for a four-game series
against Boston starting Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK: Jim Hall, the public address announcer while Bob
Sheppard watched from a luxury suite on Bob Sheppard day, has been
Sheppard's backup for 25 years. ... Derek Jeter was 0-for-4,
dropping to .287. ''I'm not comfortable,'' he said. ''Every season,
every year, you go through stretches when you don't feel right.
It's finding a groove. You have to be able to get though it.'' ...
New York lost for just the fourth time in its last 17 games against
Baltimore at Yankee Stadium. ... 2B Chuck Knoblauch took batting
practice for the first time in six days and said his injured left
wrist felt better. But he won't play Monday.
Devil Rays-Red Sox:
</P>
<P>
   TAMPA BAY: The Devil Rays are in the midst of playing 23 of 32

</P>
<P>
   BOSTON: SS Nomar Garciaparra didn't start for the second

single in the eighth inning before leaving for a pinch-runner. ...
RHP Pedro Martinez began serving his five-game suspension for
beaning Cleveland's Roberto Alomar with a pitch on April 30. The
Red Sox announced on Saturday that Martinez dropped his appeal to
the league office.
Athletics-Rangers:
</P>
<P>
   OAKLAND: The Athletics won only one game despite scoring an
Oakland record 47 runs over the four days leading into Sunday's
wrapup of a series with the Rangers. The A's scored 40 runs on 50
hits (.391 average) over the last three of those games with 13
doubles, 10 homers, 14 walks and one hit batsman. ... The pitching
staff allowed 52 runs in the first six games of May. The bullpen
blew three straight saves -- after allowing just two runs total in
the previous nine games -- before Doug Jones closed Sunday's win.
... The A's are 10-6 on the road and 5-10 at home, tied for the
second-worst home record in the majors.
</P>
<P>
   TEXAS: The Rangers' back-to-back walk-off victories in the first

July 15-16 vs. Arizona. ... Ruben Mateo' has a career-high 11-game

16 to remove bone spurs from the front of his right ankle.
White Sox-Royals:
</P>
<P>
   CHICAGO: The White Sox were 3-5 during manager Jerry Manuel's
suspension. ... Magglio Ordonez homered, doubled and singled in his
first game back from a five-game suspension. ... The White Sox,
playing under Manuel for the first time since he served an
eight-game suspension, dropped to 1-6 in May after posting a
team-record 17 wins in April.
</P>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY: New Royals owner David Glass was honored before the
game by commissioner Bud Selig. ... Johnny Damon extended his
hitting streak to 14 games with his first-inning single. He leads
the league in stolen bases with 13 and has not been caught this
season. ... The Royals lead the league in stolen bases with 36 in
39 attempts. ... Jermaine Dye has a major-league high 100 total
bases and leads the AL in slugging percentage (.813) and the majors
in extra base hits (27).
Tigers-Twins:
</P>
<P>
   DETROIT: Juan Encarnacion's 18-game hitting streak is the
longest this season. ... Encarnacion is the only Tiger to have
played in all 29 games. ... Detroit relievers have allowed just
four runs in their last 22 2-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   MINNESOTA: After the game, a Cuban team practiced in the
Metrodome in preparation for its game Tuesday against the
University of St. Thomas. The Cuban team arrived in Minnesota on
Saturday and one of its players, Mario Miguel Chaoui, apparently
defected, leaving the group moments after the team's arrival at
Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport. ... Jay Canizaro,
called up from Triple-A Salt Lake on Thursday when Todd Walker got
demoted, got his third straight start at second base Sunday. He is
1-for-7.
Angels-Mariners:
</P>
<P>
   ANAHEIM: The 12 walks was the fourth time Anaheim has walked
that many, the last time being June 27, 1996, against Oakland. The
12 walks ties a team record. ... Scott Schoeneweis was hit in the
lower back by Dan Wilson's line drive, but stayed in the game.
</P>
<P>
   SEATTLE: Mariners broadcaster Dave Niehaus, 65, was inducted
into the team's Hall of Fame in a 30-minute ceremony before the
game. He joined former Mariners first baseman Alvin Davis, who was
inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1997, as the only two members of
the Hall of Fame in the club's 24-year history. ... John Halama
improved his record to 15-10 with the Mariners. He was acquired in
a trade with Houston on July 31, 1998, involving Randy Johnson. ...
The Mariners are 10-5 at Safeco Field with an ERA of 3.11.
NATIONAL LEAGUE:
Pirates-Cubs:
</P>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH: Luis Sojo might want to visit Wrigley Field more
often. Sojo hit just two home runs all of last year, and arrived in
Chicago without having gone deep yet this year. But in three days
at Wrigley, he hit three homers. ''In Chicago, the wind was blowing
out and I got lucky,'' he said. ''After we leave, we're going to
get back to reality and I'm going to have to hit the ball up the
middle again.'' ... Jason Schmidt was all but forgotten in the
Kerry Wood frenzy, but he can pitch, too. Schmidt, who was making
his second start after spending the early part of the season on the
DL with inflammation in his right shoulder, gave up one earned run
in five innings Sunday. ''I'd sure like to have Kerry Wood, but I'd
go into battle with the guy on the other side, too,'' Pittsburgh
manager Gene Lamont said. ... Dating back to last season, the
Pirates have now won four in a row at Wrigley Field. It's the first
four-game winning streak in Chicago since 1988.
</P>
<P>
   CHICAGO: The Cubs are 12-21 and have lost their last four.
Manager Don Baylor had words for his team after the game, but not
the kind you might think. ''Just something I've been meaning to
say, encouraging words,'' Baylor said. ''Guys are pressing, but one
thing is definite, this club hasn't quit.'' ... Eric Young went
3-for-4 with an RBI and a run scored. He's now 24-for-61 (.393)
over his last 14 games. ''He keeps battling,'' Baylor said. ''If he
keeps playing like that, the team will be better.'' ... Mark Grace
is all out of synch these days. He was the Cubs' No. 2 hitter
Sunday for only the second time since 1994. Grace, who bats either
third or fourth, hit second during the last three months of the
1991 season, but hadn't since Aug. 16, 1998. He also made a rare
reserve appearance Saturday.
Mets-Marlins:
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK -- The Mets have now lost five of six games and scored
only 16 runs in the past seven games. ... New York will have a
much-needed day off on Monday before they play at Pittsburgh on
Tuesday. ... Rickey Henderson wasn't happy about not playing in
Sunday's game against the Marlins. ''When it comes to the point
that I play two or three games in a row and then need a day off for
a rest, it's time I hang up my shoes.''
</P>
<P>
   FLORIDA: In addition to the five one-hit or less complete games
by Al Leiter, Kevin Brown, Pat Rapp, Alex Fernandez and, now, Ryan
Dempster, the Marlins' John Johnstone, Robb Nen and Rapp combined
for a one-hitter against Colorado on July 9, 1994 in a 4-2 win. ...
The Marlins have had two no-hitters in their history. Al Leiter on
May 11, 1996, against Colorado and Kevin Brown on June 10, 1997,
vs. San Francisco. ... Dempster struck out three straight batters
in the fourth and fifth innings, the fourth time he has
accomplished this feat this season. He did it on April 9 vs.
Colorado and twice on April 15 at Chicago. ... OF Cliff Floyd
barely missed Mike Piazza's sixth inning double that broke up
Dempster's bid for a no-hitter. ''I knew he had a no-hitter going
so I was giving it everything I had to catch it,'' said Floyd. ''He
just hit it so hard I couldn't get a good read on it.'' ... Mike
Lowell snapped a 0-for-27 hitless streak with a double in the
eighth inning that scored a run.
Cardinals-Reds:
</P>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS: Mark McGwire missed Saturday's game because his
brother was seriously injured in an auto accident in the Detroit
area. He was back in the lineup Sunday and had a pair of singles
off Denny Neagle. Coming into the game, McGwire had been 0-for-13
with seven strikeouts against the left-hander. ... The 12 runs
scored by the Cardinals during the three games was their lowest
total for a series this season. ... The Cardinals have become
dependent upon the homer to score runs. They lead the majors with
67 homers but are hitting only .226 with runners in scoring
position. They were 3-for-18 with runners in scoring position
during the series.
</P>
<P>
   CINCINNATI: Dante Bichette's homer Sunday his first since April
8, a span of 87 at-bats, and provided his first RBI since April 26.
He's batting .225 with three homers and eight RBIs. By comparison,
that's only one more homer and three more runs batted in than St.
Louis starter Rick Ankiel, who gave up Bichette's homer Sunday. ...
Dmitri Young doesn't want to jinx his hitting streak by talking
about it. His single Sunday extended it to a career-high 15 games.
... Young was at first base in place of Sean Casey, who's in a
4-for-32 slump.
Phillies-Braves:
</P>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA: Former Brave Brian Hunter made his third start of
the season for the Phillies. Hunter was acquired on waivers April
21 when the Braves tried to option him back to the minors. Three
days earlier, in his final at-bat for Atlanta, Hunter beat
Philadelphia on a pinch-hit homer in the 12th inning.
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA: OF Brian Jordan sat out for the second day in a row
with a sore rib cage muscle. He hopes to return to the lineup
Monday when the Braves travel to Florida to begin a four-game
series. Trenidad Hubbard started for Jordan in right field. ...
Reliever Kevin McGlinchy, on the DL with tendinitis in his
shoulder, threw again before the game and reported no pain. ''I was
probably throwing about 90 percent,'' he said. McGlinchy will
return to the minors this week to make two more rehab appearances
before the Braves decide if he is ready to rejoin the 25-man
roster. ... The 11 hits in Saturday's 6-0 loss to Curt Schilling
was the most in a shutout defeat since the Braves had the same
number in a 2-0 setback to Kevin Brown and San Diego on Aug. 20,
1998.
Expos-Brewers:
</P>
<P>
   MONTREAL: The Expos finished a three-city, nine-game road trip
on Sunday. Montreal hosts Philadelphia on Tuesday in the first
outing of a 12-game homestand. ... Vladimir Guerrero, who was
6-for-9 with a homer and four RBIs in the first two games against
Milwaukee, still took extra batting practice at County Stadium. ...
Ugueth Urbina is in just his fourth season as Montreal's closer,
but in saving the Expos' 3-2 victory on Saturday, he moved into
second place on the franchise's career saves list with (110).
</P>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE: Lyle Mouton started in left field in place of Geoff
Jenkins, who will be out for a month with a broken bone in his
right hand. Mouton, who was playing in Japan two years ago, was
acquired from Baltimore in a minor-league deal last year. ...
Jeromy Burnitz's first-inning homer was his 106th as a Brewer,
putting him in 10th place on the franchise's career list. It was
also his first homer since April 8. ... The Brewers are 0-15 this
season in games in which they scored three runs or fewer, and
they're 2-15 when being outhit by opponents.
Padres-Diamondbacks:
</P>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO: The Padres are 4-13 at Bank One Ballpark, 1-9 the
last two seasons. ... Eric Owens, who had reached base safely in
all 27 of his games until Saturday, was 2-for-3 for the Padres. ...
San Diego's only run came on Ryan Klesko's RBI single with two outs
in the third. ... Matt Clement, failed to become the first Padres'
pitcher to start 5-0 since Andy Hawkins in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   ARIZONA: In Todd Stottlemyre's seven starts, the Diamondbacks
have scored 54 runs. ... With Stottlemyre's infield single in the
fifth, pitchers have gone 6-for-13 against the Padres in their last
six games. ... The Diamondbacks' Erubiel Durazo extended his
hitting streak to 10 games with a leadoff single in the sixth. ...
Arizona outscored San Diego in the series 23-9. ... The
Diamondbacks are 21-10 but have lost three of five against San
Francisco, the only team they've played that has a winning record.
Rockies-Giants:
</P>
<P>
   COLORADO: The Rockies have lost five straight on the road,
including consecutive shutouts to the Giants before Sunday's
rainout in San Francisco. 1B Todd Helton said the problem stems
more from the way the Rockies are swinging the bat than from the
opposition's pitching. ''I think it's been more us as hitters.
We've been swinging the bats very poorly,'' Helton said. ...
Sunday's rainout in San Francisco will lead to some juggling in the
Rockies' pitching rotation. Colorado's No. 1 starter Pedro Astacio
will stick with his scheduled turn and pitch Monday in Houston.
''Any time you can get your No. 1 guy out there, you want to take
advantage of it,'' Bell said.
</P>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO: Sunday's rainout against Colorado was just the
29th in San Francisco since the Giants moved west in 1958 but the
second since the team began playing in Pacific Bell Park this
season. ... Before this year, the Giants had not been rained out
more than once in a season since 1967, when three games were called
due to inclement weather. ... Despite the rainout, the Giants are
keeping their rotation in order, pushing each of their starters one
day back. So Livan Hernandez (1-4), whose scheduled start was
washed away, will now face Pat Hentgen (3-3) Monday when the Giants
open a three-game series against St. Louis.
Astros-Dodgers:
</P>
<P>
   HOUSTON: Astros LF Moises Alou is expected to return to the
Astros' lineup on Friday after a two-week stint on the DL with a
strained right calf. He has been on the DL eight times in his
nine-year career, totaling 65 weeks -- including the entire 1991 and
1999 seasons. His father, Montreal manager Felipe Alou, was on the
DL only once in 17 major league seasons, missing just four weeks.
... The Astros will have one more game to play at Dodger Stadium
following this weekend's series. The April 17 rainout was
rescheduled for June 8, which had been a scheduled travel day
between Houston and San Diego. ... Hockey's Stanley Cup will be on
display before the Astros-Colorado game at Enron Field on Monday
night. Fans will be able to have pictures taken with the trophy for
$5 a head, with all the proceeds going to the Make-A-Wish
Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES: Kevin Brown (2-1) is scheduled to face Randy
Johnson (7-0) on Wednesday in Arizona in one of the marquee
pitching matchups of the season. They'd be hard-pressed to top
their duel in Game 1 of the NL Division Series in 1998, when Brown
pitched eight innings of two-hit ball for San Diego and struck out
16 to beat Johnson and Houston 2-1. Brown also outpitched Johnson
last July 25 in a 2-1 Dodger victory, allowing a run and three hits
over eight innings with seven strikeouts. ... What makes Matt
Herges' season-opening streak of 19 1-3 consecutive innings without
allowing an earned run all the more remarkable, is his ability to
focus on his job. His brother was diagnosed with a brain tumor
during spring training. ... Reliever Gregg Olson, who has been on
the DL since April 11 because of a strained left forearm, will
accompany the team to Arizona and throw in the bullpen before going
off to his next rehab assignment. ... 3B Adrian Beltre returned to
the Dodgers' lineup Sunday after missing two games due to a tight
left hamstring. ... Reliever Mike Fetters, whose MRI on his right
elbow came back negative, should be ready to pitch again by Monday,
when the Dodgers begin a 12-game road trip in Arizona.

Putin Swears To Restore Russia's Luster
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Vladimir Putin promised to encourage democracy in Russia and
rebuild the country's economy during his inaugural speech in Moscow Sunday. With
his predecessor, Boris Yeltsin, standing stiffly at his side, the 47-year-old
Putin said after taking the presidential oath at the Kremlin that his main task
was to save Russia after years of decline. Many Russians hope that the former
KGB officer will end years of economic and social chaos, boost incomes and
living standards, root out entrenched corruption and restore political stability
after the turbulent Yeltsin era.

Serious Crime Decline Continues
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Serious crimes reported to the police dropped for an
eighth consecutive year in 1999, down 7 percent from the year before and by far
the longest-running crime decline on record, the FBI reported today. The FBI
report showed that all seven major types of crime were down not only nationwide,
but also in each region of the nation, and in suburbs, rural areas and in cities
of all sizes. The violent crimes of murder, rape, robbery and aggravated assault
were down a combined 7 percent, led by murder and robbery, each down 8 percent.

   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) -- A clash between U.N. Forces and a rebel group
in Sierra Leone seemed to be cooling Sunday after leaders of the rebel
Revolutionary United Front and U.N. officials flew together by helicopter to
check out the area where their forces clashed a day earlier. No rebel soldiers
could be seen along the route in central Sierra Leone, and there were no signs
of violence officials said. As many as 500 peacekeepers are believed to be held
by the rebels. Why they were seized remained unclear.

Ex-President Bush Urges China Trade
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   HOUSTON (AP) -- Extending permanent trade benefits to China will not flood
the U.S. market with cheap goods or encourage the government in Beijing to
ignore human rights at home, former President Bush said today in expressing his
support for pending legislation. Bush, who was the chief U.S. liaison officer to
China from 1974 to 1976, said trade with that country is one of the most
important foreign policy issues facing the United States. The House is expected
to vote later this month on a bill to extend permanent trade status with China.

Rwanda To Pull Troops From Congo War

<P>
   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) -- Rwanda agreed on Sunday to begin withdrawing from the
war in neighboring Congo, where its troops have aided various rebel factions.
The pledge came during a visit by a seven-member U.N. Security Council
delegation aimed at boosting peace prospects and paving the way for U.N.
observers in Congo. Rebels took up arms in eastern Congo in August 1998 to oust
Congolese President Laurent Kabila. Rwanda and Uganda backed the rebels, citing
security concerns along their borders with Congo, while Kabila enlisted the
support of Angola, Zimbabwe and Namibia.

NASA Changes Mars Exploration Plans
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- After a pair of high-profile Mars mission flops,
NASA is rethinking its approach to the Red Planet in an unprecedented review
that includes everything from science and technology to management and
bureaucracy. When the soul-searching is done, officials say they will have
reinvented the program that helped doom the $125 million Mars Climate Orbiter
and the $165 million Polar Lander. Mindful that dumb mistakes are part of human
nature, NASA is concentrating on why they were not caught. Too little money,
lack of oversight, poor communication and an unfocused agenda all contributed to
the failures, officials said.

<HEADLINE> Putin Promises To Rebuild Russia  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY RENFREW, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- President Vladimir Putin pledged to finish
building democracy in Russia and restore the country to its world
power status during his inaugural speech Sunday, which marked the
first democratic transfer of power in the vast nation's history.
</P>
<P>
   Moving swiftly to tackle the ailing economy, the country's
biggest problem, Putin's first act was to name economics specialist
Mikhail Kasyanov as prime minister. Kasyanov is a well-regarded
moderate who backs market reforms.
</P>
<P>
   With his predecessor, Boris Yeltsin, standing stiffly at his
side, the 47-year-old Putin said after taking the presidential oath
at the Kremlin that his main task was to save Russia after years of
decline.
</P>
<P>
   ''Today is really a historic day. For the first time throughout
the history of the Russian state, high power is being transferred
in the most democratic and simple way, by the will of the people --
legally and peacefully,'' Putin said.
</P>
<P>
   Many Russians hope that the former KGB officer will end years of
economic and social chaos, boost incomes and living standards, root
out entrenched corruption and restore political stability after the
turbulent Yeltsin era.
</P>
<P>
   Putin and Kasyanov also symbolize the passing of power to a new
generation of vigorous, younger leaders after decades of elderly,
often ailing Soviet and Russian leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ''Putin is a new politician with new ideas, and I think the
young generation has put its hopes in him,'' said Natalya
Medvedeva, a student.
</P>
<P>
   Kasyanov, 41, a close ally of Putin, had been first deputy prime
minister and his appointment to head the Cabinet was widely
expected. The appointment must be confirmed by parliament, which is
expected to act swiftly.
</P>
<P>
   Putin took the oath of office amid the ornate splendors of the
Andreevsky Hall, the old imperial throne room that is a glittering
confection of gold columns, white marble and crystal chandeliers.
The presidential guard in 19th-century uniforms goose stepped,
military bands belted out trumpet fanfares, and cannons outside
fired a 30-gun salute. The inauguration was broadcast live on
Russian TV.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin, who resigned early last New Year's Eve after making
Putin acting president, is rarely seen these days. Frequently
hospitalized during his second term, Yeltsin looked tired and
stiff, but smiled during the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   Mikhail Gorbachev, the last Soviet leader, glumly watched the
inauguration as he stood in the crowd of dignitaries in the hall.
</P>
<P>
   An enigmatic figure who never held elected office until winning
March 26 elections, Putin faces an enormous task. The economy has
been in decline for years, caught between the failed Soviet system
and the corrupt crony capitalism of the Yeltsin years. The
education and health systems are crumbling, while life expectancy
and the birth rate are falling sharply.
</P>
<P>
   Putin said he recognized the magnitude of the problems facing
Russia and the population's expectations. He acknowledged that
further democratic reforms were needed and appealed to all Russians
to unite behind him. Some liberal critics, mindful of Putin's KGB
past, fear he will roll back democratic freedoms.
</P>
<P>
   ''The road to a free society was not simple and easy. Our
history had both tragic and light pages. The construction of the
democratic state is far from being completed yet. But a lot has
been done,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Putin said he understood that ordinary Russians desperately want
better lives and promised to work openly and honestly for effective
government.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want Russia to become a free, flowering, rich and mighty
and civilized country of which its citizens are proud and which is
respected around the world,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Kremlin ceremony was jammed with the politicians and
tycoons who have amassed wealth and power while the rest of Russia
has sunk into poverty.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the economy, the other pressing challenge for Putin is
the war in Chechnya. His tough stance against Chechen rebels helped
boost his popularity, but Russian forces are bogged down with
little hope of quick victory.
</P>
<P>
   Putin says he wants to restore Russia's great power status,
which could strain relations with the United States. Russia relies
heavily on foreign loans, and analysts say Putin is likely to be
pragmatic in dealing with the West.

<HEADLINE> Clintons go home to raise money for Senate race in New York  </HEADLINE>
By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Home in Arkansas, Bill and Hillary
Rodham Clinton raised $100,000 on Sunday for the first lady's
campaign for a U.S. Senate seat from New York.
</P>
<P>
   ''In my whole life I have never met anyone who had a better
grasp of the issues,'' the president said. ''I think she would do a
superb job for the people of New York. I think she would be great
for America.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We are on the brink of consolidating the progress we have made
and building on it,'' the first lady told an audience of supporters
who contributed $250 each to support her out-of-state campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope I will be able to win the trust and confidence of the
people of New York so that together we can help keep our country on
the right track,'' Mrs. Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The president said that when the first lady was preparing to
launch her campaign, ''I practically beat her up time and time
again working on the announcement speech because an election is
like a job interview and it helps to let them know in advance how
you would do.''
</P>
<P>
   The election is important, Clinton said, because it will mean
embracing or rejecting the progress that has been made over the
last eight years.
</P>
<P>
   ''Bill's absolutely right,'' the first lady said. ''This
election, like all elections, is about the future.''
</P>
<P>
   But she said Republicans are trying to breath new life into
economic ideas that long ago proved unworkable.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is stunning that they would go back to where they were,''
she said. ''It is deja vu all over again. If they succeed it will
be bad for New York, bad for Arkansas and bad for America,'' she
told the gathering at Little Rock's convention center.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Serafin, a spokesman for Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's senate
campaign, responded by saying: ''This is classic Clinton double
speak .... Mrs. Clinton attempts to create her record without
mentioning President Clinton and now she's flip flopping and asking
for support because of the president.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons were in Arkansas for the wedding of Stephanie
Streett, an Arkansas native and Clinton's White House scheduler.
</P>
<P>
   Following the Saturday afternoon wedding at a Benedictine
Monastery, the Clintons drove in a four-hour long motorcade through
the Ozark Mountains to spend the night at the home of friends near
Fayetteville.
</P>
<P>
   Diane Blair and her husband Jim are among the Clintons' closest
acquaintances, with a friendship that dates to the early 1970s when
both Clintons taught at the University of Arkansas. Blair left her
teaching post at the university last fall because of terminal
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Clintons' second visit with the Blairs in a month.
</P>
<P>
   Then-Gov. Clinton officiated at the Blairs' 1979 wedding, and
Hillary Clinton served as what Jim Blair described as ''best
person.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Blair was Hillary Clinton's adviser during a nine-month
period in 1978 and 1979, when she turned a $1,000 investment in the
cattle futures market into nearly $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   On the drive to Fayetteville, the president twice stopped his
limousine, once to shake hands with nearly 300 people waiting in a
supermarket parking lot in Ozark, Ark., once to reminisce and tell
stories and to shake still more hands.
</P>
<P>
   At the Turner Bend General Store and Canoe Rental across the
road from a public camping area the president swapped memories of
many previous visits while standing near a shelf filled with
bottles of Tabasco sauce and cans of chili.
</P>
<P>
   ''I used to come in and talk politics with the owner,'' he said.
Then a framed photograph hanging on the wall brought back a memory.
</P>
<P>
   ''Last time I was turkey hunting was in this county, and it was
the hardest thing I've ever done,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just loved being out and calling turkeys and hearing them
sing to you,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons on Monday, along with Vice President Al Gore and
his wife Tipper, travel to New York for the funeral of Cardinal
John O'Connor. The archbishop of New York is considered the most
influential Catholic post in the United States.

<HEADLINE> Indians' Colon Throws Well in Rehab  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- Cleveland Indians starter Bartolo Colon
allowed one run in five innings Sunday in his first rehab start for
Triple-A Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   Colon, who was placed on the disabled list April 17 with a
slight tear in his left rib cage, allowed six hits and struck out
four while throwing 67 pitches -- 50 for strikes -- as Buffalo beat
Richmond 12-5.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was fine,'' Buffalo manager Joel Skinner said. ''We had a
couple of long innings where he had to sit around and wait, and it
didn't create any problems. Everything went smooth. He was
well-prepared for the start. He'd been pitching in Cleveland. He
passed the test up there, came down here and there were no
problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Depending on how Colon feels over the next few days, the Indians
said the 24-year-old right-hander could make his scheduled start
against Kansas City this weekend in Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   His replacement in the rotation, Bobby Witt, gave up six runs
and eight hits in 1 2-3 innings Sunday against Toronto. The Indians
beat the Blue Jays 10-8 in 12 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Colon (2-1) was injured on April 15 in a loss to Texas. He
lasted just 3 1-3 innings, giving up six runs and nine hits, but
didn't tell anyone he was hurt until the following day.
</P>
<P>
   He has allowed eight runs and 17 hits with 13 walks and 18
strikeouts in 14 1-3 innings this season. He went 18-5 last year.

<HEADLINE> Davies Wins Philips LPGA Title  </HEADLINE>
By JIM VERTUNO, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Laura Davies watched the scoreboard and
wondered when she would lose her lead at the Philips Invitational.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, no one made a charge to keep her from another career
milestone.
</P>
<P>
   Davies shot a 2-over-par 72 Sunday but held on for a two-stroke
victory over Dottie Pepper, the 60th win of her international
career and 19th in 12 years on the LPGA Tour. Davies finished with
a 5-under 275 total.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sixty is nice. Hopefully 70 will be even better, but that's a
long way off,'' said Davies, wearing the cowboy hat awarded to the
tournament champion.
</P>
<P>
   The English star won $127,500 for her second victory of the
year. She needs just three more points in the LPGA's scoring system
for automatic qualification to the Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   The second annual tournament, a tribute to former Austin
resident Harvey Penick, drew just a handful of the tour's top
players in 1999 but had most of the top players this year.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the impressive field, Davies played the most
consistent week of golf in windy conditions with low, laser-like
long irons off the tees and a solid short game.
</P>
<P>
   While Davies never pulled her driver out of the bag, only eight
others players were good enough in the wind to finish under par on
the narrow 6,101-yard Onion Creek Club.
</P>
<P>
   ''Two over par doesn't sound like a great score, but conditions
were tough,'' Davies said.
</P>
<P>
   Pepper started the day back in the pack at seven strokes off the
lead and struggled early in falling to two over on the front nine.
</P>
<P>
   ''At that point, I pretty much hated Austin,'' Pepper said.
</P>
<P>
   After closing with three birdies over the final six holes for a
67, she watched from the clubhouse for an hour as her score kept
moving her up the leaderboard.
</P>
<P>
   ''I figured if I played the back nine solid, like I did
yesterday, things can happen,'' Pepper said. ''If you play the back
nine a couple under, you figure you can get into the top 10.''
</P>
<P>
   Davies started the final round with a three-stroke lead over
Susie Redman and Tammie Green before struggles with her putter let
the field stay close on the final day.
</P>
<P>
   After her only birdie on No. 2 got her to eight under, Davies
lipped out a short putt on No. 5 for bogey. She then missed an
excellent birdie chance on No. 10 when she pushed a 9-footer inches
right of the hole.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps still thinking about the missed opportunity, she chunked
an iron on the 164-yard 11th, leaving it three yards short of the
green. After running her chip through the green and two-putting,
she found herself just one shot up when Redman birdied No. 12 to
get to five under.
</P>
<P>
   Davies dropped another shot with a bogey on No. 13 and starting
thinking the worst.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's when the panic buttons went off,'' she said. ''Coming
off the green, I said 'I don't think we're going to win it.' I'm a
big leaderboard watcher from day one. I figured someone was going
to make a move.''
</P>
<P>
   But even when Davies struggled, none of the day's early leaders
mustered a challenge down the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   Redman, playing in the group ahead of Davies and without a
victory in 15 years on tour, couldn't make the move to tie.
</P>
<P>
   After finding the sand on No. 13, she missed a 6-footer for par.
Even as Davies was dropping another stroke, Redman followed with
another miss of a short par putt on 14 before eventually finishing
with a 72. She tied for third at 278 with Moira Dunn, who had a 66,
and Alison Nicholas of England, who had a 70.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was probably nervous. I know I didn't hit things very solid
down the stretch,'' Redman said.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Davies bogeyed twice on the final nine, she was
still two strokes up with four holes left. She needed a little luck
to close it out when her tee shot on No. 16 went left and hit a
tree only to bounce back into the middle of the fairway.
</P>
<P>
   She escaped with par and avoided any danger on the last two
holes to claim the victory.
</P>
<P>
   Green, who almost withdrew from the tournament on Friday with a
stomach virus, twice closed within two shots of the lead on the
front nine, but three bogeys in a four-hole span dropped her out of
contention. She finished with a 75 and was tied for 16th.
</P>
<P>
   Penick, who died in 1995, was considered one of golf's greatest
instructors. His pupils included two-time Masters champion Ben
Crenshaw; U.S. Open winner Tom Kite; Kathy Whitworth, winner of 88
tournaments; Mickey Wright; and Betsy Rawls.

<HEADLINE> Canada Routs Italy in Hockey  </HEADLINE>
By ERICA BULMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia (AP) -- Sean Haggerty's late goal pulled
the United States into a 1-1 tie with surprising Latvia at the
World Hockey Championships on Sunday, keeping intact the Americans'
unbeaten streak.
</P>
<P>
   In other matches, Finland and Canada solidified their chances of
advancing to the final eight, the Finns defeating reigning Olympic
and world champion Czech Republic 6-4 and the Canadians blanking
Italy 6-0.
</P>
<P>
   Russia, meanwhile, continued to self-destruct in front of its
furious home fans, losing 1-0 to the former Soviet republic Belarus
for its fourth straight defeat.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans had already locked up their place in the
quarterfinals and took the lead atop the Group E standings with six
points after a 3-3 tie with Switzerland, a 3-0 victory over Russia,
a 3-2 win over France and a 3-2 victory over Belarus, as well as
their tie with Latvia.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're still undefeated and we've played very good hockey,''
said the Calgary Flames' Phil Housley, the NHL's all-time American
scoring leader.
</P>
<P>
   Latvia stunned their rivals and fans alike, jumping to a 1-0
lead just 6:33 into the game. Aleksandrs Kercs made a perfect pass
from the American net to Rodrigo Lavins, who fired a slap shot from
the blue line through heavy traffic in front of the crease and past
American goalie Robert Esche.
</P>
<P>
   The small Baltic nation kept the Americans scoreless until
midway through the final period, when Haggerty rushed the Latvian
net, scoring as he crashed into the prone Arturs Irbe.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans will now face 1998 champion Sweden in a fight for
the top spot in the group.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've got our hands full with Sweden,'' Housley said. ''It's
going to be one of the toughest teams we're going to face.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest loss leaves Russia stranded at the bottom of its
group table. Its medal hopes had already been snuffed out Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   It marked the first time either Russia or the Soviet Union
failed to make the quarterfinals since its first world
championships in 1954.
</P>
<P>
   Russia was heavily favored at the beginning of the competition,
because it boasted an impressive all-star cast of NHLers that
included the Florida Panthers' Pavel Bure, Ottawa Senators holdout
Alexei Yashin and the Chicago Blackhawks' Alexei Zhamnov.
</P>
<P>
   But it was a goal by Buffalo Sabres forward Vladimir Tsyplakov
that gave Belarus the win. Tsyplakov deflected Aleksei Kalyuzhny's
long shot into the net.
</P>
<P>
   Finland's chances of advancing were greatly enhanced when the
Montreal Canadiens' Juha Lind scored the tying goal.
</P>
<P>
   Goals by Frantisek Kaberle and the Ottawa Senators' Vaclav
Prospal gave the Czechs a 2-0 lead. After Petteri Nummelin's goal
at 17:44 narrowed the gap to 2-1, the teams traded power-play goals
early in the second period. Nummelin scored his second at 2:26 and
Michal Sykora answered at 4:45. Jyrki Lumme of the Phoenix Coyotes
knotted the score again less than four minutes later.
</P>
<P>
   In the third period, Czech Jiri Dopita scored before Finland
tallied three successive goals within six minutes to clinch the
victory.
</P>
<P>
   The Florida Panthers' Mike Sillinger scored and Montreal
Canadiens goalie Jose Theodore shut out Italy, restoring Canada's
hopes for a quarterfinal berth.
</P>
<P>
   The Vancouver Canucks' Peter Schaefer opened the scoring with a
wraparound goal at 3:37, while Sillinger added the second for
Canada at 8:59, knocking in a rebound. Vancouver's Mike Johnson
gave Canada a 3-0 lead at 4:28 of the second.
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago Blackhawks' Steve Sullivan and Vancouver Canucks'
Adrian Aucoin each scored power-play goals in the second, while
Sillinger ended the scoring with another power-play goal with 2:01
left in the game.
</P>
<P>
   It was Theodore's second shutout of the tournament.

<HEADLINE> Mercosur Aiming To One Currency  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- Brazil's president said Sunday
that Mercosur -- South America's largest trade bloc -- is heading
toward the adoption of a euro-style single currency.
</P>
<P>
   Fernando Henrique Cardoso made his remarks in a speech during
the formal opening of Mercosur Economic Summit, an annual event
sponsored by the World Economic Forum.
</P>
<P>
   He said Mercosur was advancing toward ''macroeconomic
convergence ... (leading) to a monetary union, which we would like
to see implemented in the medium term.''
</P>
<P>
   Created in 1991, Mercosur is a customs union comprising
Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay as full members and Bolivia
and Chile as associates. Today, it represents a market with a
combined gross domestic product of more than $1 trillion and a
consumer market made up of the region's 200 million people.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 100 business and political leaders converged on this city
to attend the summit which will focus on Latin America's economic
integration and competitiveness on the world market.
</P>
<P>
   Cardoso told those assembled that before a single currency could
become reality, the countries of the region would need to enact
fiscal policies ''that guarantee the solvency of our accounts and
monetary policies that guarantee price stability.''
</P>
<P>
   Mercosur and other regional blocs like the Andean Community were
stepping stones for the eventual formation of the U.S.-sponsored
Free Trade Area of the Americas, Cardoso said.
</P>
<P>
   He also said Mercosur would continue negotiating with the
European Union for the creation of a trans-Atlantic free trade
zone.
</P>
<P>
   The summit will also focus on the region's competitiveness and
ways to strengthen it through greater investment in education,
infrastructure and technology.
</P>
<P>
   Other topics on the agenda include the environment,
business-to-business commerce via the Internet and biotechnology.

<HEADLINE> Mercosur Said Aiming To 1 Currency  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- Brazil's president said Sunday
that Mercosur -- South America's largest trade bloc -- is heading
toward the adoption of a euro-style single currency.
</P>
<P>
   Fernando Henrique Cardoso made his remarks in a speech during
the formal opening of Mercosur Economic Summit, an annual event
sponsored by the World Economic Forum.
</P>
<P>
   He said Mercosur was advancing toward ''macroeconomic
convergence ... (leading) to a monetary union, which we would like
to see implemented in the medium term.''
</P>
<P>
   Created in 1991, Mercosur is a customs union comprising
Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay as full members and Bolivia
and Chile as associates. Today, it represents a market with a
combined gross domestic product of more than $1 trillion and a
consumer market made up of the region's 200 million people.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 100 business and political leaders converged on this city
to attend the summit which will focus on Latin America's economic
integration and competitiveness on the world market.
</P>
<P>
   Cardoso told those assembled that before a single currency could
become reality, the countries of the region would need to enact
fiscal policies ''that guarantee the solvency of our accounts and
monetary policies that guarantee price stability.''
</P>
<P>
   Mercosur and other regional blocs like the Andean Community were
stepping stones for the eventual formation of the U.S.-sponsored
Free Trade Area of the Americas, Cardoso said.
</P>
<P>
   He also said Mercosur would continue negotiating with the
European Union for the creation of a trans-Atlantic free trade
zone.
</P>
<P>
   The summit will also focus on the region's competitiveness and
ways to strengthen it through greater investment in education,
infrastructure and technology.
</P>
<P>
   Other topics on the agenda include the environment,
business-to-business commerce via the Internet and biotechnology.

<HEADLINE> Venezuelan Election Heads Want Peace  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Hoping to stem a series of violent
campaign-related confrontations, election officials on Sunday
called on Venezuela's political parties to commit themselves to
peaceful campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   The National Election Council, which has come under fire for
being partial to President Hugo Chavez' political coalition, has
invited 22 political organizations to meet this week to discuss a
''pact of nonaggression.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The goal is to guarantee Venezuelans that this process will
develop through totally peaceful means and will culminate with a
great celebration of Venezuelan democracy,'' the council's
president, Etanislao Gonzalez, said.
</P>
<P>
   The council's call for a meeting follows a Carter Center report
on Venezuela warning of a ''campaign climate of harsh personal
attacks.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Chavez' main rival, Francisco Arias Cardenas, was
forced to suspend campaign activities in a poor neighborhood after
the president's supporters threw bricks, vegetables and trash at
him. The next day, the campaign car of an opposition mayoral
candidate was vandalized.
</P>
<P>
   Arias Cardenas, a former military officer who helped Chavez
stage his failed 1992 coup, accused the president of paying off
those who attacked him last week.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez denied the charge and urged his followers over the
weekend to leave his rival in peace because ''indifference hurts
more than a rock.''
</P>
<P>
   Venezuela's new constitution pushed through by Chavez last year
requires voters to ''re-legitimize'' all public offices on May 28.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez leads Arias Cardenas by more than 20 points in most
polls, despite soaring unemployment and crime rates and recent
ruptures within the Venezuelan leader's political coalition.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Higher  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar was higher against the yen early Monday
amid expectations for higher interest rates in the United States.
Tokyo stocks edged up.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar bought 108.86 yen, up 0.38 yen from late Tuesday in
Tokyo and also above its New York level of 108.34 yen on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Financial markets in Tokyo were closed last Wednesday through
Friday for national holidays.
</P>
<P>
   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 5.29 points,
or 0.03 percent, to 18,444.65 in the first one hour of trading. On
Tuesday, the average closed up 36.28 points, or 0.19 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In currency dealings, the dollar strengthened against the yen
after strong U.S. economic data, released Friday, raised the
possibility of a U.S. interest rate hike when the Federal Reserve
meets May 16.
</P>
<P>
   The Labor Department said on Friday that the U.S. jobless rate
fell to a 30-year low of 3.9 percent in April, fanning speculation
that the Fed will raise rates by as much as one-half percentage
point to contain a resurgence of inflationary pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Higher interest rates tend to boost a nation's currency.
</P>
<P>
   In other currencies, the euro was traded at 98.19 yen, down from
98.82 yen late Tuesday in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   On the stock market, the Nikkei index started slightly higher on
the back of gains on Wall Street on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   But trading remained light in the absence of major market-moving
news.
</P>
<P>
   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was up 10.64 points, or 0.62 percent, to 1,713.22.
The TOPIX closed up 7.35 points, or 0.43 percent, on Tuesday.

   In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 165.37 points
to 10,577.86 at Friday's close. The Nasdaq composite index closed
at 3,816.82, up 96.58 on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond was
unquoted in early trading. On Tuesday, it settled at 1.7300 percent
and its price stood at 100.60.

<HEADLINE> Suns' Mistakes Let Lakers Breeze  </HEADLINE>
By KEN PETERS, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Too many TOs.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix's Luc Longley passed the ball right into the hands of
the Lakers' Kobe Bryant. The Suns' Rodney Rogers threw the ball
away. Bryant and Ron Harper stole bad passes.
</P>
<P>
   For good measure, the Suns' Corie Blount then inbounded the ball
to the Lakers' Shaquille O'Neal right under the Los Angeles basket.
</P>
<P>
   All those Suns' turnovers came in a span of just more than two
minutes midway through the third quarter as the Lakers built their
lead to double digits and took control for good.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's final score was Lakers 105, Suns 77. The difference in
points off turnovers accounted for 24 points of the Lakers' winning
margin. Los Angeles cashed in 23 turnovers for 28 points to four
points for Phoenix off the Lakers' 12 turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   ''They scored 28 points off our turnovers. We scored four off
theirs. There's the game right there,'' Phoenix coach Scott Skiles
said after the Suns' lopsided loss in Game 1 of the Western
Conference semifinal series.
</P>
<P>
   Skiles said the poor ball-handling wasn't unusual.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's been one of our weaknesses all year long. We haven't
handled the ball well on the break and just handling and passing
the ball from point A to point B is one of our weaknesses,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the bad passes were not caused by the Lakers' defense,
but were simply wild throws, several of which sailed off the court
and into the courtside seats.
</P>
<P>
   ''We ran into a buzzsaw,'' said the Suns' Penny Hardaway, who
scored 25 points and had four turnovers. ''We just have to go back
to the drawing board. The majority of it was us, unforced
turnovers, just passing a bounce pass to somebody and somebody
(Lakers defender) stepping into the lane.''
</P>
<P>
   Hardaway did say the Lakers forced the Suns to make an extra
pass many times.
</P>
<P>
   ''You have to credit their defense with our over-passing,'' he
said. ''I think you have to pick and choose the times you want to
make (interior passes), and we didn't do a good job of that, thus
so many turnovers.''
</P>
<P>
   Jason Kidd, playing just his second game after returning from a
broken ankle that had sidelined him since March 22, looked rusty,
committing five turnovers and scoring only three points on 1-of-6
shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Kidd said he hurt his ankle a little the first time he shot a
layup against the Lakers, but that it was nothing serious and
didn't expect it to be a factor in Game 2 on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was just favoring it a little bit,'' he said. ''But I think
realizing that I can push off it will help my confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   The Suns had just five more field goals -- 28 -- than turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   ''We didn't get the shots at the basket because of the turnovers
and when you're playing the best team in the league, you can't
afford to do that,'' Kidd said. ''Obviously, that's something we
have to improve in the second game.''

<HEADLINE> Australia Restores Ties With NKorea  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) -- Australia has restored diplomatic
ties with North Korea, 25 years after they were suspended in
circumstances which were never fully explained, officials said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer
confirmed the resumption of ties after North Korean radio reported
that relations between the two countries had resumed at the
ambassadorial level as of Monday.
</P>
<P>
   But Australia would not immediately post an ambassador to the
North Korean capital of Pyongyang, instead accrediting Australia's
ambassador in Beijing to North Korea, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate announcement Monday, Australian Prime Minister
John Howard said he would visit South Korea from May 19-21 for
talks.
</P>
<P>
   Australia and North Korea set up diplomatic ties on July 31,
1974, but cut them on Nov. 8, 1975.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, North Korea's embassy in the Australian capital of
Canberra was abandoned in the wake of a serious car accident in
which a number of North Korean embassy staff were injured.
</P>
<P>
   Australia became the second nation this year to normalize ties
with Pyongyang after Italy established relations with the reclusive
communist country in January.
</P>
<P>
   Japan and the United States have also been in talks aimed at
normalizing diplomatic ties with North Korea, but no accords have
been reached.

Serious Crime Decline Continues
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Serious crimes reported to the police dropped for an
eighth consecutive year in 1999, down 7 percent from the year before and by far
the longest-running crime decline on record, the FBI reported today. The FBI
report showed that all seven major types of crime were down not only nationwide,
but also in each region of the nation, and in suburbs, rural areas and in cities
of all sizes. The violent crimes of murder, rape, robbery and aggravated assault
were down a combined 7 percent, led by murder and robbery, each down 8 percent.

transferred in the most democratic and simple way, by the will of the people --
legally and peacefully,'' Putin said. Moving swiftly to tackle the ailing
economy, the country's biggest problem, Putin's first act was to name economics
specialist Mikhail Kasyanov as prime minister. Kasyanov is a well-regarded
moderate who backs market reforms.

surrender. But the kind of disarmament now being offered would not require the
IRA to hand over weapons publicly, only to identify the locations of its secret
stockpiles. The two governments also said they would extend the deadline for
total IRA disarmament from this May 22 to June 2001.

<HEADLINE> Protestants Urged To Take IRA Offer  </HEADLINE>
By SHAWN POGATCHNIK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- The Irish Republican Army's
decision to put its weaponry ''beyond use'' drew praise from Sinn
Fein's chief negotiator Sunday and stepped up pressure on Northern
Ireland's main Protestant party to accept the IRA pledge.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are moving forward, hopefully to new times, and there is a
real opportunity now for politicians -- unionist, loyalist,
nationalist and republican -- to build a new future for all our
people,'' said Martin McGuinness, deputy leader of the IRA-allied
Sinn Fein Party and its chief negotiator. ''I think we are going to
get there.''
</P>
<P>
   McGuinness said the IRA leadership had made a huge step forward
to end the disarmament deadlock.
</P>
<P>
   The IRA has always rejected disarmament as equivalent to
surrender. But the kind of disarmament now being offered would not
require the IRA to hand over weapons publicly, only to identify the
locations of its secret stockpiles.
</P>
<P>
   Although many details of the fate of the arms dumps still have
to be worked out, Ulster Unionist Party leader David Trimble gave a
cautious welcome to the IRA's pledge Saturday to reveal their
locations to two international inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would caution people against throwing their caps up in the
air,'' said Trimble, who is the senior minister in Northern
Ireland's suspended Protestant-Catholic administration. ''We want
to be sure that this is a process, not just a token gesture.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ulster Unionists asked to meet soon with Cyril Ramaphosa,
the former African National Congress chairman from South Africa,
and Martti Ahtisaari, Finland's recently retired president, who are
to inspect the IRA weapons stockpiles.
</P>
<P>
   Trimble agreed late last year to form the power-sharing Cabinet
alongside Sinn Fein, but when he threatened to withdraw over the
IRA's failure to make disarmament commitments, Britain suspended
the administration and resumed direct rule in February.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Mandelson, Britain's Northern Ireland secretary, told the
British Broadcasting Corp. on Sunday that the two sides need to
seize the moment.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we let it slip from our grasp, I don't think that we will
very easily again reproduce those conditions for peace in Northern
Ireland,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Tony Blair, in an interview published in The
Times of London on Monday, also welcomed the IRA's offer as ''a big
step forward'' but warned that dissident groups may use violence to
upset the new atmosphere of peace.
</P>
<P>
   ''Let us mark it carefully because we have been in a situation
before where potentially big breakthroughs do not yield results,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   After months of effort and long hours of talks aimed at getting
the process back on track, Britain and Ireland on Friday announced
that they wanted to transfer powers back to the suspended
administration May 22.
</P>
<P>
   The two governments also said they would extend the deadline for
total IRA disarmament from this May 22 to June 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The IRA decision to reveal its weapons stockpiles came quickly.
The outlawed group said its new commitment should reassure
Protestants that the IRA cease-fire of 1997 is designed to last
forever.
</P>
<P>
   Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern urged all sides to accept the
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ''Is it not better to try to make this work, with all the
discussions that we need to have around it, rather than the
negative politics of the past with the risk of all the mayhem of
the past?'' he said.

<HEADLINE> 10 Killed In Miss; Wis. Crashes  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSS POINT, Miss. (AP) -- A chain reaction of collisions
involving 16 cars, two tour buses and two 18-wheelers left at least
five people dead, authorities said. Heavy fog and smoke from a
forest fire reduced visibility and was believed to have been a
factor in the wreck early Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   In Wisconsin, a car carrying four teen-agers on a prom-night
outing collided with another vehicle early Sunday and both vehicles
burst into flames, killing the teens and the one person inside the
other vehicle, authorities said. The accident happened near
Neillsville in the central part of the state.
</P>
<P>
   Troopers said the Mississippi accident happened just after 5
a.m. on Interstate 10 near the Alabama state line. Fifty to 70
people were involved, said Master Sgt. David Kenny of the state
Highway Patrol. More than two dozen people were taken to area
hospitals. The majority were treated and released.
</P>
<P>
   Killed in the accident were Charles P. Bryan, 56 and Robert
Shular, 63, both of Sevierville, Tenn.; James Leon Ramer, 41, of
Theodore, Ala.; and Clyde E. Kelley, 63, and his wife, Dianne
Kelley, 52, both of Needham, Ala.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities were still trying to determine what caused the
accident, but they believe a heavy fog was part of the reason, as
well as thick smoke from a forest fire during the night.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was one accident and then bam, bam, bam all the way down
the line,'' Scottie McCarroll of Citronelle, Ala., said. ''You
could hear other traffic coming very fast and hitting on breaks and
hitting each other and crashing and screaming and all kind of
sounds and you couldn't do anything.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the two tour buses involved in the accident was carrying
a group of Spanish speaking laborers from Texas to North Carolina.
Another bus, operated by Preferred Charters, was heading from Texas
and carrying a rhythm and blues band to Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty ambulances from five different companies carried injured
drivers and passengers to Singing River Hospital in Pascagoula and
Knollwood Hospital in Mobile, Ala.

<HEADLINE> One Hurt In Dominican Party Clash  </HEADLINE>
By JOSE P. MONEGRO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) -- At least one person was
injured when supporters of two rival Dominican political parties
clashed Sunday, their opposition galvanized by a violent incident
at a rally last week that left two dead.
</P>
<P>
   Liberation Party official Euclides Sanchez said three people,
all followers of his party, were injured.
</P>
<P>
   Groups representing the Dominican Revolutionary Party and
Dominican Liberation Party encountered each other in La Vega, about
70 miles north of Santo Domingo, and began fighting, local police
said. Police confirmed that one man was shot in the arm and back,
but did not know his affiliation.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign for the May 16 presidential elections took a tense
turn when violence broke out at an April 29 rally for front-runner
Hipolito Mejia of the Revolutionary Party. Two members of the
governing Liberation Party were shot and killed as Mejia's caravan
passed Moca, 90 miles from Santo Domingo.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolutionary Party said Mejia's bodyguards fired when
someone shot at the candidate's car. The Liberation Party said the
members of the opposition party shot first. Police last week
arrested seven members of Mejia's party.

<HEADLINE> Rare Japanese Bird Gets Sibling  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- A rare crested ibis emerged from its shell Monday
morning, the second to be domestically bred amid hopes of reviving
the species in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   The bird hatched from one of three eggs laid by Yang-Yang, a
crested ibis presented by Chinese President Jiang Zemin two years
ago, said Michio Horii, an environmental official in Niigata state.
</P>
<P>
   The egg, laid early last month, was hatched in an artificial
incubator at the Sado Crested Ibis Conservation Center on remote
Sado Island, 180 miles northwest of Tokyo. Sado is part of Niigata.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at the center heard the bird tapping at its shell
late Saturday night and by Sunday morning a crack was visible.
</P>
<P>
   Of the three eggs laid between April 9 and April 13, two were
fertile. Researchers at the center said the other fertile egg
continued to show signs of hatching.
</P>
<P>
   The graceful bird, once a favorite subject of Japanese painters,
was a common site here until hunting, development and fertilizers
destroyed its habitat.
</P>
<P>
   A crested ibis hatched at the center in April of last year,
becoming the first to be successfully reproduced in Japan.

<HEADLINE> Stars 4, Sharks 1  </HEADLINE>
By JAIME ARON, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS (AP) -- The Dallas Stars are going into the Western
Conference finals on quite a roll.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Nieuwendyk got the Stars started and Dallas got power-play
goals 41 seconds apart in the third period to beat San Jose 4-1
Sunday night, eliminating the Sharks in five games.
</P>
<P>
   The Stanley Cup champions advanced to a rematch of last year's
Western Conference finals against the Colorado Avalanche. The first
two games will be in Dallas; the league is expected to release a
schedule Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars have won their last eight postseason games in Reunion
Arena, with Ed Belfour posting shutouts in four of them. He came
within 11:28 of a fifth, instead settling for a home scoreless
streak of 187 minutes, 25 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas, playing in its third straight conference finals, has a
knack for closing out playoff series. This was the sixth straight
time the Stars eliminated a team on their first chance.
</P>
<P>
   San Jose -- which played without Owen Nolan, its leading scorer,
or Bryan Marchment, its most physical defenseman -- wasn't able to
defend like it did in a 2-1 victory in Game 3. And it wasn't able
to force the high tempo of Dallas' 5-4 victory in Game 4.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars jumped ahead midway through the first period when
Nieuwendyk made a nice move in front of the net to beat goalie
Steve Shields. Three minutes later, Scott Thornton sneaked up from
behind the net and scooped in a shot, and Dallas was clearly in
control.
</P>
<P>
   At least Belfour was. He maintained the lead by knocking away a
great scoring chance by Vincent Damphousse in the closing seconds
of the first period. Belfour made several nice stops on a
second-period power play, and minutes later stopped a shot from
Jeff Friesen while sprawled on his side. He made another stop from
his stomach in the third period.
</P>
<P>
   San Jose's frustration began to show early in the final period
when penalties for tripping and slashing within 1:18 gave Dallas a
5-on-3 advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Shields made two nice stops on one flurry, then turned away a
blast from Brett Hull. But Hull got to his own rebound and fired
again. The puck went off Shields and put the Stars up 3-0 with
15:58 left.
</P>
<P>
   Sylvain Cote followed with his first goal of the postseason on a
shot from the right point with 15:17 to play. The Sharks still had
a man in the penalty box and another player was skating without his
stick, making it virtually another 5-on-3.
</P>
<P>
   With fans chanting ''The cup stays here,'' the only drama left
was whether Belfour would keep the Sharks scoreless in three games
at Reunion.
</P>
<P>
   That hope ended when Patrick Marleau squeezed the puck by
Belfour during a power play. It was his first goal of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Belfour finished with 32 saves; Shields made 26.
</P>
<P>
   Belfour has been outstanding this postseason, as has Dallas team
leader Mike Modano. Their play kept the heat off Nieuwendyk as he
struggled to get into the flow.
</P>
<P>
   He's been skating noticeably better the last few games and broke
through with two goals in Game 4, including the winner.
</P>
<P>
   His goal Sunday night was a perfect example of the extra jump
Nieuwendyk appears to have. He took the puck at center ice, shook
off a hit by Mike Rathje and sped across the mouth of the goal
while being chased by Marcus Ragnarsson. Nieuwendyk got Shields to
commit too soon, then backhanded the puck into the net.
</P>
<P>
   Shields' boom-or-bust goaltending was the bottom line of San
Jose's postseason. He allowed 27 goals in the seven losses and
seven goals in the five victories.
</P>
<P>
   The Sharks will remember this postseason for their first-round
victory over top-seeded St. Louis. It was the fifth time a No. 8
seed had reached the second round, but none have advanced beyond.

<HEADLINE> Ga. Stalin Monument Back On Display  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TBILISI, Georgia (AP) -- A small town in Georgia put a monument
to the late Soviet dictator Josef Stalin back on display Sunday
after the sculpture spent 40 years in a warehouse.
</P>
<P>
   The unveiling of the statue was meant to coincide with the May 9
Victory Day holiday, the anniversary of the Soviet army's defeat of
Nazi Germany in 1945, said Georgian Communist Party leader
Panteleimon Georgadze.
</P>
<P>
   The statue of Stalin in the town of Khashuri, 60 miles west of
Tbilisi, had been removed after a decree by then Soviet leader
Nikita Khrushchev. Khrushchev denounced Stalin's purges in the
1930s that killed or imprisoned millions of people and demanded
monuments to the dictator be torn down.
</P>
<P>
   Stalin, whose real last name was Dzhugashvili, hailed from the
Georgian village of Gori, and still has a following among die-hard
communists across the former Soviet Union. He led the Soviet Union
from 1924 to his death in 1953.

<HEADLINE> Report: Blair To Come Back Fighting  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Prime Minister Tony Blair vowed to ''come out
fighting'' following the Labor party's dismal showing in last
week's local government elections in England and Wales, The Times
newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In elections for more than 3,300 seats on 152 local councils --
polls seen as a referendum on Blair's 3-year-old government -- the
Conservatives gained 593 seats, while Labor lost 568.
</P>
<P>
   Blair said he refused to allow the results to deflect him from
his ''mission'' to change Britain.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is not unknown for governments in midterm to do badly in
local elections. I do, of course, take the results seriously. The
most important thing is for the government, and me personally, to
come out fighting for what we believe in,'' Blair said in an
exclusive interview with The Times.
</P>
<P>
   Blair promised to continue focusing on traditional Labor goals
such as full employment, reduced poverty and a strong public
service.
</P>
<P>
   The prime minister dismissed speculation that London's newly
elected mayor, Ken Livingstone, would be allowed a quick return to
the Labor party.
</P>
<P>
   Livingstone was expelled for five years after he entered the
race as an independent candidate, and Blair said it would be a long
time before he would even consider shortening that term.
</P>
<P>
   He said an election, widely expected to be held early next year,
may be delayed because he had not yet given thought to its timing.
Blair remains the favorite to win the next election, though not on
the massive scale of Labor's 1997 victory.

<HEADLINE> Ibarra Leads Buenos Aires Race  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) -- A candidate from the ruling
Alliance party of President Fernando de la Rua was headed for a win
in the first round of elections to choose the mayor of Buenos
Aires, preliminary voting showed Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   With 37 percent of the vote counted, Anibal Ibarra, a
42-year-old former federal prosecutor, led with 49 percent of the
ballot to 33 percent for Domingo Cavallo, a former economic
minister under President Carlos Menem.
</P>
<P>
   A victory garnering more than 50 percent of the vote is needed
to claim an outright majority and to avoid a runoff. Official
returns were expected Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's vote was widely perceived to be a referendum on the
five-month old presidency of De la Rua, who assumed office Dec. 10.
Ibarra was believed to have benefitted from a strong anti-Cavallo
sentiment among voters.
</P>
<P>
   Before taking office, De la Rua was the first elected mayor of
Buenos Aires, a position previously named by the federal
government. Buenos Aires is considered a political stronghold for
De la Rua and his center-left Alliance party.
</P>
<P>
   Voters on Sunday also cast ballots for 60 seats on the city
council, where the Alliance was expected to retain a majority of
the seats.
</P>
<P>
   The election for mayor appeared to deal another devastating blow
to Menem's Peronist party. With support from one of Argentina's
most powerful parties spread among three candidates, the leading
Peronist candidate, Raul Granillo Ocampo, mustered just one percent
of the vote, according to initial ballot returns.
</P>
<P>
   Of the remaining candidates for mayor, seven were from smaller
leftists parties and three from lesser-known rightist parties.

<HEADLINE> Clinton's Raise Campaign Money  </HEADLINE>
By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Home in Arkansas, Bill and Hillary
Rodham Clinton raised $100,000 on Sunday for the first lady's
campaign for a U.S. Senate seat from New York.
</P>
<P>
   ''In my whole life I have never met anyone who had a better
grasp of the issues,'' the president said. ''I think she would do a
superb job for the people of New York. I think she would be great
for America.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We are on the brink of consolidating the progress we have made
and building on it,'' the first lady told an audience of supporters
who contributed $250 each to support her out-of-state campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope I will be able to win the trust and confidence of the
people of New York so that together we can help keep our country on
the right track,'' Mrs. Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The president said that when the first lady was preparing to
launch her campaign, ''I practically beat her up time and time
again working on the announcement speech because an election is
like a job interview and it helps to let them know in advance how
you would do.''
</P>
<P>
   The election is important, Clinton said, because it will mean
embracing or rejecting the progress that has been made over the
last eight years.
</P>
<P>
   ''Bill's absolutely right,'' the first lady said. ''This
election, like all elections, is about the future.''
</P>
<P>
   But she said Republicans are trying to breath new life into
economic ideas that long ago proved unworkable.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is stunning that they would go back to where they were,''
she said. ''It is deja vu all over again. If they succeed it will
be bad for New York, bad for Arkansas and bad for America,'' she
told the gathering at Little Rock's convention center.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons were in Arkansas for the wedding of Stephanie
Streett, an Arkansas native and Clinton's White House scheduler.
</P>
<P>
   Following the Saturday afternoon wedding at a Benedictine
Monastery, the Clintons drove in a four-hour long motorcade through
the Ozark Mountains to spend the night at the home of friends near
Fayetteville.
</P>
<P>
   Diane Blair and her husband Jim are among the Clintons' closest
acquaintances, with a friendship that dates to the early 1970s when
both Clintons taught at the University of Arkansas. Blair left her
teaching post at the university last fall because of terminal
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Clintons' second visit with the Blairs in a month.
</P>
<P>
   Then-Gov. Clinton officiated at the Blairs' 1979 wedding, and
Hillary Clinton served as what Jim Blair described as ''best
person.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Blair was Hillary Clinton's adviser during a nine-month
period in 1978 and 1979, when she turned a $1,000 investment in the
cattle futures market into nearly $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   On the drive to Fayetteville, the president twice stopped his
limousine, once to shake hands with nearly 300 people waiting in a
supermarket parking lot in Ozark, Ark., once to reminisce and tell
stories and to shake still more hands.
</P>
<P>
   At the Turner Bend General Store and Canoe Rental across the
road from a public camping area the president swapped memories of
many previous visits while standing near a shelf filled with
bottles of Tabasco sauce and cans of chili.
</P>
<P>
   ''I used to come in and talk politics with the owner,'' he said.
Then a framed photograph hanging on the wall brought back a memory.
</P>
<P>
   ''Last time I was turkey hunting was in this county, and it was
the hardest thing I've ever done,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just loved being out and calling turkeys and hearing them
sing to you,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons on Monday, along with Vice President Al Gore and
his wife Tipper, travel to New York for the funeral of Cardinal
John O'Connor. The archbishop of New York is considered the most
influential Catholic post in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to reporters Sunday evening on Air Force One during the
flight back to Washington, Clinton said he and O'Connor sometimes
disagreed but he admired the cardinal, especially for his career as
a Navy chaplain.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought he was a very strong guy. He had very strong
convictions,'' the president said.

Report: Serious Crime Decline Continues
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The FBI reported today that serious crime reported to the
police dropped for an eighth consecutive year in 1999, by far the
longest-running crime decline on record. The nation's longest and steepest crime
rise -- increases of 10.2 percent to 13.8 percent from 1965 through 1969 -- came
as postwar baby boomers reached the crime-prone ages of 15 to 25 and ''civil
rights and Vietnam war protests increased distrust of government,'' officials
said. The violent crimes of murder, rape, robbery and aggravated assault were
down a combined 7 percent, led by murder and robbery, each down 8 percent.

   MOSCOW (AP) -- New Russian President Vladimmir Putin pledged to build
democracy in his vast country and to tackle the nation's economy in his
inaugural speech today. With his predecessor, Boris Yeltsin, standing stiffly at
his side, the 47-year-old Putin said after taking the presidential oath at the
Kremlin that his main task was to save Russia after years of decline. Many
Russians hope that the former KGB officer will end years of economic and social
chaos, boost incomes and living standards, root out entrenched corruption and
restore political stability after the turbulent Yeltsin era.

<HEADLINE> Charges pending in crash that killed Hammonton doctor  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MONROE, N.J. (AP) -- Charges are pending in an automobile crash
that killed a Hammonton doctor and critically injured his wife
Sunday, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Howard L. Kent, 69, was killed when his Mercury Sable was struck
by a GMC Jimmy driven by John Williams, 20, of Camden, Gloucester
County Prosecutor Andrew N. Yurick said.
</P>
<P>
   Williams' vehicle crossed the center line of Route 322 about a
half-mile west of Fries Mill Road and struck Kent's car.
</P>
<P>
   Kent's wife, Margaret, 64, was in critical condition at Cooper
Medical Center in Camden.
</P>
<P>
   Their daughter, Lisanne Kent, 37, also was hurt in the crash but
her condition could not be determined Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Williams underwent surgery on his ankle Sunday at Cooper Medical
Center. A passenger in his car, Raymond Cooper, 21, of
Sicklerville, was treated at J.F.K. Hospital in Washington Township
for injuries he sustained in the crash, and later released.
</P>
<P>
   The crash remains under investigation by the prosecutor's office
Vehicular Homicide and Serious Injury Unit.

<HEADLINE> Man To Plead No Contest to NM Slay  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARLSBAD, N.M. (AP) -- A Massachusetts man is expected to plead
no contest to charges he stabbed his best friend to death in the
arid back country of Carlsbad Caverns National Park last summer.
</P>
<P>
   In a plea agreement with prosecutors, Raffi Kodikian will enter
the plea Monday to a reduced charge of second-degree murder and
then testify about what he has called a mercy killing during a
sentencing hearing, said attorney Gary Mitchell. He had been
charged with first-degree murder.
</P>
<P>
   Kodikian, 25, has told investigators David Coughlin pleaded with
him to end his pain after the two got lost and ran out of water
while camping in the park. Kodikian said they believed they would
die.
</P>
<P>
   He faces up to 15 years in prison. But his plea will be given
with the condition that he has the right to appeal an earlier
ruling that barred a dehydration-dementia defense of temporary
insanity, Mitchell said.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence will be presented by both sides, expert witnesses will
testify about dehydration, and Kodikian will take the witness stand
himself, the attorney said.
</P>
<P>
   Kodikian, of Boston, had been traveling with Coughlin, 26, of
Millis, Mass., to California, where Coughlin had planned to begin
graduate studies at U.C. Santa Barbara.
</P>
<P>
   ''The boys were the best of friends, never meant any harm to
anybody, including themselves,'' Mitchell said. ''They get lost,
have no water for three days, are severely dehydrated, both in
extreme agony, and both attempt suicide.
</P>
<P>
   ''David pleads with Raffi to end his life, and Raffi -- in what
most people call a mercy killing -- does as his best friend
wishes,'' Mitchell said.
</P>
<P>
   An Aug. 8 journal entry by Kodikian details Coughlin's death:
''I killed and buried my friend today. ... David had been in pain
all night. At around 5 or 6 (a.m.) he turned to me &AMP; begged that I
put a knife in his chest. I did, &AMP; a second time when he wouldn't
die.''
</P>
<P>
   Park personnel rescued Kodikian about six hours after Coughlin
died.
</P>
<P>
   ''If they'd been there six hours earlier, we wouldn't be here
today,'' Mitchell said.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell said he will ask District Judge Jay Forbes for
leniency, suggesting Kodikian could perform community service by
appearing before groups to tell his story as a warning for desert
campers.
</P>
<P>
   The judge wouldn't allow the dementia defense, Mitchell said,
''because New Mexico's involuntary intoxication defense requires
the involuntary intake of some type of substance. ... In this case,
it's the failure or inability to take in a substance, due to the
unavailability of that substance: water.''
</P>
<P>
   In 23 years defending clients, Mitchell said it's a first.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've represented people in mercy killings before, asked judges
to allow doctors to remove life-support systems, but never have I
had one like this.''
</P>
<P>
   The state Office of the Medical Investigator concluded Coughlin
was in moderate to severe dehydration but that his body fluids were
not yet lethally low when he was killed.
</P>
<P>
   Survival experts will testify about how far someone can walk
without water, Mitchell said, and what humans can and cannot do
under such circumstances. Military survival accounts will be
included in evidence, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think a lot of their questions are going to be answered by
Raffi's testimony,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Ferry Sinks, 38 Killed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- An overloaded ferry carrying more than
100 passengers sank Sunday off Ambon island, killing at least 37, a
senior police official and news reports said.
</P>
<P>
   Rescuers found 37 bodies where the ferry went down in the Banda
Sea, Brig. Gen. Dewa Astika said. The Jakarta Post daily reported
that local residents and officials had rescued 85 people and were
continuing their search for several other survivors.
</P>
<P>
   Astika said navy vessels had been dispatched to help in the
search.
</P>
<P>
   The ferry KM Masnait was en route from Ambon to the port of
Waipirit on Seram island, 1,450 miles east of Jakarta. It sank
about five hours after leaving port.
</P>
<P>
   The ferry, which was overloaded with passengers, four vehicles
and 60 tons of cement and fertilizer, was swamped by two large
waves and then capsized, Antara said.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of overloading is a chronic problem in Indonesian
shipping, and maritime disasters are frequent. Insurers say weight
regulations are routinely ignored and enforcement is sporadic at
best.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the worst recorded disasters, an overcrowded passenger
ship sank between the Indonesian islands of Borneo and Sumatra in
February 1999 with 332 people aboard. There were only 20 survivors.

FBI Reports Drop in Crime
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Serious crimes reported to the police dropped for an
eighth consecutive year in 1999, down 7 percent from the year before and by far
the longest-running crime decline on record, the FBI reported Sunday. The FBI
report showed that all seven major types of crime were down not only nationwide,
but also in each region of the nation, and in suburbs, rural areas and in cities
of all sizes. President Clinton said the report ''confirms that our anti-crime
strategy -- more police officers on the beat, fewer illegal guns and violent
criminals on the street -- is having a powerful impact.''

Rebels Halt Advance in Sierra Leone

   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) -- A rebel advance through Sierra Leone's
interior ended with the rebels ''melting away'' into the jungle, a U.N. official
said Sunday, cooling a clash that involved United Nations forces and a
helicopter gunship from the government. One day after the peace process in this
West African nation seemed doomed, leaders of the rebel Revolutionary United
Front and U.N. officials flew together by helicopter to check out the area where
their forces clashed a day earlier. As many as 500 peacekeepers are believed to
be held by the rebels. Why they were seized remained unclear Sunday.

Charges of Fraud in Iran's Elections
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) -- Hard-liners said Sunday they had found evidence of vote
fraud in Iran's February elections that were swept by reformers, raising fears
that they would annul victories of candidates who support loosening the
conservative clergy's rule. The suspected fraud was in the capital of Tehran,
where reformists won 29 of 30 seats in the 290-seat parliament. Tehran was the
top prize in a nationwide victory for reformers, who ousted conservatives from
control of the legislature for the first time since the 1979 Islamic revolution
brought the clergy to power.
