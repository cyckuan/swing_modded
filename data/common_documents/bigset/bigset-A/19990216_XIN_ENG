<HEADLINE> EU Adopts Computerized Customs Transit System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 15 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission and
the European Free-Trade Area (EFTA) have jointly agreed to adopt a
computerized customs transit system, commission officials said on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The computerized system known as the New Computerized Transit
System (NCTS), is expected to usher in more effective cooperation
between national administrations in managing transit and paperless
customs procedures.
</P>
<P>
The legal basis for the system covers such areas as the status
of electronic messages, the structure of electronic messages, the
codes to be used, transit accompanying documents and procedures
based on the electronic exchange of data.
</P>
<P>
The system is to be launched in December. It is hailed by
commission officials as a central element in the reform of transit
in Europe and a practical response to the recommendation of the
European Parliament that called for improved performance and
security in transit arrangements.
</P>
<P>
The system will be initially implemented in Germany, Italy, the
Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland and will be limited to the most
important aspects of transit.
</P>
<P>
It will also be developed under the convention of a common
transit procedure which binds together the 15 European Union (EU)
member states, the EFTA countries of Switzerland, Iceland and
Norway, and the central and eastern European countries applying
for EU membership: the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and
Slovakia.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Warplanes Attack Iraqi Site in Northern No-Fly Zone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 15 (Xinhua) -- U.S. warplanes Monday
renewed their attacks on Iraqi air defense sites in the northern
no-fly zone after they said they were fired by Iraqi fire.
</P>
<P>
Pentagon spokesman Lt. Col. Steve Campbell said there were two
incidents taking place north of Mosul, at about 11:26 a.m. Iraqi
time (0626 GMT).
</P>
<P>
In the first confrontation, two F-15E fighter jets were fired
up by an anti-aircraft artillery site, Campbell said. In response,
one of the fighters dropped a 500-pound bomb on the site.
</P>
<P>
In a separate incident, another U.S. warplane lunched a missile
at an Iraqi radar site that had targeted it about an hour later,
Campbell said.
</P>
<P>
All the patrolling planes returned safely back to their base in
Incirlik, Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The strikes coincided with a visit by Iraqi Deputy Prime
Minister Tariq Aziz, who met with Turkish Prime Minister Bulent
Ecevit to voice displeasure at Turkey for allowing U.S. and
British forces to use Incirlik.

<HEADLINE> N.Ireland Opens Key Debate Amid Row Over IRA Arms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Northern Ireland's 108 assembly
members opened their session in Belfast on Monday with discussions
on the shape and scope of a new administration.
</P>
<P>
They convened to approve a report drawn up by First Minister
and Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble and his nationalist
deputy Seamus Mallon.
</P>
<P>
But the issue of the handover of terrorist weapons continues
to divide members over whether to bar Sinn Fein from power until
its IRA allies give up their guns.
</P>
<P>
Unionists have said they cannot contemplate a new executive or
cabinet that includes Sinn Fein unless IRA weapons are
decommissioned.
</P>
<P>
The IRA guerrillas, who fought for decades against British
rule, have so far refused to begin the disarmament called for in
last year's peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
Pro-British Protestant Unionist politicians say they should
rule the IRA's political wing Sinn Fein out of the new
administration.
</P>
<P>
But Sinn Fein argued that there was nothing in the Good Friday
Agreement which makes its presence in the executive conditional on
weapons being handed over.
</P>
<P>
"Without resolution of this issue there will not be sufficient
trust within the political process to make that process work
effectively," Seamus Mallon of the province's main Catholic
nationalist SDLP party told the new assembly.
</P>
<P>
Although the assembly is expected to agree to set up a 10-seat
cabinet or executive, North-South bodies creating links with the
Irish Republic and a British-Irish council, the row over when the
Irish Republican Army (IRA) should scrap its arms threatens to
delay Britain's handover of some home-rule powers on March 10.

<HEADLINE> Spanish King Glosses Over Trade Deal Problems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Spanish King Juan Carlos
Monday glossed over last-minute hitches that his country has
raised in South Africa's free trade negotiations with the European
Union (EU) when he addressed parliament in Cape Town, South
Africa.
</P>
<P>
Instead, he painted a rosy picture of future relations between
the two countries, saying stronger ties with South Africa had
priority on Spain's agenda of bilateral relations, South African
Press Association reported.
</P>
<P>
The king, accompanied by Queen Sofia and a 40-strong business
delegation, arrived in Cape Town Sunday night on a three-day state
visit.
</P>
<P>
The start of the royal visit coincided with media reports that
the Spanish government had warned it would not accept the draft
trade accord reached by South African and EU negotiators in Davos,
Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
Addressing South African parliamentarians in English, the king
said: "I am convinced that once the difficulties in negotiating
the free trade agreement have been overcome, it will shortly take
its place as the model of a deep and mutually productive
relationship."
</P>
<P>
The fact that Spain was among South Africa's ten principal
customers and the third largest contributor to its trade surplus,
showed that the possibilities for trade were experiencing a
favorable moment and that the foundations for growth had been
laid.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, the two countries signed a declaration of
intent on economic cooperation and to promote bilateral trade and
investment.
</P>
<P>
Mandela and King Carlos also decorated each other with their
countries' highest award.

<HEADLINE> DaimlerChrysler to Decide on Nissan Bid Within Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, February 15 (Xinhua) -- The auto giant DaimlerChrysler
is to decide "in the spring" on whether to bid for a stake in
Japan's second largest carmaking company, Nissan Motor, according
to the German company's chief executive, Juergen Schrempp, Monday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the University of Bayreuth in Germany, he said an
acquisition was currently "very attractive" to DaimlerChrysler.
</P>
<P>
The group's objective was to raise Asian business to 25 percent
of its overall sales within the next 10 years, he said. A decision
on cooperation or taking a stake in Nissan would be made in two to
three months, he said.
</P>
<P>
At the end of last month the two companies confirmed they had
been in talks at chief-executive level on cooperation, with
DaimlerChrysler showing interest in both a truckmaking subsidiary,
Nissan Diesel, and Nissan as a whole.
</P>
<P>
DaimlerChrysler had originally been keenest on buying just
Nissan Diesel, but analysts say it was probably told it could not
pick the cherries but would have to take a shareholding in the
group as a whole.
</P>
<P>
Nissan's problems start with debts totaling 4.2 trillion yen
(33 billion euros) and continue through weak sales in Japan to a
shortage of paid-up capital.

PARIS, February 15 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
will pay a visit to Macedonia on February 28, as NATO is
deliberating the dispatch of a peacekeeping force to the
neighboring Yugoslav province of Kosovo.
</P>

France is stationing 850 soldiers in a 1,800-man NATO force in
Macedonia to protect the verifiers of the Organization for

<HEADLINE> Talks on Iraqi-Turkish Ties Positive: Aziz </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister
Tariq Aziz said here Monday that his talks with Turkish Prime
Minister Bulent Ecevit were "very positive".
</P>
<P>
Aziz, who arrived here on Sunday for talks with Ecevit on the
Incirlik air base, the tense ties between Turkey and Iraq and the
latest developments in Iraq, made the remark following their first
round of talks.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that his talks with Ecevit would help in
improving the strained bilateral relations as a result of attacks
on Iraqi air defense sites by the U.S. warplanes based on Turkish
soil.
</P>
<P>
U.S. and British warplanes based in Turkey's Incirlik air base
were responsible for enforcing the "no-fly" zone in northern Iraq
set up by the allies in the wake of the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
Over the past months, those jets setting off from the air base
have been involved in confrontations with Iraqi air defense
units. Baghdad accused the U.S. and Britain of violating its air
space and infringing on Iraqi sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
Aziz said that during the talks "we have had a very beneficial
dialog with the Turkish prime minister and his delegation and the
dialog has been sincere and neutral."
</P>
<P>
"We have also discussed bilateral relations and our legitimate
concerns in a friendly and open manner," said Aziz.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that "this sincere and objective dialog will
help Turkey and Iraq reach a good understanding about their own
concerns and improve their bilateral relations."
</P>
<P>
However, he stressed that the main question was the "foreign
interference", saying that "when we remove the foreign
interference we can make a good degree of understanding and
cooperation."
</P>
<P>
Aziz said that "Turkey and Iraq are neighbors and friends" and
"have a lot of things in common," adding that "the security of
Turkey is in connection with the security of Iraq. We should not
allow the foreigners to interfere in our relations."
</P>
<P>
Aziz is trying to persuade Turkey to terminate the U.S. and
British mandate to use Incirlik base and halt their attacks on
Iraqi military facilities in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ecevit said that he held a "very beneficial and
friendly meeting" with Aziz, adding "we discussed all issues
concerning our countries."
</P>
<P>
"I told Aziz that Turkey launches every contribution and
initiative to the end of the sanctions imposed against Iraq," he
said, adding that Iraqi government should take some concrete steps
in this regard.
</P>
<P>
The crippling economic sanctions imposed after Iraqi invasion
of Kuwait in 1990 can not be lifted until U.N. arms inspectors
certify that Iraq has been free from prohibited weapons of mass
destruction.
</P>
<P>
Aziz and Ecevit are holding the second round of talks on the
improvement of strained bilateral relations and the Incirlik
base.

<HEADLINE> French Aerospatiale Merges With Matra Defense Corporation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 15 (Xinhua) -- The French government has
decided to privatize the country's civil and defense aerospace
group Aerospatiale to merge it with the private defense group
Matra Hautes Technologies.
</P>
<P>
The move will produce the world's fifth largest civil and
military aerospace group which produces the Airbus passenger
planes, regional transport planes, helicopters, missiles, and
other space products for the European space group Arianespace,
which sends satellites with the Ariane rocket.
</P>
<P>
The French government said in a decree issued Sunday night that
a majority of Aerospatiale's equity will be sold from the public
sector to the private sector.
</P>
<P>
French newspapers said Monday that Matra Hautes Technologies,
which is owned by the Lagardere group, will control 33 percent of
the stocks in a new entity Aerospatiale-Matra with a cost of 2
billion francs (357 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Lagardere group will pay for the stocks in two phases from 1999
till 2001.
</P>
<P>
The new entity will be governed by a directory with Yves
Michot, the president of Aerospatiale, as its chairman. A council
of supervision of the new corporation will be headed by Jean-Luc
Lagardere, the owner of Matra Hautes Technologies.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 20 percent of the shares of Aerospatiale will be
sold to the market and from 2 to 3 percent of the shares will be
offered to the staff of the corporation.
</P>
<P>
The ownership of the French government will thus be reduced to
under 50 percent in the Aerospatiale.
</P>
<P>
The new entity will also control 37 percent of the airspace and
defense group Dassault Aviation, which produces Mirage and Rafale
warplanes.
</P>
<P>
The move by the French government followed the recent merger
between the British Aerospace with the GEC-Marconi defense
corporation.
</P>
<P>
It could also be the prelude of an alliance between the
Aerospatiale-Matra with the German Daimler-Benz airspace group,
which will result in a European giant to challenge the American
airspace groups like the Boeing.

<HEADLINE> African Seed Seminar Starts in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 15 (Xinhua) -- A week-long seminar on the role
of small- holder farmers in seed production systems, whose aim is
to come up with strategies to improve production of quality seeds
and share experiences in Africa, began in Harare on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Seed production experts from nine African countries are
attending the seminar whose objective is also to come-up with
recommendations to governments to make the production of hybrid
seeds a priority in order to boost crop production even in times
of drought or incessant rains.
</P>
<P>
The seminar is being held at a time when some parts of Africa
were experiencing drought while others were experiencing incessant
rains, conditions which affect crop production.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwean Land and Agriculture Minister Kumbirai Kangai told
participants the success of farmers in the region was dependent on
the quality of seeds they planted although that could be improved
by the use of fertilizers and good crop management.
</P>
<P>
He said because of the recurring disasters, declining soil
fertility and rapid population growth, African countries needed to
formulate strategies that would secure small-holder seed supply to
enhance food security.
</P>
<P>
He said Zimbabwe's research services over the years had
developed new varieties of sorghum, millet, sunflower and other
crops but an efficient marketing system was also important to
ensure all farmers throughout the country to get seeds.

<HEADLINE> AL Chief Rejects Iraqi Threats Against Kuwait, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Arab League (AL)
Secretary General Ahmed Esmat Abdel-Meguid Monday rejected renewed
Iraqi threats against Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
"We do not accept threats and to be clear on this matter,
problems are not solved by threats but through dialog and
negotiations," Meguid told a press conference.
</P>
<P>
"Threats are rejected and unacceptable," and the AL chief, who
arrived here Sunday for a three-day visit.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein said during a meeting of top
officials in Baghdad Sunday night that Iraq was capable of
attacking Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, accused of harboring air bases
used by U.S. and British planes to police the no-fly zone in
southern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
On Iraq's rejection of the communique of the Arab foreign
ministers' meeting held in Cairo on January 24, the AL chief said
it was "unacceptable because the Arabs were unanimous on the Iraqi
crisis."
</P>
<P>
Meguid said the communique was "balanced" because it outlined
the responsibilities, stressed the importance of Iraq's
territorial integrity and sovereignty and outlined a mechanism to
form an Arab committee to follow up Iraq's relations with the
U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
He welcomed a Security Council decision to set up three
committees to look into matters of Iraq's humanitarian affairs,
Kuwait's prisoners of war (POWs) and the dismantling of Iraq's
weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
He called the decision a "important" one and hailed the role of
the U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan in this regard. Baghdad has
rejected the U.N. decision.
</P>
<P>
Meguid said the his organization would cooperate with the
U.N. on this matter.
</P>
<P>
He urged Iraq to cooperate positively with these committees
"because their objective was the implementation of all Security
Council resolutions related to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990."
</P>
<P>
On the POWs issue, which dominated his talks with Kuwaiti
leaders, Meguid asserted that the issue was a priority on the AL's
agenda, noting that the issue was a humanitarian but not a
political case.
</P>
<P>
He said he was the first to dispatch an envoy to Baghdad to
discuss the issue.

GENEVA, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Participants to a financial
services agreement sponsored by the World Trade Organization (WTO)
agreed here Monday to implement it on March 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
But 18 of the 70 participants to the WTO pact reached in
December 1997 have not yet ratified the agreement.

</P>
<P>
WTO Director-General Renato Ruggiero welcomed the decision,

financial sector, particularly in developing countries.
</P>
<P>
"At a time of instability in global financial markets, this
agreement provides a solid foundation for improvement of financial
practices, for enlarging the pool of capital available to business
and consumers and for increasing the transparency of financial
operations around the world," he said in a statement.
</P>

Ruggiero also urged those who had not yet ratified the treaty
to do so as soon as possible.

<HEADLINE> Southern African Region Urged to Protect Itself </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Acting Malawian High
Commissioner to Zimbabwe Elias Chijota challenged Southern African
United Nations (U.N.) military observers Monday to work together
and find solutions to improve security in the region.
</P>
<P>
Officially opening a three-week U.N. military observer course
in Harare, Chijota said there was need to protect the region as
possibilities of external intervention into conflicts in Africa
continued to decline.
</P>
<P>
"This situation, combined with the recognition within the U.N.
system on limitations for solving internal conflicts in Africa,
compelled countries in southern Africa to develop regional
cooperation on conflict resolution and establish a permanent
structure for coordination and capacity building, paving the way
for African solutions to African conflicts," he said.
</P>
<P>
This was how Inter-State Defense and Security (ISDS) Unit of
the Southern African Development Community (SADC) emerged from the
front line states to meet challenges of consolidating peace,
democracy and development in the region, Chijota said.
</P>
<P>
The military observer course is being attended by about 60 army
officers from the member states of the SADC.

<HEADLINE> Moussa Renews Call for Lifting Embargoes on Libya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TUNIS, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Egyptian Foreign
Minister Amr Moussa on Monday renewed his country's call for
lifting the "unfair U.N. sanctions" on Libya.
</P>
<P>
Moussa made the remark at a press release upon his arrival at
the Tripoli International Airport aboard an Egyptian airliner on a
working visit to Libya, according to reports reaching here from
the Libyan capital of Tripoli.
</P>
<P>
The visit was aimed at to probe into issues concerning the
Lockerbie bombing with Libyan officials. Two Libyan intelligence
officials were suspected of bombing a U.S. Pan Am passenger plane
over Lockerbie, Scotland on December 21, 1988, in which 270 people
were killed.
</P>
<P>
"The visit is part of the Egyptian-Libyan consultations on the
situation in the Middle East and Africa and on some sticky issues
such as Lockerbie," the minister said, expressing hope for "an
early cancellation of the embargoes."
</P>
<P>
It is not clear whether Moussa's flight to Libya was approved
by the U.N. Sanctions Committee as the air embargo, enforced since
1992 for Libya's refusal to surrender the two suspects in the
Lockerbie bombing, remains in effect.
</P>
<P>
Libya is still against extraditing two of its nationals until
the two suspects' fair trial, security and safety are guaranteed.
There seemed to be a breakthrough in the decade-old problem,
thanks to the mediation efforts by U.N. Secretary General Kofi
Annan, South African President Nelson Mandela and Saudi King Fahd.
</P>
<P>
Tripoli, London and the United Nations are expected to announce
details of a deal between Libya, the United States and Britain on
the handing over of the two Libyan suspects to the Hague, the
Netherlands, to be tried by Scottish judges under Scottish law.
</P>
<P>
The two suspects will, if convicted, serve their sentences in
Scotland under certain guarantees.

<HEADLINE> Canada to Deploy Canadian Election Observers to Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Canada announced Monday that it
will deploy a team of Canadian election observers to Nigeria for
the country's National Assembly and Presidential elections,
February 20 and 27 respectively.
</P>
<P>
"A giant in the region, with a population exceeding 100
million, Nigeria's political stability has a direct impact on its
neighbors as well as future development efforts in the region,"
said International Cooperation Minister Diane Marleau in a release
issued Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Supporting Nigeria's elections is a concrete way of
demonstrating Canada's interest in promoting democracy and good
governance, which will help further development in West Africa,"
added the Canadian Minister.
</P>
<P>
The ten-member Canadian team will observe the pre-election
period, including voter registration, the political campaign,
election day polling and the vote count, as well as report any
election irregularities, including ballot tampering, said the
release.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian General Abdulsalaam Abubakar has been in power since
June 1998, and has taken steps toward democracy in his country. On
December 5, 1998, municipal elections took place, marking the
beginning of a series of elections that will end on February 27,
1999 with the Presidential election.

<HEADLINE> Solid Minerals Policy Launched to Diversify </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABUJA, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian Solid Minerals Minister
Patrick Yakowa launched a national policy Monday on solid minerals
in a bid to diversify Nigeria's oil-driven economy.
</P>
<P>
At a launching ceremony here in the capital, the minister said
the policy was designed to stimulate private sector and foreign
involvement in the development of solid minerals.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, the Nigerian government will offer
incentives such as three to five years tax holidays, deferred
royalty payment, possibility of 100 percent foreign ownership,
extension of infrastructure and the possible capitalization of
expenditure on exploration and surveys.
</P>
<P>
The minister noted that "we envisage that economic gains
expected from a fully operative mining sector... can be enormous
in terms of royalties, company taxes, import substitution and
employment prospects and opportunities."
</P>
<P>
Nigeria has about 450 minerals, most of which have remained
untapped because of the lack of a policy and incentives to
encourage private sector investment.
</P>
<P>
The stock of minerals includes 26 billion tons of bitumen and
639 million tons of coal spread over a belt that stretches through
13 of the 36 states in the west African country.  With the
fluctuations in the oil prices on the international market,
Nigeria has been emphasizing the development of the solid minerals
sector to ensure that its development was not held hostage by the
vagaries of the international oil market.

<HEADLINE> Yemeni FM in Saudi Arabia for Border Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Yemeni Deputy Prime
Minister and Foreign Minister Abdul Qader Ba-Jammal arrived in
Saudi capital Riyadh Tuesday for talks on border demarcation,
informed sources said.
</P>
<P>
Yemeni Ambassador to Saudi Arabia Mohammad Al-Kabbab said
Bajammal, who has started talks with Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah
Ibn Abdul-Aziz, will deliver a message from President Ali Abdullah
Saleh to King Fahd.
</P>
<P>
He declined to disclose the contents of the letter.
</P>
<P>
However, informed diplomats told the Kuwait News Agency that
the message dealt with border demarcation between the two Arab
states.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of both countries have been exchanging letters aimed at
ending border disputes, the diplomats said.
</P>
<P>
Ba-Jammal is expected to hold lengthy talks with his Saudi
counterpart Prince Saud Al-Faisal on what was achieved on the
border demarcation process.
</P>
<P>
Ba-Jammal's visit came five days after a joint border
demarcation committee concluded a field survey to locate border
signs.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued last Thursday by the committee said field
inspections of border demarcation in Najran and Jizan in southern
Saudi Arabia were completed.
</P>
<P>
Informed sources said there were around 300 signs stretching
over the 300-kilometer common border, but it was hard to find them
because most of them were wiped out.
</P>
<P>
Mohammad Al-Alafi, head of the Yemeni delegation in charge of
the border signs finding, said he had proposed to seek help from
nationals living in border areas for signs locating.
</P>
<P>
Al-Alafi said both sides had agreed in principle to hire four
European companies to build border signs after their locations
were confirmed.

<HEADLINE> EU Assesses German, French Stability Programs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 16 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission on
Tuesday criticized Germany and France for not leaving enough
safety margins in their respective stability programs.
</P>
<P>
Both Germany and France have been hailed as the twin engine of
the economic development of the 15-nation bloc.
</P>
<P>
The commission said that though the German and French medium-
term target was in line with the requirements of the stability and
growth pact, the German program offered no safety margin to
accommodate the financial consequences of new policy measures or
unforeseen developments while the French program did not allow
additional safety margin for unforeseen developments in economic
activity or government finances or for budgetary burden of future
demographic developments.
</P>
<P>
The commission was to hand in its assessment reports to the
European council of ministers for approval.
</P>
<P>
The European Union Stability and Growth Pact, agreed by the
European council meeting in Amsterdam in June 1997, requires euro
zone countries to present stability programs to the council and
commission for assessment.
</P>
<P>
The commission and the council have also to review the
convergence programs for the four EU member states not
participating in the single currency mechanism. These countries
are Britain, Sweden, Denmark and Greece.
</P>
<P>
Yves-Thibault de Silguy, European commissioner responsible for
economic, monetary and financial affairs, said that the purpose of
the assessment reports of stability programs was to help build up
confidence as well as coordinate national economic and budgetary
policies at the union level.
</P>
<P>
The commission's analysis considers in particular therefore
whether the medium-term budgetary target of each member nation
provides a sufficient margin for normal cyclical fluctuations
without exceeding the union-wide reference deficit value of 3
percent of gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
The stability programs cover the current year and at least
three years to come.

</P>

in last summer's severe floods. Helping flood victims build new
homes has been given top priority by local governments in all of
the flood-affected regions.

prosperous Spring Festival, China's most important holiday seasons.
</P>
<P>
Residents of Beijing flocked to eight different temple fairs
across the city, where they were treated to traditional

<HEADLINE> Georgia Protests Contacts Between Russian Regions, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 13 (Xinhua) -- The Georgian Foreign Ministry
lodged a strong protest against some Russian regions'
establishment of direct ties with Abkhazia, Itar-Tass reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In a note sent to Moscow, the ministry said Russian regions and
federal structures "obstinately continue to establish direct
business contacts with the separatist leadership of Abkhazia"
despite numerous protests from Tbilisi.
</P>
<P>
Last October, the Kostroma region of Russia signed a deal on
trade and economic cooperation with Abkhazia. The Rostov region
and the Stavropoi Territory are also preparing similar agreements
with Abkhazia, Tass said.
</P>
<P>
The Georgian Foreign Ministry said "cooperation with the
separatists in any form and in any field is a violation of the
Alma Ata Memorandum on the Maintenance of Peace and Stability in
the CIS (Commonwealth of Independent States) of February 10, 1995,
and of the decision on measures to settle the conflict in
Abkhazia, approved by the Council of the CIS heads of state under
the chairmanship of the President of Russia on January 19, 1996."
</P>
<P>
Tbilisi also protested the invitation, without consultation
with and consent of the Georgian government, of Abkhazian
President Vladisiav Ardzinba and South Ossetia leader Lyudvig
Chibirov to the February 6-8 meeting of the Russian association
North Caucasus in Sochi.
</P>
<P>
That meeting was also attended by Russian First Vice-Prime
Minister Vadim Gustov, which "lent an official state status to the
event," Tass reported.
</P>
<P>
The fact that "the leaders of separatist authorities from
Abkhazia and South Ossetia were invited" to Russia's internal
event is an "obvious act of connivance for anti-constitutional
regimes," Georgia said.
</P>
<P>
Describing the meeting in Sochi as an "interference in the
internal affairs of sovereign Georgia," the Georgian Foreign
Ministry said participants at the meeting "turned it into a forum
to provocative statements against Georgian authorities, into some
sort of a trial for Georgia's policy."

<HEADLINE> Greek President Shortens Visit to Austria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Greek President Costis
Stephanopoulos shortened his three-day visit to Austria by one day
and will leave for home Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made following the Kurdish intrusions into
Greek embassies in Austria, Holland, Russia and other European
countries, which occurred after the Greece's handover of Kurdish
rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan to Kenya, and then to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, the Kurdish intruders into the Greek and Kenyan
embassies in Austria still refuse to open dialogue with the
Austrian police and do not raise any demands.
</P>
<P>
The police have talked with the detained Greek ambassador
couple and said they are in good condition. Besides, the police
ruled out possibility of attempt to rush into the embassy to avoid
any escalation of violence.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Stephanopoulos said that his visit will not be altered
by the violent actions by the Kurds.
</P>
<P>
Austrian President Thomas Klestil also said that he will
continue to accompany his Greek counterpart to complete the tour
as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
Austrian Federal Chancellor Viktor Klima Tuesday strongly
condemned the Kurdish intrusions and hostage taking.
</P>
<P>
Klima described the action by the Kurds as a terrorist one.
</P>
<P>
Austrian Minister of Foreign Affairs Wolfgang Schuessel and
Interior Minister Karl Schloegl were holding emergency talks and
keeping in contact with Greek President Costis Stephanopoulos, who
is in Austria for a visit, and Greek Prime Minister Constantinos
Simitis for resolving the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Riot policemen have sealed off the embassy. But they have not
established contact with the Kurds holed up inside the embassy
building.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan embassy in Vienna was also occupied by another group
of Kurds.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan, who Turkey has been seeking for waging a guerrilla war
for autonomy, was brought back to Turkey early Tuesday, Turkish
Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit said in Ankara at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
"He has been in Turkey since 3 a.m. (0100 GMT) this morning,"
Ecevit said, adding the rebel leader was captured unharmed.

<HEADLINE> Japan Urges Pakistan to Sign CTBT Before India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Japan Tuesday urged Pakistan
to sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) before India,
saying it would boost the image of Pakistan in the international
community.
</P>
<P>
"We urged Pakistan to ensure progress in the nuclear field and
ink the CTBT before India," a senior Japanese official said after
talks held here between officials from the two countries.
</P>
<P>
"Tokyo will appreciate Pakistan if it takes the initiative to
show adherence to the non-proliferation treaty," Director in the
Japanese Foreign Ministry Kazauya Ogawa said.
</P>
<P>
He said the Japanese delegation, led by Deputy Foreign Minister
Minoru Tamba, stressed the need for legislation to tighten control
over the export of nuclear technology to third country.
</P>
<P>
"We conveyed our concern over the cooperation between Pakistan
and North Korea in the nuclear field and told the Pakistani side
that it would affect ties between Pakistan and Japan," Ogawa said.
</P>
<P>
However, Pakistan's Foreign Secretary Shamshad Ahmed, who led
the Pakistani side at the talks, rejected reports that Islamabad
is receiving any assistance from third country in the nuclear
field.
</P>
<P>
"We also asked Pakistan to refrain from further test of missile
and stop the production of fissile materials," Ogawa said.
</P>
<P>
Pakistani officials, he said, told the Japanese side that
Pakistan is participating in the talks on Fissile Material Cut-off
Treaty (FMCT) in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
Japan agreed that Kashmir is the root cause of tension in South
Asia and hoped the tension would reduce through bilateral talks
between Pakistan and India, said Ogawa.
</P>
<P>
Japan is ready to facilitate Pakistan and India to hold talks
in Tokyo if the two countries agree, he said.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether Japan would lift sanctions if Pakistan signs the
CTBT, Ogawa said Tokyo could partially restore aid to Pakistan
after its signing and ratification of the Nuclear
Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT).
</P>
<P>
Japan, the largest donor to Pakistan, slapped economic
sanctions after the country's nuclear tests last May. Japan had
extended 500 million U.S. dollars to Pakistan annually.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan has been for several months under tremendous pressure
by the Western countries to ink the CTBT before the sanctions are
lifted.
</P>
<P>
The main purpose of the Japanese deputy foreign minister's
visit is to convince Pakistan to sign the CTBT.
</P>
<P>
In the wake of nuclear tests last May, the Japanese government
stopped granting aids and loans to Pakistan and decided not to
support Pakistan in getting loans from international financial
institutions like the World Bank, International Monetary Fund and
Asian Development Bank.
</P>
<P>
During Pakistani Foreign Minister Sartaj Aziz's visit to Japan
late last year, the Japanese government removed its opposition to
Pakistan's getting loans from international institutions, but
refused to lift sanctions before Pakistan signs the CTBT.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Govt Demands Greek Ambassador's Recall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 16 (Xinhua) -- The government of Kenya
Tuesday demanded Greek ambassador's recall with immediate effect
due to his role in the illegal entry of Abdullah O'calan, leader
of the Turkey's Kurdish Workers Party, into Kenya.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan Foreign Minister Bonaya Godana announced at a press here
Tuesday afternoon that O'calan arrived in Kenya on February 2,1999
aboard a private jet from Milan, Italy, with request for
diplomatic clearance sought by the Embassy of Greece to Kenya, and
the minister also confirmed that O'calan left the country Monday
for a destination known only by the Greek authorities.
</P>
<P>
"The government also established that the names of the persons
used in the Greek Embassy's note verbal seeking clearance were
fiction," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
"After intervention with the Greek Ambassador, it was
confirmed that O' calan was in the Ambassadors residence. The
government immediately requested for his expatriation from the
country to which the Greek Ambassador agreed after consultations
with his minister in Athens."
</P>
<P>
"The entry of O'calan into the country appears to have been
well known to the Greek government . We are puzzled as to why
Kenya was chosen as a destination for O'calan," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is possible that the Greek authorities may have taken
advantage of the strong friendly relations existing between our
two countries, which raises serious questions about their
sincerity and trustworthiness.
</P>
<P>
"The presence of O'calan in the country, therefore, raises
serious security concern. We would not have expected a friendly
country like Greece to subject Kenya to such an awkward situation
giving rise to suspicion and possible attack," he added.
</P>
<P>
O'calan, wanted in Turkey for leading a 14-year separatist war
in which about 29,000 people have died, was in Turkish custody
Tuesday, after being whished away from Kenya where he had been
secretly harbored by the Greek Embassy.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan government took up the matter with the Greek
government with a view to ascertaining the full circumstances and
reasons leading to the illegal entry of O'calan to Kenya, Godana
told the press.
</P>
<P>
The minister pointed out that "the Greek ambassador H.E. George
 Costorlas was at hand to meet the group at the airport. He
briefly boarded the aircraft and left with passengers without
following any of the formalities. No immigration arrival cards
were filled as the passengers were simply walked through."
</P>
<P>
"In view of the above, it is no longer possible to trust the
ambassador as serious doubts about his credibility have been
created. Accordingly, the

government had demanded his recall with immediate effect."
</P>
<P>
He said, "the government of Kenya wishes to emphasize that the
government had no role whatsoever to play in O'calan presence in
Kenya."

KUWAIT CITY, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait and Switzerland

<HEADLINE> Mexico, Egypt Enter Finals in New Year Cup Soccer Tourney </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mexico, one of the top 16 teams in the last year's World Cup,
will face on Friday African champion Egypt which stunned pre-
tournament favorite Bulgaria 3-1 in the opening match at the four-
team tournament earlier today.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptians dominated the first half against the fresh-faced
Bulgarians who were paced by noted striker Hiristo Stoitchkov.
Team captain Hossam Hassan opened the scoring in the 11th minute.
He also added another goal with a header after 30 minutes of play.
Midfielder Hazem Imam scored Egypt's ensuring goal at the 80th
minute.
</P>
<P>
Forward Iovov Hristo saved face for Bulgaria, semi-finalist in
the World Cup eight years ago, slamming a consolation goal three
minutes before the final whistle.
</P>
<P>
"I am not satisfied with my young team and the result is not
what we expected," said Bulgarian head coach Dimitur Dimirov. "The
Bulgarian team is in the process of changes, and our teamwork is
not good."
</P>
<P>
In the Mexico-Hong Kong match, the Mexican side fielded most of
their World Cup players. However, they met strong resistance from
the hosts, especially in the defense. Three of their shots hit the
post and another hit the bar.
</P>
<P>
After the two sides tied the score 0-0 in full time, the match
went into shootout. The Mexicans shot home four out of the five
while Hong Kong scored three.
</P>
<P>
"I am very happy with my players' performance, although we lost
the game," said Chan Hung Ping, coach of the hosts.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong will play against Bulgaria for the third place in the
annual tournament.

<HEADLINE> EU Criticizes German, French Stability Programs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 16 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission on
Tuesday criticized Germany and France for not leaving enough
safety margins in their respective stability programs.
</P>
<P>
The commission, the executive body of the 15-nation European
Union, said that though the German and French medium-term target
was in line with the requirements of the stability and growth pact,
the German program offered no safety margin to accommodate the
consequences of new financial policies, while the French program
didn't leave additional safety margin for both unforeseen
developments of economy and budgetary burden of future increase of
population.
</P>
<P>
The commission will present its assessment reports to the
European council of ministers for approval.
</P>
<P>
The European Union Stability and Growth Pact, agreed by the
European council meeting in Amsterdam in June 1997, requires euro
zone countries present stability programs to the council and
commission for assessment.
</P>
<P>
The commission and the council have also to review the
convergence programs of the four EU member states staying out of
the single currency mechanism: the United Kingdom, Sweden, Denmark
and Greece.
</P>
<P>
Yves-Thibault de Silguy, European commissioner responsible for
economic, monetary and financial affairs, said that the purpose of
the assessment reports on stability programs was to help build up
confidence as well as coordinate national economic and budgetary
policies at the union level.
</P>
<P>
The commission's analysis considers in particular whether the
medium-term budgetary target of each member-nation provides a
sufficient margin for normal cyclical fluctuations without
exceeding the union-wide reference deficit of 3 percent of gross
domestic product.
</P>
<P>
The stability programs cover the current year and at least
three coming years.

<HEADLINE> Aziz Hopes Incirlik Base Not to Serve U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister
Tariq Aziz Tuesday expressed his hope that Incirlik Air Base in
southern Turkey will not be used by the U.S. and Britain.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference here, Aziz said he has clarified
to the Turkish officials that Iraq hopes to terminate the U.S. and
British mandate to use the Incirlik base and halt their attacks
on the anti-aircraft batteries in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Aziz arrived in Ankara on Sunday for talks with Turkish
Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit on the Incirlik base, the tense
bilateral ties between Turkey and Iraq and the latest
developments in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Aziz said that neighbors should not hurt each other. He added
that Iraq was hurt as the U.S.-British patrol of the no-fly zone
in northern Iraq was conducted from the Turkish base.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Vice President Taha Yassin Ramadan said in Baghdad on
Monday that Iraq will attack the U.S. air base in Incirlik
as its request for Ankara to prevent the use of the base
for the U.S.-British strikes in Iraq was rejected.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit said on Monday that
Turkey will not accept unnecessary attacks on Iraq, but added
that U.S. jets were only striking at Iraqi defense sites when
attacked or targeted.
</P>
<P>
The visit by Aziz was aimed at persuading Turkey to stop
the use of Incirlik base by the U.S. warplanes for the
enforcement of the no-fly zone.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. bombings of Iraqi sites in the restricted zones
have become commonplace recently after hour days of U.S.-british
air strikes against Iraq in mid-December last year.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and its allies imposed two no-fly zones in
northern and southern Iraq after the 1991 Gulf War, allegedly
to protect the Kurds and the Shiite Muslims from Baghdad's
suppression.

<HEADLINE> Protesters Still Occupy Greek Embassy in London </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 16 (Xinhua)-- London Police officers on
Tuesday are negotiating with Kurdish protesters who barricaded
themselves in the Greek Embassy in London to demonstrate their
support to their leader Abdullah Ocalan.
</P>
<P>
But no notable progress has been achieved yet as the 50 Kurds
in the embassy keep on saying that they have petrol and are ready
to burn themselves to death.
</P>
<P>
Some 200 people also gathered outside the building in west
London to support the protesters inside, who are holding a man
believed to be a cleaner as their hostage.
</P>
<P>
The protest has been going on since early on Tuesday following
the detention in Kenya of Ocalan, who has now arrived in Turkey
where he is wanted on charges of terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Earlier a spokesman for the protesters inside the embassy said:
"We are ready to burn ourselves. There are more than 100 of us in
here and we have petrol."
</P>
<P>
Ocalan was handed over to the Kenyan authorities on Monday by
officials at the Greek Embassy in Nairobi, the capital of Kenya.
He has now been sent to Turkey where he is wanted for trial.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators in London have said they will not give up
their protest until Ocalan is granted asylum.
</P>
<P>
Scores of police officers are at the scene in London. The area
has been cordoned off and trained negotiators are talking to
protesters.
</P>
<P>
"The Greek ambassador has been present and he has spoken to the
people inside the building, but I'm not party to what has gone on
there," an inspector of the Metropolitan Police in London said.
</P>
<P>
London Fire Brigade and ambulance service crews are also at the
scene after reports of gas.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan has been on the run since last October when threats of
military action by Turkey forced him to flee his base in Syria. He
arrived in Rome in last November but disappeared again last month.
</P>
<P>
Since then he has been denied refuge in a number of European
countries because of massive diplomatic pressure from Turkey.

<HEADLINE> EDS-Update With Karimov Remarks Uzbek President Survives Assassination Attempt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 16 (Xinhua) -- A sudden change of schedule on
Tuesday saved Uzbek President Islam Karimov from potential harm
following explosions that rocked the government house where he was
to attend a meeting.
</P>
<P>
The blasts, occurring in central Tashkent, the Uzbek capital,
constituted an attempt on Karimov's life, announced the state
television.
</P>
<P>
Karimov was to attend a conference at the government building
at 11 a.m., but he changed his mind at the last moment and drove
to another location, Interfax quoted sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
"These were well-planned and well-prepared terroristic acts
aimed against our system, our independent policy, the independence
of our state," Karimov said.
</P>
<P>
He urged his countrymen to remain calm and vowed to "eliminate
the scoundrels" who staged the blasts, the Itar-Tass news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
The five explosions detonated shortly before 11 a.m. in quick
succession near the government building, in the immediate vicinity
of the National Bank for Foreign Economic Activities, and near the
city traffic-police headquarters.
</P>
<P>
The blasts were so strong that windows and doors two kilometers
away were broken.
</P>
<P>
According to unofficial reports, seven persons were killed and
about 30 persons have been hospitalized.
</P>
<P>
The area surrounding the city center has been sealed off by
police; burned cars were visible in the streets, Interfax said.

<HEADLINE> Supreme Soviet Cannot Change Ukraine's Partnership With NATO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, February 16 (Xinhua) -- The Supreme Soviet of Ukraine has
no right to deliberate over the Charter of Partnership Between
Ukraine and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) signed
in 1997, said a top official of Ukrainian State Committee on
Security and Defense.
</P>
<P>
Under the Ukrainian Constitution, the Supreme Soviet is
entitled to draft principles of the country's foreign policy, a
reason the Supreme Soviet cited for its deliberation over all the
treaties the government signed with NATO.
</P>
<P>
However, Vladimir Gorbulin, secretary of the security and
defense committee, said the Supreme Soviet's deliberation on the
charter will not lead to any actual change, because the charter is
a political document. The charter is "in compliance with the
principles of Ukrainian foreign policy," he added.
</P>
<P>
Although Ukraine is a non-aligned and neutral state, it "must
cooperate with NATO as well as Russia," he said.

<HEADLINE> Flowers Add Festive Feel to Chinese Holiday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Millions of Chinese flocked to
botanical gardens, fairs, and sidewalk flower shops on this first
day of the New Year holiday to visit and buy blooming plants which
symbolize the Spring, good luck, and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
More than one-million flower pots were placed along the major
streets and on the public squares of Kunming, capital of southwest
China's Yunnan Province, and flower exhibits featuring the beauty
of orchids, tulips and camellias are being held in several city
parks.
</P>
<P>
Kunming, dubbed the "City of Spring" for its mild climate, will
host a world horticulture exhibition in about two months, and
today gardens displaying more than 350,000 plants and flowers were
opened to the public as a warm-up for the big event.
</P>
<P>
Bouquets of roses or tulips were favored by residents in the
east China city of Hangzhou this year as the demand for flowers
has been expanding greatly.
</P>
<P>
"Some people started reserving floral baskets last November, "
said Chen Jihong, general manager of the Zhejiang Provincial
Flower Company.
</P>
<P>
Chen's satisfaction with his business was shared by flower
sellers in Chengdu, capital of Sichuan Province.
</P>
<P>
All the flowers brought in from suburban Chengdu early this
morning were sold out by the noon, said one seller at the
Qingshiqiao Flower Market.
</P>
<P>
Visiting the plum blossoms is a favorite festival activity for
many people in Hangzhou and the central China city of Wuhan, which
boast two of the most famous plum gardens in China.
</P>
<P>
Plums bloom in early Spring and are among the Chinese people's
favorite flowers because of their profound cultural significance.
</P>
<P>
About 5,000 plum rows in Hangzhou's botanical garden had the
first group of visitors today at the start of the annual plum
exhibit. This event has been a local favorite since it began in
1987.

<HEADLINE> Italy Urges Turkey to Meet European Standards in Ocalan's Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto
Dini said Tuesday that Italy expects Ocalan's trial in Turkey will
meet standards and guarantees laid down by the Council of Europe,
of which Turkey is a member.
</P>
<P>
He said that those conventions do not envisage the death
penalty, and the Ocalan case could test Turkey's ability to meet
European standards and may help its bid to join the European Union.
</P>
<P>
He said Italy would continue to support that bid as long as
Turkey moves closer to Europe on human and civil rights and the
treatment of minorities, the main stumbling block to its EU
ambitions.
</P>
<P>
Dini added that Italy and the European Union condemned all
forms of terrorism and urged Kurds everywhere to refrain from
violent protest against Ocalan's capture.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit announced Tuesday that
Ocalan was brought to Turkey from Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan's Italian lawyers confirmed that Tuesday morning that
the Greek embassy in Nairobi had turned Ocalan to Kenyan
authorities, and then with the permission of Kenya, Turkey took
Ocalan back to the country with a special military airplane.

<HEADLINE> Georgia Protests Contacts Between Russian Regions, Abkhazia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 13 (Xinhua) -- The Georgian Foreign Ministry
lodged a strong protest against some Russian regions'
establishment of direct ties with Abkhazia, Itar-Tass reported.
</P>
<P>
In a note sent to Moscow, the ministry said Russian regions and
federal structures "obstinately continue to establish direct
business contacts with the separatist leadership of Abkhazia"
despite numerous protests from Tbilisi.
</P>
<P>
Last October, the Kostroma region of Russia signed a deal on
trade and economic cooperation with Abkhazia. The Rostov region
and the Stavropoi Territory are also preparing similar agreements
with Abkhazia, Tass said.
</P>
<P>
The Georgian Foreign Ministry said "cooperation with the
separatists in any form and in any field is a violation of the
Alma Ata Memorandum on the Maintenance of Peace and Stability in
the CIS (Commonwealth of Independent States) of February 10, 1995,
and of the decision on measures to settle the conflict in Abkhazia,
approved by the Council of the CIS heads of state under the
chairmanship of the President of Russia on January 19, 1996."
</P>
<P>
Tbilisi also protested the invitation, without consultation
with and consent of the Georgian government, of Abkhazian
President Vladisiav Ardzinba and South Ossetia leader Lyudvig
Chibirov to the February 6-8 meeting of the Russian association
North Caucasus in Sochi.
</P>
<P>
That meeting was also attended by Russian First Vice-Prime
Ministry Vadim Gustov, which "lent an official state status to the
event," Tass reported.
</P>
<P>
The fact that "the leaders of separatist authorities from
Abkhazia and South Ossetia were invited" to Russia's internal
event is an "obvious act of connivance for anti-constitutional
regimes," Georgia said.
</P>
<P>
Describing the meeting in Sochi as an "interference in the
internal affairs of sovereign Georgia," the Georgian Foreign
Ministry said participants at the meeting "turned it into a forum
to provocative statements against Georgian authorities, into some
sort of a trial for Georgia's policy."

<HEADLINE> Pak, Japan Talks End Without Tangible Achievement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan and Japan Tuesday
euphorized their bilateral relations in talks focusing on
non-proliferation and promotion of political and economic
cooperation but no important achievement was made.
</P>
<P>
The ninth meeting of the Pakistan-Japan Joint Commission was
held here Tuesday between Pakistani Foreign Secretary Shamshad
Ahmed and Japan's Deputy Foreign Minister Minoru Tanba.
</P>
<P>
Shamshad said that the two countries enjoyed enduring
friendship and mutually beneficial ties, stressing Pakistan
considered its relations with Japan as "most valuable and a very
important part of its foreign policy", according to a press
release issued after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Being the largest donor of Pakistan, Japan had extended 500
million U.S. dollars to Pakistan annually before it imposed
sanctions against the South Asian country last May. It is the
leading trading partners of Pakistan, too.
</P>
<P>
Minoru emphasized Japan's sincere desire to further advance the
traditional friendly relations between the two countries, said the
press release.
</P>
<P>
He promised to encourage Japanese investors to look more
favorably on opportunities in Pakistan in view of the excellent
Pakistan-Japan ties, said the press release.
</P>
<P>
Minoru also stated that Japan highly appreciated Pakistan's
positive approach towards security, non-proliferation objectives
and noted that Pakistan had made significant progress in this
regard.
</P>
<P>
Shamshad said Pakistan's Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has
already made a commitment to adhering to the Comprehensive Test
Ban Treaty (CTBT) in an atmosphere free of coercion, according to
the press release.
</P>
<P>
The punitive approach of sanctions was counter-productive and
always evoked a negative response, said Shamshad.
</P>
<P>
He urged that Japan should lift bilateral sanctions against
Pakistan imposed following Pakistan's nuclear tests.
</P>
<P>
Japan had reportedly promised to ease sanctions if Pakistan
signs the CTBT.
</P>
<P>
On regional security situation in South Asia, Shamshad
underscored the centrality of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute to
that issue, saying that full normalization of Pak-Indo relations
would be possible only in the context of the resolution of the
core dispute.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Islamabad, Minoru also paid a courtesy call
on Pakistani Foreign Minister Sartaj Aziz. He has left for
Pakistan's southern port of Karachi en route to Tokyo.

<HEADLINE> White-collar Workers Keen on Helping Poor Students </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, February 16 (Xinhua) -- For the first time since her
father's death, Min Pinghua, a 15-year-old student at the
Shanghai Shuyuan Middle School, could not help smiling because the
helping hand extended by a complete stranger has just prevented
her from dropping out of school.
</P>
<P>
Min's father died in a car accident in 1994, leaving behind his
wife and two little girls and more than 60,000 yuan in debts. Mrs.
Min, a poor farmer living in the outskirts of Shanghai, since then
has had great difficulty supporting the family and was considering
that Pinghua might have to leave school.
</P>
<P>
A senior clerk at the Shanghai Asian Paper Co. Ltd., who
identifies himself only as Zhang, read about Min's story on the
Internet and decided to provide her with 1,500 yuan a year until
her graduation.
</P>
<P>
"For us, the figure of 1,500 yuan may only mean a suit, but for
Pinghua, it can afford her a year's schooling that may bring about
great changes in her life, " Zhang said. "So, I believe what I've
done is worthwhile."
</P>
<P>
Zhang is the first, but not the only, white-collar worker
offering help to poor students in this largest industrial and
commercial city in China. Actually, a line of donors has begun to
form since the Shanghai Charity Foundation launched an aid-poor-
students web site on the Internet last December 25, which carries
brief introductions about needy students in the city to find aid
for them in a more efficient way.
</P>
<P>
In less than 40 days, more than 20,000 people, mostly young
white-collar workers with good education, have visited the web
site
One-hundred of these folks have already started funding the first
100 students, and 50 have signed agreements to aid the next 50
students to be listed, and more are waiting for coming
announcements of still other needy ones.
</P>
<P>
"Some people worry that young white-collar workers might become
indifferent selfish as market forces play a bigger and bigger role
in the country," said Xu Benliang, director of the Shanghai
Charity Education Center. "Now we're relieved to see that they
still carry forward the fine Chinese traditions of warm
heartedness
and mutual assistance."
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the Shanghai Professional Personnel Exchange
Center indicate that there are more than 300,000 young white-
collar workers in the city's major state-owned enterprises and
institutions, and some 10,000 in overseas-funded businesses, with
monthly incomes ranging from 1,500 to 25,000 yuan, much higher
than the average local salary, and many of them are cyber-surfers.
</P>
<P>
According to the charity program, a donor is asked to provide
at least 1,500 yuan a year to support one poor student. All the
donor needs to do is to choose a student, fill out a form, both
through the web site and then send the money to the foundation.
</P>
<P>
And recently, an increasing number of donors are no longer
satisfied with their indirect help, and have extended their aid
outside the Internet by establishing direct ties with the students
they fund.
</P>
<P>
Qi Jun, an insurance company clerk, and his wife have made
additional plans to give study guidance to the two middle-school
students they support. The couple intends to help them become
university students.
</P>
<P>
"I know how important education is to a person because I myself
have benefited a lot from it," Qi said. "Now I'm glad I can help
the needy continue schooling."
</P>
<P>
Shanghai, with a population of 13 million, has about 100,000
poor students, and the city has tried many ways to make sure that
no student has to drop out because of financial problems.

<HEADLINE> Chinese People Delighted to Greet Spring 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Chinese people all over the
country are delighted to be enjoying the week-long Spring Festival
as they greet the beginning of spring 1999.
</P>
<P>
In Guangzhou, capital of south China's Guangdong Province, the
gift of flowers is the favorite among the local people. Flowers
not only bring beauty to Guangzhou, but also are boosting the city'
s economy.
</P>
<P>
With the increase of flower-raising areas in the city, the
flower market is flourishing. Annual flower sales in Guangzhou
reached more than 100 million bunches with a value of more than
700 million yuan last year.
</P>
<P>
In Xi'an, capital of northwest China's Shaanxi Province, more
than 1,600 young university professors and lecturers moved into
new housing before the Spring Festival eve.
</P>
<P>
Since last August, the Shaanxi provincial government has set
housing construction for university teachers at the top of its
agenda, and has invested 301 million yuan into housing projects.
</P>
<P>
Early this year, Shaanxi Province completed 382,400 square
meters of apartment floor space for local teachers. By the end of
this year, more university teachers in Shaanxi are expected to
move into new housing as construction continues around the
province.
</P>
<P>
In Huxian County's Donghan Village in Shaanxi Province,
villagers invited 16 American students who are currently studying
at Xi'an Institute of Foreign Languages to spend their holidays
with them during this Spring Festival season.
</P>
<P>
Two American girls, Betsy and Bonnie, learned to make jiaozi (
dumplings) at Wang Baoshan's houses. Their eagerness to learn how
to make this traditional Chinese dish aroused the laughter of the
family members time and again.
</P>
<P>
Betsy said: "Chinese Spring Festival is fascinating to me and I
enjoyed myself making jiaozi with Chinese villagers."
</P>
<P>
In the Tibet Autonomous Region, Tibetans are busy preparing
festival food for tomorrow, the Tibetan lunar New Year's Day.
</P>
<P>
At Arxue Village near Lhasa, capital of the region, more than
50 households who recently moved from the barren land of Zhanang
County were celebrating their resettlement.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the Tibetan Autonomous Regional Government invested
more than 250,000 yuan, and Zhanang County donated 210,000 yuan so
that the Tibetan households could build new houses at Arxue
Village. Now the villagers have opened up more than 26 hectares
of farmland and they are expecting a good harvest this year.
</P>
<P>
In Ward Number 2 at the Chaoyang District Hospital in Beijing,
a 71-year-old woman named Liu Zizhen was enjoying a reunion with
her family members, her bed surrounded by flowers and balloons, as
the nurses were busy serving jiaozi and other festival dishes to
the patients on the ward.
</P>
<P>
Liu and other patients were given special care and all of them
were engrossed in the festival atmosphere. Cao Hailing, a head
nurse, said: "I would rather give up my holiday to ensure that the
elders enjoy their last happiness at festival time."

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, February 16 (Xinhua) -- It looked like an ordinary
family scene -- the parents and two children enjoying a rich feast
on the eve of Spring Festival yesterday.
</P>
<P>
The six-year-old girl in the family, Li Yanping, however, is
actually an orphan who has been taken care of by the family for
more than one year.
</P>
<P>
Li Hongzi, the father, said that when the family offered to
take care of her she was suffering from congenital heart disorder
and rickets as well as mental retardation.

kindergarten she plays with other normal children," said the
mother, Liu Bihua.
</P>
<P>
Like Li Yanping, this Spring Festival 120 orphans in Shanghai
spent the holidays with among families.
</P>
<P>
In May 1997, the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Civil Affairs,
the Municipal Charity Foundation and the Xinmin Evening News
issued a joint proposal calling on families in the city to take
children out of the orphanage and into their homes to be raised as
part of the family.
</P>
<P>
Now there are 120 such families in Shanghai, the parents of
which are engaged in many different professions such as teachers,
doctors, self-employed business people, and even laid-off workers.
Some of the parents pay tuition for painting and ballet classes
for the children.
</P>
<P>
Lu Rongfang, a teacher at the Shanghai Orphanage, said that a
survey conducted by her orphanage at the end of last year showed
that the 100 children who left her facility to go and live with
families are all thriving.
</P>
<P>
Ma Zhongqi, deputy secretary-general of the Shanghai Municipal
Charity Foundation, said that by the end of this year, the number
of families in the city with orphans in their care is expected to
reach 300.

<P>
WUHAN, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Chinese premier Zhu Rongji is
touring central China's Hubei Province to celebrate the Lunar New

</P>
<P>
He extended season's greetings to policemen in the city of

<HEADLINE> Israel Sees First Negative Inflation Index in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Israel's consumer price
index (CPI) plunged 0.5 percent in January, the first negative
growth since January 1986, when the CPI fell 1.3 percent, local
media reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Declines in housing prices and seasonal changes in clothing
and shoe prices were the main factors pulling the January index
downward, offset by increases in products and health care prices,
the Jerusalem Post said.
</P>
<P>
With the negative figure coming on the heels of a slight 0.1
percent CPI increase in December, the pressure has begun to mount
for the central bank to lower interest rates.
</P>
<P>
Various economic and business establishments said that the
continuation of downward CPI growth showed that the original
inflation target for 1999, 4 percent, is likely to be achieved.
</P>
<P>
They said that by lowering interest rates, Bank of Israel
Governor Jacob Frenkel could help bring the economy out of what
seems to be a full-blown recession.
</P>
<P>
After the turmoil in the international financial market
prompted a wave of devaluation of the Israeli currency shekel
in October which saw a record high of 3 percent CPI growth,
Frenkel was forced to raise the interest rate twice in two
weeks to 13. 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Economists said the controlled inflation of the last two
months has created an environment for the central bank to cut
the interest rate, a move which will encourage investment and
production.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said Frenkel is expected to announce a 0.3 to 0.5
percent cut in the interest rate next week.
</P>
<P>
Frenkel said he hopes the January index is an indication that
the economy is stablizing.

<P>
Last November, the central government implemented a decision to
replace the 31 provincial bank branches under the central bank
with nine regional branches in order to tighten control over
finances. The new Shanghai Branch administers financial affairs in
Shanghai, the country's largest industrial and commercial city,
and the provinces of Zhejiang and Fujian, two major economic
powerhouses.
</P>
<P>
According to the plan, financial institutions in the region
will list those enterprises and individuals who do not honor their
agreements and will combine in refusing services to them.
</P>
<P>
The finance sector will further improve internal management by
sorting out those employees who repeatedly break trade regulations
and cause losses, and banning them from continuing working in the
sector.
</P>
<P>
The plan also calls for a credit ratings system to be set up.

<HEADLINE> Regional Meeting on Use of Pesticide Begins in Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Representatives from 15
countries in the Asia and Pacific region were gathered here
Tuesday for a two-day meeting on the use of pesticide.
</P>
<P>
The project review and program management committee meeting of
the Regional Network on Safe Pesticide Production and Information
for Asia and the Pacific is jointly organized by the Nepali
government, the United Nations Development Program and the United
Nations Industrial Development Organization.
</P>
<P>
Inaugurating the meeting, Hari Shankar Tripathi of the National
Planning Commission of Nepal said that though the use of chemical
fertilizer and pesticide is very low in Nepal compared with other
countries in the region, it has a negative impact on agriculture
and ecological system due to excessive use.
</P>
<P>
According to information provided by the Nepali Ministry of
Agriculture, about 55,870 metric tons of pesticide are used in
Nepal every year.
</P>
<P>
R.B. Pradhan, director general of the Agriculture Department of
Nepal, said that efforts are being made with the technical
cooperation of the Asian Development Bank to establish a pesticide
laboratory in Nepal for the improvement of agriculture in the
country.
</P>
<P>

crops and ecological conservation.

<HEADLINE> Uzbek President Survives Assassination Attempt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 16 (Xinhua) -- A sudden change of schedule on
Tuesday saved Uzbek President Islam Karimov from certain death
following a series of car bombs that detonated outside the
government building where he was scheduled to attend a cabinet
meeting.
</P>
<P>
The blasts, occurring in central Tashkent, the Uzbek capital,
constituted an attempt on Karimov's life, state television
announced.
</P>
<P>
Karimov was to attend a conference at the government building
at 11 a.m., but he changed his mind at the last moment and drove
to another location, Interfax quoted confidential sources as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The five explosions detonated shortly before 11 a.m. in quick
succession near the government building, in the immediate vicinity
of the National Bank for Foreign Economic Activities, and near the
city traffic police headquarters.
</P>
<P>
The blasts were so strong that windows and doors two kilometers
away were broken.
</P>
<P>
According to unofficial reports, approximately 30 persons have
been hospitalized. There were no reports to indicate that anyone
had died.
</P>
<P>
The city center has been sealed off by police, and burned cars
were visible in the streets, Interfax said.

<HEADLINE> Security Stepped Up Around Embassies in Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Turkish security forces
stepped up security on Tuesday around the embassies of the United
States, Greece, Russia and Israel after Kurdish rebel leader
Abdullah Ocalan was brought back to Turkey earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
Additional security measures were also taken around the Turkish
Prime Ministry building and the United Nations House in Ankara.
</P>
<P>
Kurds across Europe have been storming Greek embassies in the
continent since early Tuesday morning in protest against the
handover of Ocalan, the leader of the Kurdistan Workers Party, by
the Greek embassy to the Kenyan authorities.
</P>
<P>
Greece inherited the Ocalan problem this year after he was
denied refuge or forced out of Lebanon, Syria, Russia, Italy,
Germany, the Netherlands and other countries.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit announced that Ocalan,
Turkey's most wanted man, has been brought to Turkey at 03:00
local time (01:00 GMT) Tuesday and will face a death penalty if
convicted.
</P>
<P>
However, Ecevit did not confirm whether Ocalan was brought
back to Turkey from Kenya and refused to give any details
about his capture.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's Anatolia News Agency reported that the private plane
which brought Ocalan to Turkey landed at the Ataturk
International Airport in Istanbul, the largest city of Turkey and
left soon.

<HEADLINE> EU Stresses Structural Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 16 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission
stressed on Tuesday the role of economic and structural reform in
the fight against unemployment and its impact on growth.
</P>
<P>
The commission, the executive body of the 15-nation European
Union, made the emphasis in a report published Tuesday on economic
and structural reform within the union.
</P>
<P>
The commission said in its report, requested by the European
Union Cardiff summit last June, that the impact of economic and
structural reform can be increased if all member states act
together to ensure a coherent approach.
</P>
<P>
The report highlighted the need to take account of the
interaction between measures to improve the operation of markets
for goods, products and capital and macro-economic policies and to
maximize the benefits of the single market.
</P>
<P>
It also stressed the need for reform of taxation and benefit
systems to improve flexibility and to promote investment in human
capital.
</P>
<P>
An urgent need was pinpointed in the wide-ranging report as to
remove the obstacles to development of a pan-European risk capital
market which would benefit small and medium-sized enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The commission report also pointed to the need to foster EU tax
coordination and restructure public finances to prepare for the
budgetary consequences of ageing.
</P>
<P>
Yves-Thibault de Silguy, European commissioner responsible for
economic, monetary and financial affairs, said that the central
message of the commission report adopted at his initiative was
that structural reform is essential to foster employment and
growth in Europe and to ensure the smooth operation of the
economic and monetary union in the form of euro.

<HEADLINE> EU, Bosnia on Reform Strategy, Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 16 (Xinhua) -- The European Union and Bosnia
have discussed the strategy for industrial and economic reform and
foreign direct investment in their third task force meeting,
European Commission officials said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The task force meeting, held in Sarajevo on Monday, also
touched upon judicial reform and public administration in the
Balkan country.
</P>
<P>
Hans-Jorg Peters, ambassador of Germany, emphasized on behalf
of the 15-nation European Union at the one-day meeting the
potential advantages for the Bosnian economy in strengthening the
internal market of Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Improvement on financial services, company law and accounting
will help attract foreign direct investment to the Balkan country,
he said.
</P>
<P>
The participants to the meeting agreed that a significant
improvement had been made in the progress of implementing the
tasks projected by the joint meeting and the Bosnian participants
were strongly encouraged to consistently follow up on their
commitment made during the three task force meetings held so far.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was presided over by the EU and Bosnia-Herzegovina
Consultative Task Force that was established in last June after
the meeting of the European Council of Ministers in Luxembourg.
</P>
<P>
The two parties are scheduled to meet again in April to discuss
technical norms and standards within the internal market and
competition policy within Bosnia.

<HEADLINE> Ocalan's Lawyers Ask Italy to Intervene His Handover to Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Italian lawyers for the Kurdish
rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan launched a "vigorous appeal" to the
Italian government to mount "a strong diplomatic intervention to
save the life of Abdullah Ocalan."
</P>
<P>
The lawyers, who had asked the Italian government to give
political asylum to Ocalan, said that the request was submitted
precisely for the purpose of avoiding Ocalan's sentence to death
in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit announced Tuesday that
Ocalan has been brought back to Turkey from Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
The lawyers confirmed that Tuesday morning the Greek embassy in
Nairobi turned Ocalan to Kenyan authorities, and then with the
permission of Kenya, Turkey took Ocalan back to the country with a
special military airplane.
</P>
<P>
As pro-Kurdish demonstrations and hostage-taking continued at
Greek missions in other parts of Europe, there was no Kurdish
demonstration at the Greek Embassy in Rome.
</P>
<P>
Three police cars were seen parked around the embassy with five
to six Italian policemen on patrol at the front gate of the
Turkish diplomatic mission.
</P>
<P>
Media reports quoted Italian Interior Ministry sources as
saying that there was no cause for concern over Kurdish protests
in Italy.
</P>
<P>
Police surveillance of various diplomatic quarters, embassies
and consulates in the country has been tightened since news broke
overnight of Ocalan's movements and the situation is being "
constantly monitored."
</P>
<P>
The Kurdish Worker's Party (PKK) leader was arrested in Rome on
November 12 last year after he arrived on a flight from Moscow and
left Rome on January 16.
</P>
<P>
Germany said later that it will not seek to extradite Ocalan to
Germany, for fear of sparking confrontation between the Kurdish
and Turkish communities in the country.
</P>
<P>
Turkey accused Ocalan of committing a long list of terrorism
and terrorism-related crimes and blaming him for more than 30,000
deaths during his 15-year armed struggle for a Kurdish homeland in
southeastern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
But Turkey's extradition request was rejected by Italy, which
has a law banning extradition to countries where the death
sentence is in force.
</P>
<P>
Italy's decision has caused a rift between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Italy and Germany agreed on November 27 that Ocalan be tried by
an international tribunal supported by European Union (EU). But no
member of the EU is willing to host the trial.
</P>
<P>
The Rome Appeals Court lifted on December 16 travel restriction
on Ocalan, and on December 23, Italian Prime Minister Massimo D'
Alema announced that Ocalan could leave Italy and "is free to go
wherever he wants."

Monday in the African nation and brought back to Turkey early
Tuesday.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan fought hard to beat
India 4-2 in Lahore, Pakistan on Tuesday in their fifth field
hockey match, edging closer to taking the nine-match series.
</P>
<P>
After the first match of the second leg Pakistan now won four
matches and lost one. Pakistan had won the four-match Indian leg
by three to one.
</P>
<P>
Two expertly taken penalty corner goals by Sohail Abbas and one
each by Atif Bashir and Mohammad Khalid helped Pakistan outlast
the visitors.
</P>
<P>
Both teams made some good moves with Pakistan benefiting from
the induction of left-in Mohammad Khalid, who missed the Indian
leg of the series due to injury.
</P>
<P>
The first goal came in the 20th minute when captain Atif Bashir
received the ball on the edge of the circle. Sohail Abbas added
the second through a penalty corner in the 26th minute while India
failed to score from any of the four short corners they forced in
the first half.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan kept up the tempo when play resumed. Mohammad Sarwar
fed Mohammad Khalid a golden pass in the 39th minute. Khalid's
shot was deflected by a defender for Pakistan's third goal.
</P>
<P>
India forced four short corners in three minutes and finally
scored in the 49th minute through Baljit Singh Sani. They were
further rewarded with a penalty stroke converted by Baljit Singh
Dhillon with 15 minutes to go.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's last goal came in the last minute when Sohail Abbas
scored on a penalty corner. The two teams will meet in the sixth
match in Karachi on Thursday.

WELLINGTON, February 16 (Xinhua) -- An unsettled dispute
between the South Pacific Games council and the Oceania Football
Confederation (OFC) led to soccer dropped from the event to be run
in Guam from May 29 to June 12, officials said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The OFC wrote to the games council on February 5, telling them
it had not sanctioned soccer at the Guam games and advising them
not to participate, council secretary general Vidhya Lakhan said
in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The row arose some months ago over a decision of the games
council to play the game according to the South Pacific Games
charter rules rather than FIFA rules which allows only nationals
of a country to participate in the games.
</P>
<P>
The games charter allows athletes with at least four years'
residence in a country to participate.

<HEADLINE> EU Envoy Presses for Pact in Congo (K) Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Visiting European Union envoy
to the Great Lakes region Aldo Ajello has pressed for an agreement
by all parties involving in the conflict in the Democratic
Republic of Congo (DRC) as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Ajello made the remarks during his meeting here Monday with
Mozambican President Joaquim Chissano during which they exchanged
views on the current situation in the Great Lakes region, the
Noticias paper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The envoy, who is touring several African countries to collect
information on how to resolve the crisis in the region, especially
in the DRC, asked Chissano to make further efforts in peacefully
resolving the conflict in the region by getting the warring
parties to build trust among themselves.
</P>
<P>
"The essential issue in solving the conflicts facing the region
 (including Burundi, Rwanda and the DRC) is to build trust,
therefore, I believe the experienced President Chissano has the
political authorities to settle the issue," said Ajello.
</P>
<P>
At present, Mozambique, Tanzania and Zambia are the three
Southern African Development Community countries mediating in the
conflicts in the Great Lakes region.
</P>
<P>
"We hope the three countries should participate more in
mediation," said the envoy, adding that Chissano is doing his best
in this regard.
</P>
<P>
Ajello is optimistic about the prospects of the DRC conflict,
saying he hopes all parties involved will soon reach an agreement.
</P>
<P>
According to the envoy, at the moment, the most important thing
for the DRC is to sign a cease-fire agreement, not the setting up
of a peace- keeping force, for peace-keeping forces could be
established any time so long as the fighting is stopped.
</P>
<P>
He revealed that the first draft cease-fire has been worked out
after the recently closed Lusaka meeting. It is predicted that
all parties of the conflict will soon sign the accord.
</P>
<P>
The DRC conflict started on August 2 last year when rebels
backed by Rwanda and Uganda rose up in arms against President
Laurent Kabila who was later joined by allies Angola, Zimbabwe,
Namibia and Chad.

<HEADLINE> PKK Leader Brought back to Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah
Ocalan, of whom Turkey has been in hot pursuit, was captured and
brought back to Turkey early Tuesday, Turkish prime minister
Bulent Ecevit announced.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference here on Tuesday morning, Ecevit
said Ocalan, leader of the outlawed Kurdish Workers's Party (PKK),
was brought back to Turkey at 03:00 local time (01:00GMT) Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister added Ocalan was captured unharmed.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit declined to comment on whether Ocalan was
brought to Turkey from Kenya and he refused to elaborate upon
Ocalan's capture.
</P>
<P>
"We had promised that the state would catch him, we have kept
our promise," the prime minister said, adding the promise had been
given to the mothers of the martyrs.
</P>
<P>
"Ocalan will pay the price of his accounts to the independent
Turkish courts," Ecevit added.
</P>
<P>
Reports said Ocalan faces the death penalty if convicted, and
he will soon be interrogated by authorized judicial officials.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish prime minister did not say when a trial will take
place.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan, whose whereabouts had been a mystery to the world since
he left Rome in January, was seen most recently in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan, who has been leading the PKK in fighting a war for
independence in southeastern Turkey, was ousted by Syria from his
long-time hideout there in November.
</P>
<P>
After a brief stay in Russia, Ocalan left for Italy in November
where he remained until January. Italy refused to to extradite him
to Turkey, because he faced capital punishment here.
</P>
<P>
Greek diplomats said Tuesday they had granted Ocalan secret
refuge in Nairobi for two weeks, but that he disappeared Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish prime minister said Ocalan's capture came after a
secret, 12-day operation, which only ten senior Turkish officials
knew about.
</P>
<P>
The PKK's war with the Turkish government has claimed over
37,000 lives since August 1984.

Viktor Klima Tuesday strongly condemned the Kurds for storming the
Greek embassy in Vienna and taking hostage the Greek ambassador,
his wife and three other Greek diplomats.
</P>
<P>
The Kurds attacked or occupied the Greek embassies across
Europe on learning the news that their leader Abdullah Ocalan had
been handed over by Greece to Kenyan authorities in Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
Klima described the action by the Kurds as a terrorist one.
</P>
<P>
Austrian Minister of Foreign Affairs Wolfgang Schuessel and
Interior Minister Karl Schloegl were holding emergency talks and
keeping in contact with Greek President Costis Stephanopoulos, who
is in Austria for a visit, and Greek Prime Minister Constantinos
Simitis for resolving the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Austrian President Thomas Klestil said that he will continue to
accompany his Greek counterpart to complete the tour as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
Stephanopoulos said that his visit will not be altered by the
violent actions by the Kurds.
</P>
<P>
At about 5 a.m. local time, a group of 15 Kurds broke into and
occupied the Greek embassy here and took hostage the people inside,
including the ambassador's family.
</P>
<P>
Riot policemen have surrounded the embassy. But so far they
have not established contact with the Kurds holed up inside the
embassy building.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan embassy in Vienna was also occupied by another group
of Kurds.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan, who Turkey has been seeking for waging a guerrilla war
for autonomy, was brought back to Turkey early Tuesday, Turkish
Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit said in Ankara at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
"He has been in Turkey since 3 a.m. (0100 GMT) this morning,"
Ecevit said, adding the rebel leader was captured unharmed.

<HEADLINE> 25,000 Businesses Bankrupt in Singapore Last Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Speaking at the Chinese Lunar New Year celebration gathering
held by the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry,
Lee said the figure provided by the Registry of Businesses (RCB)
shows that more than 25,000 businesses ceased operations in this
country in 1998 compared with the average of 20,000 a year from
1994 to 1997.
</P>
<P>
Lee said bankruptcy petitions last year also increased to
4,073, which is 68 percent higher than in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Mentioning the labor market, the minister said retrenchments
soared to a record high of more than 2,800 last year, job
vacancies dropped to an unprecedented low of about 15,400 in
September 1998 compared with about 45,000 vacancies a year ago and
unemployment had also risen to 4.5 percent by September 1998 and
remained high to the end of December 1998.
</P>
<P>
Conceding these numbers reflected the economic sharp downturn
in Singapore, Lee said his country's fundamentals remain sound and
 Singaporeans should not be discouraged.
</P>
<P>
The year of the Tiger turned out to be a very difficult and
turbulent year, Lee said. "We can welcome the year of the Rabbit
with confidence and hope."

</P>
<P>
Sannha Abhay, deputy chief of Lao National Tourism Authority

<HEADLINE> Greece Threatens to Take Action If Hostages Not Released </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, February 16 (Xinhua) - Greek Foreign Minister Theodoros
Pangalos threatened on Tuesday to take action against Kurdish
activists if the Kurds did not release hostages they have taken.
</P>
<P>
Pangalos told a press conference that Greece will take "
merciless" actions against the Kurdish activists if the hostages
are not released by 1000 GMT.
</P>
<P>
He said the wife and eight-year-old child of the Greek
ambassador in The Hague were being threatened with a hand grenade.
</P>
<P>
The Greek ambassador in Vienna, his wife and three employees
were also being held hostage by supporters of the Kurdish rebel
leader Abdullah Ocalan, who were turned over to Turkey by the
Greek embassy to Kenya overnight Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Greek police have been ordered to detain any Kurds in public
places on sight, fearing they had plans to take over public
buildings.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan's capture ignited a wave of protests by Kurds across
Europe, directed largely against Greece.
</P>
<P>
Greek embassies and consulates were occupied or attacked in
Bonn, Paris, The Hague, Moscow, Brussels, Copenhagen, Vienna,
Marseille and Frankfurt and the European headquarters of the
United Nations in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
At Greek embassies in Athens and London, Kurdish protesters
threatened to commit mass suicide in support of Ocalan.
</P>
<P>
The Kurdish rebel leader, who Turkey has been seeking for
waging a guerrilla war for autonomy, was brought back to Turkey
early Tuesday, Turkish Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit announced.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan, who has been in an unknown place since he left Rome in
January, was seen most recently in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish prime minister did not confirm whether Ocalan was
brought to Turkey from Kenya and he refused to give any details
about his capture.
</P>
<P>
"He has been in Turkey since 3 a.m. (0100 GMT) this morning,"
Ecevit said, adding the rebel leader was captured unharmed.

MOSCOW, February 16 (Xinhua) -- About 30 Kurds, who doused
themselves in gasoline, broke into the building of the United
Nations' mission Tuesday in Yerevan, Armenia, and held two U.N.
workers hostage, Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
The Kurds are demanding that their leader Abdullah Ocalan be
freed. The leader of Turkey's outlawed Kurdish Workers Party, who
is wanted on terrorism charges, was reportedly back in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The building of the U.N. mission has been encircled by Kurds
who live in Armenia.
</P>
<P>
Also on Tuesday, Kurds tried to break into the consular
department of the Greek Embassy in Armenia, but the attempt was
foiled by Armenian police, Interfax said.
</P>
<P>
Kurds staged similar protests against Greek embassies and
consulates in Britain, France, Germany, Greece, Switzerland,
Austria and a number of other European countries Tuesday over
reports that Greece handed Ocalan over to Kenyan authorities.

<HEADLINE> Chinese New Year Starts in HK with Grand Parade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 16 (Xinhua) -- A float parade held here
Tuesday, the New Year's day on the Chinese Lunar calendar, to
welcome the Year of the Rabbit.
</P>
<P>
The 12 dazzling floats, each built on a 5.5 ton truck, and the
performance of 14 international and 31 local performing groups
along the Central-Wan Chai harborfront attracted more than 100,000
spectators all the way along the route.
</P>
<P>
The parade, organized by the Hong Kong Tourism Association (
HKTA), began at about 2:00 p.m. It was led by Lee Lai Sham, a Hong
Kong Goodwill Ambassador and an Olympic and Asian Games gold
medalist, and other Hong Kong Asian Games gold medalists.
</P>
<P>
Different from the traditional route at Tsim Sha Tsui East,
Kowloon, this year the parade took a new route.
</P>
<P>
Starting from the Tamar Site in Central, the procession of
floats and performing groups traveled along a circular route
through the Wan Chai North area, around the Hong Kong Convention
and Exhibition Center, and then returned to the Tamar Site.
</P>
<P>
This new route not only allowed many spectators to enjoy the
festive scene along the route, but also encompassed some of Hong
Kong's best-known sights including the spectacular harbor and the
state-of-the-art HKCEC, where the handover ceremony was held on
July 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
It also provided visitors to Hong Kong with the opportunity to
enjoy the unique atmosphere of a special Hong Kong celebration
side by side with local residents.
</P>
<P>
The float presented by the Cathay Pacific Airways Limited, the
title sponsor of this year's parade, took the leading position of
the parade.
</P>
<P>
Entitled "Bringing the World to Hong Kong", the Airways said
that its role is to bring the world to Hong Kong and Hong Kong to
the world and it has always been proud to be known as Hong Kong's
airline.
</P>
<P>
Administrative Secretary Anson Chan, patron of the parade, said
in her message that the Chinese New Year is the most important
festival in Hong Kong's calendar.
</P>
<P>
It is also the best time for visitors to experience the unique
flavor of this metropolitan and international city, where the
elements of tradition and modernity, the cultures of the East and
the West, blend together in such a harmonious and colorful way.
</P>
<P>
Chan said that Hong Kong's economy has had a difficult year.
But she said she was confident that at the end of this adjustment
process, Hong Kong will emerge leaner, stronger and better able to
tackle the challenges facing it in the Year of the Rabbit.

<P>
LONDON, February 16 (Xinhua) -- About 100 Kurdish demonstrators
who occupied the Greek embassy before dawn Tuesday said they were
ready to die for their leader Abdullah Ocalan.
</P>
<P>
Media reports here quoted a spokesman for the demonstrators
inside the embassy as saying: "We are ready to die. There are more
than 100 of us in here and we have petrol. We are ready to burn
ourselves."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said they had no weapons other than petrol. "We
will stay here until we get news from the Greeks about our leader.
We want the problem solved. We had no other choice about this," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators said they were Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK)
supporters. They said there was a man inside the embassy when they
occupied it before dawn on Tuesday but added: "He is happy with us
and wants to stay with us."
</P>
<P>
British police earlier said that about 50 demonstrators broke
into the embassy building in west London shortly before 0300 GMT
and about 200 had been moved away from the building.
</P>
<P>
Outside about 200 people were waving Kurdish flags, holding
pictures of Ocalan and chanting for his freedom.
</P>
<P>
Police closed off the road near the embassy and put the
demonstrators behind barricades. Fire engines were standing by.
Police said their negotiators had been in contact with the group
inside.
</P>
<P>
The Kurdish rebel leader, who Turkey has been seeking for

<HEADLINE> Osama Not in Hekmatyar Area: HIA Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Hizb-e-Islamic Afghanistan
(HIA) Tuesday denied press reports that Osama bin Laden has
arrived in an area controlled by former Afghan prime minister
Gulbuddin Hekmatyar's commanders in northern Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
"These are unfounded and mischievous reports," HIA spokesman
Dr. Ghairat Baheer said.
</P>
<P>
London-based Arabic newspaper Al-Hayat reported Monday that
Osama had left the Taliban's stronghold of Kandahar several days
ago and is in an area controlled by the former prime minister.
</P>
<P>
The daily quoted "informed" Afghan sources as saying that Osama
momentarily stopped in Hekmatyar areas along with the head of
Egypt's jehad (holy fight) group Ayman el-Zawahri and a dozen
Taliban soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Baheer said the Saudi dissident has not gone to the
HIA-controlled areas in the northern provinces of Kunduz and
Bughlan.
</P>
<P>
Afghanistan's dominant Taliban announced Saturday that Osama
has disappeared and they have no information as to whether he has
left Afghanistan or not.
</P>
<P>
Earlier some media reports suggested that Osama crossed the
Afghan-Iran border at Torghundi in western Afghan province of
Herat last Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
However, Iran's Foreign Ministry categorically denied the
reports and described them as "irresponsible and regrettable".
</P>
<P>
Washington accused Osama of masterminding the bombings of U.S.
embassies in Kenya and Tanzania on August 7 last year, which
killed more than 200 people including 12 American nationals.
</P>
<P>
But Osama had rejected Washington's accusations, saying that he
had no links with the blasts.
</P>
<P>
Despite repeated demands from Washington, the Taliban refused
to extradite or hand over Osama after the embassy bombings,
demanding proof of his involvement in terrorist activities.
</P>
<P>
In their recent meetings with senior Taliban officials, U.S.
Assistant Secretary of State Karl Inderfurth and British Minister
of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs Derek Fetchett had
renewed their pressure on the militia to expel the Saudi
dissident.

<P>
JERUSALEM, February 16 (Xinhua) - The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Foreign Ministry Director-General Eytan Bentsur met
Monday with Dutch Ambassador Como van Hellenberg Hubar in an
attempt to defuse the escalating tension between the two countries
over a 1992 Israeli plane crash near Amsterdam.
</P>
<P>
An Israeli parliamentary investigation of the crash, which
killed 43, has created a hostile environment in the Dutch media
toward Israel's national airline, El Al. The Israeli Foreign
Ministry fears that it might cloud diplomatic relations between
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Haaretz:
</P>
<P>
-- A surprise drop of 0.5 percent in Israel's Consumer Price
Index for January has prompted calls in the country for a
reduction in interest rates.
</P>
<P>
Various agencies said Monday that by lowering interest rates,
Bank of Israel Governor Jacob Frenkel could help bring the economy
out of what seems to be a full-blown recession.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Initial results from Labor Party primaries on Monday showed
legislator Shlomo Ben-Ami and former deputy chief of
General Staff Matan Vilna'i are the biggest winners, ranking the
first two in the Labor's slate of candidates for parliament.
</P>
<P>
Labor Party leader Ehud Barak and former prime minister Shimon
Peres were awarded the top slots without having to compete in the
primaries.

<HEADLINE> Crackdown on Video Games Near Schools in Phnom Penh Successful </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Phnom Penh municipality has
managed to reduce the presence of video games arcades near schools
dramatically since it launch a fresh crackdown on gambling and
gaming outlets in the city last month.
</P>
<P>
"The crackdown is very successful and right now there are
hardly any video games arcades operating within 200 meters of any
schools in the city," Sok Leakhena, deputy chief of the Phnom Penh
Municipality, was quoted by the Vision as saying.
</P>
<P>
In the past, the arcades located near schools were attracting
school children there and the owners had purposely established the
centers near schools to attract students as their main customers.
</P>
<P>
A teacher at a primary school said that the police action had
shown some results as the number of absentees in her class had
been drastically reduced.
</P>
<P>
Also, a parent said that she was happy that police had shut
down the video arcades near the schools as now she was quite sure
that her young son was attending school.
</P>
<P>
There has been alarming increase in the number of students
playing truant from schools. They are normally found in the video
games arcades or snooker centers located near the schools.
</P>
<P>
Describing this as a social problem, police officials said that
students were also resorting to extorting money from their class
or school mates to feed their passion for the games which is
addictive.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some analysts pointed out that only shutting down
video games arcades near school was not the long term solution,
the best way is to enhance the education to the students, let them
know the harmfulness.

ANKARA, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah
Ocalan, who Turkey has been seeking for waging a guerilla war for
autonomy, was brought back to Turkey early Tuesday, Turkish Prime
Minister Bulent Ecevit announced.

<HEADLINE> Kurds Protest in Europe Against Ocalan's Handover to Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Latest reports said that Ocalan, Turkey's most wanted man who
leads a guerrilla war against the Turkish government, has already
been brought to Turkey and will face a death penalty.
</P>
<P>
Kurdish protesters, most of whom are Ocalan supporters, stormed
Greek embassies and consulates in Britain, France, Germany,
Austria, Russia, Belgium, Denmark and the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
Greek Foreign Minister Theodoros Pangalos threatened to take
action against Kurdish activists' interests unless hostages being
held in Greek embassies around Europe were released.
</P>
<P>
The PKK has been fighting the Turkish authorities for 14 years
in a conflict estimated to have cost 29,000 lives.
</P>
<P>
Greece inherited the Ocalan problem this year after he was
denied refuge or forced out of Lebanon, Syria, Russia, Italy,
Germany, the Netherlands and other places.
</P>
<P>
A government statement in Athens during the night said he had
passed into the hands of the Kenyan authorities.
</P>
<P>
It said Ocalan decided to negotiate with Kenyan authorities,
who took charge of him late on Monday.
</P>
<P>
As the story broke, up to 50 demonstrators forced their way
into the Greek embassy in London early on Tuesday and barricaded
themselves inside.
</P>
<P>
Within a few hours, similar protests hit the Greek embassies in
Bonn, The Hague, Moscow, Brussels, Copenhagen and Vienna,
consulates in Marseille and Frankfurt and the European
headquarters of the United Nations in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
Greek ambassador to Austria was taken hostage and the Kenyan
embassy in Vienna was put on fire.
</P>
<P>
So far, the concerned European countries have taken emergency
measures to cope with the complicated situation.

<HEADLINE> ADB New President to Visit Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 16 (Xinhua) -- The new president of the Asian
Development Bank (ADB), Tadao Chino, is slated to visit Indonesia
between February 16 and 18,1999, and will have a talk with
President B.J. Habibie, official Antara News Agency reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Chino, who was appointed the new ADB president last month, is
also scheduled to hold a discussion with the Indonesian side on
the ADB's commitment to Indonesia, said the report.
</P>
<P>
ADB has promised to Indonesia it would assist reform and
restructuring in the financial sector, support reform and
restructuring in the real sector, and extend assistance to the
poor community affected by the adverse impact of the ongoing
economic crisis, particularly in connection with fulfillment of
daily necessities and the provision of health and education
services.
</P>
<P>
Last year the ADB gave its green light to two loan programs,
namely 1.5 billion U.S. dollars for the reform program in the
financial sector, and 300 million U.S. dollars for the development
program in the social welfare sector.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, ADB plans to extend financial aid totaling between 1.4
to 1.6 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
This aid is intended to finance restructuring in the
electricity sector, industrial and trade deregulation, and the
development of small-and-medium-scale and state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
ADB 1999 loan programs have also been expanded to reinforce the
social safety net programs, including the health, community and
regional development programs.

<HEADLINE> Bleak Months Ahead For Angolan War Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 16 (Xinhua) -- The World Food Program (WFP)
sounded an alarm over the worsening condition of more than half a
million Angolans who have been forced to flee their homes in fear
of the fighting, according to a news release from the agency's
Nairobi office available here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
WFP said reports of rising malnutrition rates and disease in
the country' s 550,000 internally displaced people are becoming a
cause for extreme concern. The agency feared that the situation
could start to get out of control in the months ahead should the
fighting not abate.
</P>
<P>
"The next few months are looking very grim," said Francesco
Strippoli, WFP's representative in Angola and the Head of the
U.N. Humanitarian Assistance Coordination Unit. "In fact, if the
fighting continues and intensifies we could have a large-scale
humanitarian catastrophe."
</P>
<P>
Several provinces are now reporting severe cases of
malnutrition among children and women. The malnourished are
falling prey to disease, with incidences of malaria and TB on the
rise. The appalling sanitary conditions in which tens of
thousands of displaced families live are also aggravating health
and nutritional problems.
</P>
<P>
While relief agencies have had renewed access to many towns in
recent weeks, relentless shelling of Malange town continues to
block WFP from resuming air deliveries which suspended last
December. Distribution of existing food stocks has been
extremely difficult due to a serious shortage of NGO partners in
the town.
</P>
<P>
However, over the past 10 days, WFP food was distributed to
almost 52, 000 people with the help of Government counterparts and
international NGOs. More needs to be done to address the worrying
nutritional state of some 70, 000 internally displaced people in
and around the city.
</P>
<P>
Strippoli said that a critical lack of food distribution
partners in other towns was also straining the agency's ability
to feed the hungry, and that unless the situation reversed, large
groups of internally displaced people and other vulnerable groups
could not be assisted.
</P>
<P>
"We are in a fierce uphill battle, trying to deliver large
amounts of food aid to an escalating number of hungry people. The
dangerous security environment is complicating our effort, with
people we're trying to help often caught behind the front-line of
the war," said Strippoli.
</P>
<P>
This month WFP hopes to deliver a total of 9,500 tons of food
throughout Angola, most of it aboard two cargo aircraft which fly
to eight central destinations on a daily basis. Extreme
insecurity on Angolan roads has forced WFP to airlift over 90
percent of its food in contrast to 20 percent six months ago.
</P>
<P>
In Angola, WFP is responsible for transporting food to central
locations where it is then turned over to national and
international NGOs and local authorities for distribution to the
vulnerable groups.

<HEADLINE> Pakistani Rice Export Expected to Pick Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani rice export is
assumed to pick up within this month, making the target of rice
export value of 700 million U.S. dollars achievable in the fiscal
year of 1998-99, an official source said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Export of rice in Pakistan has undergone a marginal decline of
7.3 percent in the past seven months (July to January 1998-99)
because of weak demand in the international market, said the
source.
</P>
<P>
During this period, 258.73 million U.S. dollars was earned from
the export of 847,764 tons of rice, comparing with 278.97 million
dollars in the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
However, the source said from February rice export will
accelerate because two major export orders are expected to
materialize.
</P>
<P>
300,000 tons of rice has been ordered by Indonesia and other
100,000 tons will be sold to an Italian businessman.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan has sold abroad rice worth 2.231 billion U.S. dollars
during the past five years. In 1997-98, Pakistan earned about 675
million dollars from rice export. The government are hoping bigger
rice export to enhance general exports in the current fiscal year.

<HEADLINE> Bombs Planted Against Americans: Officer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, February 16 (Xinhua) -- The bombs, which killed at
least four people and injured 35 others on Sunday night, is said
to target foreigners, especially U.S. citizens who frequent the
two bars in the suburb of Kabalagala.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's New Vision paper quoted some senior police officer as
saying that the terrorists were hoping to kill lots of Americans
including off- duty Marines who end up in the two bars at night.
</P>
<P>
Security services had suspected that a bombing might be
imminent but lacked the technical capacity to intercept it, the
officer, who prefers to be unnamed, told the paper.
</P>
<P>
He said most of the nine suspects arrested are Africans, adding
that security is being tightened in the area.
</P>
<P>
In a press release issued Monday, Minister of Internal Affairs
Tom Butime said that three telephone hot lines have been
established to enable the public to give clues to the police.
</P>
<P>
The police have come to conclusion that the two bombs were
domestically made. They were not powerful, but killed and injured
so many because they were planted in crowded places.
</P>
<P>
Police sources said that bomb experts from the police and
military had gathered the fragments for analysis to determine the
group that is responsible.
</P>
<P>
The bombs, which went off on the Valentine's Day, killed people
who were celebrating in the bars and injured many on-lookers.
</P>
<P>
President Yoweri Museveni has condemned the blasts as senseless
cowardly evil acts and called on people to be alert for any
suspicious things. He assured the nation that the government is
doing all it can to ensure the safety of its people.

<HEADLINE> Congo (K) Rebels Launch Major Offensive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Rebels and their backers in
eastern Congo (K) have launched a major offensive on all fronts,
particularly in the north and southeast, despite efforts for a
peaceful resolution to the conflict being spearheaded by Zambian
President Frederick Chiluba.
</P>
<P>
The daily Herald Tuesday quoted the Task Force headquarters of
the Southern African Development Community (SADC) as saying Monday
the rebels' ultimate objective was to capture Gbadolite in the
north, Kamina and Mbujimayi in the Katanga Province, Lubumbashi in
the south and finally launch an offensive to capture Kinshasa.
</P>
<P>
"While the SADC allied countries are fully devoted and
committed to the current peace initiatives, they will use all
available resources to deny the invaders any chances of a total
military victory," the Task Force headquarters said.
</P>
<P>
"SADC allied forces are currently engaged in battles with the
invading troops along the Congo River, notably in the general area
of Kabalo and along Lake Tanganyika in Moba," it said.
</P>
<P>
It said the invading forces had engaged in massive recruitment,
 reorganization and, of late, acquisition of new weapons of high
calibre.
</P>
<P>
"The invaders have since the beginning of the conflict used
peace talks to achieve military gains. They pretend to talk peace
while on the ground they are intensifying the war effort," the
headquarters said.
</P>
<P>
The SADC Allied Forces fighting in the DRC comprise Zimbabwe,
Angola and Namibia who, together with Chad, have sent troops to
help DRC President Laurent Kabila quell the rebellion which
erupted on August 2 last year.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe Defense Forces spokesman Chancellor Diye Monday said
the rebels had an insurmountable task of breaking through the
Allied Forces lines in all fronts in order to penetrate into the
DRC hinterland.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Uganda to Re-Issue Visas for UK Citizens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Uganda will begin issuing
visas next month to foreigners whose countries of origin demand
visas from Ugandans.
</P>
<P>
The decision by the cabinet is expected to take effect from
March 1 this year, the Monitor daily reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
This move will affect all Ugandan missions abroad. However,
visitors from countries which do not require Ugandans to carry
visas including East African Cooperation and member countries of
Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa will be exempted.
</P>
<P>
Uganda's High Commissioner to Britain George Kirya was quoted
as saying that Uganda chose to impose the limitation after its
goodwill gesture went unreciprocated.
</P>
<P>
Uganda has in the past waived the visa requirement for all
Europeans, Americans and Canadians coming into the country while
its own nationals going to these countries have had to go through
the incumbrances and expenses of obtaining visas.
</P>
<P>
Some officials in the immigration department said the
government intends to use proceeds from visas in maintaining its
largely run-down missions abroad.

<HEADLINE> Philippines to Amend Law for Mindanao Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 16 (Xinhua) -- As part of his commitment to
pursue lasting peace in the Southern Philippines, President Joseph
Estrada Tuesday certified as urgent a bill in the congress
proposing to amend the Organic Act for Muslim Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
Estrada signed the certification calling for speedy passage of
the bill at a meeting here Tuesday morning, according to a
presidential palace statement.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that Estrada urged congressional leaders to
facilitate the passage of the bill, which is part of the
government's commitment under the 1996 agreement with the Moro
National Liberation Front (MNLF).
</P>
<P>
Because of the Mindanao situation, the president wants the
amendment to the organic act as soon as possible, it said.
</P>
<P>
Recently, the Moro Islamic Liberation Front has intensified its
fighting for an independent Muslim state in Mindanao. President
Estrada is scheduled to visit Mindanao later this month and plans
to meet MILF leaders to discuss peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
However, MILF rebels said Monday that they will not change its
objective of an independent state in the south.
</P>
<P>
Under the peace agreement with the MNLF, the government is
committed to amend the organic act to pave the way for expansion
of the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM).
</P>
<P>
After the amendment, a plebiscite shall be held to determine if
the provinces and cities included in the expanded region want to
be part of this new setup.

<HEADLINE> Kenya's Imports Down 3.4 PC in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's imports fell by 3.4
percent in 1998, according to Kenyan Central Bank's Monthly
Economic Review for January available here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
All categories of imports except chemicals posted falling rates
while exports, except tea, also shrunk by 0.4 percent, the
reviewed said.
</P>
<P>
The review noted that such falls helped narrow the trade
deficit to 1, 161 million U.S. Dollars, down from 1,264 million
Dollars in 1997, which it said was due to the general slowdown in
economic growth in 1998.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, the review said, the falling trend in tourism which
began in 1996 continued, posting earnings at only 292 million
Dollars compared with 448 million Dollars in December 1996.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, foreign exchange reserves fell to 1.1 billion
Dollars in December 1998 compared to 1.4 billion in the same
month in 1997, the review added.
</P>
<P>
In explaining the decline, the review said, the fall was not a
cause for worry as the stock was sufficient to cover four months
worth of imports. And the over all balance of trade for December
1998 recorded a 74-million- Dollar surplus.

CANBERRA, Feburary 16 (Xinhua) -- Sydney Olympic Organizing
Committee (SOCOG) President Michael Knight said Tuesday he is
optimistic about the running of the 2000 Summer Olympic Games even
if organizers fail to meet the revenue target.
</P>
<P>
"I'm confident the existing sponsors will remain. However, you
can run a pretty fantastic Olympic Games on 2.4 billion (
Australian) dollars (about 1.53 billion U.S. dollars), you can do
even better if you can get another couple of hundred million,"
Knight said.
</P>
<P>
Knight's said this after several Olympic sponsors, including
South Korean electronics conglomerate Samsung, Australian car
manufacturer Holden and finance company John Hancock expressed
concern over the widening corruption scandal affecting the
reputation of the Olympic Movement.
</P>
<P>
Their comments have prompted concern that SOCOG could lose the
100 million Australian dollars these companies have already
contributed to the Games' preparations and the 200 million
Australian dollars SOCOG needs to raise in additional sponsorship
money.

The president will push through the visit despite threats to
his life from secessionist groups, Zamora said.

"There is still a secessionist movement, and we can't expect
all of its proponents to show good intentions when the president
goes to Mindanao. Our intelligence tells us that there are
threats," he said.

<P>
MILF leader Salamat said Monday that he will not abandon the
demand for the establishment of an independent state in Mindanao

produce, especially cereals as the looming drought will trigger a
shortage of food.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Denies Talks with Maradona to Coach National Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait sports officials Monday
denied reports that they had opened talks with former Argentinian
football superstar Diego Maradona aimed at hiring him to coach the
Gulf state's national team following the resignation of its Czech
trainer.
</P>
<P>
An official aide to Sheikh Ahmed Fahed al-Sabah, the head of
the Kuwait Football Association (KFA), said that "it is untrue"
that Kuwait had asked Argenti-born Maradona to coach its team.
</P>
<P>
"They are rumours. We have not begun talks yet on who will
replace our coach. Next week we will have a meeting, and the
subject will be discussed then," said the official close to Sheikh
Ahmed Fahed, who also heads the Kuwait-based Asian Olympic
Committee.
</P>
<P>
Reports from Buenos Aires on Sunday had quoted Maradona as
saying that he had received a coaching offer from Kuwait and that
he there was a good chance he would assume the post.
</P>
<P>
He added that his initial contacts with Kuwaiti officials had
taken place during a recent visit to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Last month Kuwait's national football team coach, Milan
Macalla, resigned after a six-year coaching career in the Gulf
state.
</P>
<P>
Macalla first trained Kuwait's Kazma Club team for a short
while and was then hired by the KFA to rebuild the national
football team. He led the Kuwaiti team to victory in two
consecutive Gulf Cups, most recently in late 1998.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait's football team is considered one of the best in Asia.
</P>
<P>
Maradona played a major role in the Argentinian teams which
won the World Cup in 1986 and were runners-up in 1990.

<HEADLINE> French Yachtwoman Fighting for Survival in Southern Ocean </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, February 16 (Xinhua) -- French yachtswoman Isabelle
Autissier was fighting for survival Tuesday after apparently
capsizing in the Southern Ocean during the solo around the world
race, organizers said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Fellow race competitor, Italian Giovanni Soldini, had turned
south into mountainous seas and bad weather to reach the stricken
yacht and was Autissier's best chance of rescue, organizers said.
</P>
<P>
Autissier sent a mayday and made a brief call to her Paris
headquarters after apparently being capsized by 35-knot winds and
waves reaches 40 feet (12 meters), Peter Rachtman, an Auckland-
based race director, said.
</P>
<P>
A report on the Around Alone race's official Internet page said
Autissier's team headquarters had received a radio call over
crackling interference shortly before the emergency beacon was set
off. She said she had been capsized, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Organizers said earlier Tuesday that Autissier had taken to a
liferaft, but Rachtman said this had not been confirmed.
</P>
<P>
Soldini was at least 10 hours away when he turned south, and
heading into heavy seas with waves at a height of up to 40 feet (
12 meters).
</P>
<P>
Two other competitors were on their way to the area, but
organizers said the nearest boat was at least three days away.
</P>
<P>
Autissier, the overall race leader, was rescued by an
Australian navy vessel in the 1994-95 Around Alone race when her
yacht was dismasted.
</P>
<P>
The latest race weather report for the area for the next 24
hours was for 30 to 50 knot winds and very large seas.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand's Maritime Safety Authority was still trying to
locate any vessels in the area, and said Chilean authorities were
overseeing the rescue.
</P>
<P>
Rescue Coordination Center spokesman Stuart Clark said Soldini
was Autissier's best chance of rescue.

<HEADLINE> Philippines' Trade Deficit Posts Big Drop in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 16 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' trade deficit
dropped to 164 million U.S. dollars in 1998, the lowest in 26
years, after the country reduced its imports by 17.5 percent in
the year, the National Statistics Office said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In a report released here, the office said that total
merchandise imports for 1998 dipped by 17.5 percent to 29.660
billion dollars from 35.934 billion dollars in 1997, while export
revenue increased 16.9 percent to 29.496 billion dollars in the
year from 25.228 billion dollars in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
"Total trade settled at 59.156 billion dollars which was 3.3
percent below the 61.162 billion dollars recorded in 1997," the
office said.
</P>
<P>
It said that the country's trade deficit dipped to 164 million
dollars in the year, the lowest in 26 years.
</P>
<P>
The big reduction in the country's trade deficit is attributed
to less imports caused by the slowdown of the nation's economic
growth, which shrank by 0.5 percent in 1998, analysts said.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Closes Softer as Yen Falls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 16 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar lost
about two thirds of a U.S. cent Tuesday as the Japanese yen took a
dive against the U.S. currency.
</P>
<P>
Deutsche Bank currency strategist Tim Moloney said comments
from a Japanese official welcoming a weaker Japanese yen saw that
currency fall, dragging the domestic unit along with it.
</P>
<P>
At the close of trading Tuesday in Sydney the Australian dollar
was at 64.21 U.S. cents from 64.87 U.S. cents Monday.
</P>
<P>
During the day it fell to a low of 64.09 U.S. cents and reached
a high of 64.65 U.S. cents.
</P>
<P>
"The key factor undermining the Aussie today was the fall in
the yen," Moloney said.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of Japan eased its overnight interest rate by 10 basis
points to 0.15 percent Friday from 0.25 percent previously.
</P>
<P>
Moloney said commodity prices were the key factor now for the
Australian dollar.
</P>
<P>
At the close Tuesday in Sydney, the Australian currency was
buying 74.53 Japanese yen from 74.17 and 0.5736 euro from 0.5752
euro.

<HEADLINE> Museveni Condemns Bombings in Kampala </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni has condemned Sunday night's terrorist bombings in
Kampala's suburb of Kabalagala which killed four and injured more
than 30 others.
</P>
<P>
In a press release Tuesday, Museveni said he was shocked and
saddened to learn that four people has lost their lives while 35
others were injured in two bomb blasts which occurred at two bars
at 9:30 p.m. and 9:50 p.m. respectively.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his deepest and most heart-felt condolences to the
families of those killed and injured in these incidents.
</P>
<P>
Museveni described the blasts as "senseless barbaric acts"
which evil- minded terrorists have inflicted on innocent people.
</P>
<P>
He assured the nation that the government, through its security
agencies, has been working around the clock to protect the lives
of people wherever they are and to identify and ferret out the
authors and implementers of these cowardly evil acts.
</P>
<P>
The president called on the general public to supplement the
government's efforts and always be on the alert for any suspicious
actions.
</P>
<P>
The Telex bar and Family shop, which are within 20 meters of
each other, are said to be frequented by foreigners.
</P>
<P>
Police spokesman Bob Ngobi told Xinhua Tuesday morning in a
telephone interview that so far nine suspects have been arrested,
most of whom are foreigners.
</P>
<P>
He said so far he could not establish their motive but the
investigations are still under way.

<HEADLINE> Road Accidents Kills 2,970 People In Kenya in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Two thousand nine hundred and
seventy people lost their lives through road accidents that
occurred in Kenya in 1998, Kenyan Traffic Police Commandant
Philemon Arodi Agong'o disclosed Monday.
</P>
<P>
The traffic police boss said this was a decrease in the number
of death toll compared to 3,022 lives lost in 1997, adding that
292 people were killed in accidents last December alone, he was
quoted by the Kenya Time newspaper as saying Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Abong'o said the on-going police swoop on unroadworthy vehicles
and reckless driving would go a long way in curbing road
incidents and the road operations since late last year had
reversed the trend in the number of road accidents.
</P>
<P>
He revealed that 1,142 accidents were reported in January this
year compared to 1,459 in the 1998 same period and 238 people
died in road accidents in the past one month compared to 292 last
year.
</P>
<P>
The commandant appealed to motorists and other road users to
comply with the law, saying that obedience to traffic laws was
key to road safety.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that police had launched a continuous massive
road safety campaign targeting both motorist and other members to
the public to enlighten them on road safety and such exercise
would involve distribution of copies of the highway code to the
public.

<HEADLINE> Tibetan Antelope Finds Friends in Nature (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 16 (Xinhua) -- A Beijing-based independent
environmental organization has launched a campaign to save the
Tibetan antelope, an endangered species which is being killed
illegally to make the shahtoosh shawls.
</P>
<P>
Liang Congjie, president of China's most active independent
environmental group, Friends of Nature, said that shahtoosh shawls,
which are made from the fleece and fur of Tibetan antelope and
fetch thousands of dollars in fashion shops in London, Paris, New
York City and Hong Kong, are being "fashioned for extinction".
</P>
<P>
On October 6, 1998, Liang, the retired history professor sent a
letter to the British Prime Minister during his state visit to
China, asking Tony Blair to use his personal influence to raise
the awareness of the plight of Tibetan antelope.
</P>
<P>
Blair's response was encouraging. He assured the 66-year-old
campaigner in his written reply the following day that he shared
Liang's "revulsion over the slaughter of the antelopes", and would
be contacting British and European Union environmental authorities
about the illegal trade.
</P>
<P>
Set up in 1994, Friends of Nature has attracted more than 500
individual members to lobby the Chinese government and raise
national awareness on such issues as deforestation, the protection
of the gold snub-nosed monkey and the environmental education in
schools. But its biggest campaign to date is to save the Tibetan
antelope, or "chiru".
</P>
<P>
Professor Liang, also a member of the Chinese People's
Political Consultative Conference, and his organization are rising
to the challenge of carrying on the battle, not in the sense of
chasing poachers on the plateau, but by drawing international
attention to the bloody slaughter of the Tibetan antelope.
</P>
<P>
Occupying a hostile habitat on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau some
4,500 meters above sea level, the Chinese Forestry Association
estimates that in 1995, there were an estimated 75,000-100,000
head of antelopes on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.
</P>
<P>
Fur of Tibetan antelope, known as the "king of wool", is sold,
illegally, to make the world's most expensive shawl.
</P>
<P>
Shawls on sale for 11,000 US dollars each were seized in 1997
by British police during a raid on a shop in South Audley Street,
Mayfair, London. In the same year, Hong Kong police found 186
shawls. French customs have reportedly seized 1,000 shahtoosh
shawls since 1994.

<HEADLINE> Tibetan Antelope Finds Friends in Nature (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Since 1990, Chinese authorities have caught around 3,000
poachers, confiscated more than 17,000 Tibetan antelope hides and
1,100 kg of antelope fur. Soi'nam Daje, deputy head of Zhiduo
Autonomous County, who volunteered to lead the patrol in the vast
Hoh Xil, a nature reserve of 46,000 sq meters in the Qinghai-Tibet
Plateau where the antelope live, and safeguard the antelope, was
killed in a gun fight with poachers in January 1994.
</P>
<P>
Zhaba Doje, Soi'nam Daje's brother-in-law, succeeded him in
August 1995, and picked his team of 17 anti-poaching fighters
which has since been dubbed the Wild Yak Anti-poaching Squad".
Despite lack of funds and appalling conditions, the squad had
captured more than 400 poachers, confiscating 3,307 antelope hides
by September 1998.
</P>
<P>
In September 1998, Friends of Nature, together with the China
Green News, a daily under the State Forestry Administration,
invited Zhaba and two of his colleagues to Beijing for discussions
with environmental officials and fundraising. Unfortunately,
Zhaba was reportedly committed suicide after he filled dead man's
shoes by replacing Soi'nam Daje, his brother-in-law.
</P>
<P>
"The death of Zhaba Doje has made the anti-poaching situation
even more serious," said Li Wen, an official with Qinghai
Provincial Forestry Bureau and an admirer of the two Tibetan
officials.
</P>
<P>
Li said that since the adverse conditions in Hoh Xil and the
mobility of poachers both defy crackdown from outside. Anti-
poaching work this winter will be seriously affected by Zhaba's
departure.
</P>
<P>
But the local government will continue the efforts to fight
against poaching in Hoh Xil, he said.
</P>
<P>
As Professor Liang put it, "The price of anti-poaching work is
dear, and there remains much for the government to do for the
issue, but I'm sure that the Chinese government will take more
effective measures to protect the Tibetan antelope."
</P>
<P>
The government published a "whitepaper" report in mid-December
1998, declaring its resolve to crack down on the poaching of the
Tibetan antelope and appealing for international efforts to put an
end to the illegal fur trade.

<HEADLINE> Congo (K) Rebels Launch Major Offensive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Rebels and their backers in
eastern Congo (K) have launched a major offensive on all fronts,
particularly in the north and southeast, despite efforts for a
peaceful resolution to the conflict being spearheaded by Zambian
President Frederick Chiluba.
</P>
<P>
The daily Herald Tuesday quoted the Task Force headquarters of
the Southern African Development Community (SADC) as saying Monday
the rebels' ultimate objective was to capture Gbadolite in the
north, Kamina and Mbujimayi in the Katanga Province, Lubumbashi in
the south and finally launch an offensive to capture Kinshasa.
</P>
<P>
"While the SADC allied countries are fully devoted and
committed to the current peace initiatives, they will use all
available resources to deny the invaders any chances of a total
military victory," the Task Force headquarters said.
</P>
<P>
"SADC allied forces are currently engaged in battles with the
invading troops along the Congo River, notably in the general area
of Kabalo and along Lake Tanganyika in Moba," it said.
</P>
<P>
It said the invading forces had engaged in massive recruitment,
 reorganization and, of late, acquisition of new weapons of high
calibre.
</P>
<P>
"The invaders have since the beginning of the conflict used
peace talks to achieve military gains. They pretend to talk peace
while on the ground they are intensifying the war effort," the
headquarters said.
</P>
<P>
The SADC Allied Forces fighting in the DRC comprise Zimbabwe,
Angola and Namibia who, together with Chad, have sent troops to
help DRC President Laurent Kabila quell the rebellion which
erupted on August 2 last year.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe Defense Forces spokesman Chancellor Diye Monday said
the rebels had an insurmountable task of breaking through the
Allied Forces lines in all fronts in order to penetrate into the
DRC hinterland.
</P>
<P>
Military and security officials from several African nations
held talks in Lusaka last week to try and secure a truce in the
DRC but the rebels dismissed the talks, saying their absence from
the proceedings meant nothing meaningful could be achieved, the
paper reported.

<HEADLINE> Joint Indo-Lanka Venture to Expand Cashew Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, February 16 (Xinhua) -- India and Sri Lanka will soon
set up a joint venture to expand cashew exports of both countries,
the official Daily News reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Managing Director of the Indian Cashew Manufacturers'
Association T. Pillai who was in Sri Lanka recently agreed to
collaborate in this venture when he met Internal and International
Commerce Minister Kingsley Wickramaratne, the report said.
</P>
<P>
"There is a great demand for cashew in the world. But both
India and Sri Lanka have failed to meet the demand," Wickramaratne
was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Although Sri Lanka's cashew trees grow luxuriantly their yield
is not very satisfactory. When India harvests four tons of cashew
from an acre, Sri Lanka harvests only half a ton.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka hopes to benefit from India's technological expertise
to increase production, Wickramaratne said.
</P>
<P>
"The joint venture will help us develop our cashew industry to
generate employment to about 500 people," he added.
</P>
<P>
Indian hopes the proposed joint venture will help develop the
cashew industry in both countries to earn foreign exchange,
according to Pillai.

VIENNA -- The average price for seven kinds of crude oil in the
world market is still sliding, according to the figures published
Monday by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).
</P>
<P>
The average price dropped to 9.66 U.S. dollars a barrel from
last week's 10.51 dollars, much lower than last year's 12.28
dollars a barrel. It is also far lower than OPEC's reference price
of 21 dollars a barrel.
</P>
<P>
Oil market analysts said here that the slide is due to the
oversupply in the world market. To make up the loss caused by
price slide, some oil producing countries have been producing and
selling more oil, which has in turn deteriorated the situation. (

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh's High Court Issues Rule on Hartal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, February 16 (Xinhua) -- The High Court Division of the
Bangladesh Supreme Court on Monday issued a rule upon the ruling
and the opposition parties and the government to "show cause why
pro- and anti-hartal activities shall not be declared cognizable
offense," newspapers here reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
It is for the first time in the history of the country that a
suo moto rule has been issued by the highest court on the issue of
hartal. Suo moto, a legal term, means "acting on its own."
</P>
<P>
The rule was issued, following reports in a national Bengali
daily on February 10-12 on the growing concern over the repeated
hartals in the country, upon Awami League Secretary General Md.
Zillur Rahman, Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) Secretary
General Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan, and secretaries of the Home Ministry
and the Ministry of Law, Justice and Parliament Affairs.
</P>
<P>
The high court division in its rule asked them to show cause on
March 1, the date fixed for hearing of the rule, as to why the
criminal courts and police should not be directed to take action
by treating pro-hartal and anti-hartal activities cognizable
offense, and pass such other orders as it deemed fit and proper.
</P>
<P>
On February 9-11, the BNP-led opposition alliance called a
60-hour countrywide hartal to press home their four-point demand,
including replacement of the chief election commissioner, for
joining the country's municipal elections scheduled to be held
later this month.
</P>
<P>
Six people, including a policeman, were killed and hundreds of
others sustained bullet wounds and bomb blast injuries during
clashes between pro- and anti-hartal activists.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the BNP-led opposition alliance has finalized its
next course of action to resist the ensuing polls in 140
municipalities across the country from February 23 to 25, The New
Nation daily newspaper reported.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian President Reveals Move by Prabowo in May 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President B.J.
Habibie Monday revealed, for the first time, military movements
launched by Lieut. Gen. Prabowo May 22 last year following the
down-fall of former president Soeharto, Prabowo's father-in-law.
</P>
<P>
In a impromptu speech delivered before participants of the 2nd
Asian-German Editors Forum at the Merdeka Palace, the president
said he received a report on the troop concentration from
Indonesian Armed Forces (ABRI) Commander/Defense Minister General
Wiranto.
</P>
<P>
"He (Wiranto) said, troops under the command of --I don't need
to conceal his name now -- General Prabowo, were concentrated in a
number of places, including in the proximity of my house," local
leading newspapers Tuesday quoted Habibie as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Since I was also concurrently the highest commander of the
Armed Forces, General Wiranto sought my advice on what to do. I
said he (Prabowo) should withdraw the troops," the president said.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto was forced to down on May 21, 1998 amid the country's
worst political and economic crisis in decades. On the same day,
Habibie took office.
</P>
<P>
From May 13 to 15, violence took place in Jakarta, capital of
Indonesia, and some other cities in the country, killing more than
1200 people and damaging nearly ten thousands of buildings.
</P>
<P>
After the step down of Soeharto who ruled the country for 32
years, riot-torn Jakarta was then overwhelmed by rumors of coup
attempt by the once all-powerful military.
</P>
<P>
Prabowo, then head of the Army Strategic Reserves Command, was
one of the most powerful men in the uniform and led the unit
dubbed an 'Army within the Army' and also had loyalists in the
Special Forces Kopassus which he had headed previously.
</P>
<P>
"I took the oath of office at 9:05 a.m. Some time past
midnight, at exactly 1:32 a.m. I held a briefing with all cabinet
members, except the minister of defense," said Habibie.
</P>
<P>
"In the morning, just before going to the palace, he (Wiranto)
said he received a report on the concentration of troops under
Prabowo."
</P>
<P>
The president then ordered Wiranto to sack Prabowo from his
post and transferred him to a non-combat position in the Army
Command School in Bandung, west Java. It was only one day after
the long-ruling Soeharto stepped down.
</P>
<P>
The ever-savvy Prabowo was dismissed from his military duty
months afterwards on account of his alleged involvement in the
kidnapping of political activists during his tenure as head of
Kopassus.
</P>
<P>
Some reports said earlier, Prabowo and some other high-ranking
officers also involved in the May riots and rapes.
</P>
<P>
Prabowo has been reportedly living in Amman, Jordan, to
represent the business interests of his brother Hashim.

<HEADLINE> Crude Oil Price Continues to Slide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, February 15 (Xinhua) -- The average price for seven
kinds of crude oil in the world market is still sliding, according
to the figures published Monday by the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries (OPEC).
</P>
<P>
The average price dropped to 9.66 U.S. dollars a barrel from
last week's 10.51 dollars, much lower than last year's 12.28
dollars a barrel. It is also far lower than OPEC's reference price
of 21 dollars a barrel.
</P>
<P>
Oil market analysts said here that the slide is due to the
oversupply in the world market. To make up the loss caused by
price slide, some oil producing countries have been producing and
selling more oil, which has in turn deteriorated the situation.

<HEADLINE> Bulgarian President Forges New Ties With Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Bulgarian President Petar
Stoyanov returned from a two-day visit to Russia Monday, claiming
to have mended ties between the two nations which had become
strained with Bulgaria's focus on the West.
</P>
<P>
Most of the obstacles that hindered Bulgarian-Russian relations
had been cleared and the two countries would be able to develop
trade and economic relations, said Stoyanov.
</P>
<P>
Stoyanov thanked Russia for including Bulgaria in the list of
countries that enjoyed a favorable treatment in customs taxation,
reported the Bulgarian Telegraph Agency.
</P>
<P>
Russia has been unhappy about Stoyanov's ruling Union of
Democratic Forces because of its push for Bulgaria to join NATO
and establish closer ties with West.
</P>
<P>
The UDF, which came to power two years ago, has tried to
gradually convince Russian leaders that Bulgaria's political
turnaround is not necessarily opposed to traditional ties with
Russia, a fellow Slavic nation.
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria is heavily dependent on imports of Russian oil,
natural gas, nuclear fuel and raw materials and needs to regain
its once wide access to the Russian market to help heal its ailing
economy.
</P>
<P>
During the visit to Moscow, Stoyanov discussed with Russian
Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov the repayment of some 50 million U.
S. dollars of Russian debt to Bulgaria with spare parts for
Russian-made MIG planes.

<HEADLINE> hke - Rodman and Lakers Still in Holding Pattern </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Dennis Rodman may be in a
Los Angeles Lakers uniform as early as Tuesday when the team hosts
the Charlotte Hornes.
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Times reported Saturday that Rodman decided to
join the Lakers for the veteran's minimum of one million U.S.
Dollars, pro-rated to $600,000 for the shortened season.
</P>
<P>
The forward also would receive another $3 million from an
endorsement contract with Converse.
</P>
<P>
However, the Lakers have not confirmed if an agreement has been
reached.
</P>
<P>
The report said Rodman's agent, Steve Chasman of International
Creative Management, has been negotiating with the Lakers for
almost two weeks and that Rodman has received a personal
invitation to join the Lakers from owner Jerry Buss.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper also reported that Chaseman has discussed
possible movie deals for Rodman with Fox, which holds an option to
buy into the Lakers as a limited partner.
</P>
<P>
The 37-year-old Rodman has led the NBA in rebounding each of
the last seven seasons and has been part of five NBA championship
teams, including the last three with the Chicago Bulls.
</P>
<P>
Rodman also won titles with the Detroit Pistons in 1989 and
1990.
</P>
<P>
His rebounding expertise, however, comes at a price. He has
been suspended six times in the last seven years, including twice
by the league, and once when he kicked a cameraman in the groin.
</P>
<P>
Rodman began his NBA career with the Pistons in 1986 and was a
key member of their back-to-back championship teams. He was NBA
Defensive Player of the Year in 1990 and 1991 and earned All-Star
berths in 1990 and 1992.

<P>
TIANJIN, February 16 (Xinhua) -- A recent survey of people in
the northern Chinese city of Tianjin showed that they have changed
their ideas about the lunar New Year and are moving away from
family gatherings toward other kinds of activities.
</P>
<P>
Many want to spend this year's Spring Festival, which falls on
February 16, taking part in more colorful activities like outings,
parties, or even physical exercises.
</P>
<P>
Some 36 percent think that spring Festival is a good time to
get together with relatives and friends for parties because they
have no time to do this during the busy work of the rest of the
year, and 24 percent think that people are not paying so much
attention to the holiday as before because they can now enjoy
better food and beautiful clothing year round.
</P>
<P>
About 21 percent of those questioned said that they get
exhausted during holidays, taking part in some obligatory but
really boring gatherings and dinners, and wasting a lot of money
and time.
</P>
<P>
Spring Festival is a traditional Chinese holiday, but people
are showing less interest in it as the standard of living
continues to improve, according to the survey.

<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, February 15 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill
Clinton concluded his working visit to neighboring Mexico on
Monday after signing nine agreements of cooperation with his
Mexican counterpart Ernesto Zedillo.
</P>
<P>
Among the agreements signed, emphasis was placed on the
memorandums of understanding on frontier violence, international
cooperation for the development and procedures of cooperation in
the application of the law.
</P>
<P>
Clinton arrived in Mexico on Sunday for his second visit to
Mexico during his presidency. The first one was in May, 1997.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts said that Clinton's visit to Mexico was a sign
that the U.S. places special attention to relations between the
two countries, which will be strengthened further by this new
visit.
</P>
<P>
After the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) was
founded in January 1994, trade between the United States and
Mexico has doubled, reaching 185 billion U.S. dollars by the end
of 1998, compared with 77 billion dollars in 1993.
</P>
<P>
It accounts for nearly 20 percent of the total of U.S. export
growth in the last five years. Mexico has been the second largest
trading partner of the United States since last September, only
after Canada.

<HEADLINE> Major Chinese Grain Producer Opening up Agriculture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, February 16 (Xinhua) -- East China's Anhui Province, one
of the country's major grain producers, plans to open its
agricultural sector wider to the outside world in a bid to
accelerate agricultural modernization.
</P>
<P>
An official from the provincial agricultural department said
that priority will be given to the introduction of fine strains of
livestock and crops and advanced agricultural techniques from
abroad.
</P>
<P>
More overseas investment will be used in comprehensively
exploiting agricultural resources and processing farm produce, the
official said.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few years, the province has approved a series of
overseas-funded projects in this sector, with total overseas
capital of over 400 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
These funds have been directed mainly into livestock breeding,
grain growing, irrigation, and low-yield land improvement.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, most of these projects have
progressed smoothly and are playing an important role in the local
economy. A Japanese-funded project completed last year transformed
18,600 hectares of low-yield farmland into the producer of 53.1
percent more grain.
</P>
<P>
Despite of the devastating flood, the province reported a total
agricultural output value of 64 billion yuan (7.71 billion U.S.
dollars) last year, 2.3 percent up over that of the previous year.

MADRID, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Former Italian national coach
Arrigo Sacchi announced formally Monday that he feels "exhausted"
and is quitting soccer for good.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks after he was fired Sunday as coach of
Atletico de Madrid, becoming the sixth coach to be sacked from the
Spanish league so far this season.
</P>
<P>
"Today I am leaving football for good," Sacchi said, "I am
exhausted."
</P>
<P>
Sacchi lasted seven months of a contract due to run through the
end of next season. The two-year contract reportedly included a
salary of 350 million pesetas (2.4 million U.S. dollars) per
season and a payment of 200 million pesetas (1.3 million U.S.
dollars) if he is sacked.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Carlos Aguiar, coach of second-division
Atletico de Madrid B, will serve as interim coach while the team
looks for a replacement.
</P>
<P>
Atletico de Madrid has been hit by four straight losses so far
under the leadership of Sacchi, currently languishing in ninth
place in Spanish first-division.

<HEADLINE> Single Currency for Latin America "Desirable," IDB Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, February 15 (Xinhua) -- A single currency in Latin
America would be a very important factor in regional integration,
Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) President Enrique Iglesias
said here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"A single currency in Latin America would be desirable without
any doubt. It would permit the coordination of macro-economic
policies and strengthen integration," he told a forum on the
elimination of poverty held in the National Autonomous University
of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
The adoption of a single currency could not be done in a day,
but the topic would form part of the agenda of the governments of
the region in future meetings, he told the forum called by the
bank.
</P>
<P>
The IDB president confirmed that the success of Europe's single
currency had prompted the debate.
</P>
<P>
He also highlighted the importance of social matters, and
reassured that the bank has established programs to help the
countries which maintain social policies to combat poverty.
</P>
<P>
Economic growth was the best way to attack marginalization and
poverty, the banker said, referring to the case of Mexico, which
had a growth rate double those of other Latin American countries
last year.
</P>
<P>
However there remained a big problem with the distribution of
wealth in the country, he noted.
</P>
<P>
In Latin America one in three, or around 150 million people,
still lived in poverty, according to Iglesias.

<P>
MEXICO CITY, February 15 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill
Clinton said on Monday that he would support his wife Hillary if
she ran for the Senate.
</P>
<P>
But he cautioned at the same time that Mrs. Clinton had made no
decision.
</P>
<P>
"First of all I think it's important that everyone understand
that people in New York started calling her. I don't think it had
ever occurred to her before a lot of people started calling and
asking her to do it," Clinton said to reporters after his private
meeting in Merida, Yucatan, with Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo.
</P>
<P>
"I think she would be terrific in the Senate... She would be
great if she did it," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
"She and I both would like to continue to be useful in public
affairs when we leave office," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Clinton's prospects were all the talk on Sunday TV news
programs with a Republican senator saying that the possible Senate
race between her and New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani would be a "
titanic struggle".

<HEADLINE> NZ Researchers Discover Blood Test for Cancer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Two Wellington Researchers
have discovered a blood test for cancer, in a breakthrough that
has huge potential for diagnosis and treatment of cancer.
</P>
<P>
Until now, there has been no simple blood test for cancer. The
new test is not restricted to detecting a particular type of
cancer and has the potential to be used with many cancers, the
Dominion, a Wellington-based newspaper, reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The test, developed by researchers Mike Berridge and An Tan
with the Malaghan Institute for Medical Research, has been used
successfully with colon, lung and liver cancer, and worked by
detecting a "fingerprint" left by rapidly growing cancer cells in
the serum component of blood, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
When a normal cell changes into a cancer cell, it "pigs out" on
 glucose and produces poisons and waste products that need to be
disposed of or recycled. The cancer cell does this by making new
proteins that convert the waste products into reusable
substances. That recycling leaves a distinct fingerprint, which
is discharged into the blood, Dr. Berridge was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
It is the enzyme activity of the fingerprint that causes a
simple color change to occur in a newly developed dye when mixed
with serum from blood.
</P>
<P>
Though the test is unlikely to be used as a method of
predicting the onset of cancer, it can be used to monitor the
progress and treatment of tumors, the newspaper said.

<HEADLINE> Cuba to Tighten Sentences Against Violent Crime </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Cuban lawmakers Monday
discussed toughening sentences for drug trafficking, assault and
other violent crimes.
</P>
<P>
A vote is expected by the end of the assembly session, probably
Tuesday, on a proposal that would increase Cuba's longest prison
sentence from 20 years to 30 years, and would lengthen terms for
repeat offenders. It also would expand the use of death penalty --
now rarely imposed --and the use of life sentences.
</P>
<P>
The tougher legislation came six weeks after Cuban leader Fedel
Castro called for harsher sentencing, saying that drug traffickers
"deserve capital punishment."
</P>
<P>
During his January 5 speech celebrating the 40th anniversary of
the National Revolutionary Police, Castro called Cuba's growing
crime problem a threat to the revolution.
</P>
<P>
"But we are against the death of the country," he said to the
applause from lawmakers. "The country has to be saved. That is an
absolute priority," said the Cuban leader.

<HEADLINE> Russia Marks 10th Anniversary of Pullout From Afghanistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Russia on Monday marked the
10th anniversary of the withdrawal of Soviet troops from
Afghanistan where a nine-year war killed at least 15,000 Soviet
servicemen and 1 million Afghans.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, attending a ceremony in the
Kremlin Palace, reflected that the deployment of Soviet troops in
Afghanistan "could have been avoided."
</P>
<P>
In December 1979, the Soviet Union sent 80,000 troops into the
Asian country to support the leaders it had installed there.
</P>
<P>
"It is absolutely obvious that nowadays force cannot be used
for a long time to remove or support the powers in a country which
is not prepared for this," Primakov said.
</P>
<P>
Mikhail Gorbachev, the last president of the Soviet Union who
was instrumental in the withdrawal of the last Soviet troops from
Afghanistan on February 15, 1989, said neither Russia nor the
international community have learned the lessons of the Afghan
war.
</P>
<P>
"This is shown by the conflicts in various regions. Political
leaders tend to be complacent and then take up arms and cause
death and destruction. The Afghan tragedy was followed by
tragedies in the former Yugoslavia, Chechnya, and Africa, and the
sufferings of the Iraqi people continue," he said.
</P>
<P>
"What is needed is the real democratization of international
relations, the strengthening of roles of the U.N. and other
international organization and the prevention of conflicts," the
Interfax news agency quoted Gorbachev as saying.

MOSCOW, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Foreign Minister Tofig
Zulfugarov of Azerbaijan left Baku Monday for Ankara on a trip to
discuss planned military cooperation that may involve stationing
Turkish armed forces in Azerbaijan, Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
Zulfugarov and his hosts will discuss Turkish assistance in
strengthening Azeri air force and air defenses and in training
Azeri military personnel in Turkey, Interfax said, quoting an
Azeri diplomat.
</P>
<P>
The diplomat said Russian weapons exports to neighboring
Armenia have upset the balance of power in the region, a charge
repeatedly denied by Moscow.
</P>
<P>
The trip was planned when Azeri President Heydar Aliyev was
getting medical treatment in Ankara last month, the diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
One purpose of the proposed deployment of Turkish troops in
Azerbaijan was to guard a strategic pipeline to export Azeri oil
via Turkey, he said.
</P>
<P>
The pipeline would carry oil to the Turkish Mediterranean port
of Ceyhan, a route suported by the United States but opposed by
major oil companies as it is longer and more costly than another
one crossing Iran.

The two no-fly zones were imposed by the U.S. and its allies in
the wake of the Gulf War in 1991, with the claimed aim to protect
Kurds in the north and Shiite Muslims in the south from Baghdad
oppression.
</P>
<P>
Iraq declared that it does not recognize these restricted zones
because of the lack of U.N. authorization and will fire at any
plane patrolling there as enemy plane violating Iraq's air space.
</P>
<P>
There have been recurring confrontations between U.S. and British
warplanes and Iraqi air defense over the past weeks. Baghdad
accused those planes of bombing civilian targets.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with foreign media, Ramadan said the warning
against Kuwait and Saudi Arabia also applied to U.S. base in
Incirlik.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Depety Prime Minister Tariq Aziz was visiting Ankara to
urge Turkish government to stop the use of the air base by the
U.S. in attacking Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit reportedly told Aziz the
U.S.-British mission will continue and is operating under the
strict control of Turkish officers.
</P>
<P>
Iraq said five civilians were killed and 22 others injured on
Monday when the U.S.-British warplanes launched missile attacks on
targets in southern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that 21 formations of U.S.-British
warplanes from the Saudi and Kuwaiti bases violated Iraqi airs

<HEADLINE> U.S. Lawmaker Announces Plans for Presidential </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 15 (Xinhua) -- John Kasich, chairman of
the U.S. House Budget Committee and a champion of tax cuts, laid
the groundwork Monday for a longshot presidential campaign for the
elections in 2000.
</P>
<P>
"We have to begin to run America from the bottom up," Kasich
told a crowd of 1,300 supporters in his adopted hometown in
Columbus of Ohio State.
</P>
<P>
Kasich, a nine-term Republican congressman who has been pushing
for a 10 percent, across-the-board tax cut, announced his plans to
file papers with the Federal Election Commission to formally
establish a presidential exploratory committee.
</P>
<P>
Kasich, 46, joins Senator John McCain of Arizona, conservative
activist Gary Bauer, former Vice President Dan Quayle and former
Secretary of Education Lamar Alexander as Republicans with
exploratory committees.
</P>
<P>
While less well-known than such front-runners as Quaye, Texas
Governor George W. Bush or former Cabinet secretary Elizabeth
Dole, Kasich said voters' lack of familiarity with him could work
to his advantage. He said he was different from other candidates
because he was not capitalizing on famous relatives or personal
wealth.
</P>
<P>
"I'm just a little different and a little fresher than a lot of
the people who are in politics now," Kasich said Sunday on NBC's
"Meet the Press."

<HEADLINE> U.S. American Airlines, Pilot Negotiations Resume </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Most of American Airlines'
flights took off as scheduled Monday as negotiations resumed
between the company and its pilot union, 10 days after pilots
began a sickout that tangled travel for more than a half-million
passengers.
</P>
<P>
Some 800 of American's 9,400 pilots were still listed as sick
Monday, down from the nearly 2,500 who were out last Thursday and
Friday, airline officials said. Cancellations of 11 percent of
flights was no worse than a day of bad weather in a hub city, the
officials added.
</P>
<P>
American's parent company, AMR Corporation, and the Allied
Pilots Association headed back to the table to negotiate the
integration of recently purchased Reno Air.
</P>
<P>
The two were in virtually the same place they were when pilots
began calling in sick and refusing overtime, canceling thousands
of flights and costing the airline tens of millions. Neither side
has changed their stance on pay for pilots who fly for Reno Air.
</P>
<P>
About 250 of the 2,250 flights scheduled were canceled because
some pilots weren't immediately available for flying. The Fort
Worth-based airline had canceled only 17 flights scheduled for
Tuesday, spokesman John Hotard said.
</P>
<P>
According to American, pilots have been taking themselves off
the sick list at a rapid rate since a federal judge held the union
and two top board members in contempt and promised sizable fines
against them last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Joe Kendall threatened a "significant" fine
against the pilots' union Saturday, saying that the union did not
do enough to encourage pilots to return to work after he ordered
the union to end the sickout last Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 6,000 flights have been canceled since the work action
began, costing American between 67 million and 90 million U.S.
dollars, according to Chris Chiames, a spokesman for AMR Corp. The
final total has not been projected.
</P>
<P>
The dispute is over how Reno Air pilots have been paid since
AMR took control of the low-cost carrier last December. AMR wants
to pay the pilots higher rates as they are retrained, but the
union believes their contract guarantees the pilots are paid more
from the purchase date.

<HEADLINE> Turkey, Iraq Try to Enhance Economic Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Despite its rejection of Iraqi
request to stop the use of a U.S. air base in its territory,
Turkey on Monday said it wants the U.N. sanctions against Iraq to
be lifted.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit told a press conference
that Turkey hopes the crippling sanctions be removed to facilitate
the enhancement of economic ties between Turkey and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
After talks with visiting Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq
Aziz, Ecevit said that there are proposals being brought for a new
chapter in the bilateral economic relations between Ankara and
Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
Turkey says that Ankara has lost about 30 billion U.S. dollars
since the U.N. embargo was imposed against Iraq following Iraqi
invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit said that the Turkish side expressed its displeasure
over the possibility of the division of Iraq and also its worries
about the ongoing U.N. embargo on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"Turkey is doing its best on these issues, but we know that
Iraq should do the necessary things on the matter," Ecevit said.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish prime minister said that Turkey will not accept
unnecessary attacks on Iraq, but added that U.S. jets were only
striking at Iraqi defense sites when attacked or targeted.
</P>
<P>
Aziz, who arrived here on Sunday for talks with Ecevit, was
trying to persuade Turkey to stop the use of Incirlik air base by
U.S. warplanes for the enforcement of the no-fly zone.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and its allies imposed no-fly zones in both north and
south of Iraq with the claimed aim of protect Kurds and Shiite
Muslims from Baghdad oppression.
</P>
<P>
Iraq said it does not recognized the restricted zones because
of the lack of U.N. authorization and will fire at any patrolling
U.S. and British jet as enemy plane violating Iraqi air space.
</P>
<P>
Over the past months, U.S. and British warplanes taking off
from the Incirlik base have been involved in confrontations with
Iraqi air defense units.
</P>
<P>
Aziz is expected to leave Turkey on Tuesday.
