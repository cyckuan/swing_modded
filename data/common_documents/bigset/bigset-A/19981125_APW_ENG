Chinese student calls for lower telephone costs for Internet use

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Saying surfing the Internet is too expensive for
the average Chinese, a university student is organizing an Internet
strike to call for lower rates, a Hong Kong human rights group
reported Wednesday.
	   Huang Zhenqiang says the cost of 20 hours of Internet use in
China is about 250 to 350 yuan (dlrs 30 to dlrs 40), or about a
fourth of the average monthly salary.
	   In statements, he blamed unnecessarily high fees on China
Telecom, a government monopoly that has become ``a greedy
monster,'' the Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic
Movement in China said in a statement.
	   Huang, an economics student at Nanjing University, urged Chinese
Internet users to stay off-line for one day from Dec. 31 to Jan. 1
and every Sunday afterward until the phone company lowers costs.
	   In Germany, several groups organized a similar boycott of
Internet connections against the main telecommunications provider
Deutsche Telekom on Nov. 1.
	   Success was below expectations _ several Internet providers
measured a drop of about 20 percent in the number of connections
that day.
	   Protesters wanted an easing of rates, but Deutsche Telekom
didn't respond. The German campaign followed a similar boycott in
Spain which forced the telecommunications company there to withdraw
an increase in rates.
	   The Chinese government has tried to control what type of
information the growing numbers of mainland Chinese Internet users
can receive. The Ministry of Information Industry operates servers
that block sites the government considers salacious or subversive,
including some Western news organizations.
	   Yet the government's control is not complete. On-line democracy
magazines, for example, use roving addresses on the Worldwide Web
that are hard to block.

Taiwan vies with Japan as world's top notebook computer maker
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANNIE HUANG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ While many businesses struggle amid
Taiwan's economic doldrums, notebook computer makers are busily
expanding in an industry that should grow by 35 percent this year,
according to government projections released Wednesday.
	   Notebooks have emerged a rising star in Taiwan's computer
industry, after the island secured its place as the world's top
producer of monitors, keyboards and motherboards.
	   Notebook makers are reporting higher profits, sending their
share prices soaring in a generally lackluster stock market.
Initial production figures show Taiwan will likely replace Japan as
the world's top notebook computer maker _ if it hasn't already.
	   Taiwan is expected to produce around 6 million notebook
computers this year, about 40 percent of global output. That could
be slightly more than Japan's output, according to government and
business estimates.
	   The 1998 output likely will represent a 35 percent increase from
1997 when Taiwan-made notebooks totaled 4.46 million sets and
generated U.S. dlrs 6.6 billion in revenues. The government did not
provide any estimates for this year's revenue from the notebooks.
	   A few Japanese firms, such as NEC, have purchased notebooks from
Taiwan because of lower prices. The buying pressure eased this year
because a sharp depreciation of the Japanese yen made the Taiwanese
products somewhat less attractive in Japan, but Taiwanese
executives believe their price advantage eventually will return.
	   ``The Japanese economy will revive and its production costs will
rise again,'' said Jackson Lin, vice president of notebook maker
Mitac International. ``When that happens, they won't find a better
notebook supplier than Taiwan.''
	   Japan has a strong component industry, and the U.S. computer
industry is more diversified, but Taiwan's smaller makers have the
flexibility to produce notebooks faster with more efficiency,
analysts say.
	   Notebook production, requiring the higher technology of placing
small components in a compact space, signals Taiwan's advance in
the computer industry. Overall, however, Taiwan's industry still
lags behind those of the United States, Japan and South Korea.
	   Using chips produced by U.S. maker Intel, Taiwan has been the
main supplier for Compaq, Dell, Hewlett Packard and IBM.
	   Tim Lee, manager of Quanta Computer Inc., Taiwan's largest
notebook maker, said Taiwan's strengths lie in its engineering
manpower, design and manufacturing capability.
	   Quanta just opened its third notebook factory in October, and
recruited 300 people to reach a total workforce of 2,500. Quanta
will produce an estimated 1.4 million sets this year, double last
year's output.
	   Taiwan's notebook industry is also capitalizing on the regional
economic crisis that has forced Japan and South Korea to halt
expansion projects on screen displays.
	   Six Taiwanese firms have invested in making Liquid Crystal
Displays and are expected to turn out their first products by the
middle of 1999.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHOENIX (AP) _ Keith Tkachuk scored twice and assisted on Jeremy
Roenick's decisive goal, giving stingy Phoenix a 3-2 victory
Tuesday night over the Chicago Blackhawks _ a league best sixth
straight win for the Coyotes.
	   Phoenix is now 10-0-2 in its last 12 games _ the second-longest
unbeaten streak in franchise history. The Coyotes could tie their
franchise mark _ set as the Winnipeg Jets during the 1984-85 season
_ Thursday night against New Jersey.
	   The game also was 15th in a row in which the Coyotes have held
opponents to two goals or less _ the longest streak since the
1958-59 Montreal Canadiens set the NHL set the record of 18
straight.
	   Tony Amonte and Ethan Moreau scored for Chicago, but weren't
able to give the Blackhawks their 2,000th win. Chicago is
1,999-2,098-750 since joining the NHL in 1926.
 &UR; Blue 4, Predators 0 &QC; 
	   In St. Louis, Pavol Demitra had a goal and two assists, and
Jamie McLennan got his first shutout of the season as St. Louis
beat Nashville.
	   This was the Blues' third look at the expansion Predators in 11
days, and they took two of three. St. Louis won 5-1 at home Nov. 14
and lost 3-2 on a last-minute goal by Cliff Ronning on Nov. 19 at
Nashville.
	   The Central Division teams meet three more times, but the next
matchup isn't until Jan. 1 in Nashville.
	   McLennan is the backup to the injured Grant Fuhr, who's out 4-6
weeks with a groin strain. McLennan left Saturday's game after one
period with back spasms, but showed no signs of stiffness against
the Predators despite facing only 19 shots.
	   Scott Young, Al MacInnis and Pierre Turgeon also scored for the
Blues.
 &UR; Bruins 4, Lightning 1 &QC; 
	   In Tampa, Florida, Ray Bourque scored a power-play goal during a
four-goal third period as Boston sent Tampa Bay to its sixth
straight loss.
	   Bourque, who has scored 10 of his 11 points on the power play,
got his second goal of the season from the top of the left circle
with 5:41 remaining.
	   Dmitri Khristich, who added two assists, had tied the game 1-1
on his team-leading 11th goal with 17:40 left in the third period.
Steve Heinze had a breakaway goal with 16:53 remaining and Kyle
McLaren scored with 1:19 left.
	   Khristich has four goals and eight points in his past three
games.
	   Brent Peterson scored the Lightning goal at 2:39 of the first
period.
	   Tampa Bay's losing streak is its fourth of six or more games
since the start of the 1997-98 season.

Beijing bids for 2008 Olympics
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS throughout to UPDATE with official comment &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ The city of Beijing said Wednesday that it will
bid to host the 2008 Summer Olympics.
	   The announcement won quick support from a government minister,
who said China _ as the world's most populous nation _ should host
the Games.
	   Beijing Mayor Jia Qinglin submitted the application to Wu
Shaozu, president of the Chinese Olympic Committee, during a
ceremony at the Great Hall of the People, the state-run Xinhua News
Agency reported.
	   ``We think that as the world's most populous country with a
vigorous and growing economy, China should host the Olympic Games
and make more contributions to the Olympic movement,'' Xinhua
quoted Wu as saying.
	   ``Many people in China and foreign friends have expressed their
hope that China would bid again,'' said Wu, who is also minister of
the State Sports General Administration. The Chinese Olympic
Committee ``is very happy to receive the application,'' he said.
	   Beijing lost to Sydney by two votes in the 1993 selection for
the host of the 2000 Games. China chose not to pursue the 2004
Olympics.
	   The Chinese Olympic Committee will study Beijing's bid and any
applications from other Chinese cities at a meeting in January,
said He Huixian, a committee spokeswoman. If the committee approves
a bid, it will forward the application to the International Olympic
Committee, she said.
	   She said Beijing lost the 1993 vote for the 2000 Games because
of ``non-sports factors.''
	   Criticism of China's human rights record was a factor in the
1993 vote.
	   The Chinese Olympic Committee set up a special team to research
the feasibility of another bid. Wu said Beijing gave its bid
``careful consideration'' before submitting the application.
	   Officially, competition to host the 2008 Games hasn't even
begun. The International Olympic Committee will open the bidding
process next year, and the selection of the host city will take
place in 2001.
	   Other countries that have already announced they will bid
include Canada, Japan, Turkey, Spain and Argentina.

Malaysian jobless, poverty rates shoot up in recession
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Nearly five percent of Malaysia's
labor force will be without jobs during the nation's first year of
recession in a decade, an official said Wednesday.
	   The projected unemployment rate is almost double that of last
year when 2.6 percent of the country's work force of nine million
were without jobs, Deputy Human Resources Minister Abdul Kadir
Sheikh Fadzir told Parliament.
	   An estimated 441,300 Malaysians are expected to be jobless this
year.
	   Also, the number of Malaysia's poor was expected to rise by more
than 1 percent because of the economic slide, Deputy Rural
Development Minister K. Kumaran told Parliament in a separate
statement.
	   The poverty rate was expected to touch 8 percent this year from
6.7 percent last year, he said.
	   The government classified 417,200 households comprising
1,233,200 people as being poor. Authorities follow varied
definitions of poverty levels, depending on the cost of living in
the areas surveyed.
	   For years, unemployment had not been a problem in this tiny
nation of 22 million. In fact, factories, restaurants and builders
had to import workers from neighboring countries to meet labor
needs.
	   But since last year, when the economy started sinking because of
the regional currency and stock market crisis, jobs became scarce.
According to government figures, the economy is expected to
contract by nearly five percent.
	   To protect its citizens, Malaysia evicted more than one million
foreign workers, mostly Indonesians from stalled building projects.
	   Although many Malaysians have been sacked, the minister said
some of those laid off did not join the pool of unemployed because
they had found other jobs.
	   Of the 74,681 workers losing jobs since January, 89 percent or
66,501 people, were Malaysians and 11 percent, or 8,180 people,
were foreigners, said Abdul Kadir.
	   The manufacturing sector had cast off 39,406 workers. That
figure is 53 percent of the total jobs lost, he said.
	   Of the remaining sacked workers, about 12 percent were from
trading companies, restaurants and hotels, more than 11 percent
from the construction sector and over 6 percent from the fisheries
industry.

Report: Big fall in Indonesian mineral exploration expected
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Mineral exploration in Indonesia is
expected to fall 40 percent in 1998 compared with last year because
of political turbulence and currency volatility, a local newspaper
reported Wednesday.
	   The Jakarta Post quoted the secretary general of the Indonesian
Mining Services Association, Umar Sirait, as saying many foreign
companies had delayed exploration activity amid uncertainties in
the country's political situation and the slump in the gold price.
	   Local investors, who dominate the country's coal sector, also
delayed exploration projects on the back of a sharp depreciation of
the rupiah over the past year.
	   Indonesia is currently grappling with its worst economic crisis
in a generation.
	   ``We estimate preliminary mining activities, including
exploration and feasibility studies have dropped by 40 percent this
year,'' Umar said.
	   Consequently, about 400 mining service companies that support
mining activities are struggling to survive.
	   Umar's remarks counter a popular belief that the mining sector
will prosper because it earns foreign currency from exports.
	   He said the windfall profit derived from the rupiah's
depreciation is mostly enjoyed by the mining companies which are in
production and by a few giant mining service companies which
provide heavy equipment to support their operations.
	   ``The rest of the mining service companies which provide
services like field surveys, drilling, laboratory tests and
environmental impact analysis, are now on the brink of collapse due
to the lack of orders,'' he said.
	   Once in operation, most mining companies handle all the above
activities by themselves rather than hiring outside mining service
companies, he said.

Bangkok to put alarms in buses after passengers abducted, raped
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ The gang rape of two girls who were
abducted from a city bus by knife-wielding vocational students has
prompted the Bangkok Mass Transit Authority to install alarms on
140 buses to improve passenger safety.
	   Transit officials said Wednesday that the alarms, part of a
700,000 baht (dlrs 20,000) program to cope with rising crime on
buses, would alert both fellow passengers and police that something
was amiss.
	   Both the transit authority and the scores of fellow passengers
who let the girls be abducted by the five drunken young men have
come under severe public criticism for ignoring the girls' cries
for help.
	   The five suspects have been arrested and charged with kidnapping
and rape. A campaign is forming demanding that they be given the
death penalty rather than the customary long prison terms.
	   Transit officials said that other, petty crimes or harassment
occur every day on Bangkok's buses due to crowding. The trend has
sharpened with Thailand's severe economic recession.
	   Bus drivers and conductors are also to receive training to help
passengers in trouble, officials said. In most cases, they are
frightened of being harmed if they interfere with attackers.

Reports: Welfare boss to reimburse Hong Kong for first-class air
</HEADLINE>
fare &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ A high-flying welfare boss had his wings
clipped over a first-class flight to London and will reimburse the
taxpayers, newspapers reported Wednesday.
	   ``I didn't have any evil intentions,'' Director of Social
Welfare Andrew Leung said, according to the South China Morning
Post. Leung added that guidelines for civil servants taking days
off while on working trips abroad were ``not clear.''
	   Leung visited London for a two-day break while he was away on
official business in Tel Aviv, Israel, in July. The journey stirred
considerable controversy _ Leung had previously suggested welfare
benefits to struggling families might have to be cut during Hong
Kong's recession.
	   ``Civil servants _ particularly senior ones _ should set an
example when the economy is gloomy,'' said Lam Woon-kwong, Hong
Kong's secretary of civil service. ``They should operate cost
effectively and maximize the use of resources.''
	   But Lam acknowledged rules on travel by top civil servants were
a ``gray area'' and said Leung will not be punished.
	   Leung insisted it was proper for officials to take time off
while they are away on overseas trips, and said he will repay the
government the equivalent of U.S. dlrs 1,982 _ the difference
between first-class and business-class on the personal part of his
journey.
	   Senior government officials can fly first-class on flights that
exceed six hours, but the flight from Tel Aviv to London was just
four hours.
	   Criticism came swiftly when Leung's trip was first reported.
	   With a financial downturn lifting unemployment to a 15-year high
of 5 percent, Leung had said earlier that monthly payments
equalling U.S. dlrs 1,500 for a welfare family of four were ``a bit
high'' so they might be cut.
	   Leung is paid 181,050 Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 23,211) per
month _ and the Post said in an editorial Wednesday that his
first-class side trip was ``profligacy on a greater scale'' than
anything the welfare recipients were getting.

Chinese president arriving in Japan to seek closer ties
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Jiang due to arrive at about 0900 GMT &QL; 
 &UR; By JOSEPH COLEMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Bitter wartime memories and decades of Cold War
division stand between Asia's political and economic powerhouses.
But a major force is helping bring China and Japan together: the
region's economic crisis.
	   Chinese President Jiang Zemin arrives in Japan on Wednesday _
the first visit by a Chinese head of state since World War II _ in
a trip trumpeted as the start of a new partnership between Tokyo
and Beijing.
	   A cornerstone of that new relationship is the economy. Japan is
the region's top source of aid and investment; China needs all the
help it can get to fend off crisis and develop its vast economy.
	   For Japan, closer ties with Beijing _ and a stronger Chinese
economy _ can anchor stability in a region where North Korea is
still a wild card and Southeast Asia is caught in financial and
political turmoil.
	   ``We want the visit to be the beginning of the establishment of
a stable relationship between Japan and China toward the 21st
century so we can cooperate in vital international issues,''
Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiromu Nonaka said Wednesday
before Jiang's arrival.
	   A first step in clearing the way for the future is dealing with
the issues of the past _ like Japan's invasion and occupation of
much of China in the 1930s and 40s. Japanese news reports said the
two sides had agreed that Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi would offer
an oral statement of Tokyo's remorse over the war when he meets
with Jiang on Thursday.
	   The statement follows a similar action earlier this month, when
Obuchi offered visiting South Korean President Kim Dae-jung Japan's
fullest apology yet for its 1910-1945 colonial rule over the Korean
Peninsula.
	   Another major issue is Taiwan.
	   Jiang was coming from a trip to Russia, where he obtained
promises that Moscow would not to undermine China's claim to Taiwan
and not sell weapons to the island, which Beijing considers a
renegade province.
	   Japan does not sell weapons abroad, but Taiwan is watching
nervously to see whether Jiang will extract Tokyo's promises not to
otherwise support the island, whose government enjoys some backing
from conservative Japanese politicians.
	   The Chinese are also eager to see Japan promise that recently
updated defense cooperation guidelines with the United States do
not require Tokyo to join any U.S. military actions around Taiwan.
	   But settling those differences pave the way for the main thrust
of Japan-China relations in the coming decades: the economy.
	   Even with political strains, economic ties between the two
countries are blossoming. China is Japan's second-largest trading
partner and Japan is China's largest, with annual trade volume of
more than dlrs 60 billion.
	   The Asian malaise has made those ties even more important.
Though China has so far avoided the meltdown that has wiped out
neighbors in South Korea, Thailand and Indonesia, its economy faces
major problems. State-run industries are deep in trouble, and
unemployment is on the rise.
	   This comes at a time when Japan's aid is expected to drop and
Japanese investors are increasingly wary as Tokyo grapples with its
own sour economy.
	   ``China has to maintain a certain level of economic growth,''
said Satoshi Amako, political scientist at Aoyama Gakuin University
in Tokyo. ``To do that, it needs to encourage investment from
overseas, including Japan.''
	   But even as the country's top leaders are planning cozier ties,
signs of lingering divisions remain.
	   Japanese right-wing groups _ which have reviled China for its
communist government _ planned to demonstrate during Jiang's visit
in protest of its calls for a wartime apology.
	   China also faces criticism of his human rights record in Japan.
Supporters of Tibetan autonomy scheduled a dinner and statement on
Thursday _ hosted by a former Japanese lawmaker. The London-based
Amnesty International also planned a rally after urging Obuchi to
push for more human rights protections in China.

Arafat flies to Paris from Gaza Airport
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DAHANIEH, Gaza Strip (AP) _ With an honor guard ceremony seeing
him off, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat flew to Paris Wednesday
morning in his first flight originating from the newly opened Gaza
International Airport.
	   ``This is an historical event that ushers in a new era in
Palestinian history,'' said Brigadier General Fayez Zeidan,
chairman of the Palestinian Civil Aviation Authority.
	   Zeidan said that flight number 001 would be Arafat's official
flight number.
	   Arafat's plane took off at 6:45 am (0445 gmt) while Israeli
security officials in civilian clothing watched from the runway.
Israel maintains security control over the airport.
	   The airport, which opened Tuesday morning, is a vital link for
Palestinians bringing goods in and out of Gaza and a powerful
symbol of independence.
	   Top advisors Nabil Shaath and Nabil Abourdeneh accompanied
Arafat to Paris. The plane was routed along the southern side of
Egypt.
	   Zeidan said that commercial flights from Gaza would begin next
week. He said he had signed agreements with the Jordanian Civil
Aviation Authority for daily flights from Gaza to Jordan and from
Jordan to Gaza. Air Morocco has also agreed to have two flights
weekly to and from Gaza, Zeidan said.
	   The Egyptian and Moroccan planes that inaugurated the airport
Tuesday were to depart later Wednesday, Zeidan said.

Moody's downgrades credit rating of Japan's Sumitomo Trust
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ U.S. credit rating agency Moody's Investors Service
said Wednesday it has downgraded Japan's Sumitomo Trust and Banking
Co. and its units because of poor prospects for profitability.
	   The move comes after the ratings agency earlier this month
lowered its rating of all securities issued or guaranteed by the
Japanese government.
	   Moody's said it has downgraded long-term debt ratings of
Sumitomo Trust, one of the country's top trust banks, and its units
to Baa3 from Baa1.
	   It also lowered the bank's long-term deposit rating to Baa2 from
Baa1, and its bank financial strength rating to E-plus from D. The
bank's short-term debt rating was affirmed at Prime-2.
	   A lower rating is associated with higher risk for investors and
depositors.
	   The rating agency said that Sumitomo Trust's overall financial
condition will likely remain under significant pressure. The rating
outlook is negative, it said.
	   Moody's said Sumitomo Trust's credit environment is being
affected by Japan's severe economic slump and structural trends
such as diminishing to weak corporations provided by their main
banks.
	   Moody's said that Sumitomo Trust's decision to tighten its
relationship with Sumitomo Bank and other Sumitomo Group financial
institutions should allow the trust bank to pursue more focused
strategies based on its established trust service capabilities.
	   Moody's also said, however, that competitive pressure will be
very high in the bank's focused areas, such as asset management and
private banking services, making it unlikely that Sumitomo Trust
will generate meaningful revenues from such businesses alone.

Young America plugs away at Cup campaign
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With AP Photos AUCK101-104 &QL; 
 &UR; By TONY HARPER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) _ Pop star Alanis Morissette climbs
aboard to take the helm alongside skipper Ed Baird and the crew of
America's Cup hopeful Young America buzzes in the glow of her
celebrity.
	   A day later they're posing for fashion photographers hired by
the firm which supplies all the race gear. Baird, in charge of his
first Cup challenger, gives orders like a film director. ``They
want action, let's give it to them,'' he says, sparking a flurry of
grinding and a tack for the cameras.
	   But the spark of interest in the New York Yacht Club's entry for
the 2000 America's Cup off Auckland ends quickly and the team is
left to its 10-hour days of testing and training with only
dolphins, whales and a ubiquitous spy boat for company.
	   Young America crew members say the spy boat belongs to the
Japanese syndicate and being America's Cup, with its history of
squabbles and subterfuge, there are rules which prevent the spies
from getting within 200-yards of another team's boat.
	   The America's Cup is as much about technology as sailing skill.
Since Australia ended the New York Yacht Club's 132-year domination
in the event in 1983, there has been a surge in money spent on the
technology and a surge in surveillance.
	   ``Once the 1987 Cup happened in Fremantle (Australia) it grew
and people wanted to know what was going on in other camps and
people started to cover up what they were doing in their camps,''
Baird said. ``There was a lot of research done by people which
turned into spying, but we think it's very fairly run now.''
	   Baird's team is testing in New Zealand because two sponsors
combined to bring Young America's two boats over from the base in
Rhode Island to Auckland for free. Not that they're crying poor _
the team is well funded with a budget of U.S. dlrs 40 million and
U.S. dlrs 10 million will be spent in March to build two yachts for
the Challenger series starting in September.
	   Star designer Bruce Farr is on the Young America payroll and has
been with the crew all week, monitoring the performance of the test
boats and talking to the crew to get their input.
	   Baird was involved in the 1995 Cup in San Diego as part of the
winning New Zealand syndicate which will defend the trophy against
the top challenger in March 2000.
	   He has been the world's top match-racing sailor and this year
sailed some sections of the Whitbread Around the World race.
	   But being at the helm of an America's Cup challenger is the
pinnacle for the 40-year-old.
	   ``It's absolutely the most difficult event in our sport,'' Baird
said. ``It's the combination of so many things that have to be done
properly. You not only have to race the boats well, you have to
raise the money to do it, you have to correctly spend the money on
the right technological advances, you have to develop things in a
very careful manner so you're not getting tricked into thinking
that something that's not important is, or missing something that
is important.''
	   Baird is finding that being a talented sailor won't be enough to
get results in the Cup.
	   ``We go out and race the event, but developing the tools and the
equipment and the people is a huge part of the skipper's
responsibility. The racing side is something that all of us do all
the time.
	   ``But the challenge for me is to put together the right team,
motivate them well, get them thinking creatively and come up with
the best piece of equipment.''
	   While Baird talks and the test boat is being slowly towed the
five miles from base camp to the Hauraki Gulf, a member of his
brains trust, Tony Rey, is tapping information into a waterproof
laptop computer.
	   Back at base in the Auckland Viaduct area specially cleared and
developed for the America's Cup, a meteorologist keeps the team
updated with weather news.
	   ``There is a tremendous amount of science involved,'' Baird says
``If you don't have the best boat it's nearly impossible to win the
event. If you've got the best boat then you look a lot smarter and
your job's a lot easier as a sailor.''
	   Baird worked as a test boat helmsman and coach for the New
Zealand team in San Diego, earning him the contract with the New
York Yacht Club.
	   There is plenty of history behind the Young America bid and
Baird is lapping it up.
	   ``With history comes knowledge and experience,'' said Baird.
``One of the things that's wonderful about the New York Yacht Club
group is the willingness to support the team financially and
mentally.
	   ``To gather the collective wisdom is very helpful. These guys
have been through this event a lot of times.''

Indonesia supports calls for OPEC leaders meeting
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP)_ Indonesia said Wednesday it supported
calls for a meeting of leaders of Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries.
	   However, Foreign Minister Ali Alatas said OPEC energy and
foreign ministers should meet first.
	   Algeria has proposed that OPEC heads of state come together to
tackle the problem of weakening oil prices.
	   Alatas said President B.J. Habibie had met with an Algerian
envoy to discuss the OPEC summit plan and said the president
expressed support for the idea.
	   Alatas said he had also met the envoy and had proposed that the
ministers meet first to discuss the summit agenda.
	   ``That's what we did before,'' Alatas said, referring to a
previous summit in the Algerian capital.
	   In March 1975, OPEC heads of state met in Algiers and adopted
the so-called ``Solemn Declaration,'' in which they stated that
member countries had the right to adjust oil prices unilaterally.
	   It also blamed a global economic disequilibrium at the time on
developed countries consuming excessively and wasting scarce
resources.
	   Algeria is expected to put forward its proposal for a heads of
state summit during Wednesday's meeting of OPEC ministers in
Vienna.
	   Indonesia is Asia's only OPEC member.

Myanmar soldiers detain three foreign tourists near Thai border
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CHIANG MAI, Thailand (AP) _ The Thai military is trying to
secure the release of three foreign tourists who strayed into
Myanmar last week on motorbikes and are believed to have been
detained by soldiers, Thai officials said Wednesday.
	   Two of the foreigners are Westerners and the third is believed
to be Japanese, said Samverng Boonyoprakorn, governor of Mae Hong
Son province in northwestern Thailand. Other details on their
identities were not available.
	   The governor said he had received a report from the military
that the trio had crossed over the Ban Mai Kai On pass on Nov. 19.
Thai army rangers who monitor the border tried to stop them but
were unable to get their attention.
	   The Myanmar army at a command post across the border has
reportedly denied any knowledge of the three tourists, but local
people who cross the border regularly say they have been detained
by soldiers.
	   A Thai military intelligence source said on condition of
anonymity that the three are being detained at Lung Kur in
Myanmar's Shan State.
	   Authorities are trying to locate the company that rented
motorbikes to the three men to determine their names and
nationalities.

Arafat flies to Paris from Gaza Airport
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DAHANIEH, Gaza Strip (AP) _ With an honor guard ceremony seeing
him off, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat flew to Paris Wednesday
in his first flight originating from Gaza International Airport.
	   ``This is an historical event that ushers in a new era in
Palestinian history,'' said Brigadier General Fayez Zeidan,
chairman of the Palestinian Civil Aviation Authority.
	   Zeidan said Arafat's official flight number would be 001.
	   Arafat's plane took off at 6:45 a.m. (0445 GMT) while Israeli
security officials in civilian clothing watched from the runway.
Israel maintains security control over the airport.
	   The airport, which opened Tuesday morning, is a vital link for
Palestinians bringing goods in and out of Gaza and a powerful
symbol of independence.
	   Top advisors Nabil Shaath and Nabil Abourdeneh accompanied
Arafat to Paris. The plane was routed along the southern side of
Egypt.
	   Zeidan said that commercial flights from Gaza would begin next
week. He said he had signed agreements with the Jordanian Civil
Aviation Authority for daily round-trip flights to Jordan. Air
Morocco has also agreed to have two flights weekly, Zeidan said.

Top New Zealand helmsman signs with America's True
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TIMARU, New Zealand (AP) _ New Zealander Gavin Brady said
Wednesday he had been signed as joint helmsman for San Diego-based
America's Cup challenger America True.
	   Brady, ranked No.4 on the world match-racing standings, said he
would join fellow-Kiwi John Cutler at the helm for the Challenger
series in New Zealand late next year.
	   ``We're due to spend three or four months in Auckland on our
practice boat and should have America True there by the middle of
next year,'' Brady said Wednesday.
	   Brady and Cutler will share starting helmsman, race helmsman and
tactician positions, while six of the 16-strong crew will be women.
	   ``Women have competed successfully at a very high level and
apart from minor changes to deck fittings there won't be much
difference,'' Brady said.
	   Meanwhile, one of two French syndicates is showing signs that it
might not take part in the Challenger series.
	   Esprit France has given up its base in Auckland's Viaduct Basin.
It was to share a base with the Swiss Fast 2000 campaign, which
arrives in Auckland this weekend.
	   The Swiss team will swap places with Hawaii's Aloha Challenge,
moving from a double site to a single.
	   America's Cup Challenger Association spokeswoman Heather Pike
said Esprit's withdrawal from the village did not necessarily mean
they would not sail in Auckland.
	   ``We haven't heard from them to say they are not coming,'' Pike
said. ``We're still 16 challengers and holding.''
	   Sixteen syndicates have paid their entry fees, but it is
believed that Spirit of Hong Kong, which also gave up its base,
won't compete.
	   By early next week, six of the 12 bases in the village will be
occupied. AmericaOne, America True and Fast 2000 will join Team New
Zealand, Prada and Young America.

	   PORT MORESBY, Papua New Guinea (AP) _ A crippled Japanese
whaling ship which caught fire last week off the Australian coast
was making its way back to Japan under its own power, a salvage
operator said Wednesday.
	   The environmental group Greenpeace said on Monday that a salvage
tug from Port Moresby was expected to be sent to assist the Nisshin
Maru, which caught fire last Thursday about 600 nautical miles east
of Mackay, Queensland.
	   The tug had been on standby, but was no longer required, the
tug's operator said Wednesday.
	   United Salvage technical manager Trevor Cosh said from Sydney
that he believed the Nisshin Maru was now heading back to Japan
under its own power.
	   ``We've had the salvage tug on standby (in Port Moresby) since
last Friday afternoon to go to its assistance, but as of last night
we were advised that the vessel was making way under its own
devices and our services were not required,'' Cosh said.
	   Cosh said he did not know which port the Nisshin Maru was bound
for.
	   No injuries were reported from the fire, the cause of which has
not been determined.
	   The 7,575-ton Nisshin Maru, carrying a crew of 111, was on its
way to Antarctic seas for Japan's annual research whaling program.
That program has often been criticized because meat from the whales
killed for research is sold on the market in Japan, with proceeds
going to the whaling industry.
	   Though consumed less and less, whale meat has been a traditional
food in Japan.
	   Commercial whaling is banned throughout the world. Japan has
continued with research in an effort to gather evidence that would
persuade regulators to lift the ban.

	   COTABATO, Philippines (AP) _ Soldiers and Muslim rebels
exchanged mortar and automatic weapons fire in fierce sporadic
fighting in the southern Philippines, leaving at least one civilian
dead and nine combatants wounded, officials said Wednesday.
	   Maj. Gen. Rolando Bautista, the army's area commander, said a
woman visiting a nearby ranch was killed Tuesday after being hit by
a stray bullet near the town of Datu Piang in Maguindanao province.
	   Bautista said nine combatants were wounded in the sporadic
fighting that began Saturday between the Muslim rebels and
government troops. He did not say how many of the wounded were
soldiers or rebels, but another army officer said seven of those
wounded were soldiers.
	   Al-haj Murad, spokesman for the rebel Moro Islamic Liberation
Front, confirmed the fighting but refused to give casualty figures.
	   Bautista said the Muslim rebels have been trying to move closer
to government positions despite an earlier agreement to maintain a
five-kilometer (three-mile) distance to prevent clashes while peace
talks continue.
	   ``They started it,'' said Bautista. ``We have been moving away
to prevent clashes but they always move in.''
	   However, a Liberation Front official, Ustadz Shariff Julabbi,
accused government troops of having first bombarded rebel positions
with mortar fire.
	   ``The fighting was very fierce,'' Julabbi said.
	   Bautista said the two sides exchanged mortar and automatic
weapons fire.
	   He estimated that the Muslim rebels have about 100 armed men and
the government has about 1,000 soldiers in the area.
	   Muslim rebels claim they have 48 camps, including 13
strongholds, in southern Mindanao, the country's second largest
island, but the government has yet to recognize any of these camps.
	   Because of the fighting, a road linking Cotabato to the nearby
city of General Santos, a major fishing port, has been closed.
	   The Moro Islamic Liberation Front is the bigger of two Muslim
rebel groups still fighting the government. The main rebel group,
the Moro National Liberation Front, signed a peace pact with the
government in September 1996.

Indonesian students keep up demands for Suharto trial
</HEADLINE>

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Student protesters who were forced to
end a 12-hour occupation of the attorney general's office demanded
once again Wednesday that former President Suharto be tried for
corruption and human rights abuses.
	   Unbowed, hundreds of the demonstrators gathered at nearby Atma
Jaya Catholic University in the morning ahead of a planned street
march. The campus was the spot where security personnel opened fire
on anti-government protesters Nov. 13. As many as 17 people were
killed in the violence, including nine students.
	   In another development Wednesday, about 100 women demonstrators
staged a peaceful rally in downtown Jakarta against rising violence
in crisis-ridden Indonesia.
	   On Sunday, 14 people were killed in riots that started as a
street brawl between rival Christian and Muslim gangs in the
capital's north.
	   Last week, Suharto's former protege and successor, President
B.J. Habibie, announced the government would set up a new inquiry
into allegations that Suharto illegally enriched himself, his
family and a clique of cronies during his 32 autocratic years in
power.
	   Details of the proposed commission of inquiry have not yet been
released, and its announcement has failed to mollify student
protesters who have accused the government of protecting the
elderly leader.
	   Suharto, 77, remains a virtual recluse in his heavily guarded
Jakarta home. He has denied any wrongdoing and has told private
visitors that he is willing to face any investigation into his
affairs.
	   On Tuesday, about 1,000 student forced they way into the lobby
of the office of Attorney-General Andi Muhammad Ghalib who headed
an earlier investigation into Suharto's wealth, which is estimated
by Forbes Magazine to be dlrs 4 billion.
	   Ghalib, a three-star army general, has been widely criticized by
opposition groups for going soft on Suharto, a retired general.
	   The students taunted Gahlib on Tuesday. They produced a live hen
during their protest and chanted: ``Ghalib wants to be a chicken,
not a tiger.''
	   Others shouted ``Hang Suharto,'' as student representatives held
talks with Ghalib who refused to accept their demands that Suharto
be put on trial within one month.
	   Many students later left the building voluntarily. Pressured by
the military, a remaining group of 200 agreed to board army trucks
that ferried them to their university campuses shortly before
midnight.
	   Some students scuffled with officers, but the evacuation was
largely peaceful.
	   Calls for a proper inquiry into Suharto's wealth have grown to
the point where the ruling Golkar Party, which helped keep him in
power for three decades, has suggested that he be placed under
house arrest.
	   Hundreds of soldiers have been deployed in an exclusive Jakarta
suburb to protect Suharto from student protesters who have tried
repeatedly to march on his home in recent days.

	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ With parliament ringed by heavy
security, Prince Norodom Ranariddh was elected National Assembly
speaker Wednesday in a new bid at power-sharing with the arch-rival
who deposed him as co-prime minister last year, Hun Sen.
	   The prince was invested at the first meeting of the assembly
since legislative elections in July. After months of disputing the
victory by Hun Sen's party and blocking formation of a new
government, Ranariddh struck a deal with Hun Sen two weeks ago.
	   Under the agreement, Hun Sen will be Cambodia's sole prime
minister and an upper chamber of Parliament, a Senate, will be
formed, somewhat diluting the assembly's powers.
	   The prince was formally named assembly president by a 105-7 vote
with support from Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party. One lawmaker
abstained, seven were absent and two votes were declared invalid.
	   The opening of the assembly marked a symbolic end to the
political limbo that Cambodia has suffered since Hun Sen deposed
the prince in a violent coup in July 1997. But it remains to be
seen if the longtime rivals can bring much-needed stability and
development to the desperately poor country.
	   Speaking to reporters as he arrived, with the assembly ringed by
armed police and other security forces, Ranariddh expressed
optimism that the pair have learned from their bloody conflicts and
would now work together.
	   ``I feel confident and hope for a brighter future of our
country, Cambodia,'' Ranariddh said. ``We have learned the lessons
from the past.''
	   The opening session also marked the return of former finance
minister Sam Rainsy to parliament since he was expelled from
Ranariddh's royalist FUNCINPEC party and the legislature in 1995
after clashing with the prince and Hun Sen over government
corruption.
	   Sam Rainsy formed his own party and placed a distant third to
FUNCINPEC and the CPP in the election. After being excluded from
the coalition negotiations, the firebrand politician is now
opposition leader in parliament, controlling 15 of 122 seats.
	   ``It is a great day today,'' Sam Rainsy said at the gates of the
legislature. ``I remember very well the day when I was expelled
from this place, the National Assembly, three years ago. Now I am
happy to return, not only alone, but with 14 other MPs.''
	   Sam Rainsy laid a wreath outside at the site of a March 1997
grenade attack against a protest he was leading that killed at
least 16 people and injured more than 100. He had been barred by
police from making the gesture Tuesday upon his return to Cambodia.
	   Sam Rainsy and Ranariddh formed an alliance against Hun Sen in
1997, a few months before Hun Sen broke his four-year-old tense
coalition with the prince with fighting in the streets of the
capital.
	   The prince and Sam Rainsy maintained the alliance during the
election and their post-election boycott of parliament, when they
accused Hun Sen of winning by violence and fraud, and led
supporters in violently suppressed street protests against Hun Sen
in September.
	   Sam Rainsy criticized Ranariddh on Tuesday, saying the prince's
party had exchanged ``the people's blood for positions in
government.''
	   Ranariddh rebuked his former ally Wednesday, arguing that his
party had agreed to join the government in the interests of the
people.
	   With a new government in place, Cambodia is hoping for a
resumption of foreign aid and entry to the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations, suspended since last year's coup.
	   Lakhan Mehrotra, the United Nations representative to Cambodia,
said the country would be able to reclaim its General Assembly seat
when all the constitutional institutions are in place.

	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Sri Lankan security forces went on
full alert Wednesday fearing rebel attacks on the 44th birthday of
Velupillai Prabhakaran, the Tamil rebel commander who has led a
15-year guerrilla war for Tamil independence.
	   Troops in full battle gear manned road blocks on Galle Road, the
city's main thoroughfare. Gun emplacements protected
telecommunications buildings, government offices and business
centers.
	   Most vehicles entering the capital on main roads were searched
for bombs or suspected rebels.
	   Prabhakaran's birthday marks the beginning of Hero's Week for
his organization, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam. In the
past, the period has seen a rise in military activity in the north
and east of the country which the Tigers claim as a future Tamil
homeland.
	   ``The entire city of Colombo is under the joint command of the
military and the police because of the threats,'' Brigadier Sunil
Tennekoon, the defense ministry spokesman, told The Associated
Press.
	   Prabhakaran, who founded the LTTE in 1976, has been labeled a
terrorist by the United States, a hero by radical Tamils in his
homeland and a ruthless killer by the nation's Sinhalese majority.
Some 56,000 people have been killed since Tamil discontent exploded
into civil war in 1983.
	   Tamils make up 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 18.5 million people and
have a language, religion and culture distinct from those of the
Sinhalese. The two groups have periodically fought over territory
during their 1,000-year histories.

Singapore's parliament considers painful wage reduction
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Final vote expected Wednesday. Will be updated.

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Parliament debated a multi-billion dollar
cost-cutting package Wednesday that would slash workers' salaries,
one day after government ministers took the lead by announcing a 20
percent reduction in their total annual wages.
	   In addition to cutting company contributions to the mandatory,
state-run pension fund from 20 percent to 10 percent of a worker's
salary, the legislation would reduce Singaporeans' take-home pay by
5 percent to 8 percent. Therefore, an average worker's total income
would be reduced by at least 15 percent.
	   The proposed reductions in salaries, bonuses and pension
payments, worth an estimated 7.5 billion Singapore dollars (dlrs
4.6 billion) per year, are part of an overall revitalization
program aimed at helping Singapore out of its economic crisis.
	   Recently, the government announced that the city-state is
suffering a recession, its first one in years.
	   If the measures are adopted by Parliament, as expected, the
salary reductions would begin Jan. 1.
	   Government ministers in Singapore are among the highest paid
civil servants in the world.
	   ``We have set ministers' salaries and civil servants' salaries
at levels which we think are sensible and justifiable, and are
right to get the sort of people we want for the job which we are
looking for,'' Deputy Prime Ministers Lee Hsien Loong told
Parliament on Tuesday.
	   ``Especially at times like this, I think you would be looking
for good ministers rather than cheap ministers,'' he said.

O'Donoghue aims for SOCOG board
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ An Aboriginal leader who once said
indigenous Australians would be justified in using the Sydney
Olympics as a platform for political protest has lobbied to replace
Rod McGeoch on the board of organizing committee SOCOG.
	   Lois O'Donoghue, a former leader of Australia's peak Aboriginal
group ATSIC, is the chairwoman of SOCOG's indigenous advisory
committee (NIAC) formed by the organizers to ensure Aborigines are
happy with the running of the 2000 Games.
	   O'Donoghue said last year that Aborigines would protest at the
Olympics if the conservative government failed to address land
rights issues. Aborigines are still no closer to agreement with the
government on the issue.
	   ``We will be back in the streets, there will be just no ways
about that,'' O'Donoghue said last year. ``And we will be back to
marching, demonstrating and ... certainly the Games will be a
platform.''
	   Olympics Minister Michael Knight and New South Wales state
premier Bob Carr have said they want a woman to fill McGeoch's
vacancy on the board of 15. There is only one woman, Anna Booth, on
the board.
	   McGeoch quit Tuesday after days of bitter infighting.
	   O'Donoghue said she took her case for inclusion to SOCOG chief
executive Sandy Hollway on Wednesday.
	   ``I got a good hearing from Sandy, it was no secret to him that
we would be taking the matter up again and he was quite amenable,
although it's not his decision,'' O'Donoghue said.
	   ``I would want to be a SOCOG board member in my own right of
course, I don't want to necessarily be put in a box even though I
believe women need representation and indigenous people need
representation.''
	   She said NIAC would pursue representation of an indigenous
Australian on SOCOG's board.
	   ``But if I was appointed I would see myself as a SOCOG board
member _ admittedly with indigenous interest uppermost in my
mind,'' O'Donoghue said. ``But I think I'd be able to fill the
position of a board member and take into account all the aspects
that a board member needs to consider.''
	   O'Donoghue said she had a good working relationship with the
SOCOG board, ``even if we think at times our interests are not
being served in the way we would want them to be.''
	   A decision is expected within the next few days.

Tokyo stocks finish lower, dollar slips against yen
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with closing Nikkei, mid-afternoon dollar and bond &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese stock prices finished lower Wednesday on
profit-taking following recent sharp gains in Tokyo. The U.S.
dollar slipped against the yen.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 91.17 points,
or 0.60 percent, closing the session at 15,073.47. On Tuesday, the
index rose 384.70 points, or 2.60 percent, closing above the
psychologically-important 15,000-point level for the first time
since Aug. 25.
	   The market retreated Wednesday as the Nikkei took a breather
after gaining about 800 points in the previous two trading days,
traders said.
	   The Nikkei managed to trim heavier losses earlier in the day on
investor hopes for more government measures to stimulate the
economy after the ruling Liberal Democratic Party agreed last week
to form an alliance with the opposition Liberal Party, which calls
for further tax cuts, traders said.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was down 1.93 points, or 0.17 percent, to 1,153.68.
The TOPIX gained 24.87 points, or 2.20 percent, the previous day.
	   Losses overnight on Wall Street also helped suppress prices in
Tokyo.
	   On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average lost 73.12 points
to finish at 9,301.15. On Monday, the Dow rose 214.72 points,
closing at a record high of 9,374.27. Its previous record was
9,337.97 points, set in July.
	   In currency dealings, profit-taking pushed the U.S. currency
lower against the yen. Selling of the German mark to buy yen also
indirectly affected trading in favor of the Japanese currency,
traders said.
	   The dollar bought 120.66 yen at mid-afternoon, down 0.96 yen
from late Tuesday in Tokyo and also below its late New York level
of 121.18 yen overnight.
	   But trading in general remained thin and sluggish ahead of the
Thanksgiving holiday in the United States on Thursday, with many
U.S. players on the sidelines, they said.
	   ``Today's really the last full trading day of the week since a
lot of the U.S. will take Friday off as well. There's nothing to do
but square positions,'' said Minoru Shioiri, assistant foreign
exchange manager at Nippon Credit Bank.
	   The benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government bond rose to
0.940 percent from Tuesday's finish of 0.920 percent, driving its
price down to 107.53 yen from 107.73 yen.

U.N. panel says uranium mine should be stopped
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ A United Nations World Heritage
committee called Wednesday for the scrapping of the proposed
Jabiluka uranium mine in Australia's Northern Territory.
	   The committee said the proposed mine would pose a severe danger
to the cultural and natural values of the adjacent Kakadu National
Park.
	   ``The mission therefore recommends that the proposal to mine and
mill uranium at Jabiluka should not proceed,'' the committee said
in its report following a visit to Kakadu last month.
	   However, federal Environment Minister Robert Hill has blasted
the report as biased, unbalanced and lacking in objectivity.
	   ``I am disturbed and distressed about the quality of this
document,'' Hill said. ``There has not been a case developed that
could, in any way, lead to the conclusion they have reached.''
	   Kakadu is almost 12,000 square miles (31,000 square kilometers)
of pristine floodplains and plateau on Australia's north coast,
incorporating spectacular waterfalls, a towering 125-mile
(200-kilometer) sandstone escarpment and hundreds of animal
species, including many that are rare or endangered.
	   The park is one of a handful listed for both environmental and
cultural values. About 200,000 tourists visit the park every year.
	   The report said the mine, which could process 19.5 million
metric tons of uranium ore over its 28-year life, could damage the
environment.
	   ``The mission has noted severe ascertained and potential dangers
to the cultural and natural values of the Kakadu National Park,
posed primarily by the proposal for uranium mining and milling at
Jabiluka,'' it said.
	   The miner, Energy Resources of Australia Limited, told the panel
that its project does not threaten the environmental and cultural
values of Kakadu, which are recognized by the United Nations' World
Heritage Bureau.
	   The company has already begun construction of its Jabiluka
uranium mine, which is within the boundaries, but technically not
part of Kakadu.
	   The ERA also promised it would rehabilitate the site ``to a
condition ecologically and culturally compatible with Kakadu.''

	   SHANGHAI, China (AP) _ A court has postponed a subversion trial
that had been scheduled to begin this week for a Chinese man who
gave e-mail addresses to a U.S.-based Internet magazine, a court
official said Wednesday.
	   Lin Hai, 30, had been scheduled to go on trial Thursday in
Shanghai Intermediate People's Court No. 1.
	   The court postponed the trial but has not set a new date, said
Ni Jinlong, deputy chief of the court administration office. Ni
said he did not know why the case was postponed.
	   Lin, the owner of a computer software company in Shanghai,
provided e-mail addresses of some 30,000 Chinese computer users to
``Big Reference,'' a pro-democracy journal published on the
Internet by Chinese dissidents abroad.
	   He was detained March 25 and formally arrested April 30 on
charges of ``inciting the overthrow of state power.''

Police watch increased after bomb threats
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Police beefed up security around the U.S.,
Italian and German embassies Wednesday after an anonymous caller
claimed time bombs were planted at the diplomatic compounds, a
report said.
	   No bombs were found, according to the Anatolia news agency.
Police and diplomatic sources confirmed the bomb threats. There was
no immediate speculation on who initiated the bomb scare.
	   But the threats displayed the increasing tension over Kurdish
rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan, who was arrested in Rome on Nov. 12
and is seeking political asylum in Italy.
	   Turkey, which considers Ocalan a terrorist, is demanding his
extradition. But Italian courts say the nation cannot send a
suspect to a country where there is the possibility of the death
penalty. Protesters have held daily rallies outside the Italian
embassy in Ankara.
	   Ocalan is also wanted by Germany. Washington has supported
Turkey's extradition request.
	   Nearly 37,000 people have been killed in the 14-year battle
between Turkish forces and Kurdish rebels seeking autonomy in
southeastern Turkey.
	   On Tuesday, Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz acknowledged that
Italian legal codes make it unlikely Ocalan could be extradited to
Turkey. But he urged Italy to send Ocalan to ``Germany or another
third country.''

Increase in asthma cases holds mysteries for scientists

children, grafs 7-9; ADDS mention of drug treatment in 19th graf,
edits 20th graf to conform &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ A breath-robbing disease that can prove
fatal if untreated, asthma is on the rise in many countries,
especially among children, and scientists aren't sure why.
	   But experts on the disease, speaking this week at the Global
Conference on Lung Disease, have identified enough suspects to
suggest measures to lower the risk of becoming a victim.
	   The conference, bringing together 1,500 experts from 90
countries, is the largest meeting of its kind held in Asia for a
decade. Doctors and scientists are sharing information on lung
ailments ranging from tuberculosis to the effects of smoking.
	   Most triggers for an asthma attack _ marked by wheezing,
difficulty in breathing and a tightness in the chest _ are well
known. They include allergic reactions to animal hair and dander,
plant pollens and certain foods and food additives. Attacks can
also be induced by exercise.
	   What is less clear is what makes people susceptible to asthma
and why their numbers _ and mortality rates _ have been increasing
in the past two decades, especially among children.
	   Asthma is most prevalent in Australia, New Zealand, Britain and
the United States.
	   It is much lower is Asia, where an average 8 percent of children
regionwide show symptoms, compared with a global average of 14
percent, said Dr. C. Lai of Hong Kong's Prince of Wales Hospital.
	   From country to country within Asia, and within each country,
the variations are significant. Japan, Thailand and Hong Kong have
high rates of childhood asthma; Indonesia and China have low ones,
according to a survey of more than 130,000 children in 10
Asia-Pacific countries.
	   In China and Malaysia, the prevalence of the disease tops out in
the capital cities.
	   The data for Asia, said Hong Kong's Lai, ``suggest that the
Western lifestyle, that of the English-speaking societies, may be
important in explaining why asthma is becoming more prevalent.''
	   While there is a consensus that the rise in asthma is linked to
``Westernization'' or ``urbanization,'' no one knows exactly why.
	   In Australia, asthma is actually more of a problem of rural
areas, said Ann Woolcock of the Institute of Respiratory Medicine
in Sydney.
	   And the world's highest rate of asthma is found in Tristan da
Cunha, a remote South Atlantic archipelago, which ``is certainly
not polluted, though maybe stressed,'' she said, referring to the
theory that stress can bring on asthma.
	   The disease is less prevalent among groups with poor hygiene
than among those where washing is frequent. There is a theory that
some infections give protection, but that remains unproven.
	   At least as baffling is why the younger siblings in families are
relatively protected from the disease compared to their older
brothers and sisters, a pattern that seems to hold true everywhere.
	   Scientists are fairly certain what contributes to asthma
susceptibility. Exposure to allergens is a major factor, with the
house dust mite a prime culprit. Secondhand tobacco smoke has also
been fingered.
	   Some studies show that lowered intake of fish may weaken asthma
resistance. Some evidence suggests that intake of omega-3, a fatty
acid found in fish oil, may be beneficial in keeping the disease
away.
	   Omega-3 has also been linked to healthy cardiovascular and
immune systems and the development and functioning of the brain and
eyes.
	   Woolcock says there is some evidence that early treatment with
inhaled steroid drugs can improve resistance to asthma, but there
is no evidence that drugs can cause a remission of the disease.
	   However, Woolcock has come up with a ``non-pharmaceutical''
scheme for reversing the rising asthma trend.
	   Top of her to-do list: allergic avoidance. Dust mites are the
most important to avoid, followed closely by cats and certain types
of mold. Dogs and maybe cockroaches figure less importantly, then
plant pollens. Zero environmental tobacco smoke is a must.
	   Breast feeding is ``certainly protective,'' Woolcock said, as is
a diet of fresh fruit and vegetables, oily fish and low salt.

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ One French tourist was killed and 19
other people were injured Wednesday when their bus overturned while
traveling down the foothills of Doi Suthep mountain, site of a
much-visited Buddhist temple.
	   Police identified the dead man as Jean-Claude Camjue, 43. Most
of the other passengers were also French, part of a group ferried
down the mountain by the Tourismo Thai operator. Company officials
were not immediately available for comment.
	   Police confirmed that the driver lost control while making a
sharp turn down the mountain, near the northern city of Chiang Mai.
The driver fled the scene and police were searching for him. The
injured were taken to local hospitals.

Taiwan vies with Japan as world's top notebook computer maker
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS new grafs 5-6 with comments from Japanese computer
industry &QL; 
 &UR; By ANNIE HUANG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ While many businesses struggle amid
Taiwan's economic doldrums, the notebook computer makers are busily
expanding in an industry that should grow by 35 percent this year,
according to government projections released Wednesday.
	   Notebooks have emerged as a rising star in Taiwan's computer
industry, after the island secured its place as the world's top
producer of monitors, keyboards and motherboards.
	   Notebook makers are reporting higher profits, sending their
share prices soaring in a generally lackluster stock market.
Initial production figures show Taiwan will likely replace Japan as
the world's top notebook computer maker _ if it hasn't already.
	   Taiwan is expected to produce around 6 million notebook
computers this year, about 40 percent of global output. That could
be slightly more than Japan's output, according to Taiwanese
government and business estimates.
	   Japanese high-tech companies have been nervously watching the
gains of their Taiwanese rivals.
	   ``We are aware of the rapid expansion drive by Taiwanese
computer makers. There is no doubt that Japanese manufacturers will
feel a sense of crisis from their challenge,'' said Yuko Shigyo, a
spokeswoman at the Japan Electronic Industry Development
Association, a group of more than 100 Japanese computer makers.
	   Taiwan's 1998 output of notebooks likely will represent a 35
percent increase from 1997, when Taiwan-made notebooks totaled 4.46
million sets and generated U.S. dlrs 6.6 billion in revenues. The
government did not provide any estimates for this year's revenue
from the notebooks.
	   A few Japanese companies, such as NEC, have bought notebooks
from Taiwan because of lower prices. The buying pressure eased this
year because a sharp depreciation of the Japanese yen made the
Taiwanese products somewhat less attractive in Japan, but Taiwanese
executives believe their price advantage eventually will return.
	   ``The Japanese economy will revive and its production costs will
rise again,'' said Jackson Lin, vice president of notebook maker
Mitac International. ``When that happens, they won't find a better
notebook supplier than Taiwan.''
	   Japan has a strong component industry, and the U.S. computer
industry is more diversified, but Taiwan's smaller makers have the
flexibility to produce notebooks faster with more efficiency,
analysts say.
	   Notebook production, requiring the higher technology of placing
small components in a compact space, signals Taiwan's advance in
the computer industry. Overall, however, Taiwan's industry still
lags behind those of the United States, Japan and South Korea.
	   Using chips produced by U.S. maker Intel, Taiwan has been the
main supplier for Compaq, Dell, Hewlett Packard and IBM.
	   Tim Lee, manager of Quanta Computer Inc., Taiwan's largest
notebook maker, said Taiwan's strengths lie in its engineering
manpower, design and manufacturing capability.
	   Quanta just opened its third notebook factory in October, and
recruited 300 people to reach a total work force of 2,500. Quanta
will produce an estimated 1.4 million sets this year, double last
year's output.
	   Taiwan's notebook industry is also capitalizing on the regional
economic crisis that has forced Japan and South Korea to halt
expansion projects on screen displays.
	   Six Taiwanese companies have invested in making liquid crystal
displays and are expected to turn out their first products by the
middle of 1999.

Hong Kong universities promote safe sex, but ban condom handouts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Seven Hong Kong universities are participating
in a safe sex campaign, but six have banned the distribution of
condoms in a move attacked by AIDS-awareness groups.
	   ``What it demonstrates is a moral response getting in the way of
a public health program,'' Graham Smith, a senior officer of AIDS
Concern, said in an interview Wednesday with government-run Radio
Hong Kong. ``There's a lot more than just reading a leaflet.''
	   One university said that if students want to use condoms, they
can buy their own. Baptist University cited its religious
background, while another school said public distribution might
create embarrassment for children of staff living on campus,
explained Lin Oi Chu, chief executive of Hong Kong AIDS Foundation,
a private organization coordinating the campaign.
	   Lin said the safe sex campaign will be the biggest and most open
such move ever allowed by the schools, despite the ban on condom
handouts. Three universities also banned demonstrations on condom
use.
	   Heterosexual transmission is the main route of AIDS infection in
Hong Kong, where it is five times more common than homosexual
transmission, according to government statistics.
	   About 1,000 cases of HIV infection and more than 300 full-blown
AIDS cases have been reported in the territory. HIV is the virus
that develops into AIDS.

Netanyahu cancels visit to Switzerland
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday
canceled an official visit to Switzerland in which he had been
expected to try and defuse tensions with his hosts over a campaign
to have Swiss banks pay restitution to Holocaust victims.
	   Netanyahu called off his trip at the last minute, citing his
efforts to broaden his fragile coalition government. Netanyahu
spent most of the night from Tuesday to Wednesday trying to
negotiate the return of his former foreign minister, David Levy.
	   The prime minister was expected to depart for Britain later
Wednesday and continue on to Spain, as scheduled.
	   A shadow was cast over Netanyahu's trip to Switzerland after he
participated last week in a ceremony honoring Americans and
Israelis who had campaigned against Swiss banks.
	   Those honored played a key role in winning the agreement of the
banks to pay dlrs 1.2 billion to Holocaust survivors and the heirs
of victims to settle claims for assets deposited in the banks by
Jews and others trying to avoid Nazi confiscation.
	   The Swiss government expressed its irritation over the award
ceremony but did not rescind the invitation to Netanyahu.
	   Netanyahu had planned to co-chair a Swiss-Israeli economic forum
and discuss the Middle East peace process with top Swiss officials.

With arrests, expulsions, China determined to tighten secrecy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Leads throughout to UPDATE with trial of Lin postponed &QL; 
 &UR; By ELAINE KURTENBACH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ In many ways, China has signaled its openness to
change: allowing a U.S. president to speak on state-run television,
giving its citizens more freedom to travel and work as they choose,
signing human rights treaties.
	   At the same time, the government has expelled foreign reporters
and imprisoned Chinese journalists.
	   Its latest target is Lin Hai, a Shanghai computer entrepreneur
arrested for giving e-mail addresses to a U.S.-based Internet
magazine published by Chinese dissidents. Lin had been scheduled to
stand trial Thursday on subversion charges, but a court official
said Wednesday the proceeding had been postponed.
	   Behind the more open, liberal face, China is fighting an
information counterrevolution. Its state security apparatus uses
laws on secrecy and subversion to suppress information the ruling
Communist Party dislikes and to lock up the messengers.
	   Recently, those efforts have focused on trying to curb the
fast-growing reach of the Internet in China _ although with the
number of web users growing exponentially, it appears to be a
losing battle.
	   In China, nearly all information that has not been published in
the tightly controlled state media is regarded as classified. The
government also sets strict rules for foreign reporting, although
enforcement is sporadic and arbitrary.
	   Last Friday, the government expelled a reporter for the German
magazine Der Spiegel, Juergen Kremb, on charges of possessing state
secrets. In October, a reporter for the major Japanese newspaper
Yomiuri was forced to leave the country on the same charges.
	   In both cases, government officials refused to say what
materials were involved on the grounds that they were secret.
	   Foreign journalists in China live with constant surveillance and
the possibility of having homes and offices searched or of being
detained while conducting news coverage that would be considered
routine elsewhere.
	   For Chinese citizens, the stakes are much higher. The maximum
penalty for violating the state secrets law is death.
	   Under the law, state secrets can be anything that affects
national unity or social stability, or matters concerning economic
and social development _ a broad definition that makes it
impossible to know what kind of information the authorities will
view as sensitive.
	   The public was allowed to watch U.S. President Bill Clinton
voice his views about democracy on state-controlled television. In
U.N. accords, the government has pledged to uphold basic civil,
economic and social rights.
	   But Chinese citizens who attempt to exercise those rights can
find themselves in trouble.
	   Lin, the 30-year-old owner of a computer software company, was
detained March 25 and charged a month later with ``inciting the
overthrow of state power'' for providing 30,000 e-mail addresses to
the magazine ``Big Reference.''
	   Lin's trial, to be conducted in secret, had been scheduled to
start Thursday in the No. 1 Shanghai Intermediate People's Court.
	   But Ni Jinlong, deputy chief of the court administration office,
said Wednesday the court postponed the trial and has not set a new
date. Ni said he did not know the reason for the postponement.
	   Lin's wife, Xu Hong, has appealed to the government to hold an
open trial, and has asked President Jiang Zemin and Premier Zhu
Rongji to take an interest in the case, the Hong Kong-based
Information of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China said.
	   The case highlights the government's determination to restrain
the freewheeling Internet and control information to its 1.2
million registered users in China.
	   The Ministry of Information Industry, which operates the servers
that permit access to the Internet, has created what some hackers
have dubbed the ``Great Firewall of China'' _ a filter to block out
the salacious and the subversive _ everything from Penthouse to
CNN.
	   Yet Chinese government efforts to shut down or block on-line
democracy magazines electronically appear to have failed.
	   The on-line dissident magazine ``Tunnel'' is still operating
despite the arrest of its Chinese publishers and what dissidents
say were Chinese government attempts to wipe out its web site.
	   ``Big Reference,'' too, continues to flood China. Both magazines
operate from roving addresses on the Worldwide Web and are sent by
e-mail directly to Chinese, a method difficult to block.

Netanyahu makes tentative deal with Levy to rejoin coalition
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SARI BASHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday
struck a tentative deal with his former foreign minister, David
Levy, to return to the fragile coalition.
	   Hard-liners in Netanyahu's government have been threatening to
leave over the land-for-security agreement with the Palestinians,
thus robbing Netanyahu of his majority in parliament.
	   Without such a majority, Netanyahu would either have to call
early elections or try to bring other parties into his coalition.
	   Levy's return would not be enough to guarantee the survival of
Netanyahu's government. Political commentators said Wednesday that
the prime minister wanted Levy back in the fold so he would be in a
stronger position when opening negotiations with the main
opposition party, Labor, to join the government.
	   Under the emerging deal with Levy, the former foreign minister,
would become minister of infrastructure. Levy's Gesher Party would
run on a joint slate with Netanyahu's Likud Party in the next
elections, with Levy guaranteed the No. 2 spot.
	   One of Gesher's five legislators, David Magen, said he would not
return to the coalition.
	   Levy had resigned in January in protest over the deadlock in the
peace talks with the Palestinians and the government's failure to
spend as much money as promised on social welfare programs.
	   At the time, he said the government was ``on a flight to
nowhere.''
	   On Tuesday, Levy suggested that with the signing of the Mideast
accord last month, the government looked more appealing.
	   ``Now that the government is taking the political course that I
demanded ... we in Gesher will convene and decide,'' he told Israel
TV's Channel Two.
	   Using intermediaries, Netanyahu and Levy negotiated through the
night and a tentative deal was reached before dawn Wednesday,
Israel radio and Israel army radio said.
	   In parallel negotiations, Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon met
Wednesday with Rafael Eitan, leader of the far-right Tsomet Party,
to persuade him to merge with Likud, Israel radio said.

Workers at naval shipyard strike in Russia's north
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ More than 9,000 civilian workers at Russia's main
northern naval port held a one-day strike Wednesday to protest
wages that are up to six months overdue, a news report said.
	   The workers handle ship repairs and also work on weapons systems
in the port city of Murmansk, home to many of the ships and
submarines in Russia's Northern Fleet.
	   Trade union leaders said that if back wages were not paid by the
end of the year, workers would go on open-ended strikes aimed at
shutting down the city's factories and repair yards, the ITAR-Tass
news agency reported.
	   Millions of Russian workers and pensioners receive their
salaries months despite repeated government promises that the money
will be paid on time.

Philippines' PLDT put on credit ratings watch following First
</HEADLINE>
Pacific buy-in &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Duff and Phelps Credit Rating Co.
said Wednesday it has placed Philippine Long Distance Telephone Co.
on rating watch for possible downgrade because of potential changes
under its new management.
	   Ending months of speculation, Hong Kong-based holding company
First Pacific Co. said Tuesday it has acquired a 17.2 percent
equity stake and a 27.4 percent voting interest in PLDT, giving it
management control of the Philippines' largest telephone company.
	   The ratings watch applies to PLDT's foreign and local currency
ratings.
	   PLDT's foreign currency obligations are currently rated BB-plus.
Its local currency obligations are assigned a BBB rating.
	   Duff and Phelps said it will review the possible operational and
financial strategies to be implemented by PLDT's new management in
both its land-line and cellular telephone businesses.
	   With First Pacific's buy-in, immediate changes were made in the
local carrier's board of directors, and a new president and chief
executive officer were installed.
	   First Pacific managing director Manuel Pangilinan was appointed
president and CEO, replacing Antonio Cojuangco, who was elected
board chairman. Additional changes in PLDT's senior management will
be made at a later date, the company said.
	   More than half of PLDT's 11-person board was replaced by
executives representing First Pacific.
	   In stock trading, PLDT shares fell 30 pesos (76 cents), or 2.8
percent, Wednesday to 1,025 pesos (dlrs 26) on profit-taking after
the completion of First Pacific's takeover, which was announced
after the market closed Tuesday.

Suharto hands over seven foundations to Indonesian government
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Former President Suharto has handed
over seven charitable foundations worth dlrs 530 million that he
established during his three decades in power, the government said
Wednesday.
	   Suharto, accused by critics of siphoning off state wealth to
benefit his family's business empires, faces a fresh corruption
inquiry ordered by his successor and onetime protege, President
B.J. Habibie.
	   A previous investigation by government prosecutors turned up
little evidence of wrongdoing and was dismissed by student
protesters as a whitewash. Students occupied the attorney general's
office Tuesday to demand a trial of Suharto on corruption charges.
	   In response to a public outcry, the government launched an
investigation earlier this year into a dozen foundations owned by
Suharto. It said it found some indication of irregularities in the
use of foundation funds.
	   The coordinating minister for social affairs, Haryono Suyono,
said Suharto sent a letter Sunday to Habibie in which he ceded
control of seven foundations to the government.
	   Habibie then ordered the ministry of social welfare to supervise
the foundations, Haryono added.
	   Suharto quit in May after riots and protests against his 32-year
authoritarian rule. Habibie has pledged democratic reforms, but
students say he is stalling on political change.
	   The foundations handed over by Suharto are Yayasan Supersemar,
Yayasan Dharmais, Yayasan Dakab, Yayasan Amal Bakti Muslim
Pancasila, Yayasan Dana Sejahtera Mandiri, Yayasan Gotong Royong
and Yayasan Trikora.

Philippine Senate passes new securities bill
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Philippine Senate on Wednesday
passed a proposed new Securities Act intended to boost confidence
in the local stock market by providing greater protection for
investors.
	   A similar bill needs to be passed by the House of
Representatives before the measure can be signed by the president
into law.
	   The Senate bill imposes tougher penalties for fraud and other
serious violations in securities transactions such as insider
trading and price manipulation.
	   It aims to promote full disclosure to assure that relevant
investment information is made available to every investor.
	   The bill also broadens the powers of the Securities and Exchange
Commission. Under the bill, the commission's chairman is empowered
to stop any transaction that could result in irreparable damage to
investors.
	   It also tries to minimize the temptation for brokers to commit
fraudulent acts such as price manipulation and front running by
limiting their ability to transact shares for their own accounts.
	   The bill is part of a package of measures initiated in Congress
to further develop and modernize the country's fledgling capital
market.

Netanyahu cancels visit to Switzerland
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CLARIFIES that economic forum appearance has been canceled,
7th graf

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday
canceled an official visit to Switzerland in which he had been
expected to try and defuse tensions with his hosts over a campaign
to have Swiss banks pay restitution to Holocaust victims.
	   Netanyahu called off his trip at the last minute, citing his
efforts to broaden his fragile coalition government. Netanyahu
spent most of the night from Tuesday to Wednesday trying to
negotiate the return of his former foreign minister, David Levy.
	   The prime minister was expected to depart for Britain later
Wednesday and continue on to Spain, as scheduled.
	   A shadow was cast over Netanyahu's trip to Switzerland after he
participated last week in a ceremony honoring Americans and
Israelis who had campaigned against Swiss banks.
	   Those honored played a key role in winning the agreement of the
banks to pay dlrs 1.2 billion to Holocaust survivors and the heirs
of victims to settle claims for assets deposited in the banks by
Jews and others trying to avoid Nazi confiscation.
	   The Swiss government expressed its irritation over the award
ceremony but did not rescind the invitation to Netanyahu.
	   Netanyahu had already canceled a planned appearance at an
economic forum in Zurich in order to negotiate Levy's return.
	   Wednesday's decision was to cut the remaining stop-over in Bern
where Netanyahu was to meet with Swiss leaders on his way to
London.

	   The prime ministers from the Commonwealth of Independent States,
an alliance of former Soviet republics, also planned to set the
agenda for a summit of presidents expected next month or in
January.
	   Boris Berezovsky, a controversial Russian business tycoon who
serves as the alliance's executive secretary, organized Wednesday's
meeting. He has just returned to Moscow from visits to the CIS
nations, where he sought to build support for a plan that would
give additional powers to the group.
	   Berezovsky says his proposals have broad support, though a
number of CIS leaders have opposed them. They have expressed
concerns that a strong CIS structure would interfere with their
sovereignty.
	   The CIS, formed in the wake of the 1991 Soviet collapse, meets
often. But members have been unable to realize ambitious plans for
closer cooperation. Most of the member states are reluctant to
surrender their independence to an group they believe will be
dominated by Russia.
	   Attempts at closer integration have also been hampered by the
economic crisis in the former Soviet states and big differences in
the size and level of development of their economies.
	   The CIS prime ministers on Wednesday planned to again discuss
the establishment of a free trade zone among member states, an idea
that was first put forward when the alliance was founded seven
years ago.

October consumer prices down slightly, lower than predicted
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Consumer prices in France fell 0.1 percent in
October and rose only 0.4 percent from a year ago, officials said
Wednesday.
	   The October drop of the final consumer price index follows an
unchanged monthly figure in September. Year-on-year inflation in
September was 0.5 percent.
	   The national statistics institute, INSEE, said the index fell in
October because of continually dropping prices of fresh products,
food and manufactured goods.
	   The October year-on-year figure was slightly below economist
expectations, which on average called for a flat figure on the
month and a 0.5 percent rise on the year.

Tokyo stocks fall after two-day rise, dollar lower
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Wraps up with late dollar, closing bond, other details

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The Tokyo Stock Exchange's main index fell on
profit-taking Wednesday after two sessions of gains. The U.S.
dollar slid against the yen in light trading.
	   In late afternoon, the dollar bought 120.84 yen, down 0.78 yen
from late Tuesday in Tokyo and also below its late New York level
of 121.18 yen overnight.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 91.17 points,
or 0.60 percent, closing 15,073.47. On Tuesday, the index had
surged 384.70 points, or 2.60 percent, closing above the
psychologically important 15,000-point level for the first time
since Aug. 25.
	   Losses were heavier earlier in the day, but the Nikkei recovered
somewhat on investor hopes for more government measures to
stimulate the economy after the ruling Liberal Democratic Party
agreed last week to form an alliance with the opposition Liberal
Party, which seeks further tax cuts, traders said.
	   Despite the Nikkei's decline, advances outnumbered retreats 649
to 493, with 157 issues unchanged. An estimated 490 million shares
changed hands on the exchange's first section, compared with
Monday's 580.67 million.
	   Traders said the Tokyo market took a breather after the main
index had gained a total of 810.18 points Friday and Tuesday.
Japanese finance markets were closed Monday for a national holiday.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was down 1.93 points, or 0.17 percent, to 1,153.68.
It had gained 24.87 points, or 2.20 percent, the previous day.
	   An overnight fall on Wall Street also dampened sentiment in
Tokyo. On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average closed at
9,301.15, down 73.12. On Monday, it had climbed 214.72 points,
closing at a record high of 9,374.27. Its previous record was
9,337.97 points, set in July.
	   In currency dealings, the dollar moved lower against the yen on
profit-taking. Selling of the German mark to buy yen also
indirectly affected trading in favor of the Japanese currency,
traders said.
	   But trading in general remained thin and sluggish ahead of the
Thanksgiving holiday in the United States Thursday, they said.
	   ``Today's really the last full trading day of the week since a
lot of the U.S. will take Friday off as well. There's nothing to do
but square positions,'' said Minoru Shioiri, assistant foreign
exchange manager at Nippon Credit Bank.
	   The dollar ranged between 120.23 yen and 121.52 yen in
Wednesday's trading.
	   The benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government bond rose to
0.970 percent from Tuesday's finish of 0.920 percent, driving its
price down to 107.25 yen from 107.73 yen.

Bombs rip through Sindh city killing one, injuring 7
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ZAHID HUSSAIN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) _ Two bombs ripped through a busy
marketplace in southern Sindh province on Wednesday, killing one
person and injuring seven others, police and ambulance officials
said.
	   The bombs went off within minutes of each other in Hyderabad,
barely 100 kilometers (60 miles) northeast of the Sindh provincial
capital of Karachi, they said.
	   The first bomb, which was hidden outside a shop killed one
person and injured four others, according to ambulance workers. A
second explosion barely three kilometers (1.8 miles) away injured
three people, they said.
	   No one took responsibility for the explosions, which went off
shortly before noon local time.
	   Although it's not clear there was any connection, police said
that a Sindhi nationalist group, known as the Sindh Nationalist
Front, had called for a province-wide strike Wednesday to protest
the imposition of federal rule and establishment of military courts
in southern Sindh.
	   Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif imposed federal rule throughout
Sindh province to try to stop the endless violence that has wracked
the province and its capital of Karachi in recent months.
	   Since the beginning of the year more than 1,000 people have been
killed in violent feuding between rival factions of an ethnic-based
party known as the Muttaheda Qami Movement. The group claims to
represent Urdu speaking Indians who settled in Pakistan in 1947
when British colonial rule of the Asian subcontinent ended.

Philippine stocks slip on PLDT profit-taking; peso strengthens
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Profit-taking in Philippine Long
Distance Telephone Co. following the sale of a controlling interest
to Hong Kong's First Pacific Corp. helped push Philippine stocks
slightly lower Wednesday, traders said.
	   But expectations that other telecommunication issues might also
be targets for mergers or acquisitions after First Pacific's
assumption of management control of PLDT triggered speculative
buying of other telecommunication shares, helping underpin the
overall market.
	   The 30-share Philippine Stock Exchange Index closed down 2.71
points, or 0.2 percent, at 1,958.54, off its intraday low of
1,925.26. The index had gained 38.99 points Tuesday.
	   The broader All Shares Index finished at 620.27, down 0.87 point
after rising 7.02 points the previous session.
	   Declines edged out gains 49 to 47, with 37 issues unchanged.
	   PLDT fell 30 pesos, or 2.8 percent, to 1,025 pesos on
profit-taking following the takeover by First Pacific, announced
after the market closed Tuesday. First Pacific's Philippine unit,
Metro Pacific, which the market had previously bought up on the
mistaken belief it would incorporate the PLDT shares, declined 2
centavos to 2.12 pesos.
	   Analysts expect First Pacific's takeover of PLDT to spur a
consolidation in the telecommunications industry, now populated by
a slew of players enticed in 1993 when the government liberalized
the industry to break up PLDT's virtual monopoly.
	   ``Potential targets of mergers and acquisitions will be the
focus of this market in the coming days,'' said Market Capital
President Nestor Aguila. But he doubted they could drive the market
higher as speculation over the PLDT buy-in did.
	   PLDT accounts for around 10 percent of the market's total
capitalization.
	   With little surprises expected from the release Friday of
third-quarter economic data and the PLDT deal out of the way,
Aguila said the market should consolidate as it searches for fresh
incentives to trade on.
	   Analysts expect third-quarter figures to show the economy
slipping into a recession. The economy already had contracted
during the second quarter.
	   The peso, meanwhile, strengthened against the U.S. dollar on
moderate demand for the local currency and some dollar inflows,
traders said.
	   The dollar averaged 39.381 pesos for the day, down from
Tuesday's 39.606 pesos. It traded in a thin range between 39.270
pesos and 39.500 pesos and was last traded at 39.450 pesos.
	   Traders said some corporate clients had peso requirements,
driving the local currency higher. Dollar demand was slack, traders
said, as most participants had covered their requirements in
previous sessions.
	   Dollar inflows from stock investors also helped boost the peso,
with supply of the U.S. currency being more than enough to meet the
financial system's requirements for the day.

Norway's minority government averts crisis with budget compromise
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) - Norway's minority government averted a
political crisis Wednesday by reaching a last-minute compromise
with two opposition parties on a proposed 1999 national budget.
	   The centrist three-party coalition and two right-wing parties
reached an accord hours before the opening of a two-day
parliamentary budget debate that many feared would end in a
deadlock and bring down the government.
	   The opposition Conservatives and Party of Progress had agreed to
a new round of budget negotiations with the coalition on Tuesday,
after the government offered heavy concessions in exchange for
their support in Parliament.
	   After talks that lasted into the early morning, Prime Minister
Kjell Magne Bondevik, a Christian Democrat, said the parties had
reached a compromise agreement and that only technical adjustments
to the budget remained.
	   `This is a victory for the political system, and a victory for
the parties involved,'' Bondevik said.
	   The parties planned to announce details of the budget compromise
later Wednesday. However, it was already clear that the government
gave in to the political right's demand that all proposed tax and
tariff hikes be eliminated.
	   The coalition has just 42 seats in the 165-seat parliament, and
needs the support of opposition parties to remain in office.
	   Bondevik formed his government in October 1997, after Labor
Party Prime Minister Thorbjoern Jagland resigned due to a
disappointing national election result.
	   This weekend, Jagland, head of Norway's largest party, said he
was ready to return to office if the coalition fell.
	   The budget agreement was broadly seen as a move to the political
right by the centrists that might allow the coalition to remain in
power for the remaining three years of the current parliamentary
term.
	   When the Bondevik government took office, few gave it a chance
of lasting more than a few weeks.

With arrests, expulsions, China determined to tighten secrecy

 &UR; Eds: Leads with 17 grafs to ADD comment from court official. Picks

 &UR; By ELAINE KURTENBACH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ In many ways, China has signaled its openness to
change: allowing a U.S. president to speak on state-run television,
giving its citizens more freedom to travel and work as they choose,
signing human rights treaties.
	   At the same time, the government has expelled foreign reporters
and imprisoned Chinese journalists.
	   Its latest target is a Shanghai computer entrepreneur charged
with inciting to overthrow the government by giving e-mail
addresses to a U.S.-based Internet magazine published by Chinese
dissidents. Lin Hai was scheduled to stand trial Thursday, but a
court official said Wednesday the proceeding had been postponed.
	   Behind the more open, liberal face, China is fighting an
information counterrevolution. Its state security apparatus uses
laws on secrecy and subversion to suppress information the ruling
Communist Party dislikes and to lock up the messengers.
	   Recently, those efforts have focused on trying to curb the
fast-growing reach of the Internet in China _ although with the
number of web users growing exponentially, it appears to be a
losing battle.
	   In China, nearly all information that has not been published in
the tightly controlled state media is regarded as classified. The
government also sets strict rules for foreign reporting, although
enforcement is sporadic and arbitrary.
	   Last Friday, the government expelled a reporter for the German
magazine Der Spiegel, Juergen Kremb, on charges of possessing state
secrets. In October, a reporter for the major Japanese newspaper
Yomiuri was forced to leave the country on the same charges.
	   In both cases, government officials refused to say what
materials were involved on the grounds that they were secret.
	   Foreign journalists in China live with constant surveillance and
the possibility of having homes and offices searched or of being
detained while conducting news coverage that would be considered
routine elsewhere.
	   For Chinese citizens, the stakes are much higher. The maximum
penalty for violating the state secrets law is death.
	   Under the law, state secrets can be anything that affects
national unity or social stability, or matters concerning economic
and social development _ a broad definition that makes it
impossible to know what kind of information the authorities will
view as sensitive.
	   The public was allowed to watch U.S. President Bill Clinton
voice his views about democracy on state-controlled television. In
U.N. accords, the government has pledged to uphold basic civil,
economic and social rights.
	   But Chinese citizens who attempt to exercise those rights can
find themselves in trouble.
	   Lin, the 30-year-old owner of a computer software company, was
detained March 25 and charged a month later with ``inciting the
overthrow of state power'' by providing 30,000 e-mail addresses to
the magazine ``Big Reference.''
	   Lin's trial, to be conducted in secret, had been scheduled to
start Thursday in the No. 1 Shanghai Intermediate People's Court.
	   But Ni Jinlong, deputy chief of the court administration office,
said the court postponed the trial and has not set a new date.
	   Asked why, Ni said, ``There was no reason. It was just
postponed.''
	   Lin's wife, Xu Hong, has appealed to the government to hold an
open trial.
	   The case highlights the government's determination to restrain
the freewheeling Internet and control information to its 1.2
million registered users in China.
	   The Ministry of Information Industry, which operates the servers
that permit access to the Internet, has created what some hackers
have dubbed the ``Great Firewall of China'' _ a filter to block out
the salacious and the subversive _ everything from Penthouse to
CNN.
	   Yet Chinese government efforts to shut down or block on-line
democracy magazines electronically appear to have failed.
	   The on-line dissident magazine ``Tunnel'' is still operating
despite the arrest of its Chinese publishers and what dissidents
say were Chinese government attempts to wipe out its web site.
	   ``Big Reference,'' too, continues to flood China. Both magazines
operate from roving addresses on the Worldwide Web and are sent by
e-mail directly to Chinese, a method difficult to block.

Netanyahu makes tentative deal with Levy to rejoin coalition
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SARI BASHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday
struck a tentative deal with his former foreign minister, David
Levy, to return to Israel's fragile coalition government.
	   Hardliners in Netanyahu's government have been threatening to
leave over the land-for-security agreement with the Palestinians,
thus robbing Netanyahu of his majority in parliament.
	   Without such a majority, Netanyahu would either have to call
early elections or try to bring other parties into his coalition.
	   Levy's return would not be enough to guarantee the survival of
Netanyahu's government. Political commentators said Wednesday that
the prime minister wanted Levy back in the fold so he would be in a
stronger position when opening negotiations with the main
opposition party, Labor, to join the government.
	   Under the emerging deal with Levy, the former foreign minister
would become minister of infrastructure. Levy's Gesher Party would
run on a joint slate with Netanyahu's Likud Party in the next
elections, with Levy guaranteed the No. 2 spot.
	   One of Gesher's five legislators, David Magen, said he would not
return to the coalition.
	   Levy had resigned in January in protest over the deadlock in the
peace talks with the Palestinians and the government's failure to
spend as much money as promised on social welfare programs.
	   At the time, he said the government was ``on a flight to
nowhere.''
	   On Tuesday, Levy suggested that with the signing of the Mideast
accord last month, the government looked more appealing.
	   ``Now that the government is taking the political course that I
demanded ... we in Gesher will convene and decide,'' he told Israel
TV's Channel Two.
	   Using intermediaries, Netanyahu and Levy negotiated through the
night and a tentative deal was reached before dawn Wednesday,
Israel radio and Israel army radio said.

	   SHANGHAI, China (AP) _ A Chinese court has postponed the trial
for a computer engineer accused of trying to overthrow the
government by giving e-mail addresses to a U.S.-based Internet
magazine, a court official said Wednesday.
	   Lin Hai, 30, had been scheduled to go on trial Thursday in

Ni Jinlong, deputy chief of the court administration office. Ni

	   Lin, the owner of a computer software company in Shanghai, was
detained March 25 and formally arrested April 30.
	   He is charged with ``inciting the overthrow of state power'' by
providing e-mail addresses of some 30,000 Chinese computer users to
``Big Reference,'' a pro-democracy journal published on the
Internet by Chinese dissidents abroad.

	   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) _ A Spanish economist who sparked
nationwide alarm by telling his family that he and his daughter had
been kidnapped by supporters of former dictator Gen. Augusto
Pinochet says he was just kidding.
	   Government officials confirmed late Tuesday that Gonzalo
Fernandez de Cordoba and his 23-year-old daughter Ana were both
safe in La Serena, a resort 500 kilometers (350 miles) north of the
capital Santiago.
	   The news of the kidnap broke when two other daughters of the
64-year-old Spanish economist said they received an e-mail message
from their father saying, ``We are being held until Wednesday, when
the ruling in London on Sen. Augusto Pinochet will be announced.''
	   Police quickly investigated the message, and two special units
were sent to investigate. But Tuesday night, the economist told
news organizations in Chile and Spain that there had been no
kidnapping.
	   ``It was just a joke,'' Fernandez told Spanish state radio. ``We
are absolutely fine.''
	   Chilean officials would not say whether he faced any criminal
charges, but Chile has laws against causing public alarm.
	   The Spanish Foreign Ministry said Wednesday it did not expect
the Chileans to expel Fernandez. ``They will make him pay the price
of his bad joke by pointing their finger at him for a while,''
ministry spokesman Joaquin Perez Villanueva.
	   The incident was front-page news in all Spanish newspapers
Wednesday. One of them, El Periodico, missed the news that the
kidnapping was a hoax, reporting that it was for real.
	   The reported kidnapping had caused panic in Chile, where
tensions have been high since Pinochet's Oct. 16 arrest in London
on a Spanish warrant for genocide, torture and murder charges.
There have been several incidents of violence against Spaniards.
	   The British House of Lords will rule Wednesday, Pinochet's 83rd
birthday, whether state immunity must be recognized to him.
	   Fernandez and his daughter had entered Chile last Friday as
tourists from neighboring Bolivia.

Chinese president arriving in Japan to seek closer ties
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Jiang's arrival in 2nd graf, details of protest
in 20th graf &QL; 
 &UR; By JOSEPH COLEMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Bitter wartime memories and decades of Cold War
division stand between Asia's political and economic powerhouses.
But a major force is helping bring China and Japan together: the
region's economic crisis.
	   Chinese President Jiang Zemin arrived in Japan Wednesday _ the
first visit by a Chinese head of state since World War II _ to
begin a trip trumpeted as opening a new partnership between Tokyo
and Beijing.
	   A cornerstone of that new relationship is the economy. Japan is
the region's top source of aid and investment; China needs all the
help it can get to fend off crisis and develop its vast economy.
	   For Japan, closer ties with Beijing _ and a stronger Chinese
economy _ can anchor stability in a region where North Korea is
still a wild card and Southeast Asia is caught in financial and
political turmoil.
	   ``We want the visit to be the beginning of the establishment of
a stable relationship between Japan and China toward the 21st
century so we can cooperate in vital international issues,''
Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiromu Nonaka said Wednesday
before Jiang's arrival.
	   A first step in clearing the way for the future is dealing with
the issues of the past _ like Japan's invasion and occupation of
much of China in the 1930s and 40s. Japanese news reports said the
two sides had agreed that Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi would offer
an oral statement of Tokyo's remorse over the war when he meets
with Jiang on Thursday.
	   The statement follows a similar action earlier this month, when
Obuchi offered visiting South Korean President Kim Dae-jung Japan's
fullest apology yet for its 1910-1945 colonial rule over the Korean
Peninsula.
	   Another major issue is Taiwan.
	   Jiang was coming from a trip to Russia, where he obtained
promises that Moscow would not to undermine China's claim to Taiwan
and not sell weapons to the island, which Beijing considers a
renegade province.
	   Japan does not sell weapons abroad, but Taiwan is watching
nervously to see whether Jiang will extract Tokyo's promises not to
otherwise support the island, whose government enjoys some backing
from conservative Japanese politicians.
	   The Chinese are also eager to see Japan promise that recently
updated defense cooperation guidelines with the United States do
not require Tokyo to join any U.S. military actions around Taiwan.
	   But settling those differences could pave the way for the main
thrust of Japan-China relations in the coming decades: the economy.
	   Even with political strains, economic ties between the two
countries are blossoming. China is Japan's second-largest trading
partner and Japan is China's largest, with annual trade volume of
more than dlrs 60 billion.
	   The Asian malaise has made those ties even more important.
Though China has so far avoided the meltdown that has wiped out
neighbors in South Korea, Thailand and Indonesia, its economy faces
major problems. State-run industries are deep in trouble, and
unemployment is on the rise.
	   This comes at a time when Japan's aid is expected to drop and
Japanese investors are increasingly wary as Tokyo grapples with its
own sour economy.
	   ``China has to maintain a certain level of economic growth,''
said Satoshi Amako, political scientist at Aoyama Gakuin University
in Tokyo. ``To do that, it needs to encourage investment from
overseas, including Japan.''
	   But even as the country's top leaders are planning cozier ties,
signs of lingering divisions remain.
	   Japanese right-wing groups _ which have reviled China for its
communist government _ planned to demonstrate during Jiang's visit
in protest of its calls for a wartime apology.
	   China also faces criticism of his human rights record in Japan.
Supporters of Tibetan autonomy scheduled a dinner, given by a
former Japanese lawmaker, and a statement on Thursday.
	   The London-based Amnesty International also plans a rally after
Jiang's arrival to push for more human rights protections and an
end to capital punishment in China.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ U.S. credit rating agency Moody's Investors Service
said Wednesday it has downgraded Japan's Sumitomo Trust and Banking
Co. and its units because of poor prospects for profitability.
	   The move comes after the ratings agency earlier this month
lowered its rating of all securities issued or guaranteed by the
Japanese government.
	   Moody's said it has downgraded long-term debt ratings of
Sumitomo Trust, one of the country's top trust banks, and its units
to Baa3 from Baa1.
	   It also lowered the bank's long-term deposit rating to Baa2 from
Baa1, and its bank financial strength rating to E-plus from D. The
bank's short-term debt rating was affirmed at Prime-2.
	   A lower rating is associated with higher risk for investors and
depositors.
	   The rating agency said that Sumitomo Trust's overall financial
condition will likely remain under significant pressure. The rating
outlook is negative, it said.
	   Moody's said Sumitomo Trust's credit environment is being
affected by Japan's severe economic slump and structural trends
such as diminishing to weak corporations provided by their main
banks.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's big banks plan to ask the government for up
to 5.8 trillion yen (47.8 billion) in public bailout funds, but the
government says it could press the banks to accept even more money.
	   Releasing interim earnings Tuesday, seven of the country's nine
trust and long-term credit banks announced they would apply for
between 1.5 trillion yen (dlrs 12.2 billion) and 1.7 trillion yen
(dlrs 13.9 billion) in public funds to boost their capital bases.
	   Added to the plans that nine commercial banks announced last
week, Japan's big banks will request between 4.9 trillion yen (dlrs
40.3 billion) and 5.8 trillion (dlrs 47.8 billion).
	   The money will come from a 25 trillion yen (dlrs 206.6 billion)
pool of public funds created last month to help stabilize Japan's
ailing financial system.
	   But the planned funding requests, while huge, are still dwarfed
by Japan's mountain of bad and doubtful bank loans, estimated by
some analysts at over 80 trillion yen (dlrs 660 billion).
	   The government will ask banks to ``deepen their plans if
necessary,'' said FSA deputy head Hideichiro Hamanaka.
	   The nine trust and long-term credit banks all reported parent
pretax profits for the six months of the fiscal year through
September, but six forecast losses for the full year as they write
off huge amounts of bad loans.

	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Parliament debated a multi-billion dollar
cost-cutting package Wednesday that would slash workers' salaries,
one day after government ministers took the lead by announcing a 20
percent reduction in their total annual wages.
	   In addition to cutting company contributions to the mandatory,
state-run pension fund from 20 percent to 10 percent of a worker's
salary, the legislation would reduce Singaporeans' take-home pay by
5 to 8 percent.
	   That means an average worker would see total income drop at
least 15 percent.
	   The proposed reductions in salaries, bonuses and pension
payments, worth an estimated 7.5 billion Singapore dollars (dlrs
4.6 billion) per year, are part of an overall revitalization
program aimed at helping Singapore out of its economic crisis.
	   Recently, the government announced that the city-state is
suffering a recession, its first one in years.
	   If the measures are adopted by Parliament, as expected, the
salary reductions would begin Jan. 1.
	   Government ministers in Singapore are among the highest paid
civil servants in the world.

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ New mineral exploration in Indonesia
is expected to fall by nearly half this year because of political
turbulence and currency volatility, a local newspaper reported
Wednesday.
	   The Jakarta Post quoted the secretary general of the Indonesian
Mining Services Association, Umar Sirait, as saying many foreign
companies had delayed exploration activity amid uncertainties in
the country's political situation and the slump in the gold price.
	   Local investors, who dominate the country's coal sector, also
delayed exploration projects on the back of a sharp depreciation of
the rupiah over the past year.
	   Indonesia is currently grappling with its worst economic crisis
in a generation.
	   ``We estimate preliminary mining activities, including
exploration and feasibility studies have dropped by 40 percent this
year'' from the year before, Umar said.
	   Consequently, about 400 mining service companies that support
mining activities are struggling to survive.
	   Umar's remarks counter a popular belief that the mining sector
will prosper because it earns foreign currency from exports.
	   He said the windfall profit derived from the rupiah's
depreciation is mostly enjoyed by the mining companies that are in
production and by a few giant mining service companies which
provide heavy equipment to support their operations.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The number of Malaysians without
jobs will double this year, the nation's first year of recession in
a decade, an official said Wednesday.
	   Nearly 5 percent of the country's work force of nine million
will be without jobs, compared to last year's 2.6 percent, Deputy
Human Resources Minister Abdul Kadir Sheikh Fadzir told Parliament.
	   Also, the number of Malaysia's poor was expected to rise by more
than 1 percentage point because of the economic slide, Deputy Rural
Development Minister K. Kumaran told Parliament in a separate
statement.
	   The poverty rate was expected to touch 8 percent this year from
6.7 percent last year, he said.
	   The government classified 1,233,200 people as being poor.
Authorities follow varied definitions of poverty levels, depending
on the cost of living in the areas surveyed.
	   For years, unemployment had not been a problem in this nation of
22 million. In fact, factories, restaurants and builders had to
import workers from neighboring countries to meet labor needs.
	   But since last year, when the economy started sinking because of
the regional currency and stock market crisis, jobs became scarce.
According to government figures, the economy is expected to
contract by nearly five percent.

Ruling party expects to retain majority in Taiwan's legislature

	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ The 403 candidates for Taiwan's
legislature officially launched their campaigns Wednesday, with the
ruling Nationalist Party predicting it can hang on to a slim
majority despite widespread concerns about official corruption.
	   Chen Chiung-chan, head of the party's organizational affairs
department, said the Nationalists should win between 120 and 125
seats in the 225-seat legislature, maintaining a margin that would
be thin yet big enough to pass bills and head off ``daily
harassment'' by opposition members.
	   A lawmaker with Taiwan's main opposition, the Democratic
Progressive Party, conceded the Nationalists will likely get more
than half of the popular votes although DPP strategists are hoping
to win 80 seats.
	   DPP lawmaker Shen Fu-hsiung predicted that the Nationalists will
gain a majority of votes, largely because a breakaway group, the
New Party, is losing influence and likely won't take away too many
Nationalist votes this time.
	   ``This will be detrimental to the Taiwanese society,'' Shen
said, adding he believed many Nationalist lawmakers will be busy
making personal gains in the new legislature if they can stay in
control.
	   The Nationalists fielded 115 candidates against the DPP's 79 in
a race for 176 seats that will be filled directly by voters on Dec.
5. Another 49 seats will then be allocated to the parties depending
on how many popular votes they get, with eight of those seats
representing overseas residents.
	   The New Party, which broke away from the Nationalist Party over
its lukewarm support for unification with China, is running 36
candidates. Two other groups, which broke away from the DPP because
of their own more radical pro-independence stance, fielded 31
candidates.
	   The current 164-seat legislature is being expanded because
Taiwan's provincial assembly will be dismantled in January to
reduce an extra layer of local government. Functions of the
provincial government will be handed over to the central government
for efficiency's sake.
	   The larger number of seats up for grabs could favor the
Nationalists, who have plenty of money but are going into the
election still smarting from a humiliating defeat in local
elections last December.
	   The Nationalists might also get a lift from Taiwan's relatively
smooth weathering of Asia's economic crisis.
	   Shen, the DPP lawmaker who is up for re-election, says it might
take Taiwan's opposition several more years to build up support in
rural counties before it can make significant gains in national
elections.
	   For now, DPP supporters pin their hopes on incumbent Taipei
Mayor Chen Shui-bian to win re-election in another vote on Dec. 5.
A DPP victory in the capital would give the party great momentum in
the presidential race 16 months later.
	   Chen, popular because of his crackdowns on gambling and
prostitution, faces a close race despite his high approval rating.
	   The Nationalist challenger, former Justice Minister Ma
Ying-jeou, is helped by his clean image and a less confrontational
persona that appeals to many women voters.

	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Shares retreated Wednesday from a seven-month
high, giving up early gains as a recent rally ran out of steam.
	   The blue-chip Hang Seng index finished down 130.72 points, or
1.2 percent, at 10,720.99, after failing to hold on to an advance
that pushed the index to 10,979.31 early in the session.
	   The Hang Seng had gained 3.2 percent Tuesday to 10,851.71
points, its highest close since April 28.
	   Turnover fell to 8.62 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 1.1
billion), compared with 11.56 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs
1.48 billion) Tuesday.
	   Prices rose early Wednesday but stopped short of the
11,000-point level as institutional investors started selling late
in the day.
	   ``People feel the upside will be limited,'' said Adrian Ngan,
head of research at BNP Prime Peregrine Securities Ltd.
	   The Hang Seng had gained 6 percent in the first two sessions
this week and 12 percent during the past two weeks before stumbling
Wednesday.
	   Market heavyweight HSBC Holdings fell 2.00 Hong Kong dollars to
199.00. Its affiliate Hang Seng Bank fell 75 cents to 70.50.
	   Among property shares, Sun Hung Kai Properties fell 25 cents to
58.50, Henderson Land fell 1.80 to 40.90, and Cheung Kong Holdings
dropped 25 cents to 59.00.

Spanish police defuse small explosive device
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Spanish bomb disposal experts defused a
small explosive device Wednesday outside a temporary-employment
agency in Madrid, Interior Ministry officials said.
	   Police said they had been tipped off around 6:00 a.m.(0500 GMT)
by a telephone caller claiming to represent a shadowy leftist group
called GRAPO.
	   The police declined to give details about the explosive device
and said they did not know the motive of the attempted attack.
	   Earlier this month two small explosions occurred outside a
Social Security office and another temporary employment agency,
both in Madrid.
	   Such attacks are usually attributed to GRAPO, which has killed
60 people in sporadic bombings and shootings since the group
emerged in the early 1970s.
	   Its name stands for October First Antifascist Resistance Group.	   
	   October 1, 1975 is the date of the group's first major attack,
the killing of four policemen. This was in reprisal for the
execution days earlier of five suspected Basque separatists by the
regime of Gen. Francisco Franco.
	   GRAPO's precise aims have never been clear, although newspapers
have reported that at a secret congress in September it decided to
wage low- intensity attacks on what it saw as capitalist targets.

Russia may build more nuclear reactors in Iran
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia is studying the possibility of building
three more nuclear reactors at a controversial power plant in Iran,
Russia's nuclear power minister said Wednesday.
	   The United States and Israel object to Russia's current efforts
to help with the construction of a nuclear reactor in Iran, and
would almost certainly oppose the building of additional reactors.
	   ``We have a proposal to prepare a technical and economic plan to
build three more nuclear reactors in Iran,'' Yevgeny Adamov said at
a news conference.
	   Adamov has just returned from a trip to Tehran where he signed
an agreement with Mohammed Aghazadeh, head of the Iran's Atomic
Energy Organization. The deal calls for Russia to complete its work
on a dlrs 800 million contract to help build the Bushehr nuclear
power plant and conduct a feasibility study for building the
additional reactors at the same plant.
	   The United States and Israel have strongly objected to Russia
building a 1,000-megawatt light-water reactor in Bushehr, voicing
fears that it might help Iran get access to technology needed to
develop nuclear weapons.
	   Tehran denies any such plans and says the plant will be used
only to generate power.
	   Moscow insists the reactor could only be used for peaceful
purposes, and says its going ahead with the project because it
needs the money.
	   Adamov said the spent nuclear fuel from the Bushehr reactor will
be sent to Russia for re-processing and then returned to Iran for
re-use at the plant.
	   He said the construction work in Bushehr, which has moved slowly
since 1995, was gathering pace in recent months after Russia and
Iran had signed an additional contract. Some 1,000 workers, most of
them Iranians, are now working on the site, he said, according to
the Russian news reports.

Switzerland imposes sanctions on UNITA
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ Switzerland on Wednesday ordered
sanctions against the former Angolan rebel movement UNITA,
including the freezing of any assets belonging to the
organization's leaders and their relatives.
	   The sanctions, which come into force Thursday, forbid military
assistance and deliveries of arms, oil, vehicles or mining
equipment to UNITA. They bar diamond imports from Angola unless
certified by the country's government, the Swiss foreign ministry
said in a statement.
	   The United Nations mediated the so-called Lusaka Protocol
between Angola and UNITA in 1994 to end nearly two decades of civil
war, which erupted after the country's 1975 independence from
Portugal. About 500,000 people are thought to have died in the
fighting.
	   But the accord has been unraveling recently with reports of
skirmishes between the two sides and the government's refusal to
deal any longer with UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi.
	   The U.N. Security Council has imposed sanctions on UNITA _ a
Portuguese acronym for the National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola _ to try to force it to comply with the
accord.
	   The government and the United Nations have accused UNITA of
violating the peace accords by failing to relinquish control of its
four central highland strongholds and failing to disarm its troops.
	   Switzerland is imposing visa restrictions on UNITA leaders and
their adult relatives. The organization will also be barred from
opening and running offices in the country.

Indonesian students keep up demands for Suharto trial
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with protest march on Suharto's house blocked &QL; 
 &UR; By GEOFF SPENCER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Hundreds of students tried to march
Wednesday to the heavily guarded house of Indonesia's former
President Suharto to press demands that be tried for corruption and
human rights abuses.
	   Hundreds of troops blocked about 1,500 students at a park
adjacent to the U.S. ambassador's residence after they moved from a
busy downtown roundabout and through an exclusive suburb where the
former leader lives.
	   There were no reports of arrests or injuries and there was no
anti-American sentiment expressed.
	   Stopped about a kilometer (half-mile) from Suharto's home, the
students chanted anti-government slogans and shouted, ``Suharto is
a dog.''
	   Some taunted a line of soldiers who were carrying sticks and
bamboo shields.
	   Students have tried several times in recent days to reach the
home where the 77-year-old Suharto lives as a virtual recluse.
	   Two busloads of students also were blocked from demonstrating
outside the State Secretariat, next door to the presidential
palace.
	   Wednesday's protests came after troops forced several hundred
students to end a 12-hour occupation of the attorney general's
office Tuesday night.
	   Unbowed, hundreds congregated at nearby Atma Jaya Catholic
University Wednesday morning before starting their demonstrations.
	   The campus was where security personnel opened fire on
anti-government protesters Nov. 13. As many as 17 people were
killed in the violence, including nine students.
	   On Tuesday, about 1,000 students forced they way into the lobby
of the office of Attorney-General Andi Muhammad Ghalib, who headed
an earlier investigation into Suharto's wealth, which is estimated
by Forbes Magazine to be dlrs 4 billion.
	   Ghalib, a serving three-star army general, has been widely
criticized by opposition groups for going soft on Suharto, himself
a retired general.
	   Students ridiculed Ghalib on Tuesday. They produced a live hen
during their protest and chanted: ``Ghalib wants to be a chicken,
not a tiger.''
	   Others shouted ``Hang Suharto'' as student representatives held
talks with Ghalib, who refused to accept their demands that Suharto
be put on trial within one month.
	   Many students later left the building voluntarily. Pressured by
the military, a remaining group of 200 agreed to board army trucks
that ferried them to their university campuses shortly before
midnight.
	   Some students scuffled with officers, but the evacuation was
largely peaceful.
	   Last week, Suharto's successor and former protege, President
B.J. Habibie, announced the government would set up a new inquiry
into allegations that Suharto illegally enriched himself, his
family and a clique of cronies during his 32 years in power.
	   Details of the proposed commission of inquiry have not yet been
released and its announcement has failed to mollify student
protesters, who have accused the government of protecting the
former president.
	   Suharto has denied any wrongdoing and has told private visitors
that he is willing to face any investigation into his affairs.
	   Calls for a proper inquiry into Suharto's wealth have grown to
the point where the ruling Golkar Party, who helped keep him in
power for three decades, has suggested that he be placed under
house arrest.
	   Separately Wednesday, about 100 women demonstrators staged a
peaceful rally in downtown Jakarta against rising violence in
crisis-ridden Indonesia.
	   On Sunday, 14 people were killed in riots that started as a
street brawl between rival Christian and Muslim gangs in the
capital's north.

Chinese student calls for lower telephone costs for Internet use
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS with 7 grafs to UPDATE with newspaper report on Chinese
Internet service providers losing money &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Protesting that surfing the Internet is too
expensive for the average Chinese, a university student is
organizing an Internet strike to call for lower rates, a Hong Kong
human rights group reported Wednesday.
	   Huang Zhenqiang says the cost of 20 hours of Internet use in
China is about 250 to 350 yuan (dlrs 30 to dlrs 40), or about a
fourth of the average monthly salary.
	   In statements, he blamed unnecessarily high fees on China
Telecom, a government monopoly that has become ``a greedy
monster,'' the Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic
Movement in China said.
	   Huang, an economics student at Nanjing University, urged Chinese
Internet users to stay off-line for one day between Dec. 31 and
Jan. 1 and every Sunday afterward until the phone company lowers
costs.
	   The Economic Information Daily, a state-controlled newspaper,
reported Tuesday that nearly all China's Internet service providers
were losing money.
	   The report said high fees the companies pay to lease lines from
China Telecom amounted to 80 percent of their operating costs,
compared with about 6 percent in other countries.
	   But the report argued the main reason the Chinese ISPs were
losing money was that they did not provide enough information and
they were run by people who had limited English skills and few
international connections.
	   In Germany, several groups organized a similar boycott of
Internet connections against the main telecommunications provider
Deutsche Telekom on Nov. 1.
	   Success was below expectations _ several Internet providers
measured a drop of about 20 percent in the number of connections
that day.
	   Protesters wanted an easing of rates, but Telekom didn't
respond. The German campaign followed a similar boycott in Spain
that forced the telecommunications company there to withdraw an
increase in rates.
	   The Chinese government has tried to control what type of
information the growing numbers of mainland Chinese Internet users
can receive. The Ministry of Information Industry operates servers
that block sites the government considers obscene or subversive,
including those of some Western news organizations.
	   Yet the government's control is not complete. On-line democracy
magazines, for example, use roving addresses on the Worldwide Web
that are hard to block.

Ukraine's government introduces new Pension Fund taxes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine's Cabinet issued an order imposing
additional taxes that would be used to increase revenues for the
troubled state Pension Fund.
	   The cash-strapped government owed some 2.2 billion hryvna (dlrs
642 million) in overdue pensions as of this month, according to the
State Statistics Committee.
	   The new regulations, published in the Ukrainian media Wednesday,
oblige all those purchasing jewelry made of gold, platinum and
precious stones, to pay a 5 percent Pension Fund tax.
	   Previously, the tax stood at 3 percent and only involved gold
items, and concerned only companies but not private buyers,
according to the independent Ukrainian news agency.
	   A 3 percent Pension Fund tax also was imposed on the purchase of
cars, up from the previous flat rate of 100 hryvna (dlrs 29). A 1
percent tax has also been imposed on foreign currency purchases.
	   The measures were part of the government's battle to collect
more budget revenues. The lack of cash has left the government
owing billions of hryvna (dollars) in back wages and pensions.
	   Pension Fund chairman Borys Zaichuk said Tuesday that payments
to the fund were some 20 percent short of the planned amount during
the first 10 months of 1998, the Interfax news agency reported.

Mubarak says U.S. efforts to topple Saddam won't work
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Efforts to topple Saddam Hussein by courting the
Iraqi opposition will never be successful, Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak said in a newspaper interview published Wednesday.
	   ``These plans will lead nowhere,'' Mubarak told the daily Le
Figaro. ``Anyone who knows the Iraqis knows that no action will be
successful unless it comes from inside the country, from people who
live there.''
	   Asked if the CIA could help in overthrowing Saddam, Mubarak
replied: ``It would be another failure.''
	   Speaking about the most recent standoff between the U.S. and
Iraq, Mubarak said Egypt's role had been to warn Saddam of the
seriousness of impending air strikes.
	   He said he pleaded with Saddam, in a speech before the Egyptian
parliament, to save his people. ``Three hours later, Saddam Hussein
accepted the arms inspectors' return,'' Mubarak was quoted as
saying.
	   Asked if he saw an overall solution to terrorism, Mubarak
responded: ``There is only one: that each country refuse political
asylum to members of terrorist groups.''
	   Mubarak was to arrive in Paris later Wednesday for a
Franco-African summit meeting, and was set to meet with Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat later in the afternoon.

Explosion kills 12 in central China
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ A gas explosion at a small coal mine in central
China has killed 12 people, the official newspaper Beijing Morning
Post reported Wednesday.
	   The explosion occurred Friday at the Lijiayan mine in Yuanan
County, Hubei province, an area notorious for mine accidents, the
report said.
	   The report said the cause of the blast was under investigation.
Three people died in August when another mine in Yuanan was
suddenly flooded with water, it said.
	   China, the world's biggest coal producer, is plagued with
legions of mines using outdated technology and with little official
supervision. Coal mine accidents killed 157 people in October alone
by official count.

Alcohol, strained welfare system blamed for Poland's high death
</HEADLINE>
toll &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos planned &QL; 
 &UR; By BEATA PASEK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Krzysztof Chmiel knows about being
homeless and drinking, so his explanation for the 47 deaths as of
Wednesday in Poland's Arctic cold wave sounds plausible.
	   ``They drink methylated spirit and then drop dead,'' said the
46-year-old Chmiel, bundled up in a long, heavy coat at a Warsaw
homeless shelter. ``Methylated spirit warms you up really quickly,
but you also cool down quickly.''
	   The frigid Arctic air that moved in last week has claimed more
than 90 lives across Europe, including 30 in Romania and some in
France, Bulgaria and Italy.
	   Poland has the highest death toll so far, with six more victims
found overnight.
	   Police here agree that alcohol consumption contributes heavily,
saying most victims are middle-aged men who drink themselves into a
stupor and perish after collapsing outside. About 30 percent of the
total are homeless, police say, and most of the homeless victims
had been drinking.
	   That is no surprise in a nation where people drink 8.5 liters
(more than two gallons) of pure spirit each year on average, one of
the highest figures in Europe. A small number of Poles consuming
alcohol _ 5.3 percent _ account for almost half the total,
according to the Agency of Solving Alcohol Problems.
	   Among Poland's poor and homeless, methylated alcohol _ which is
ethyl alcohol mixed with toxic methanol to make anti-freeze and
cleaning solutions _ and apple wine are popular because they are
cheap and easily available.
	   Chmiel was evicted two months ago from his apartment and slept
on the floor of the Warsaw train station until Monday, when the
sub-freezing temperatures forced him to flee to one of several
shelters operated by Markot, Warsaw's biggest welfare group for the
homeless.
	   He joined about 500 others out-of-sorts men and women in the
shelter, designed for 200 people.
	   The cold has forced Markot and other agencies to change their
policy. Drunks were formerly turned away, before temperatures
dropped so low that death became a nightly threat.
	   ``The situation is critical,'' said Ewa Selke, who helps run the
Markot shelter at Marywilska street, where Chmiel is staying. ``We
don't refuse anybody.''
	   Police said they find up to 200 people sleeping on the streets
each night and take them to shelters all over the country for
safety and sobering up.
	   That further taxes the already crowded shelters in Poland, where
post-communist economic reforms have left millions jobless. As many
as 10,000 people in Warsaw are believed homeless, and Markot
founder Marek Kotanski said his organization has 40 percent less
money now than it did last winter.
	   Selke cited one problem _ an overdue utility account of 200,000
zloty (dlrs 58,000) at the Marywilska shelter, which leaves the
buildings chilly.
	   At another Warsaw center, an underground passage at Modlinska
street, up to 700 men squeeze into a space that contained less than
200 before the cold wave.
	   ``Newcomers reduce living space for other people,'' Kotanski
said. ``That causes enormous stress.''
	   The situation in poor provinces is even worse, said Ewa
Kuruliszwili of the Polish Committee of Social Welfare.
	   In southwestern Walbrzych province, where several mines have
closed under the economic reforms, only one shelter exists, she
said. People who seek help from her committee, as many as 20 a day,
get only food and clothes but no shelter.
	   The high death toll so far and the likelihood of more cold
weather in upcoming months makes last winter's figure of 54 deaths
seem small.
	   ``I see several hundred corpses,'' Kotanski said.

Chinese missionary severely beaten, rights group reports
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ A woman who helped set up underground churches
across north China has been beaten so severely in prison that she
is suffering mental disabilities, a human rights group said
Wednesday.
	   Cheng Meiying, one of about 140 members of underground
Protestant churches arrested on Oct. 26 and Nov. 5 in Henan
province, was beaten with a water-soaked hemp rope whip and a
police baton, leaving her with serious head injuries, Human Rights
in China said in a statement.
	   Ms. Cheng was released from prison Saturday in an apparent
attempt by police to avoid responsibility for her condition, the
New York-based rights group said.
	   She suffers complete memory loss and is disoriented to the
extent that she ``exhibits the appearance of insanity,'' it said.
	   Ms. Cheng, a native of Henan in central China, is a leader in
China's underground house churches. Many of these Christian groups
are neither part of the state-sanctioned non-denominational
Protestant church nor registered with the government as required by
Chinese law.
	   Ms. Cheng traveled widely in Heilongjiang, Inner Mongolia and
Hebei provinces, helping to found many house churches and convert
people to Christianity, the statement said. It added that she had
been detained and imprisoned many times previously.
	   The mass arrests last month and early this month occurred in
Wugang and Nanyang cities in Henan, where house church leaders from
around the country were meeting.
	   The warden of Fangcheng Prison in Henan, who gave only his
surname, Hou, said more than 70 of the church leaders remained in
prison, but denied any were beaten.
	   Also among those arrested were two missionaries from Taiwan, who
were released after they paid an ``astronomical fine,'' the
statement said. It said police commonly set fines of 10,000 yuan
(dlrs 1,200) or even several times that amount before they will
release people held for taking part in unofficial religious
activities.
	   The government should pay reparations to Ms. Cheng and punish
those who beat her, free other house church leaders and allow the
unofficial churches to operate independently from the
state-sanctioned churches, Human Rights in China quoted David
Zhang, who it said is a spokesman for the underground church
movement, as saying.
	   The Chinese government does not allow Christian denominations to
operate in the country but rather groups all Protestants under the
umbrella of the China Christian Council.
	   The council estimates the nation's growing numbers of
Protestants number 11 million, but other sources estimate that when
unregistered underground believers are counted the figure is much
higher.

Uganda detains 753 people in safety campaign
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ Police and soldiers detained 753 people
last weekend, but later freed more than half of them and charged
the rest with various offenses, the government said Wednesday.
	   Interior Minister Tom Butime said in a statement 243 people have
been charged with offenses ranging from robbery to tax evasion
following ``Operation Safe Kampala.''
	   Butime said security forces also recovered four machine guns,
250 rounds of ammunition, military uniforms, an undisclosed number
of vehicles suspected to have been stolen, and toy pistols used to
frighten unsuspecting robbery victims.
	   Kampala newspapers quoted people as saying the operation was
reminiscent of tactics used by former dictators Milton Obote and
Idi Amin. During their tenures in the 60s and 70s, Ugandans were
arrested, tortured and most were never seen again.
	   But Butime defended the operation saying it was necessary to
improve security in the city, which is plagued by armed robberies,
vehicle thefts and killings.
	   ``The need to rid Kampala of armed thugs should be in the
interest of us all,'' he said.

Repatriation of Myanmarese refugees begins
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COX'S BAZAAR, Bangladesh (AP) _ The government began
repatriating thousands of Muslims from Myanmar Wednesday who took
refuge in Bangladesh fearing persecution in their homeland.
	   A first group of 46 Rohingya Muslims from eight families were
sent back to Myanmar, also known as Burma, under the supervision of
the United Nations High Commission for Refugees, a district
official said on customary condition of anonymity.
	   The repatriation is likely to be completed within five months,
the official said.
	   About 250,000 Muslims fled to Bangladesh in 1991, accusing
Myanmar's military, which is predominantly Buddhist, of systematic
murder, rape and forced unpaid labor.
	   More than 212,000 have been sent back under U.N. supervision.
But 21,000 others, living in two camps in Bangladesh, had refused
to return to Myanmar's western province of Arakan.

Government looking into lavish prison birthday party for convicted
</HEADLINE>
lawmaker &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The justice secretary said Wednesday
he will investigate reports that a lawmaker convicted of raping an
11-year-old girl was allowed to hold a lavish birthday party inside
prison with a choir and roasted calves and pigs.
	   Rep. Romeo Jalosjos, who retained his congressional seat in May
despite being sentenced to two life terms for raping the girl,
celebrated his 59th birthday Tuesday at the maximum security prison
compound in suburban Muntinlupa, prison officials said.
	   The officials said caterers brought in truckloads of food for
the celebration, including two roasted calves and four roasted
pigs. Several movie stars and a children's choir serenaded Jalosjos
during the party.
	   Justice Secretary Serafin Cuevas said he will ask prisons
director Pedro Sistoza to report to him about the party, and will
then determine whether to censure him for allowing Jalosjos special
treatment.
	   Earlier, Jalosjos was allowed to build a private house by a
river within the prison complex. The building was ordered
demolished after it was discovered early this month.
	   Jalosjos also had a tennis court constructed and a seedling bank
for mahogany trees established in the prison complex.
	   Jalosjos, a rich businessman who owns one of the finest beach
resorts in the country, also was convicted on six out of 12 counts
of child sexual molestation. He was sentenced to an additional 8 to
15 years in prison on each of those counts.
	   Jalosjos has appealed the convictions. Pending a final court
decision, he ran and won in general elections in May as a
representative of his home province of Zamboanga del Norte.

Leader of Yugoslav Army fired
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic fired the head of the country's army, Chief of Staff Gen.
Momcilo Perisic, following months of rumored dispute between the
two, including the crisis in Kosovo.
	   A terse release carried by state-run Tanjug news agency late
Tuesday said Perisic's erstwhile deputy, Gen. Lt. Dragoljub Ojdanic
would be new chief of staff, while Perisic would become defense
advisor to Milosevic, a high but not executive position. It did not
elaborate on the change.
	   This is the fourth major shake-down at the top of Yugoslavia's
establishment in as many weeks, apparently a major reshuffling by
Milosevic of his closest circle of associates.
	   Perisic held high commanding positions, including leading the
army, throughout the early 1990's when the former Yugoslavia began
disintegrating. During this time, the Yugoslav army largely took
the Serb side, helping to constitute the present-day Yugoslavia
made up of Serbia and Montenegro.
	   Perisic was appointed Chief of Staff in 1993, after serving as a
commander of Serb forces fighting the Croats in Croatia's 1991 war
of secession.
	   From the beginning, Perisic had a reputation of occasionally
opposing some of the Yugoslav president's iron-fist moves.
Recently, he subtly criticized Milosevic's policy in Kosovo, the
Serbian province where ethnic Albanians are fighting for
independence, saying the conflict was partly the result of
``certain politicians' wish to stay in power.''
	   Although he never commented specifically on political issues,
Perisic was believed to be intent on keeping the army as neutral as
possible in Kosovo.
	   Perisic has also maintained ties with Milosevic's foe, Milo
Djukanovic, president of Montenegro, which disagrees with
Yugoslavia on the Kosovo crisis.
	   At the Tuesday session of the Supreme Defense Council, the
five-member decision-making body for top defense issues, Djukanovic
voted against replacing Perisic, media in Montenegro reported.
	   The chief of staff's dismissal comes a month after Gen. Lt.
Ljubisa Velickovic left the post of the airforce commander to
become deputy defense minister, following rumors of a rift with
Milosevic.
	   Earlier this month, Milosevic also fired his state security
chief, Jovica Stanisic and a top official of his Socialist party,
Milorad Vucelic.

Report: Infants for sale in Ho Chi Minh City
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Infertile couples wishing to have babies
can buy them from pregnant women at an underground market in Ho Chi
Minh City, a newspaper reported Wednesday.
	   The price ranges from 3 million to 15 million dong (dlrs 215 to
dlrs 1,070) depending on the infant's sex and whether it has an
official birth certificate, the Dai Doan Ket (Great Unity) said.
Vietnam's annual per capita income is about dlrs 340.
	   It said four to seven pregnant women often are at the market in
a park in front of the city's main market, Ben Thanh, willing to
sell their babies when they are born.
	   It quoted the women as saying they already have sold babies more
than once.
	   Asked whether they should feed the children for a few months
first, the women, mostly prostitutes, said they could not because
they would develop a relationship over time, making it more
difficult to part with the infants.
	   The paper said the market is the result of an increasing demand
for adopted children. Child trading has been on the rise in Vietnam
in recent years, thanks to foreigners wanting to adopt.
	   The women at the market said that they used to get abortions
when they got pregnant, but that they now go ahead and have the
babies for the money.
	   Earlier this year, police in southern An Giang province arrested
six people on charges of child trade.

West Indies readies for first cricket test against SAfrica
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MIKE GREEN &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ It seems hard to believe there
has only been one cricket test between South Africa and the West
Indies.
	   Thursday's meeting at the Wanderers stadium in Johannesburg --
the opener of a five-test series -- marks the first real trial of
strength between the two teams rated by the authoritative Wisden
rankings as the second- and third-best test-playing teams.
	   Given the topsy-turvy tour form of the Caribbean players, South
African fans are anticipating a measure of revenge for the
come-from-behind defeat inflicted on them in the dramatic one-off
Barbados test of 1992, South Africa's first test match after the
apartheid isolation.
	   That match saw South Africa needing just 79 runs to score on the
final day, with eight second-innings wickets still in hand. They
had outplayed the West Indians comprehensively, batting and bowling
better throughout. But they had not reckoned on the celebrated
fast-bowling skills of the islanders, and Curtly Ambrose and
Courtney Walsh scythed through them like a pair of grinning
reapers. The remainder of South Africa's batting lineup mustered
just 26 runs between them, and South Africa lost by 52 runs.
	   The same Ambrose and Walsh are here and will do battle. The
gentle nature of Ambrose's efforts against Free State, which beat
the West Indies last weekend, and the talk of Walsh's injury should
be ignored.
	   Despite any natural glee at the assumed decline and fall of
arguably the finest opening bowling duo in the last decade, the
giants remain fearsome when given a sniff of a breakthrough.
	   In South Africa's favour and in a direct counter to the
customary strong point of the West Indies is an opening bowling duo
the equal or better of any in the world.
	   Allan Donald is widely regarded as the best fast bowler in world
cricket, and the Coopers and Lybrand ratings confirm this opinion.
His partner in pace, Shaun Pollock, is rapidly becoming the best
all-rounder in the world. But it is his ranking at sixth in the
world as a bowler which gives the South African attack an edge over
the West Indies.
	   While the West Indies batting is blessed with the proven skills
and scoring abilities of captain Brian Lara, Carl Hooper and
Shivnarine Chanderpaul, and the free-scoring and aggressive batting
approach of openers Clayton Lambert and Philo Wallace, the tourists
have not clicked into run-plundering mode of late. And, as
individuals, they certainly have not succeeded with any degree of
consistency.
	   Against that, seven of South Africa's top eight in the batting
order are ranked amongst the world's top 100 batsmen. Leading the
list is captain Hansie Cronje, and he has struck rich form, scoring
a quick and big hundred against the tourists in their final
first-class game before this test. The others, Gary Kirsten, Darryl
Cullinan, Jacques Kallis, Pollock, Jonty Rhodes and Mark Boucher,
have also showed form in domestic cricket, and, given the
international stage again, they will be determined to make whatever
batting they get impressive.
	   There are possible problems. South Africa will miss the
uncompromising bowling approach of Lance Klusener. While his
replacement in debutant David Terbrugge is a good prospect who has
performed very well domestically, there may be regrets at leaving
out Makaya Ntini, who has the advantage of experience and good
temperament.
	   The West Indies bowlers have really not looked the part on tour
yet, and they all suffered at the hand of Cronje last weekend. And
given the nature of the Wanderers pitch, of late no more the
venomous fast bowlers paradise, mediocre bowling is unlikely to go
unpunished.
	   In the end, though, it might come down to which team keeps their
nerve longest. And neither team will readily forget Barbados.
	    &UR; Teams &QC; 
	    &UR; West Indies (possible 12): Brian Lara (captain), Clayton
Lambert, Philo Wallace, Shivnarine Chanderpaul, Carl Hooper, Stuart
Williams, Junior Murray (wicketkeeper), Nixon McLean, Curtly
Ambrose, Courtney Walsh, Mervyn Dillon, Dinanath Ramnarine.
	    &UR; South Africa (from): Hansie Cronje (captain), Gary Kirsten,
Adam Bacher, Jacques Kallis, Darryl Cullinan, Jonty Rhodes, Shaun
Pollock, Mark Boucher (wicketkeeper), Pat Symcox, Allan Donald,
Paul Adams, David Terbrugge.

Japanese glider pilot dies in accident
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ A Japanese pilot was killed but an
English competitor parachuted to safety Wednesday when two gliders
collided at the Australian championships.
	   Mitsuru Marui, 41, of Hokkaido, Japan, died after the gliders
collided in midair near Narromine in central western New South
Wales state. Emergency services found Marui dead in the wreckage of
his glider.
	   The second pilot, Englishman Graham Smith, 43, parachuted into a
nearby paddock. He was taken to Dubbo Base Hospital with back
injuries but was in stable condition.
	   The collision occurred before the start of competition on the
second day of the championships, which have attracted 51
competitors, including 17 from overseas.
	   Competition official Beryl Hartley said she was mystified by the
cause of the accident, the first in the event's 37-year history.
	   Both men were experienced pilots and weather conditions were
ideal for gliding, with blue skies and no wind, she said.
	   ``The accident happened before competition started for the day
so we don't know what the men were doing up then or how it could
have happened,'' she said.
	   ``They were professional pilots who did this for a living so it
is a mystery to everyone.''
	   The Bureau of Air Safety Investigation and police were examining
the crash scene.

Yemeni tribal chief accuses Saudis of trying to kill him
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By AHMAD AL-HAJ &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ The presumed target of a car bombing that
killed three people accused Saudi Arabia on Wednesday of
instigating the attack.
	   The bomb exploded in front of the German Embassy in the Hadda
district of San`a on Tuesday, killing two policemen and a young
boy.
	   The Interior Ministry says its preliminary investigation
indicates that the target was Sheik Mohammed bin Shajeh, a tribal
chief whose house is next to the embassy.
	   Police said Wednesday they were holding three persons in
connection with the attack.
	   ``Agents sent by Saudi Arabia tried to kill me because I am
siding with Yemen in the border dispute with Saudi Arabia,'' bin
Shajeh told The Associated Press.
	   Bin Shajeh is the influential chief of Waella, a disputed border
area between Saudi Arabia and Yemen.
	   ``I have steadfastly refused to allow even an inch of Waella to
become part of Saudi Arabia,'' bin Shajeh said.
	   Bin Shajeh said an anonymous caller had phoned him earlier this
month and threatened to kill him if he did not change his position.
	   Saudi diplomats would not comment on the allegations Wednesday.
	   Saudi Interior Minister Prince Nayef bin Abdul-Aziz concluded a
visit to Yemen Tuesday that was aimed at restarting border talks
between the two nations.
	   His visit helped ease tensions between the two countries whose
troops have often engaged in skirmishes along the 2,000-kilometer
(1,300-mile) frontier.
	   Yemen has long contested Saudi Arabia's claim to three Red Sea
islands and parts of the Empty Quarter, a vast desert region with
potentially lucrative oil fields. The two nations have yet to
demarcate their mountainous border in the east.
	   Yemen accuses Saudi Arabia of helping to finance its exiled
opposition and of instigating a series of explosions in the
southern port city of Aden last year.
	   For its part, Riyadh accuses Yemen of allowing arms and drugs to
be smuggled across the border into southern Saudi Arabia.

Government approves proposed secrecy law
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ A proposed law that would bring Poland's
government secrecy standards in line with NATO has been approved by
the Cabinet.
	   Interior Minister Janusz Tomaszewski, announcing the Cabinet
approval Tuesday, said Poland would be unable to join NATO as
planned next year without the draft law.
	   The proposal divides secret information into four categories:
top secret, secret, confidential and for official use.
	   Officials with access to classified information will have to
pass clearance procedures, including filling in a ``personal
security'' form for the state civilian protection office _ known as
UOP _ and military intelligence.
	   The UOP and military intelligence would be responsible for
overseeing the protection of classified information Poland
exchanges with NATO, the European Union and other international
organizations.
	   Under the measure, which requires approval from Poland's
parliament, top officials such as the president, the prime
minister, Cabinet members and others would have unlimited access to
classified information.
	   It calls for prison terms of up to five years for people who
violate the secrecy provisions.

a trial court was told Wednesday.
	   The prosecution in the case against Anwar is trying to prove
that he abused his power last year by forcing police to arrest and
obtain retractions from those who had written to the authorities
about his alleged sexual misconduct.
	   Taking the stand on the 13th day of the closely watched trial,
Amir Junus, a former deputy chief of police intelligence, said
Anwar had ordered him to force retractions from Ummi Hafilda Ali
and Azizan Abu Bakar.
	   Ummi, the sister of Anwar's former secretary, had accused Anwar
of having sex with her brother's wife. Azizan, the politician's
former chauffeur, claimed he was sodomized by his boss.
	   ``Anwar gave us the following orders. He wanted them to be
interviewed so they would be frightened into retracting their
allegations,'' Amir told the court.
	   Earlier witnesses had spoken about how the two were put through
a police procedure called ``neutralizing,'' a form of interrogation
to force people to change their views.
	   On Wednesday, Amir said that until the Anwar case, the method
had been used only against communist rebels and religious fanatics.
	   Amir said police had to carry out the highly irregular
procedures because they felt compelled to ``fulfill the
instructions issued by the accused,'' who was then Malaysia's No. 2
leader and finance minister.
	   Anwar's lawyers have tried to counter the accusations of
corruption and sexual misconduct by suggesting that there was a
conspiracy to frame the former protege of Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad.
	   Anwar, 51, has repeatedly denied the 10 charges against him,
saying they were fabricated to eliminate his political challenge to
Mahathir.
	   Police arrested Anwar on Sept. 20, two weeks after he was fired.
International concern grew after he appeared in court with a black
eye and bruises on his body, allegedly from a police beating while
in custody.
	   Anwar's case has sparked a political reform movement in the
Southeast Asian nation that has led to dozens of anti-government
demonstrations.
	   The trial was recessed during last week's Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation summit of 21 Pacific Rim leaders.
	   Some of the leaders and ministers from the APEC countries,
including the United States, Australia and New Zealand, expressed
support for the reform movement and met with Anwar's wife, Azizah
Ismail, during the trade summit.

Ukraine might break ban and execute accused murderer
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine may break a moratorium on capital
punishment and execute a man accused of 52 killings if he is found
guilty, news reports said Wednesday.
	   Anatoliy Onoprienko, 39, whose trial began on Monday in the
regional court of Zhytomyr, has admitted to the killings, which
took place in 1989 and in 1995-96, according to his attorney.
	   Onoprienko is likely to get a death sentence if convicted,
officials have said.
	   Ukraine imposed a moratorium on death penalties last year, but
President Leonid Kuchma said he was ready to appeal to the Council
of Europe regarding the possible execution of Onoprienko if he's
convicted, Ukraine's One Plus One TV channel and the ITAR-Tass news
agency reported.
	   Ukraine agreed to halt capital punishment in 1995 when it joined
the Council of Europe, the continent's leading human rights
organization.
	   However, 180 convicted criminals were executed before the former
Soviet republic introduced a moratorium on death penalties in March
1997, replacing executions with life imprisonment.
	   Amnesty International, the London-based human rights group, said
Ukraine was second only to China in the use of capital punishment
in 1996.
	   Last September, Ukraine's legislature gave preliminary approval
to a new criminal code that permits use of the death penalty only
during periods of martial law. Still, courts have sentenced more
than 80 people to death so far this year, though no executions have
been carried out.
	   The 40-nation Council of Europe, which promotes democracy, human
rights and the rule of law, forbids members from executing
criminals.
	   The Council's Parliamentary Assembly has threatened to suspend
Ukraine's membership this year unless it outlawed capital
punishment, but the threat was dropped after Ukraine pledged not to
carry out executions.

Man gets 20 years in prison for killing giant pandas
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ A farmer in southwest China has been sentenced to
20 years in prison for killing giant pandas, selling their pelts
and injuring a policeman, the state-run Xinhua News Agency reported
Wednesday.
	   The Higher People's Court of Sichuan province, which issued the
sentence Tuesday, also ordered Tang Xianlin to pay 3,000 yuan (dlrs
360) in fines, the report said.
	   It said Tang had killed or helped poach three giant pandas in
the mountains near his Pingwu County home and in a nearby nature
reserve. He sold their skins for prices ranging from 5,000 to
14,000 yuan (dlrs 600 to dlrs 1,680).
	   While resisting arrest in 1995, Tang stabbed and seriously
wounded a policeman, the report said.
	   The giant panda is an extremely endangered species indigenous
only to China. Less than 1,000 are thought to survive in the wild,
mainly in nature reserves scattered through southwestern China.

Milosevic replaces commander of the Yugoslav Army
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic fired the head of the country's army, Chief of Staff Gen.
Momcilo Perisic, following months of rumors that the two disagreed
on many government policies, including the handling of the crisis
in Kosovo.
	   A terse release carried by state-run Tanjug news agency late
Tuesday said Perisic's erstwhile deputy, Gen. Lt. Dragoljub Ojdanic
would be new chief of staff, while Perisic would become defense
advisor to Milosevic, a high but not executive position. It did not
elaborate on the change.
	   This is the fourth major shake-down at the top of Yugoslavia's
establishment in as many weeks. Perisic held many command
positions, including leading the army, throughout the early 1990's
when the former Yugoslavia began disintegrating.
	   Perisic was appointed Chief of Staff in 1993, after serving as a
commander of Serb forces fighting the Croats in 1991.
	   From the beginning, Perisic had a reputation for occasionally
opposing some of the Yugoslav president's iron-fist moves.
Recently, he subtly criticized Milosevic's policy in Kosovo, the
Serbian province where ethnic Albanians are fighting for
independence, saying the conflict was partly the result of
``certain politicians' wish to stay in power.''
	   Although he never commented specifically on political issues,
Perisic was believed to be intent on keeping the army as neutral as
possible in Kosovo. Perisic has also maintained ties with
Milosevic's foe, Milo Djukanovic, president of Montenegro.
	   At Tuesday's session of the Supreme Defense Council, the
five-member decision-making body for top defense issues, Djukanovic
voted against replacing Perisic, media in Montenegro reported.
	   The chief of staff's dismissal comes a month after Gen. Lt.
Ljubisa Velickovic stepped down as commander of the air force to
become deputy defense minister, following rumors of a rift with
Milosevic.
	   Earlier this month, Milosevic also fired his state security
chief, Jovica Stanisic and a top official of his Socialist party,
Milorad Vucelic.

Depositors clamor for money as Taiwan bank bosses dismissed
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ A crisis engulfed one of Taiwan's banks
Wednesday as the chairman and other directors were dismissed on
charges of making improper loans. The government appointed new
supervisors and provided emergency cash to try to head off a run by
depositors.
	   Hundreds of people flooded branches of the Taichung Business
Bank to withdraw their savings, and the Central Bank approved 9
billion Taiwan dollars (U.S. dlrs 270 million) of funds to help the
bank pay the panicked depositors.
	   Taichung was accused of lending up to 7.4 billion Taiwan dollars
(U.S. dlrs 227 million) to six shaky investment and property
companies that had suspected ties to the bank's chairman, Tseng
Chen-jen, according to Vice Finance Minister Yen Ching-chang.
	   Tseng was appointed as the bank's chairman Oct. 31 and approved
the loans just days later, officials said. Under Taiwan laws, the
Finance Ministry can dismiss board members of troubled banks to
protect people's savings.
	   The Finance Ministry suggested that the courts prosecute Tseng
for abusing his position of trust. Tseng is also the head of the
Kuang Shan business conglomerate.
	   The ministry ordered Central Deposit Insurance Co., which
insures Taiwanese bank deposits, to supervise Taichung Business
Bank for six months.
	   Finance Minister Paul Chiu said Taiwan's economy is still
relatively sound and will be able to achieve the projected 5
percent growth if financial irregularities can be stopped quickly.
	   In addition to the improper loans, Taichung Business Bank,
together with its affiliated Tai Yu Products Corp., failed to pay
up to 4 billion Taiwan dollars (U.S. dlrs 123 million) due for
stock purchases.
	   The Bureau of Investigation said it is investigating whether the
two companies used company funds to prop up their shares.
	   The incidents sent the blue chip index on the Taiwan stock
exchange plunging. It closed down 2.9 percent at 7,213.50 points.
	   Early this month, the government ordered seven companies to
temporarily take their shares off the stock exchange after they got
in trouble borrowing money to invest in stocks, then using the
stocks as collateral to borrow and invest more.
	   Also Wednesday, Ho Hsi-feng, head of the Kuo Yang group of
construction companies, was arrested on charges of illegal stock
deals.
	   Ho sold Kuo Yang group 6 billion Taiwan dollars (U.S. dlrs 185
million) of cheap shares in exchange for more valuable shares held
by the group, in deals suspected of being designed to help bail out
Ho after he incurred huge losses in stock purchases, prosecutors
said.

Indonesian students keep up demands for Suharto trial
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS details of protest, graf 5 &QL; 
 &UR; By GEOFF SPENCER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Hundreds of students tried to march
Wednesday to the heavily guarded house of Indonesia's former
President Suharto to press demands that be tried for corruption and
human rights abuses.
	   Hundreds of troops blocked about 1,500 students at a park
adjacent to the U.S. ambassador's residence after they moved from a
busy downtown roundabout and through an exclusive suburb where the
former leader lives.
	   There were no reports of arrests or injuries and there was no
anti-American sentiment expressed.
	   Stopped about a kilometer (half-mile) from Suharto's home, the
students chanted anti-government slogans and shouted, ``Suharto is
a dog.''
	   Some taunted a line of soldiers who were carrying sticks and
bamboo shields. A few protesters shook tambourines while others
danced and sang: ``We are in the streets for democracy.''
	   Students have tried several times in recent days to reach the
home where the 77-year-old Suharto lives as a virtual recluse.
	   Two busloads of students also were blocked from demonstrating
outside the State Secretariat, next door to the presidential
palace.
	   Wednesday's protests came after troops forced several hundred
students to end a 12-hour occupation of the attorney general's
office Tuesday night.
	   Unbowed, hundreds congregated at nearby Atma Jaya Catholic
University Wednesday morning before starting their demonstrations.
	   The campus was where security personnel opened fire on
anti-government protesters Nov. 13. As many as 17 people were
killed in the violence, including nine students.
	   On Tuesday, about 1,000 students forced they way into the lobby
of the office of Attorney-General Andi Muhammad Ghalib, who headed
an earlier investigation into Suharto's wealth, which is estimated
by Forbes Magazine to be dlrs 4 billion.
	   Ghalib, a serving three-star army general, has been widely
criticized by opposition groups for going soft on Suharto, himself
a retired general.
	   Students ridiculed Ghalib on Tuesday. They produced a live hen
during their protest and chanted: ``Ghalib wants to be a chicken,
not a tiger.''
	   Others shouted ``Hang Suharto'' as student representatives held
talks with Ghalib, who refused to accept their demands that Suharto
be put on trial within one month.
	   Many students later left the building voluntarily. Pressured by
the military, a remaining group of 200 agreed to board army trucks
that ferried them to their university campuses shortly before
midnight.
	   Some students scuffled with officers, but the evacuation was
largely peaceful.
	   Last week, Suharto's successor and former protege, President
B.J. Habibie, announced the government would set up a new inquiry
into allegations that Suharto illegally enriched himself, his
family and a clique of cronies during his 32 years in power.
	   Details of the proposed commission of inquiry have not yet been
released and its announcement has failed to mollify student
protesters, who have accused the government of protecting the
former president.
	   Suharto has denied any wrongdoing and has told private visitors
that he is willing to face any investigation into his affairs.
	   Calls for a proper inquiry into Suharto's wealth have grown to
the point where the ruling Golkar Party, who helped keep him in
power for three decades, has suggested that he be placed under
house arrest.
	   Separately Wednesday, about 100 women demonstrators staged a
peaceful rally in downtown Jakarta against rising violence in
crisis-ridden Indonesia.
	   On Sunday, 14 people were killed in riots that started as a
street brawl between rival Christian and Muslim gangs in the
capital's north.
	   About 100 women also protested in Surabaya, Indonesia's second
most populous city.

On Belgium visit, Kabila faces criticism over fighting, human

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - Congolese President Laurent Kabila's
first official visit to Belgium attracted a flurry of criticism
Wednesday over his refusal to negotiate with rebels and alleged
role in human rights violations.
	   Kabila faced demands from the European Union that he negotiate
with the rebels waging a four-month insurgency.
	   ``This allows me to ... encourage him to change his policy and
look for a political instead of a military solution, because there
is no military solution for Congo,'' said Aldo Ajello, the EU's
special envoy to central Africa.
	   Conceicao Van Dunem, the EU's spokeswoman on African affairs,
hinted EU aid could depend on solution to the conflict. ``There is
no development without peace, and no peace without
reconciliation,'' she told reporters Tuesday.
	   Kabila has refused direct talks with the rebels, demanding
instead that Rwanda and Uganda end their support for the
insurgents. He rejected negotiations again Tuesday on the first leg
of his European tour in Rome.
	   ``There are no rebels in our country,'' he told Associated Press
Television News. ``There are puppets used by the invaders of our
country.''
	   Human rights abuses under the late President Mobutu Sese Seko
led the EU to suspend all aid but emergency humanitarian supplies
in 1992, when the country was known as Zaire. Aid has not been
resumed.
	   European officials are anxious to resolve the Congolese conflict
fearing it could escalate into a wider regional war. Already the
fighting has dragged in troops from Namibia, Zimbabwe, Chad and
Angola to support Kabila while Rwanda and Uganda back the rebels.
	   Kabila arrived late Tuesday for a three-day stay in Belgium that
includes meetings with Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene, King Albert
II as well as the EU officials.
	   The visit is Kabila's first to Congo's former colonial ruler
since he toppled Mobutu to take power in 1997. His trip has sparked
protests from human rights organizations and alleged victims of
rights abuse.
	   Lawyers representing members of Congo's Tutsi minority and an
opposition political group have filed law suits against Kabila in
Belgian courts accusing him of inciting ethnic hatred against
Tutsis and other violations of international law.
	   But lawyers acknowledged that, as a serving head of state,
Kabila can claim diplomatic immunity.
	   On Monday, Amnesty International released a report on Congo
highlighting atrocities by government and opposition forces.
	   It cited widespread human rights abuses by the rebels including
killings, torture and rape, but said Kabila's forces also massacred
civilians suspected of sympathizing with the opposition.
	   Fearing protests from opposition supporters among Belgium's
12,000-strong Congolese community, the Congolese embassy in
Brussels has demanded enforced security during the visit. ``We
don't want him to be thrown into danger,'' Charge d'Affaires Emile
Kanengele told RTL-TVI television.
	   On Thursday leaves Belgium for a summit of French-speaking
African nations in Paris.

Million-dollar anti-doping program pledged by White House
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By LARRY SIDDONS &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The fight against doping in sports got a
million-dollar boost from the White House.
	   In an unprecedented action, U.S. drug czar Barry McCaffrey
pledged dlrs 1 million in federal funding Tuesday for research to
cleanse Olympic sports of all banned substances, from marijuana to
anabolic steroids.
	   McCaffrey also called on the International Olympic Committee to
set up an independent anti-drug office, award medals to athletes
cheated by doping and insist that every Olympic sport use and
enforce the same drug rules year-round.
	   The time is long past for the current ``cat and mouse game'' of
sporadic, ineffectual drug tests, the White House official said.
	   ``The prevailing belief that a large number of elite athletes
are doping causes athletes to believe that they cannot win without
cheating,'' he said. ``The common belief of widespread doping also
detracts from how the public perceives the games and medal
performances. A cynicism now envelopes every great victory.''
	   In a 10-page memo to IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch,
McCaffrey called for education and prevention programs to make
doping as ``reviled as any other form of cheating. ... The goal of
this whole effort must be to prevent Olympic medals and the Olympic
movement from being tarnished by drugs.''
	   The plan was submitted as part of planning for a worldwide drug
summit called by the IOC for Feb. 2-4. McCaffrey will head the U.S.
government delegation to that meeting.
	   While it spends millions of dollars to fight drug abuse each
year, the White House never before has committed anywhere near dlrs
1 million to battle doping in sports.
	   The U.S. Olympic Committee, which budgets more than dlrs 11
million in its own anti-drug efforts, praised McCaffrey's stand.
	   ``We're enthusiastic about the participation and the financial
commitment of the U.S. government in the international fight
against drugs in sports,'' USOC president Bill Hybl said. ``Having
the strong commitment of the executive branch is a forceful
enhancement of the USOC's efforts to detect and eradicate doping.''
	   Hybl last month asked Samaranch to award duplicate gold medals
to the U.S. women's 400-meter medley swim relay team from the 1976
Summer Games, which finished second to East Germany. Recent German
court cases have revealed that one member of the gold-medal relay
squad had been helped by anabolic steroids administered secretly by
her coach.
	   McCaffrey wants to expand the USOC request.
	   ``The IOC needs to reward medals to those drug-free athletes _
not just Americans but all international athletes _ who were
deprived of their medals,'' he said.
	   Although the proposal specifically mentions only German
athletes, a spokesman for McCaffrey said that could be broadened to
any drug cases.
	   ``We wanted the door opened,'' spokesman Bob Weiner said.
	   The dlrs 1 million research program would be administered by the
Office of National Drug Control Policy, working on its own
initiatives and on requests from Olympic authorities.
	   ``We will work in consultation with the IOC and the USOC,''
Weiner said.

Belgium joins list of nations requesting Pinochet's extradition
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Belgium joined the list of nations
Wednesday that want to try former Chilean dictator Gen. Augusto
Pinochet who is in Britain fighting extradition to Spain.
	   Brussels magistrate Daniel Vermeersch issued an arrest warrant
after ruling that a complaint against Pinochet by four Chileans
living here has merit. The four accuse Pinochet of jailing and
murdering their relatives.
	   Pinochet is in a London hospital. He was arrested Oct. 16 after
spinal surgery on a Spanish warrant seeking his extradition on
charges of genocide, terrorism and torture during his 17-year
regime.
	   France and Switzerland also seek his extradition.
	   Later Wednesday, Britain's highest court will rule if Pinochet
enjoys immunity from arrest as a former foreign head of state.
	   Also Wednesday, the Brussels-based International Confederation
of Free Trade Unions said it has launched a civil suit in Belgium
against Pinochet to ``contribute, with ample proof, to the efforts
to win redress for the crimes against humanity perpetrated by the
former Chilean dictator.''
	   The ICFTU said in a statement ``hundreds of democratic trade
unionists were arrested during the military junta's dictatorship
and scores were tortured, assassinated or `disappeared' after their
capture by the former Chilean political police, the DINA.''

Rodman, Electra go separate ways
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ORANGE, California (AP) _ Dennis Rodman is on the rebound, by
his own choice.
	   Rodman, the eccentric Chicago Bulls star, and actress Carmen
Electra were married Nov. 14 in Las Vegas, but the couple didn't
stay together long.
	   And it appears there won't be a reconciliation.
	   Rodman filed papers Monday seeking an annulment, citing fraud
and unsound mind.
	   Gerry Phillips, the lawyer who filed Rodman's petition in Orange
County Superior Court, said the couple married at 7 a.m. after
being out partying, separated the same day and haven't seen each
other since.
	   Rodman ``didn't have all his faculties about him'' at the time
of the wedding, Phillips said.
	   Electra's publicist denied that her client took advantage of
Rodman, as his agent, Dwight Manley, claimed two days after the
wedding.
	   However, spokeswoman Cindy Guagenti did acknowledge the marriage
unraveled about as suddenly as it took place.
	   ``Carmen and Dennis spoke several days ago and mutually agreed
(to end the marriage),'' Guagenti said.
	   Manley said his client is moving forward.
	   ``I just left him, he's going to breakfast, and he's in a very
good mood,'' Manley said Tuesday from his office in Newport Beach.
``Everything speaks for itself, the facts speak for themselves. It
is what it is.''
	   Manley said previously that the 26-year-old actress who once
starred on ``Baywatch'' exploited his client.
	   ``Obviously, anyone that would marry somebody that was
intoxicated to the point that they couldn't speak or stand had
ulterior motives of some sort,'' Manley had said.
	   ``I don't retract anything that was said last week,'' Manley
said Tuesday. ``I'm representing my client, Dennis Rodman, and
nobody else in this matter. My sole interest is Dennis Rodman's
well being.
	   ``Sometimes I say or do things people don't understand. In the
big picture, they will make sense or add up. Anything that I have
said is for the best interests of Dennis Rodman.''
	   The 37-year-old rebounding champion, sidelined by the NBA labor
dispute, is ready to play ball again, a development that would
please his agent no end.
	   ``I can't wait for the lockout to be over with so everybody can
focus on basketball and not be doing these other things,'' Manley
said.

Most Asian markets close lower
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Prices fell Wednesday on Asia's top three stock
markets _ Tokyo, Hong Kong and Singapore _ as a recent rally ran
out of steam. Most smaller regional bourses also closed lower.
	   Many traders withdrew from the markets ahead of the long
Thanksgiving weekend in the United States because they won't be
able to take any further cues from the New York Stock Exchange for
now, dealers said.
	   An overnight fall on Wall Street also dampened sentiment in
Asia. On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average closed at
9,301.15, down 73.12.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the benchmark 225-issue Nikkei
Stock Average shed 91.17 points, or 0.60 percent, closing at
15,073.47.
	   On Tuesday, the Nikkei had surged 384.70 points, or 2.60
percent, closing above the psychologically important 15,000-point
level for the first time since Aug. 25. It had gained a total of
810.18 points in the previous two sessions.
	   Losses were heavier earlier in the day, but the Nikkei recovered
somewhat on hopes for more government measures to stimulate the
economy after the ruling Liberal Democratic Party agreed last week
to form an alliance with the opposition Liberal Party, which seeks
further tax cuts.
	   In currency dealings, the U.S. dollar fell against the Japanese
yen. In late afternoon, the dollar bought 120.84 yen, down 0.78 yen
from late Tuesday in Tokyo and also below its late New York level
of 121.18 yen overnight.
	   In Hong Kong, the recent rally in the blue-chip Hang Seng index
snapped after it climbed to a seven-month high Tuesday. On
Wednesday, it closed 1.2 percent lower at 10,720.99.
	   The index had gained 3.2 percent Tuesday to 10,851.71 points,
its highest finish since April 28, and had climbed 12 percent
during the past two weeks before stumbling Wednesday.
	   ``People feel the upside will be limited,'' said Adrian Ngan,
head of research at BNP Prime Peregrine Securities Ltd.
	   In Singapore, share prices also fell after five days of heady
gains, as market players largely shrugged off a widely expected
package of business cost-cutting measures the government announced
Tuesday.
	   The Straits Times Index closed down 1.6 percent at 1,390.51.
	   In Indonesia, share prices fell dramatically after a five-day
rally. The JSX composite index closed down 7.8 percent at 387.383.
	   In Taipei, share prices fell after financial troubles erupted at
Taichung Business Bank, with the key Weighted Price Index plunging
2.9 percent to 7,213.50.
	   ``Market confidence is shaken, because this time it's a bank
that's having problems,'' said Lin Yu-tien, deputy general manager
at Daiwa Securities Corp.
	   The Ministry of Finance dismissed the board of Taichung Bank and
ordered Central Deposit Insurance Co. to supervise the bank, citing
suspicious lending practices.
	   Elsewhere:
	   BANGKOK: Thailand's SET index gained 1.9 percent, closing at
391.01 points, as local speculators snapped up finance shares.
	   KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysia's benchmark Composite index gained 2.6
percent, closing at 502.15 points, on buying support from local
institutional investors.
	   MANILA: The selling of shares in Philippine Long Distance
Telephone Co. following the sale of a controlling interest to Hong
Kong's First Pacific Corp. Tuesday helped push share prices lower.
The key PSE index closed down 0.2 percent at 1,958.54 points.
	   SEOUL: South Korea's benchmark Kospi index rose 0.70 percent to
464.01 points amid recent stability in Asian markets.
	   SYDNEY: The All Ordinaries index fell 0.4 percent to 2,749.4
points, following four days of gains.
	   WELLINGTON: The NZSE-40 capital index finished 0.70 percent
lower at 1,981.74 points, dragged down by a fall in market leaders
Telecom Corp. of New Zealand Ltd. and Fletcher Challenge Ltd.'s
building division.

Ukraine might break ban and execute accused murderer
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS three grafs with Ukrainian delegation leaving for Council
of Europe meeting. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine may break a moratorium on capital
punishment and execute a man accused of 52 killings if he is found
guilty, news reports said Wednesday.
	   Anatoliy Onoprienko, 39, whose trial began on Monday in the
regional court of Zhytomyr, has admitted to the killings, which
took place in 1989 and in 1995-96, according to his attorney.
	   Onoprienko is likely to get a death sentence if convicted,
officials have said.
	   Ukraine imposed a moratorium on death penalties last year, but
President Leonid Kuchma said he was ready to appeal to the Council
of Europe regarding the possible execution of Onoprienko if he's
convicted, Ukraine's One Plus One TV channel and the ITAR-Tass news
agency reported.
	   Ukraine agreed to halt capital punishment in 1995 when it joined
the Council of Europe, the continent's leading human rights
organization.
	   However, 180 convicted criminals were executed before the former
Soviet republic introduced a moratorium on death penalties in March
1997, replacing executions with life imprisonment.
	   Amnesty International, the London-based human rights group, said
Ukraine was second only to China in the use of capital punishment
in 1996.
	   Last September, Ukraine's legislature gave preliminary approval
to a new criminal code that permits use of the death penalty only
during periods of martial law. Still, courts have sentenced more
than 80 people to death so far this year, though no executions have
been carried out.
	   The 40-nation Council of Europe, which promotes democracy, human
rights and the rule of law, forbids members from executing
criminals.
	   The Council's Parliamentary Assembly has threatened to suspend
Ukraine's membership this year unless it outlawed capital
punishment, but the threat was dropped after Ukraine pledged not to
carry out executions.
	   A Ukrainian parliamentary delegation left for The Hague on
Wednesday to take part in a session of the assembly's monitoring
commission. A delegation member, Vasyl Kostytsky, said the
commission was preparing a resolution that was ``very threatening''
for Ukraine.
	   Kostytsky said the council was ``not willing to understand the
situation with the death penalty in Ukraine,'' the Interfax news
agency reported.
	   ``As soon as there was a discussion of a moratorium on death
penalty,'' an upsurge in mass murders hit Ukraine, Kostytsky said
in an apparent reference to Onoprienko.

China's swimmers to challenge Japan at Asian Games
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Chinese swimmers, missing some of their stars,
are eyeing Japan as the team to beat at the Asian Games in
Thailand, an official report said Wednesday.
	   China's formidable table tennis team, also missing some veteran
champions, is bracing for a challenge, too, and aiming for just
four to five gold medals at the games next month, another report
said.
	   Chen Yan and Wu Yanyan, world record holders in the women's
400-meter and 200-meter individual medleys, respectively, are
leading hopefuls in the pool, the China Daily said.
	   Other hopefuls are Shan Ying in the women's 50- and 100-meter
freestyle and new team member Chen Hua in the women's 800- and
1,500-meter freestyle, the newspaper said. Han Xue, a breaststroke
short-course world record holder, also has medal chances, it added.
	   But world record holders Le Jingyi and He Cihong will miss the
games, the newspaper said. Top butterfly swimmer Liu Limin also has
left to study in the United States, it said.
	   ``We excel in freestyle and relay events, but we are weaker in
backstroke and butterfly than Japan,'' the newspaper quoted Zhang
Xiong, the national team's head coach, as saying.
	   ``The competition this time will be hard because two-thirds of
our swimmers are new,'' Zhang said. ``We won't let any hope of
winning slip through our hands although it appears Japan may
dominate.''
	   In the men's events, China is aiming to win five of 14 swimming
titles, the newspaper said.
	   The table tennis team, meanwhile, will be doing without veteran
players Deng Yaping, Ma Wenge and Wang Tao, the China Youth Daily
said.
	   ``This indicates that the Chinese table tennis team has already
completed the handover from old to new,'' the newspaper said. Head
coach Cai Zhenhua said the team was aiming for just four to five
golds, the newspaper said.
	   To prepare for the games, the team went to northern Hebei
province outside Beijing for three weeks of training starting Nov.
8, the newspaper added.
	   Meanwhile, China's gymnastics team is aiming for 8 to 10 of the
14 gold medals at stake, the China Sports Daily said.
	   China, the overall gold medal leader at the past three games,
will send 596 athletes to Thailand and compete in 32 of the 36
sports. Sports officials have said China hopes to win more than 100
golds.
	   China won 137 _ or 41 percent _ of 337 gold medals at stake at
the last games in Hiroshima, Japan, in 1994.

Netanyahu cancels visit to Switzerland
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS comment by Swiss-Israeli society that relations are at a
low point, Swiss plans to set a new date for visit, grafs 8-9
 &UR; By SARI BASHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday
canceled a visit to Switzerland which had been scheduled to try and
defuse tensions over a campaign to have Swiss banks pay restitution
to Holocaust victims.
	   Netanyahu called off his trip at the last minute ``because of
his effort to expand the Cabinet and achieve a stronger base for
policy measures,'' his office said.
	   Netanyahu spent most of the night from Tuesday to Wednesday
negotiating the return of his former foreign minister, David Levy,
in an attempt to shore up his fragile coalition government.
	   The prime minister also delayed his departure for Britain
although he was expected to make the trip late Wednesday. Spain is
also on his itinerary.
	   A shadow was cast over Netanyahu's trip to Switzerland after he
participated last week in a ceremony honoring Americans and
Israelis who had campaigned against Swiss banks.
	   Those honored played a key role in winning the agreement of the
banks to pay dlrs 1.2 billion to Holocaust survivors and the heirs
of victims to settle claims for assets deposited in the banks
during World War II.
	   Swiss officials expressed their irritation over the award
ceremony but did not rescind the invitation to Netanyahu.
	   Even before the cancellation was disclosed, the
Switzerland-Israel Society, which fosters closer ties between the
two countries, said relations were at a low point.
	   Swiss officials said they expected the Swiss Cabinet to discuss
a new date for Netanyahu's visit later Wednesday.

Primakov: Emergency measures needed, but there's no emergency
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Emergency measures are needed to save Russia's
people from the ravages of the country's economic collapse, Prime
Minister Yevgeny Primakov said Wednesday.
	   However, Primakov, speaking at the Ministry of Emergency
Situations, went on to insist that the country was not in a state
of emergency. He said the economy had no problems that couldn't be
fixed with help from the state.
	   ``We can't go on waiting for the market environment to solve our
problems,'' the prime minister said, according to the Interfax news
agency. ``In such a difficult transition, development must progress
along a mechanism worked out in advance.''
	   The remarks were consistent with Primakov's previous statements
regarding the role of government in steering the economy. The
extent of that role should become clearer Thursday, when Primakov
promised that the government would agree on a long-awaited 1999
budget.
	   So far, Primakov's Cabinet has been unable to settle on a
budget, and has apparently been divided among three rival versions
of the plan.
	   The prime minister's remarks about the country needing emergency
measures were presumably meant to offer support to the Emergency
Situations Ministry, which carries out relief missions throughout
the country.
	   He said the 1999 budget would be extremely strained, and would
require emergency measures, the ITAR-Tass news agency said. He
apparently didn't specify the measures.
	   Primakov did say a new federal rescue service should be
established in 2005, ITAR-Tass said. And he called on the Emergency
Situations Ministry to improve its civil defense preparedness in
light of the potential for regional conflicts in Russia.
	   Also Wednesday, Deputy Finance Minister Mikhail Kasyanov was
quoted as saying that the first stage of debt restructuring talks
between Russia and the London Club of creditors was nearing an end.
The talks began Monday in London.
	   The government is trying to persuade creditors to restructure a
portion of the Paris and London Club debts that is inherited from
the Soviet Union.

Thai drug suspect flees during crime re-enactment
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ A suspected drug dealer hit a policeman
on the head with a pipe and escaped during a re-enactment of his
alleged crime being staged as part of investigations, an officer
said Wednesday.
	   The suspect, Thawatchai Pongsawang, will face additional charges
of assaulting a police officer, resisting arrest and escaping
detention, said the officer, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   Lt. Pitipan Krissadakorn na Ayutthaya, the policeman who was hit
Monday during the re-enactment, has 90 days to catch Thawatchai or
face disciplinary action for negligence, the officer added.
	   The officer could not answer why there was only one policeman on
duty during the re-enactment.
	   Thai police long have used re-enactments as part of their
standard procedure for investigating criminal cases.
	   In highly publicized cases, such as rape or murder, a large
crowd often gathers to witness the re-enactment, and on occasion
angry onlookers try to attack the suspects.

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic fired the head of the country's army, Chief of Staff Gen.
Momcilo Perisic, following months of rumors that the two disagreed
on many government policies, including the handling of the crisis
in Kosovo.
	   A terse release carried by state-run Tanjug news agency late
Tuesday said Perisic's erstwhile deputy, Gen. Lt. Dragoljub Ojdanic
would be new chief of staff, while Perisic would become defense
advisor to Milosevic, a high but not executive position. It did not
elaborate on the change.
	   This is the fourth major shake-up at the top of Yugoslavia's
establishment in as many weeks. Perisic held many command
positions, including leading the army, throughout the early 1990's

	   LONDON (AP) _ Britain's largest-selling daily tabloid printed a
front-page attack Wednesday on German Finance Minister Oskar
Lafontaine for his push to harmonize Europe's economies and promote
the single currency.
	   Asking ``Is this the most dangerous man in Europe?,'' The Sun
filled its front page with a large picture of Lafontaine.
	   And just to make sure no one missed its message, it teased, ``We
spell it out for Germany on page 3,'' directing readers to a second
copy of the front page written in German.
	   The tabloid said it also was printing a special German-language
edition and would circulate it in Germany.
	   ``Most of us have never heard of this man,'' opined the tabloid,
which is owned by media baron Rupert Murdoch, a fierce opponent of
economic integration. ``His name is Oskar Lafontaine. And he is the
biggest threat to the British way of life that we have seen since
1945.''
	   The Sun attacked the nine-page ``policy agenda'' signed this
weekend by finance ministers from 11 governments in the 15-nation
European Union.
	   The statement, which Lafontaine helped formulate, called for
stronger policy coordination, making growth and job-creation the
top economic priority. It also exhorted central banks to turn their
attention from fighting inflation to creating jobs.
	   The tabloid highlighted Lafontaine's support for tax
harmonization across the European Union_ which British Treasury
chief Gordon Brown has strongly rejected _ as a move to ``increase
your taxes.''
	   The newspaper also warned against plans to scrap the pound in
favor of the single European currency, the euro, which launches in
11 EU nations on Jan. 1.
	   Prime Minister Tony Blair says he is prepared to join the euro
when it is in Britain's interest to do so, but has set no
timetable.
	   ``The Sun is not anti-German,'' the tabloid declared. ``Neither
are we anti-European. ... We want a free and proud Britain with its
own currency and its own institutions working within a free
European market.''
	   ``Despite what they want you to think, the euro is not
inevitable,'' the tabloid said. ``All this claptrap is the
invention of politicians, not the people. The people of Europe
should rise up and resist this ridiculous charade.''
	   ``The people of Britain most definitely will,'' the newspaper
promised. ``Just you wait and see, Oskar.''

Congolese rebels acknowledge government-allied attacks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HRVOJE HRANJSKI &QC;

<TEXT>
	   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) _ Congolese rebels on Wednesday acknowledged
for the first time that Zimbabwean warplanes bombed the eastern
shore of Lake Tanganyika in an apparent escalation of the
government's counteroffensive.
	   Congolese state radio said on Tuesday the government and its
allies had hit an aircraft in Kalemie, a port 500 kilometers (310
miles) south of the rebel stronghold at Goma.
	   The air raid followed a similar attack last week in which the
government claimed to have sunk six barges carrying 600 rebel
troops between Kalemie and Moba, the southernmost town under rebel
control. The rebels denied the report.
	   ``There was bombing of Kalemie. But I don't know what the target
was,'' rebel leader Ernest Wamba dia Wamba said from the northern
city of Kisangani. ``As far as I know, nothing happened and there
were no casualties.''
	   ``If they are using more precise aircraft, there is a ground for
us to be extra worried,'' Wamba said. ``We are waiting for them. We
are not going let them overrun us.''
	   In the past, rebel military commanders have dismissed the threat
of Zimbabwean air force, saying its planes were dropping bombs from
too high an attitude to hit precise targets. They said the
Zimbabweans were not flying low for fear of being hit by
surface-to-air missiles.
	   The rebels have no air strike capacity.
	   Analysts blame rainy season, muddy roads and low clouds for
hampering air attacks and a lull in fighting in Congo, where the
rebels have overtaken the eastern half of the country since Aug. 2.
They claim to be pushing toward the diamond city of Mbuji-Mayi,
copper-rich southern Katanga Province, and Equatoria in northern
Congo.
	   The rebels are backed in arms and weapons by neighboring Rwanda
and Uganda, who accuse President Laurent Kabila of failing to rid
the common border of the insurgents fighting their governments.
	   So far, the government _ backed by troops, tanks and planes from
Zimbabwe, Angola, Namibia and Chad _ have had little success in
halting rebel advances.
	   Last week, Zimbabwe sent 1,500 military police to eastern Congo,
apparently to restore discipline and cut desertion among its 8,000
troops.
	   Also, Wamba dismissed as ``imprecise'' accusations by the
Amnesty International that the rebels were responsible for
killings, rape and disappearances of civilians in eastern Congo.
	   He said his Congolese Democratic Coalition had previously
admitted to killing several hundred people sheltering in a southern
church August, the most serious accusation brought by the human
rights group.
	   ``We have nothing to hide. We recognize there was a massacre. We
are conducting an inquiry. We have not come up with a conclusion
yet,'' he said.
	   Amnesty accused Kabila's forces of a string of anti-Tutsi
killings in Katanga and the capital, Kinshasa.

Singapore's parliament adopts painful wage reduction

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Parliament late Wednesday adopted a
multibillion-dollar cost-cutting package meant to help the
city-state ride out Asia's economic crisis by slashing the average
Singaporean's income by at least 15 percent.
	   The reductions in salaries, bonuses and pension payments, worth
an estimated 7.5 billion Singapore dollars (dlrs 4.6 billion) per
year, are part of an overall revitalization program aimed at
preserving jobs and regaining competitiveness.
	   Community and business leaders have questioned why Singaporean
workers must shoulder so much of the belt-tightening burden. But
the 84-seat Parliament, dominated by the ruling People's Action
Party and with only three opposition members, gave overwhelming
support to the government proposal.
	   ``When sacrifices are needed, Singaporeans will rally to the
call,'' said Zainul Abidin Rasheed of the ruling PAP. Admitting
that the cut will hurt, Zainul added that ``the alternative is even
more painful.''
	   ``The cut will touch us all,'' agreed Simon Tay, a
government-nominated member of Parliament. He warned that the
package should not regarded as a ``magic bullet.''
	   ``It gives us breathing space, but only the regional recovery
will restore real growth,'' Tay said.
	   The average monthly pay in Singapore is about 2,500 Singapore
dollars (dlrs 1,500). Recently, the government announced that the
city-state is suffering a recession, its first in years.
	   Effective Jan. 1, the legislation will reduce Singaporeans'
take-home pay by 5 to 8 percent. It will also slash employers'
contributions to the mandatory, state-run pension fund from 20
percent to 10 percent of a worker's salary, cutting the total
income by at least 15 percent.
	   The government had argued that the measures will curb
unemployment, which has doubled to 4.5 percent, and restore
Singapore's business competitiveness.
	   Singapore government ministers, who are among the highest paid
civil servants in the world, took the lead Tuesday by announcing a
20 percent reduction in their total wages.
	   To cushion the blow, the government also offered some
concessions, including an increased tax rebate, help for homeowners
who have trouble meeting their mortgage obligations, cheaper public
transport and lower hospital fees.
	   Corporations will also enjoy a 10 percent tax rebate on 1998
income, while a current commercial and industrial property tax
rebate will be extended for another year.

Romanian leu falls to more than 10,000 for one dollar
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Romania's central bank intervened
Wednesday to shore up the country's national currency, which
dropped for the first time to more than 10,000 lei to the dollar.
	   It cost 10,045 lei to buy one dollar Wednesday, up by 0.55
percent from the day before. The leu fell from 9,990 lei to one
dollar on Tuesday.
	   The central bank was selling dollars at noon Wednesday to prop
up the lei, which according to dealers is still overvalued.
	   Central bank official Adrian Vasilescu was quoted by daily
Libertatea as saying the underlying reasons behind the weakening
leu were the country's trade deficit, a falling gross domestic
product and low production.
	   In October, yearly inflation reached 47 percent, while the leu
fell by 30 percent in the same period.

	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Krzysztof Chmiel knows about being
homeless and drinking, so his explanation for the 47 deaths as of
Wednesday in Poland's Arctic cold wave sounds plausible.
	   ``They drink methylated spirit and then drop dead,'' said the
46-year-old Chmiel, bundled up in a long, heavy coat at a Warsaw
homeless shelter. ``Methylated spirit warms you up really quickly,
but you also cool down quickly.''
	   The frigid Arctic air that moved in last week has claimed more
than 90 lives across Europe, including 30 in Romania and some in
France, Bulgaria and Italy. Croatia reported its first cold-related
death Wednesday, a woman who lived alone in an unheated house.
	   Temperatures have dropped well below freezing, with minus 26
Celsius (minus 4 Fahrenheit) recorded in Poland on Sunday. On
Wednesday, Poland's low was minus 12 Celsius (10 Fahrenheit).
Romania recorded minus 10 Celsius (14 Fahrenheit) as blizzards
swept across its southeast on Tuesday.

Reports say three top Libyan officials jailed in Lockerbie case
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Newspapers reported Wednesday that three top
Libyan officials have been tried and jailed in the Lockerbie case,
but Libyan dissidents said the reports appeared to be a political
ploy by Libya's leader, Col. Moammar Gadhafi.
	   An Egyptian source, who like the Libyans spoke on condition of
anonymity, said he heard nothing about any such trials during
meetings with leading officials on a just-ended trip to the Libyan
capital Tripoli.
	   The reported jailing of the three officials comes as Gadhafi is
under pressure to accept a plan to turn over for trial two other
Libyans wanted for the 1988 bombing of Pan Am flight 103 over
Lockerbie, Scotland, that led to 270 deaths.
	   Two London newspapers, The Guardian and the leading Arabic daily
Al-Hayat, reported Wednesday that three top intelligence chiefs at
the time of the airliner bombing had been convicted and imprisoned
in Libya.
	   The Guardian said Abdullah al-Senussi, Musa Koussa and Mohammed
al-Misrati were sentenced to between five and seven years in prison
earlier this month.
	   Quoting ``well-placed sources,'' the Guardian said the charge
filed against the three was ``dereliction of duty'' but gave no
further details.
	   Al-Hayat's report said it had questioned Libyan Justice Minister
Mohamed Belgasim al-Zuwiy about the purported trials, but he had
replied only ``trials are going on all the time.''
	   Both the Guardian and Al-Hayat suggested that the jailing of the
three was aimed at blocking their testimony at a trial of the two
Libyan suspects which, under a plan approved by the U.N. Security
Council, would be heard by Scottish judges in the Netherlands.
	   After refusing for years to turn over the two men for trial in
the United States or Britain, Libya recently accepted in principle
the proposed trial in The Hague, Netherlands, but has delayed in
actually turning over the two suspects.
	   The two suspects accused by the United States and Britain, Abdel
Basset Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah, were allegedly
Libyan intelligence agents.
	   The Libyan dissidents said the jailings were probably a total
invention leaked by Gadhafi's government.
	   One dissident said the three men had been close associates of
Gadhafi for decades and were ``too valuable for Gadhafi to dispose
of them.''
	   Al-Senousi was head of the Libyan intelligence service and
Koussa was in charge of its foreign operations during the 1988
bombing. The third man, al-Misrati, was a senior official in the
Revolutionary Committees, Gadhafi's ruling party.
	   The dissidents said Gadhafi's long resistance to turning over
the two suspects stemmed from fear that their testimony would
directly implicate his government in the bombing.
	   Libya has been under U.N. sanctions since 1992 to force it to
hand over the two defendants in the Lockerbie case. The sanctions
include a ban on air links with Libya, an arms embargo and a
partial ban on the sale of oil equipment.

Serbian president expected in Kosovo

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Trying to sell a peace plan for
Kosovo, Serbia's president arrived in the province Wednesday for
another round of talks that ethnic Albanians refused to attend.
	   Milan Milutinovic's visit comes a week after he rejected a
U.S.-drafted peace plan for Kosovo and came up with his own
counter-proposal.
	   The U.S. plan, rejected by Serbia, loosens Kosovo's ties with
the republic, but keeps the province within the Yugoslav
federation, which also includes Montenegro.
	   The Serb plan keeps Kosovo firmly within Serbia giving it
self-rule. It has already been dismissed by ethnic Albanian
politicians who want independence for the province.
	   ``Milutinovic's plan is outdated. It cannot be accepted,'' the
political representative for the Kosovo rebels, Adem Demaci, said
on Tuesday.
	   Demaci, spokesman for the Kosovo Liberation Army, said the
rebels might, however, support the U.S. plan although it falls
short of their demand for independence. The KLA support is crucial
for any deal to work.
	   Other ethnic Albanian negotiators, led by Ibrahim Rugova, have
also said giving Kosovo rights equal to Serbia and Montenegro would
be acceptable. Still, they refuse to meet face-to-face with Serb
officials.
	   Most of Kosovo's ethnic Albanian majority want independence from
Serbia, but Serbs consider Kosovo the cradle of their statehood and
are unwilling to let it go. The province has been in turmoil since
the Serbs launched a crackdown last February to crush a KLA-led
rebellion. The clashes claimed hundreds of lives and forced an
estimated 300,000 people to leave their homes.
	   Demaci said for the first time Wednesday, he was invited by
Milutinovic to attend the Serb-led talks, a move he hailed as ``the
first big step forward.''
	   So far the government has refused to talk to representatives of
the KLA, which it labels as ``terrorists,'' inviting only Rugova to
the talks. The government did not confirm Demaci's invitation.
	   Earlier this week, Milutinovic condemned continuing ``terrorist
acts'' by the KLA and declared that its attacks on ``innocent
citizens, police and soldiers'' must be stopped.
	   An Oct. 12 agreement mediated by U.S. envoys led to an end of
hostilities in Kosovo and the withdrawal of many of the Serb-led
forces. But sporadic violence continues, with each side accusing
the other of starting it.
	   Serb sources in Pristina said Wednesday the KLA had carried out
176 attacks in the past month, killing five policemen and four
civilians and wounding many others. The official Serb information
could not be independently confirmed.
	   Demaci warned Tuesday that the rebels were preparing for more
fighting in spring if peaceful solution is not found.

	   COTABATO, Philippines (AP) _ Soldiers and Muslim rebels
exchanged mortar and automatic weapons fire in sporadic fierce
fighting in the southern Philippines, leaving at least four people
dead and scores of combatants wounded, officials said Wednesday.
	   Maj. Gen. Rolando Bautista, the army's area commander, said a
woman visiting a nearby ranch was killed Tuesday by a stray bullet
near the town of Datu Piang in Maguindanao province.
	   Another army officer said at least seven soldiers were wounded
in the sporadic fighting that began Saturday.
	   Al-haj Murad, spokesman for the rebel Moro Islamic Liberation
Front, said the fighting was continuing but government officials
and rebel leaders were trying to halt it.
	   He said at least three MILF rebels had been killed and five
others were injured in the hostilities.
	   Bautista said the rebels have been trying to move closer to
government positions despite an earlier agreement to maintain a
five-kilometer (three-mile) distance to prevent clashes while peace
talks continue.
	   ``They started it,'' said Bautista. ``We have been moving away
to prevent clashes but they always move in.''
	   However, an MILF official, Ustadz Shariff Julabbi, accused
government troops of having first bombarded rebel positions with
mortar fire.
	   ``The fighting was very fierce,'' Julabbi said.
	   Bautista estimated that the Muslim rebels have about 100 armed
men and the government has about 1,000 soldiers in the area.
	   Muslim rebels claim they have 48 camps, including 13
strongholds, in southern Mindanao, the country's second largest
island, but the government has yet to recognize any of these camps.
	   Because of the fighting, a road linking Cotabato to the nearby
city of General Santos, a major fishing port, has been closed.
	   The MILF is the bigger of two Muslim rebel groups still fighting
the government. The main rebel group, the Moro National Liberation
Front, signed a peace pact with the government in September 1996.

	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ A crisis engulfed one of Taiwan's banks
Wednesday as the chairman and other directors were dismissed on
charges of making improper loans. The government appointed new
supervisors and provided emergency cash to try to head off a run by
depositors.
	   Hundreds of people flooded branches of the Taichung Business
Bank to withdraw their savings, and the Central Bank approved 9
billion Taiwan dollars (U.S. dlrs 270 million) of funds to help the
bank pay the panicked depositors.
	   Taichung was accused of lending up to 7.4 billion Taiwan dollars
(U.S. dlrs 227 million) to six shaky investment and property
companies that had suspected ties to the bank's chairman, Tseng
Chen-jen, according to Vice Finance Minister Yen Ching-chang.
	   Tseng was appointed as the bank's chairman Oct. 31 and approved
the loans just days later, officials said. Under Taiwanese laws,
the Finance Ministry can dismiss board members of troubled banks to
protect people's savings.
	   The Finance Ministry suggested that the courts prosecute Tseng
for abusing his position of trust. Tseng is also the head of the
Kuang Shan business conglomerate.
	   The ministry ordered Central Deposit Insurance Co., which
insures Taiwanese bank deposits, to supervise Taichung for six
months.
	   Finance Minister Paul Chiu said Taiwan's economy is still
relatively sound and will be able to achieve the projected 5
percent growth if financial irregularities can be stopped quickly.
	   In addition to the improper loans, Taichung, together with its
affiliate Tai Yu Products Corp., failed to pay up to 4 billion
Taiwan dollars (U.S. dlrs 123 million) due for stock purchases.
	   The Bureau of Investigation said it is investigating whether the
two companies used company funds to prop up their shares.
	   The incidents sent shares into a tailspin on the Taiwan Stock
Exchange, where blue chips fell 2.9 percent.
	   Taichung is not one of Taiwan's largest banks, but its troubles
made traders more nervous than previous problems at some
conglomerates.
	   ``Market confidence is shaken, because this time it's a bank
that's having problems,'' said Lin Yu-tien, deputy general manager
at Daiwa Securities Corp.
	   Early this month, the government ordered seven companies to
temporarily take their shares off the stock exchange after they got
in trouble borrowing money to invest in stocks, then using the
stocks as collateral to borrow and invest more.
	   Also Wednesday, Ho Hsi-feng, head of the Kuo Yang group of
construction companies, was arrested on charges of illegal stock
deals.
	   Ho sold Kuo Yang group 6 billion Taiwan dollars (U.S. dlrs 185
million) of cheap shares in exchange for more valuable shares held
by the group, in deals suspected of being designed to help bail out
Ho after he incurred huge losses in stock purchases, prosecutors
said.

	   PARIS (AP) _ On his first journey from the new Gaza airport,
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat arrived in Paris Wednesday for a
day of meetings with President Jacques Chirac and Prime Minister
Lionel Jospin.
	   Arafat arrived on Flight 001 from the newly opened Gaza
International Airport, which opened Tuesday morning.
	   The airport is a vital link for Palestinians bringing goods in
and out of Gaza and a powerful symbol of independence.

then have lunch with President Jacques Chirac. Later he was to meet
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, in town for a Franco-African
summit, and dine with Prime Minister Lionel Jospin.

Singapore's parliament adopts painful wage reduction

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Parliament late Wednesday adopted a
multibillion-dollar cost-cutting package meant to help the
city-state ride out Asia's economic crisis by slashing the average
Singaporean's income by at least 15 percent.
	   The reductions in salaries, bonuses and pension payments, worth
an estimated 7.5 billion Singapore dollars (dlrs 4.6 billion) per
year, are part of an overall revitalization program aimed at
preserving jobs and regaining competitiveness.
	   Community and business leaders have questioned why Singaporean
workers must shoulder so much of the belt-tightening burden. But
the 84-seat Parliament, dominated by the ruling People's Action
Party and with only three opposition members, gave overwhelming
support to the government proposal.
	   ``When sacrifices are needed, Singaporeans will rally to the
call,'' said Zainul Abidin Rasheed of the ruling PAP. Admitting
that the cut will hurt, Zainul added that ``the alternative is even
more painful.''
	   ``The cut will touch us all,'' agreed Simon Tay, a
government-nominated member of Parliament. He warned that the
package should not regarded as a ``magic bullet.''
	   ``It gives us breathing space, but only the regional recovery
will restore real growth,'' Tay said.
	   The average monthly pay in Singapore is about 2,500 Singapore
dollars (dlrs 1,500). Recently, the government announced that the
city-state is suffering a recession, its first in years.
	   Effective Jan. 1, the legislation will reduce Singaporeans'
take-home pay by 5 to 8 percent. It will also slash employers'
contributions to the mandatory, state-run pension fund from 20
percent to 10 percent of a worker's salary, cutting the total
income by at least 15 percent.
	   The government had argued that the measures will curb
unemployment, which has doubled to 4.5 percent, and restore
Singapore's business competitiveness.
	   Singapore government ministers, who are among the highest paid
civil servants in the world, took the lead Tuesday by announcing a
20 percent reduction in their total wages.
	   To cushion the blow, the government also offered some
concessions, including an increased tax rebate, help for homeowners
who have trouble meeting their mortgage obligations, cheaper public
transport and lower hospital fees.
	   Corporations will also enjoy a 10 percent tax rebate on 1998
income, while a current commercial and industrial property tax
rebate will be extended for another year.
	   But Singapore Trade and Industry Minister Lee Yock Suan told
Parliament the domestic economy remains in crisis and the
cost-cutting package will affect growth by reducing Singaporeans'
spending power.
	   ``We are not out of the woods yet,'' Lee said.

Schroeder holds first cabinet meeting in Berlin

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder met with his cabinet
for the first time in Berlin on Wednesday, one more sign of his
eagerness to get working in Germany's new capital as soon as
possible.
	   So fixated is Schroeder on Berlin that he sped up the government
move from Bonn, but his verve has not stopped critics who say his
political goals lack direction. In office for less than a month,
Schroeder's government has wavered on tax reforms.
	   The Cabinet gathered Wednesday morning in a former communist
East German government building, a stately red brick-and-glass
structure that will be Schroeder's temporary chancellery until his
new one on the Spree River is completed.
	   On the agenda were plans for reducing youth unemployment and
introducing a European stock exchange as well as government funding
for the world's fair Expo 2000 in Hanover.
	   Unemployment reduction was Schroeder's No. 1 election promise,
and trying to fulfill it has led him to fumble over tax reforms.
After announcing new taxes in his inaugural address, he soon
withdrew them for fear of hampering the creation of low-wage jobs.
	   Schroeder won September elections for the center-left Social
Democrats partly by wooing traditionally conservative voters with
his pro-market image. The new administration has since hewed to the
left with plans to bolster social programs, drawing criticism from
conservative political opponents happy to find fault with the new
government.
	   The last Social Democrat chancellor, Helmut Schmidt, estimated
it could take a long time for Schroeder and his powerful finance
minister, Oskar Lafontaine to feel comfortable leading the nation.
	   ``They need a couple of years for sure,'' Schmidt said Tuesday.
	   Schmidt, who said he always felt the burden of responsibility
while chancellor, was in office before Chancellor Helmut Kohl
settled in 1982 for sixteen years of conservative rule that ended
when voters eager for change chose Schroeder.
	   Schroeder's Cabinet meeting Wednesday came just two days after
President Roman Herzog's staff moved into its new offices in
Berlin. Herzog's was the first federal agency to relocate to the
prewar capital in a prelude to the historic, full-scale return of
the government next year.
	   While the chancellor was not expected to move until the fall,
Schroeder announced soon after his election that he hoped to be in
Berlin by April. His chancellery, near the refurbished Reichstag
parliament building that once abutted the Berlin Wall, will not be
finished until October 2000.

Yeltsin ally in Russian parliament calls for early presidential
</HEADLINE>
elections &QL; 
 &UR; By MITCHELL LANDSBERG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The leader of a pro-government faction in Russia's
parliament called Wednesday for early presidential elections, a
potent sign that President Boris Yeltsin has lost political clout,
even among his allies.
	   Alexander Shokhin, leader of the Our Home is Russia faction,
said parliamentary and presidential elections should be held
simultaneously next September.
	   The next presidential election is not scheduled until around the
middle of 2000. Yeltsin is constitutionally barred from running for
a third term, but has insisted that he will serve out his current
term to the end.
	   The political opposition, especially the Communist Party, has
long called for Yeltsin to step down. In recent months, several
prominent allies or former allies of the president have called for
early elections.
	   ``This is an idea that might assist with constructive reforms in
the country and save money ... simultaneously,'' Shokhin said,
according to the Interfax news agency.
	   He added that Yeltsin should ``do his best to enable robust
forces to take part in parliamentary and presidential elections.''
The reference to ``robust forces'' was the closest Shokhin came to
mentioning Yeltsin's declining health, which has prompted others in
Russian politics to call for him to resign.
	   In October, the upper house of parliament, which has
consistently supported Yeltsin's government, voted 79-18 in favor
of a resolution demanding the president's resignation.
	   The president remained in a Kremlin hospital Wednesday,
recuperating from pneumonia, the latest in a long series of
frequent illnesses that have reduced him to being a part-time
president.
	   One of the potential candidates in the next presidential race,
Krasnoyarsk territorial Gov. Alexander Lebed, said Wednesday that
he opposed early elections, ITAR-Tass reported.
	   Lebed added that he found it ``improper'' for former associates
of the president to be calling for early elections.
	   Lebed is a strong and persistent critic of Yeltsin, but has also
said he wouldn't run for president until he had time to improve the
situation in Krasnoyarsk.

Serbian president expected in Kosovo

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Trying to sell a peace plan for
Kosovo, Serbia's president arrived in the province Wednesday for
another round of talks that ethnic Albanians refused to attend.
	   Milan Milutinovic's visit comes a week after he rejected a
U.S.-drafted peace plan for Kosovo and came up with his own
counter-proposal.
	   The U.S. plan, rejected by Serbia, loosens Kosovo's ties with
the republic, but keeps the province within the Yugoslav
federation, which also includes Montenegro.
	   The Serb plan keeps Kosovo firmly within Serbia giving it
self-rule. It has already been dismissed by ethnic Albanian
politicians who want independence for the province.
	   ``Milutinovic's plan is outdated. It cannot be accepted,'' the
political representative for the Kosovo rebels, Adem Demaci, said
on Tuesday.
	   Demaci, spokesman for the Kosovo Liberation Army, said the
rebels might support the U.S. plan, although it falls short of
their demand for independence. The KLA's support is crucial for any
deal to work.
	   Other ethnic Albanian negotiators, led by Ibrahim Rugova, have
also said giving Kosovo rights equal to Serbia and Montenegro would
be acceptable. Still, they refuse to meet face-to-face with Serb
officials.
	   Most of Kosovo's ethnic Albanian majority want independence from
Serbia, but Serbs consider Kosovo the cradle of their statehood and
are unwilling to let it go. The province has been in turmoil since
the Serbs launched a crackdown last February to crush a KLA-led
rebellion. The clashes claimed hundreds of lives and forced an
estimated 300,000 people to leave their homes.
	   Demaci said for the first time Wednesday, he was invited by
Milutinovic to attend the Serb-led talks, a move he hailed as ``the
first big step forward.''
	   So far the government has refused to talk to representatives of
the KLA, which it labels as ``terrorists,'' inviting only Rugova to
the talks. The government did not confirm Demaci's invitation.

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Facing mounting frustration on
all sides, British Prime Minister Tony Blair sought solutions
Wednesday to the profound disagreements that are hobbling Northern
Ireland's peace agreement.
	   Blair discussed the tense situation with the province's British
Protestant and Irish Catholic politicians, who are supposed to form
a multi-party coalition government as the centerpiece of April's
historic accord.
	   Seamus Mallon, the deputy head both of the new government and of
the major Catholic-supported party, the Social Democratic and Labor
Party, warned that ``the potential for this whole experiment to
crack up is much greater than people realize.''
	   He said the accord would lose credibility if the two sides
failed to agree by early December on specific areas of cooperation
between Northern Ireland's new government and the Irish government
in Dublin.
	   Leaders of the north's substantial Catholic minority expect
strong political links to be formed as an expression of their
desire for Ireland's eventual unification.
	   But David Trimble, the head of the new government whose Ulster
Unionist Party has long defended Northern Ireland's union with
Britain, criticized Mallon's position.
	   ``It is not helpful to generate a sense of crisis where none
exists, nor is it helpful to generate artificial deadlines, when
there aren't deadlines in the process. We are making progress,''
said Trimble, who in October shared this year's Nobel Peace Prize
with Mallon's party leader, John Hume.
	   Also taking part in the talks with Blair was Sinn Fein leader
Gerry Adams, whose Irish Republican Army-affiliated party expects
to receive two positions in any Northern Ireland administration.
	   Trimble insists that Protestants won't accept Sinn Fein in the
government unless the IRA starts disarming as proof that the
outlawed group has really renounced violence.
	   The IRA, 16 months into a cease-fire, insists it won't disarm
even though April's agreement calls for the group to do by
mid-2000.

Report: Singapore patriarch says Malaysia not cause of concern
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore elder statesman Lee Kuan Yew says the
current political struggle in neighboring Malaysia is no cause for
panic, Singapore TV reported Wednesday.
	   Speaking on BBC Radio's East Asia Today program, Lee reportedly
said Malaysia has the institutional stability that Indonesia lacks,
and its economy is also much stronger.
	   ``I don't see Malaysia going up in flames,'' Lee was quoted as
saying.
	   The arrest and trial of Malaysia' reform-minded former No. 2
leader, Anwar Ibrahim, has provoked unrest in recent weeks in the
country's capital. Indonesia, Singapore's large southern neighbor,
is being shaken for the second time this year by massive
anti-government protests, accompanied by violence.
	   Lee, who served as prime minister for 31 years, now holds the
title of senior minister in the Prime Minister's Office, and still
wields enormous influence.
	   Singapore, whose relationship with Malaysia has gone through
frequent uneasy spells, so far had refrained from commenting on
Anwar's case. Malaysia's former deputy prime minister is charged
with sexual misconduct and abuse of power. He has denied the
charges, calling them politically motivated.
	   Leer was quoted as saying he was surprised Anwar was arrested
under Malaysia's Internal Security Act, instead of the penal code.
	   ``It is unfortunate, these developments, but again one setback
doesn't demolish institutional strengths which have lasted for
decades,'' Lee was quoted as saying.
	   ``So I would hope that the rest of the trial will prove that the
judges and the system, the right of counsel to press their case,
defense counsel especially, and the fairness of the prosecution
would help re-establish and restore public confidence,'' Lee said.

Criminals try to block autobiography of India's former ``demolition
</HEADLINE>
man'' &QL; 
 &UR; By RAMOLA TALWAR &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BOMBAY, India (AP) _ A publisher in India said Wednesday he was
threatened by gangsters just days before his company planned to
release a book exposing the criminal links with powerful
politicians.
	   The book, an autobiography of former government official Govind
Khairnar, was scheduled to hit the market Wednesday. Khairnar was
once dubbed ``the demolition man'' after he ordered the razing of
unauthorized buildings owned by the reputed criminals.
	   ``There were anonymous phone calls to our office warning us not
to publish the book or else ... but we informed the police and have
been given protection,'' said Arun Belsare, editor of the
publishing company Pushpa Prakashan.
	   He said the callers also demanded 3.2 million rupees (dlrs
76,000).
	   The 260-page ``Ekaki Jung'' (Solitary Battle) is written in
Marathi, the language spoken in the western state of Maharashtra,
of which Bombay is the capital. An English version will follow in
two months.
	   Khairnar, 57, whose reputation for incorruptibility won him a
wide range of enemies as well as admirers, said the threats did not
bother him. He claimed he has been assaulted or targeted 100 times,
and his injuries includ a bullet wound to the head. He has been
give police protection.
	   The book details Khairnar's contacts with Hindu right-wing
leaders Bal Thackeray and Ashok Singhal; with Congress Party leader
and former Defense Minister Sharad Pawar; and reputed underworld
figures Vardarajan, Dawood Ibrahim and Amar Naik. Vardarajan uses
only one name.

It's the literary prize authors don't want to win
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KRISTIN GAZLAY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Will the winner be Julian Barnes, author of an
unfortunate episode featuring a diapered male character, a bowl of
ice water and a prostitute asking ``Baby do poo?''
	   Or perhaps writer Alan Titchmarsh, who somehow managed to pack
the ``lissome limbs of this human boa constrictor'' and ``liquid
noises'' into a single paragraph in his book ``Mr. MacGregor''?
	   One thing is certain: Whoever wins this award does not want it.
	   The august Literary Review's Bad Sex Prize _ presided over by
the son of ``Brideshead Revisited'' author Evelyn Waugh, no less _
pays homage to the literary carnage that can ensue when bad sex
happens to good, and not-so-good, writers.
	   The point of the prize is simple, as set out by the Review and
its editor, Auberon Waugh: ``to draw attention to the crude,
tasteless, often perfunctory use of redundant passages of sexual
description in the modern novel, and to discourage it.''
	   Appropriately, last year's winner, Nicholas Royle for ``The
Matter of the Heart,'' was presented with ``a semi-abstract statue
representing incompetent English sex.''
	   One of the hottest candidates going into Thursday's awards
dinner is lesser novelist but great English statesman Douglas Hurd,
whose sexual passages in ``The Shape of Ice'' come off more
perfunctory than passionate. Kind of a ``Then he ..., then she''
format.
	   Still, the former Conservative foreign secretary does possess
the flights of carnal fancy necessary to describe his prime
minister hero as standing before his secretary _ she who is called
Artemis _ ``trembling and naked, a white forked nothing.''
	   The winners have shown up every year _ albeit with gritted teeth
_ since the prize's inception in 1993.
	   In 1995, Philip Kerr was booed lustily when he used the occasion
of winning for ``Gridiron'' to blast the Review and take Britons to
task for continuing to regard sex as a subject for sniggering.
	   But 1996 honoree David Huggins, whose ``The Big Kiss'' contained
indelible phrases like ``Liz squeaked like wet rubber'' and ``she
hooked a yoga-leg onto my shoulder,'' took the award in the spirit
in which it was intended.
	   ``This is my first prize,'' he told the glittering assemblage.
``I may celebrate by having bad sex.''
	   As in previous years, 1998's list of unlucky 13 nominees _ which
also includes Alice Walker, Carlos Fuentes, Mary Gordon and actor
Richard E. Grant (``She sucks my tongue so hard it is difficult to
form a syllable ...'') _ were culled from nominations from the
monthly periodical's readers.
	   It was inevitable, of course, that at least one reader would
single out Kenneth Starr's report on President Bill Clinton's
affair with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky _ a tome in
which cigars now rate as foreplay.
	   ``I am not sure it qualifies, until such time as the whole
episode is officially relegated to the fiction shelf,'' Waugh
writes of ``The Starr Report'' in the Review's latest issue.
	   But, he quickly concedes, ``it certainly contains plenty of bad
sex.''

Chief executive out at Hong Kong airport
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Five months after the disastrous opening of
Hong Kong's new U.S. dlrs 20 billion airport, its chief executive
is stepping down along with several colleagues, the Airport
Authority said Wednesday.
	   The departure of Hank Townsend, a former International Bechtel
Inc. engineer, takes effect Monday, when his contract ends, Airport
Authority spokesman Chris Donnolley said.
	   Townsend was ``was suspected to have had a mild stroke, but that
is not the reason why he is retiring,'' Donnolley said, declining
to elaborate.
	   The move comes just days after Townsend testified during
legislative hearings that he could have been more forthcoming about
potential problems when the airport opened July 6.
	   Government officials have complained they were not fully
informed and proceeded with a gala opening of the airport that left
them embarrassed as computer breakdowns and systems problems
crippled both passenger and cargo services.
	   Townsend was replaced _ at least for now _ by Billy Lam
Chung-lun, deputy chief executive of the Airport Authority, who has
been named acting chief executive.
	   Meantime, the official who originally said he would take the
blame for the airport troubles was reappointed as chairman of the
Airport Authority, along with 14 other board members whose terms
were expiring.
	   Wong Po-yan and the others will keep their jobs ``as an interim
arrangement'' for another six months, amid investigations into the
mess, the government said.
	   But a statement added: ``It is premature at this stage to say
what changes would be made to the composition of the board in the
future.''
	   Wong apparently had retracted an earlier offer to take the blame
for the airport blunders and not seek reappointment as chairman,
Donnolley said.
	   There was no immediate comment from Hong Kong Chief Executive
Tung Chee-hwa, who appoints the chairman and board members.
	   ``The airport is now running smoothly and we will continue to do
all we can in close collaboration with government,'' Wong said in
an Airport Authority statement.
	   The airport's troubled opening was costly as well as humiliating
for Hong Kong. The government has estimated that a ban for more
than a month on all cargo except perishables and essential goods
will shave 0.35 percent off the territory's gross domestic product
this year.
	   A government-appointed panel and a legislative committee that
includes government critics were formed late July to determine what
went wrong and who was to blame. The government ombudsman also
launched a separate investigation.
	   Donnolley said other airport figures who are leaving include
Clinton Leeks, corporate development director and chief spokesman
during the airport's opening; Elizabeth Bosher, planning and
coordination director; and Doug Ogilvy, project director.

U.N. promises to bring in inspection teams within days
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES and RECASTS with U.N. spokeswoman saying inspection
teams to arrive in days, newspaper comment, CHANGES byline. No
pickup.
 &UR; By WAIEL FALEH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ The United Nations will bring new
inspection teams to Iraq within days, a U.N. spokeswoman said
Wednesday, to carry out searches that have proved confrontational
in the past.
	   U.N. inspectors have carried out daily visits since Nov. 14,
when Iraq relented and allowed the arms experts to resume their
work after a two-week hiatus. Iraq has so far provided full
cooperation.
	   Most of the visits have involved checks on long-term monitoring
equipment at already-searched weapons sites.
	   ``All of our inspectors have gone to the sites for the normal
and routine visits to the already monitored sites,'' said Caroline
Cross, a U.N. spokeswoman for the weapons inspectors in Iraq.
	   In the past, searches by visiting teams of inspectors to new
sites have have proven the most confrontational, sometimes angering
Iraqi officials. The chief U.N. weapons inspector, Richard Butler,
has promised to carry out the full range of inspections soon.
	   Cross said the teams should arrive this week.
	   ``We do not know when the visiting teams will arrive but they
should be coming to carry out the inspections in the next few
days,'' Cross told The Associated Press.
	   On Tuesday, the U.N. Security Council pledged its support for
weapons inspectors, but did not address the issue of Butler's
request for Iraqi documents on weapons programs, including personal
diaries and a hand-written log cataloging suspected chemical
weapons.
	   Iraq has insisted that the documents have been destroyed, are
irrelevant to the inspectors' work or have already been handed
over.
	   Although the United States and Britain have said the use of
military force is still possible, they seem willing to wait to see
how much help Iraq provides in the coming weeks. Still, U.S.
officials have insisted that Iraq fully cooperate.
	   ``I don't believe Iraq should be in the position of declaring
unilaterally that documents are irrelevant to the needs and
requests of the inspectors,'' Defense Secretary William Cohen said
Tuesday.
	   Iraq's official media Wednesday kept up the criticism of Butler,
whom it blames for prolonging crippling sanctions imposed after
Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990. Inspectors must certify that Iraq has
destroyed its long-range missiles, chemical, nuclear and biological
weapons and programs to build them before sanctions can be lifted.
	   Butler looks for ``a new excuse to be used by the United States
and Britain in order to trigger a new aggression against Iraq,''
said Al-Thawra, the newspaper of the ruling Baath Party.
	   ``It seems that his part is confined to creating a new crisis,
no more,'' the newspaper said in an editorial.
	   Iraq's failure to cooperate with U.N. inspectors could delay a
U.N. review of progress on its disarmament that Iraq hopes will
ease the sanctions, which include a ban on its export of oil.

Georgia, Czech agree on jet repair deal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TBILISI, Georgia (AP) _ Georgia and the Czech Republic have
agreed on a deal to repair Czech fighter planes at a factory in
Tbilisi, a Defense Ministry spokesman said Wednesday.
	   The agreement was reached during a visit by Czech Deputy Defense
Minister Jaromir Novotny. The Czech Republic owns a fleet of
Georgian-built Su-25 attack jets that date to Czechoslovakia's days
as a Soviet satellite.
	   The two sides also discussed the idea of the Czech Republic
buying spare parts for the planes, but Georgian officials said such
a deal would be impossible without Russian cooperation, Defense
Ministry spokesman Koba Liklikadze said.
	   Parts for the planes are manufactured in Russia, although the
jets are assembled at the Sukhoi plant in Tbilisi.
	   Liklikadze did not say how much the Su-25 repairs would cost.

U.N. panel says uranium mine should be stopped
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Northern Territory reaction; ADDS in 4th graf
that decision has no legal standing and that mine will go ahead &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ A United Nations World Heritage
committee called Wednesday for the scrapping of the proposed
Jabiluka uranium mine in Australia's Northern Territory.
	   The committee said the proposed mine would pose a severe danger
to the cultural and natural values of the adjacent Kakadu National
Park.
	   ``The mission therefore recommends that the proposal to mine and
mill uranium at Jabiluka should not proceed,'' the committee said
in its report following a visit to Kakadu last month.
	   However, federal Environment Minister Robert Hill called the
report biased, unbalanced and lacking in objectivity. He stressed
that the committee's findings had no legal standing and that
construction of the mine would not stop.
	   ``I am disturbed and distressed about the quality of this
document,'' Hill said. ``There has not been a case developed that
could, in any way, lead to the conclusion they have reached.''
	   Kakadu is almost 12,000 square miles (31,000 square kilometers)
of pristine floodplains and plateau on Australia's north coast,
with spectacular waterfalls, a towering 125-mile (200-kilometer)
sandstone escarpment and hundreds of animal species, including many
that are rare or endangered.
	   The park is one of a handful listed for both environmental and
cultural values. About 200,000 tourists visit the park every year.
	   The report said the mine, which could process 19.5 million
metric tons of uranium ore over its 28-year life, could damage the
environment.
	   The miner, Energy Resources of Australia Ltd., told the panel
that its project does not threaten the environmental and cultural
values of Kakadu, which are recognized by the United Nations' World
Heritage Bureau.
	   The company already has begun construction of its Jabiluka
uranium mine, which is within the boundaries, but technically not
part of Kakadu.
	   ERA also promised it would rehabilitate the site ``to a
condition ecologically and culturally compatible with Kakadu.''
	   In Darwin, Northern Territory Chief Minister Shane Stone said
Australia had been ambushed by the committee.
	   ``They (the committee) spent four days in Kakadu. ... They just
swept to one side 18 years of work by the supervising scientist who
has approved the workings of both the Ranger uranium mine and the
proposals for the nearby Jabiluka mine,'' Stone said.
	   He said that at the World Heritage Bureau meeting in Kyoto,
Japan, next year, the Australian government delegation would oppose
the committee's claim that the mine justified putting Kakadu on the
World Heritage in danger list.

Randell charges made public
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HOBART, Australia (AP) _ Sex charges against Australian
international umpire Steve Randell were made public Wednesday.
	   Randell will plead not guilty to 26 charges including
allegations that he had sexual intercourse with an underage boy and
that he allegedly fondled or stroked 10 different females.
	   Randell, 42, is a Hobart primary schoolteacher who has stood in
an Australian record 36 test matches.
	   The 26 charges include 11 different people, 10 of them female of
undisclosed age.
	   Until now, the court had released only bare summaries of the
charges. However, the details became available after the expiration
of a stay of execution from a Supreme Court ruling last week that
the public was entitled to know the nature of the charges.
	   Twenty-five of the charges allege unlawful and indecent assault
and one unlawful sexual intercourse with a boy aged under 17.
	   The offenses allegedly occurred in different parts of Tasmania
between 1979 and 1995.
	   Randell has stood down from umpiring and been suspended from
teaching on full pay. He is to appear again in Hobart Magistrates
Court on Monday.

Poland to sell former Warsaw Pact secret war headquarters
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Poland's government will auction off an
underground nuclear shelter that formerly was a Warsaw Pact secret
war headquarters for an opening bid price of dlrs 20,000, a
spokesman said Wednesday.
	   The shelter in Gluchow Gorny, 350 kilometers (210 miles)
southwest of Warsaw, is being auctioned under a program to sell off
obsolete property and equipment by the Military Property Agency.
	   Agency spokesman Wieslaw Rozbicki said the former nuclear
shelter, on a 34-hectare (84-acre) plot with an air-conditioned
bunker 15 meters (50 feet) underground, could become a wine
storehouse.
	   The agency expects to raise 55 million zloty (dlrs 16 million)
this year from its sales. Some items, such as Soviet-built MIG jet
fighters sold for spare parts or scrap, also are popular among
American collectors, he said.
	   The military plans to sell off a third of its real estate by
2012.
	   Much of the land scheduled for sale is near Poland's western
border with Germany and the Czech Republic. With plans for Poland
and the Czech Republic to join NATO next year, Poland already has
started disbanding units along its western border.

Indians vote in crucial provincial elections

	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Millions of Indians voted Wednesday in
provincial elections that could cast shadows on the fortunes of
Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee's wobbly coalition.
	   The ballot count begins Saturday, but an exit poll forceast a
sweeping victory for the Congress Party, led by Sonia Gandhi, in
the state of New Delhi, which would dislode the state government of
the rightwing Bharatiya Janata Party.
	   The poll, conducted by the private Center for Media Studies and
broadcast on STAR television, covered 1,500 voters. Results of the
exit polls from three other states were not immediately released.
	   More than 80 million voters were eligible to choose 626 state
legislators from among 5,000 candidates in the northern state of
New Delhi where the federal capital is located, in Rajasthan in
India's western desert, in the central state of Madhya Pradesh and
in the tiny northeastern state of Mizoram _ four of India's 26
states.
	   Pre-election surveys predicted gains by the Congress Party over
the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, mainly because of
discontent with the soaring prices of vegetables. The BJP, which
also heads the federal government, governs two of the four states,
and Congress rules two.
	   Voting was largely peaceful but some violence was reported in
Madhya Pradesh state. Tens of thousands of armed police guarded
voting stations in four states where borders were sealed to prevent
the entry of criminals from other states.
	   Police arrested a Congress Party candidate, Hari Singh Narvaria,
after he fired gunshots in the air apparently to scare away his
opponents in Madhya Pradesh state, United News of India news agency
said.
	   The election commission in the state also ordered authorities to
seize Congress leader Kamal Nath's helicopter, which was being used
to ferry voters, UNI said.
	   A group of Naxalites, who asked the voters to boycott the
elections, looted a polling station in Bastar region of Madhya
Pradesh. The Naxalites are waging an armed struggle to create a
communist state comprising tribal areas of four neighboring states.
	   Vajpayee and his party colleagues shrugged off adverse
pre-election voter surveys, saying they were taken even before the
dates for the elections were announced.
	   But most analysts see the vote as the first test of popularity
for the BJP-led government since it came to office in March. A poor
showing by the Hindu nationalist BJP could increase tension within
the 19-party ruling alliance, now strained by restive allies.
	   It also is a key electoral test for the Congress Party's new
leader, Sonia Gandhi, widow of slain former Prime Minister Rajiv
Gandhi and torchbearer of the dynasty that gave India three prime
ministers.
	   Despite aggressive campaigning by both Vajpayee and Gandhi,
political analysts said the electorate appeared apathetic.
	   ``This is the most low-key provincial election in 40 years,''
said N. Bhaskara Rao, whose Center for Media Studies carried out
pre-election surveys in the four states.
	   Rao said voters' concern was focused on the spiraling rise in
prices of essential commodities in recent months, including a
massive shortage of onion which became a powerful symbol of protest
for opposition ranks.

	   LONDON (AP) _ With a ruling imminent from Britain's highest
court, supporters of Gen. Augusto Pinochet visited the hospital
where the former Chilean dictator marked his 83rd birthday
Wednesday waiting to hear if he can go free or must fight
extradition to Spain on charges of genocide, terrorism and torture.
	   Drum-beating anti-Pinochet demonstrators draped a giant Chilean
flag from trees opposite the Grovelands Priory, a private hospital
set in parklands, and decorated branches with pink ribbons and
placards demanding ``no immunity.''
	   Outside the House of Lords, where a five-judge tribunal will
rule whether Pinochet has immunity from arrest under British law as
a former foreign head of state, relatives of people who disappeared
during his 1973-90 rule clustered on the sidewalk under leaden
skies.
	   ``If England does not extradite him, it will mean that dictators
have impunity _ England will be legtimizing acts of torture as
state acts,'' said Miredia Garcia, secretary of the Chilean
Organzation of the Families of the Disappeared.
	   A ruling in Pinochet's favor would mean he could be whisked
immediately from the hospital to board a waiting jet for Chile.
	   Conversely, a win for prosecutors would touch off a lengthy
extradition battle.
	   Home Secretary Jack Straw would have to decide by Dec. 2 whether
to allow the Spanish extradition request to go before the courts.
Pinochet, health permitting, also would make his first public
appearance since his arrest at a preliminary hearing at Bow Street
that day.
	   Supporters were seeking an English country house for Pinochet to
stay in comfort if he loses.
	   Lawyers for Spanish and British authorities had appealed a High
Court ruling that Pinochet's Oct. 16 arrest was illegal because he
has immunity.
	   A Chilean government report says 3,197 people were murdered or
disappeared at the hands of secret police after he ousted President
Salvador Allende, an elected Marxist.
	   Pinochet's lawyers argued that though it might be morally
regrettable, Britain's 1978 State Immunity Act was sufficiently
sweeping to give even Adolf Hitler immunity.
	   Prosecutors' lawyers pointed to the Nuremberg trials of World
War II Nazi leaders and recent trials of Rwandan Hutus and Bosnians
for mass murder or war crimes, and said the development of
international law and custom has put some offenses beyond immunity.
	   Pinochet, a regular visitor to Britain, was arrested on a
Spanish warrant while in another London hospital recuperating from
back surgery.
	   Among his early visitors Wednesday was his daughter, Lucia. She
pulled two bags from her car before going into the hospital,
ignoring the demonstrators.
	   Lawyers have said Pinochet is fit enough to be moved, but he
stayed in the hospital awaiting the verdict _ being carried live on
television in Britain and Chile.
	   In Santiago, the Chilean government banned a pro-Pinochet
birthday rally because of fears of violence. But an organizer,
Ximena Garin, warned ``we will not stay with our arms crossed at
our houses.''
	   Also Wednesday, Belgium joined the queue seeking Pinochet's
extradition. Brussels magistrate Daniel Vermeersch issued an arrest
warrant at the instigation of four Chilean exiles.
	   France and Switzerland also have lodged extradition requests.
But if the Lords uphold Pinochet's immunity, Britain would not be
able to act on any warrants.

Indonesian students keep up demands for Suharto trial

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Hundreds of students tried to march
Wednesday to the heavily guarded house of Indonesia's former
President Suharto to press demands that be tried for corruption and
human rights abuses.
	   Troops blocked about 1,500 students at a park adjacent to the
U.S. ambassador's residence after they moved through an exclusive
suburb where the former leader lives.
	   There were no reports of arrests or injuries and there was no
anti-American sentiment expressed.
	   Stopped about a kilometer (half-mile) from Suharto's home, the
students chanted anti-government slogans and shouted, ``Suharto is
a dog.''
	   Some taunted a line of soldiers who were carrying sticks and
bamboo shields. A few protesters shook tambourines while others
danced and sang: ``We are in the streets for democracy.''
	   Students have tried several times in recent days to reach the
home where the 77-year-old Suharto lives as a virtual recluse.
	   Two busloads of students also were blocked from demonstrating
outside the State Secretariat, next door to the presidential
palace.
	   Meanwhile, under pressure to take action against the former
autocrat, the government said Suharto had handed over control of
seven charitable foundations that he established during 32 years in
power.
	   Critics have alleged that the foundations, worth dlrs 530
million, siphoned off state wealth to benefit the Suharto family's
business empires.
	   Suharto has denied any wrongdoing and has told private visitors
that he is willing to face any investigation.
	   Last week, his successor and former protege, President B.J.
Habibie, ordered a new inquiry into corruption allegations against
Suharto.
	   The government said Wednesday that details of the proposed
commission of inquiry will be released this week. Its announcement
has failed to mollify the students who accuse the government of
protecting Suharto.
	   Wednesday's protests came after 1,000 students occupied the
office of Attorney General Andi Muhammad Ghalib for 12 hours before
being forced out by troops Tuesday.
	   Ghalib, a three-star general, headed an earlier investigation
into Suharto's wealth, which is estimated by Forbes Magazine at
dlrs 4 billion. He has been widely criticized by opposition groups
for going soft on Suharto, himself a retired general.
	   Students produced a live hen during their sit-in protest and
chanted: ``Ghalib wants to be a chicken, not a tiger.''
	   Others shouted ``Hang Suharto'' after Ghalib refused to accept
their demands that Suharto be put on trial within one month.
	   Many students later left the building voluntarily. A remaining
group of 200 left shortly before midnight after a scuffle with
troops.
	   On Wednesday, Ghalib criticized the students for interrupting
his work and said his office had tried hard to investigate
Suharto's wealth.
	   Unrepentant, hundreds congregated at nearby Atma Jaya Catholic
University Wednesday morning before starting their demonstrations.
	   The campus was where security personnel opened fire on
anti-government protesters Nov. 13. As many as 17 people were
killed in the violence, including nine students.
	   Calls for a full inquiry into Suharto's wealth have grown to the
point where the ruling Golkar Party, which helped keep him in power
for three decades, has suggested that he be placed under house
arrest.
	   In another development, an opinion poll has suggested that
Habibie is trailing badly in popularity against opposition figures.
	   The poll published in Tempo magazine this week said only 7
percent of 500 voters polled in five cities favored Habibie as head
of state.
	   The most popular was Amein Rais, a prominent Muslim leader and
intellectual, with 31 percent. Close behind with 30 percent was
Megawati Sukarnoputri, the daughter of founding president Sukarno.
	   Despite the small sample size, pollsters said it had a 5 percent
margin of error.
	   A presidential ballot is expected to be held by a government
assembly next year after a parliamentary election that senior
legislators say will probably be held June 7.
	   Parliament Speaker Harmoko said Wednesday that a presidential
vote could be held in September or October. Originally, Habibie
said the vote would take place in December.
	   Separately Wednesday, about 100 women demonstrators staged a
peaceful rally in downtown Jakarta against rising violence in
crisis-ridden Indonesia.
	   On Sunday, 14 people were killed in riots that started as a
street brawl between rival Christian and Muslim gangs in the
capital's north.
	   About 100 women also protested Wednesday in Surabaya,
Indonesia's second most populous city.

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 0000 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Prices fell Wednesday on Asia's top three stock
markets _ Tokyo, Hong Kong and Singapore _ as a recent rally ran
out of steam. On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the benchmark 225-issue
Nikkei Stock Average shed 91.17 points, or 0.60 percent, closing at
15,073.47 after an 810-point rally in two previous sessions. In
Hong Kong, the recent rally in the blue-chip Hang Seng index
snapped Tuesday's seven-month high, to close 1.2 percent lower at
10,720.99. Singapore's Straits Times Index closed down 1.6 percent
at 1,390.51. Most smaller regional bourses also closed lower. Many
traders withdrew from the markets ahead of the long Thanksgiving
weekend in the United States because they won't be able to take any
further cues from the New York Stock Exchange for now, dealers
said. In currency dealings, the U.S. dollar fell against the
Japanese yen, buying 120.84 yen, down 0.78 yen from late Tuesday in
Tokyo. (ASIAN MARKETS)
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ The Organization of the Petroleum
Exporting Countries meets Wednesday in Vienna with oil prices
hovering at their lowest point in a decade, though it doesn't
appear further production cuts are likely. Despite some voices in
favor of cutting production _ Kuwait and Algeria foremost among
them _ most believe heavyweight Saudi Arabia's fear of losing
market share to overproducers in the group may immobilize the
organization. Prices and production levels will be the center of
attention. OPEC's average price per barrel has slumped by about a
third over the past year to a bit more than dlrs 12 a barrel.
(OPEC)
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ While many businesses struggle amid
Taiwan's economic doldrums, the notebook computer makers are busily
expanding in an industry that should grow by 35 percent this year,
according to government projections released Wednesday. Notebooks
have emerged as a rising star in Taiwan's computer industry, after
the island secured its place as the world's top producer of
monitors, keyboards and motherboards. Notebook makers are reporting
higher profits, sending their share prices soaring in a generally
lackluster stock market. Initial production figures show Taiwan
will likely replace Japan as the world's top notebook computer
maker _ if it hasn't already. (TAIWAN COMPUTERS)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Emergency measures are needed to save Russia's
people from the ravages of the country's economic collapse, Prime
Minister Yevgeny Primakov said Wednesday. However, Primakov said
the economy had no problems that state help couldn't fix. ``We
can't go on waiting for the market environment to solve our
problems,'' the prime minister said, according to the Interfax news
agency. ``In such a difficult transition, development must progress
along a mechanism worked out in advance.'' The extent of the
government's role in steering the economy should become clearer
Thursday, when Primakov promised that the government would agree on
a long-awaited 1999 budget. So far, Primakov's Cabinet has been
unable to settle on a budget, and has apparently been divided among
three rival versions of the plan. (RUSSIA-ECONOMY)
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ International Paper is buying smaller rival
Union Camp Corp. for dlrs 4.9 billion, joining the wave of U.S.
paper producers desperately seeking to slash costs amid slumping
prices and booming Asian imports. Shares of Union Camp soared
almost 33 percent Tuesday on news of the deal, while International
Paper fell by nearly 4 percent. International Paper, which already
has eliminated thousands of jobs, hopes the merger will lead to
annual savings of dlrs 300 million through measures including job
cuts and possible plant closings. Specifics of cutback plans were
not disclosed. International Paper, the world's largest paper
producer, sought Union Camp in particular to boost its production
of industrial packaging and coated papers, which are used in
magazines. (US-PAPER MERGER)

U.N. promises to bring in inspection teams within days

teams to arrive in days, newspaper comment, CHANGES byline. No

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ The United Nations will bring new
inspection teams to Iraq within days, a U.N. spokeswoman said
Wednesday, to carry out searches that have proved confrontational
in the past.
	   U.N. inspectors have carried out daily visits since Nov. 14,
when Iraq relented and allowed the arms experts to resume their
work after a two-week hiatus. Iraq has so far provided full
cooperation.
	   Most of the visits have involved checks on long-term monitoring
equipment at already-searched weapons sites.
	   ``All of our inspectors have gone to the sites for the normal
and routine visits to the already monitored sites,'' said Caroline
Cross, a U.N. spokeswoman for the weapons inspectors in Iraq.
	   In the past, searches by visiting teams of inspectors to new
sites have proven the most confrontational, sometimes angering
Iraqi officials. The chief U.N. weapons inspector, Richard Butler,
has promised to carry out the full range of inspections soon.
	   Cross said the teams should arrive this week.
	   ``We do not know when the visiting teams will arrive but they
should be coming to carry out the inspections in the next few
days,'' Cross told The Associated Press.
	   On Tuesday, the U.N. Security Council pledged its support for
weapons inspectors, but did not address the issue of Butler's
request for Iraqi documents on weapons programs, including personal
diaries and a hand-written log cataloging suspected chemical
weapons.
	   Iraq has insisted that the documents have been destroyed, are
irrelevant to the inspectors' work or have already been handed
over.
	   Although the United States and Britain have said the use of
military force is still possible, they seem willing to wait to see
how much help Iraq provides in the coming weeks. Still, U.S.
officials have insisted that Iraq fully cooperate.
	   ``I don't believe Iraq should be in the position of declaring
unilaterally that documents are irrelevant to the needs and
requests of the inspectors,'' Defense Secretary William Cohen said
Tuesday.
	   Iraq's official media Wednesday kept up the criticism of Butler,
whom it blames for prolonging crippling sanctions imposed after
Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990. Inspectors must certify that Iraq has
destroyed its long-range missiles, chemical, nuclear and biological
weapons and programs to build them before sanctions can be lifted.
	   Butler looks for ``a new excuse to be used by the United States
and Britain in order to trigger a new aggression against Iraq,''
said Al-Thawra, the newspaper of the ruling Baath Party.
	   Iraq's failure to cooperate with U.N. inspectors could delay a
U.N. review of progress on its disarmament that Iraq hopes will
ease the sanctions, which include a ban on its export of oil.

Korean economy contracts in third quarter
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ South Korea's gross domestic product
shrank by 6.8 percent in the third quarter amid slumps in
consumption and corporate investment, the central Bank of Korea
said Wednesday.
	   The pace of the economic decline was unchanged from the second
quarter, when the economy also shrank 6.8 percent, the worst
quarterly performance since the fourth quarter of 1980.
	   ``It looks like the economy is entering a stage where it will
stop its steep decline and will begin to level out,'' said Lee
Sung-tae, a senior analyst at the central bank.
	   Most economists have predicted that the South Korean economy
will hit bottom late this year or in early 1999.
	   In July through September, capital investments fell 46.3 percent
because of an economic crisis in which thousands of businesses
collapsed and big companies slimmed down.
	   Private consumption fell 12 percent as South Koreans tightened
their belts and spent less on cars, clothes, shoes, kitchenware and
other consumer goods, the bank said.
	   Exports of goods climbed 11.1 percent on active shipment of
clothes, steel, semiconductors and ships. Imports declined 25
percent because companies invested less in facilities and consumers
bought fewer goods.
	   South Korea agreed to a record dlrs 58 billion economic bailout
by the International Monetary Fund last December.
	   In the first nine months of this year, South Korea's economy
contracted 5.9 percent. The economy grew 5.5 percent last year.

Ukraine to sell controlling stakes in energy companies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine's government plans to sell
controlling stakes in its energy companies in an attempt to raise
the much-needed budget revenues, a news report said Wednesday.
	   The Cabinet is now finalizing a resolution on new energy
privatization rules, under which the state would sell a stake to
the private investor offering the best business plan for
modernizing the company, the independent Ukrainian News agency
said.
	   The new resolution is expected to end several months of
disagreement in the government over how to sell energy companies,
considered among Ukraine's most attractive properties.
	   The State Property Fund has offered stakes in 18 of Ukraine's 27
energy suppliers this year, but so far has managed to sell only 9
of them.
	   All the companies on offer hold a monopoly or near monopoly
position for electricity supplies in their regions.
	   The poor privatization results led the Cabinet to suspend the
program this fall in order to work out more attractive conditions
for potential investors, including Western energy companies.
	   The Energy Ministry said foreign investors were demanding a
controlling stake, the restructuring of energy companies' debts
over a longer period and the introduction of higher electricity
rates to make the companies profitable.
	   The ministry said about 10 foreign energy giants, including
Electricite de France, Germany's RWE and Britain's British Energy
have expressed interest in buying Ukrainian energy companies under
the new terms, according to Ukrainian News.
	   Ukraine hopes to raise much of the next year's planned
privatization revenues of 800 million hryvna (dlrs 233 million)
from selling energy companies.
	   The former Soviet republic has accumulated huge debts and badly
needs extra revenues to meet its foreign debt obligations and cover
mounting wage arrears.
	   Privatization efforts in Ukraine have moved relatively slowly,
and were complicated this year by the economic crisis in Russia and
the exodus of foreign investors from Ukraine's shaky financial
market.
	   The State Property Fund has raised only about one-third of the 1
billion hryvna (dlrs 292 million) the government expected from
privatization this year, and is expected to provide only half of
the sum by the end of 1998, officials say.

Beijing bids for 2008 Olympics

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China's capital announced Wednesday it will bid
to serve as host to the 2008 Summer Olympics.
	   Beijing's announcement won quick support from a government
minister, who said China _ as the world's most populous nation _
should stage the games.
	   Beijing Mayor Jia Qinglin submitted the application to Wu
Shaozu, president of the Chinese Olympic Committee, during a
ceremony at the Great Hall of the People, the state-run Xinhua News
Agency reported.
	   ``We think that as the world's most populous country, with a
vigorous and growing economy, China should host the Olympic Games
and make more contributions to the Olympic movement,'' Xinhua
quoted Wu as saying.
	   ``Many people in China and foreign friends have expressed their
hope that China would bid again,'' said Wu, who is also minister of
the State Sports General Administration. The Chinese Olympic
Committee ``is very happy to receive the application,'' he said.
	   Beijing lost to Sydney by two votes in the 1993 selection for
the host of the 2000 Games. China chose not to pursue the 2004
Olympics.
	   ``I had been hoping Beijing would bid again after we beat them
so narrowly in 1993,'' said Kevan Gosper, an Australian Olympic
official and member of the International Olympic Committee
executive board. ``A lot of progress has been made and they are
better prepared to deliver a successful games.''
	   Since the loss to Sydney, Shanghai and Guangzhou have also been
rumored as possible sites for another China bid.
	   The Chinese Olympic Committee will study Beijing's bid and any
applications from other Chinese cities at a meeting in January,
said He Huixian, a committee spokeswoman. If the committee approves
a bid, it will forward the application to the International Olympic
Committee, she said.
	   She said Beijing lost the 1993 vote for the 2000 Games because
of ``non-sports factors.''
	   Criticism of China's human rights record was a factor in the
1993 vote. China's reputation has also been marred by a string of
doping scandals.
	   Another Australian IOC member, Phill Coles, said China will have
to be persuasive on doping controls and may face another barrage on
human rights.
	   ``Everyone discusses human rights,'' he said. ``It's an issue
with a lot of countries in the world.''
	   The Chinese Olympic Committee set up a special team to research
the feasibility of another bid. Wu said Beijing gave its bid
``careful consideration'' before submitting the application.
	   Officially, competition to stage the 2008 Games hasn't even
begun, although Toronto and Osaka, Japan, have already declared
they want to be host.
	   Bids are also expected from Buenos Aires, Argentina; Istanbul,
Turkey, and Seville, Spain. Paris, Kuala Lumpur and Cairo are also
weighing possible bids.
	   The IOC will open the bidding next year and the deadline is
February 2000. The IOC will select the 2008 host city in Moscow in
2001.

Yeltsin ally in Russian parliament calls for early presidential
</HEADLINE>
elections &QL; 
 &UR; EDs: NEW 9th graf with president's office saying that Yeltsin's
condition is `stable.'
 &UR; By MITCHELL LANDSBERG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The leader of a pro-government faction in Russia's
parliament called Wednesday for early presidential elections, a
potent sign that President Boris Yeltsin has lost political clout,
even among his allies.
	   Alexander Shokhin, leader of the Our Home is Russia faction,
said parliamentary and presidential elections should be held
simultaneously next September.
	   The next presidential election is not scheduled until around the
middle of 2000. The ailing Yeltsin is constitutionally barred from
running for a third term, but has insisted that he will serve out
his current term to the end.
	   The political opposition, especially the Communist Party, has
long called for Yeltsin to step down. In recent months, several
prominent allies or former allies of the president have called for
early elections.
	   ``This is an idea that might assist with constructive reforms in
the country and save money ... simultaneously,'' Shokhin said,
according to the Interfax news agency.
	   He added that Yeltsin should ``do his best to enable robust
forces to take part in parliamentary and presidential elections.''
The reference to ``robust forces'' was the closest Shokhin came to
mentioning Yeltsin's declining health, which has prompted others in
Russian politics to call for him to resign.
	   In October, the upper house of parliament, which has
consistently supported Yeltsin's government, voted 79-18 in favor
of a resolution demanding the president's resignation.
	   The president remained in a Kremlin hospital Wednesday,
recuperating from pneumonia, the latest in a long series of
frequent illnesses that have reduced him to being a part-time
president.
	   The president's press service said Yeltsin's condition was
``stable'' and doctors were continuing to provide treatment for his
pneumonia.
	   One of the potential candidates in the next presidential race,
Krasnoyarsk territorial Gov. Alexander Lebed, said Wednesday that
he opposed early elections, ITAR-Tass reported.
	   Lebed added that he found it ``improper'' for former associates
of the president to be calling for early elections.
	   Lebed is a strong and persistent critic of Yeltsin, but has also
said he wouldn't run for president until he had time to improve the
situation in Krasnoyarsk.

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Police have been rounding up beggars
and homeless people from a famous public field near the royal
palace as part of a cleanup to prepare for next month's Asian
Games, officers said Wednesday.
	   The roundup at Sanam Luang, a traditional center for political
rallies, began Monday, and so far 161 people who were sleeping out
there have been detained, police said. The crackdown is scheduled
to last five days.
	   The detained people were sent to government shelters, said a
police officer, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   ``Sanam Luang royal field needs the special roundup because it
will be the site for the torch relay ceremony and the installation
of the national flags of the 43 participating countries in the
games,'' he said.
	   The field is also a center for public celebrations of the
birthday of King Bhumibol Adulyadej on Dec. 5.
	   A special operations force will be stationed at Sanam Luang
around the clock from Nov. 30 until the games conclude on Dec. 20
to keep order, said the officer.

23 Chinese military businesses transferred to civilian control
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Officials in China's most populous province took
control of 23 military businesses Wednesday under nationwide orders
to get the armed forces out of commerce, the official Xinhua News
Agency reported.
	   The enterprises transferred to authorities in central Henan
province employ 1,732 people, have assets worth 298 million yuan
(dlrs 36 million) and produce 189 million yuan (dlrs 23 million)
worth of goods annually, Xinhua said.
	   The transfer of military assets to civilian control was the
second to take place in China; the first came in Shanghai, the news
agency said.
	   In July, Communist Party leaders ordered the People's Liberation
Army and People's Armed Police to divest their vast commercial
empires to better concentrate on national defense. Courts have been
told to sell off their businesses as well to reduce judicial
corruption.
	   The government has set a year-end deadline, with larger PLA
companies to be placed under the control of the State Economic and
Trade Commission.
	   Xinhua, quoting a local Henan official, said the province will
complete the transfer of military and armed police enterprises by
Dec. 10 and those of courts by Dec. 20.
	   The report did not say how or whether the military units were
compensated.
	   The PLA ventured into commerce in 1980s to make up for declining
government outlays as China concentrated on modernizing its
backward economy. By the early 1990s, the military was into
everything from discos to five-star hotels and cellular phone
networks. Revenues from such enterprises were covering a third of
the PLA's operating expenses.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   LONDON (AP) _ With a ruling imminent from Britain's highest
court, Gen. Augusto Pinochet marked his 83rd birthday Wednesday
waiting to hear if he can leave London or must fight extradition to
Spain on charges of genocide, terrorism and torture. Outside the
House of Lords, where a five-judge tribunal will rule whether
Pinochet has immunity from arrest under British law as a former
foreign head of state, relatives of people who disappeared during
his 1973-90 rule clustered on the sidewalk under leaden skies. A
ruling in Pinochet's favor would mean he could be whisked
immediately from the hospital to board a waiting jet for Chile.
Conversely, a win for prosecutors would touch off a lengthy
extradition battle. (BRITAIN-PINOCHET)
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ A growing corruption scandal appears to be
on course to topple Turkey's government. If, as expected, the
government collapses in a parliamentary vote of no confidence on
Wednesday, lawmakers would again be left with a difficult choice:
trying to set aside feuds and build a coalition of Western-style
parties or accept an alliance with the powerful pro-Islamic bloc.
Turkey's powerful army strongly opposes any return of the Islamic
party, now known as Virtue. The military sees itself as the
protector of secular principles in this mostly Muslim nation. Prime
Minister Mesut Yilmaz came to power nearly 17 months ago after
Turkey's first pro-Islamic government was forced out of power by
the military in what some people have dubbed a ``soft coup.''
(TURKEY-POLITICS)
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder met with his Cabinet
for the first time in Berlin on Wednesday, one more sign of his
eagerness to get working in Germany's new capital as soon as
possible. So fixated is Schroeder on Berlin that he sped up the
government move from Bonn, but his verve has not stopped critics
who say his political goals lack direction. In office for less than
a month, Schroeder's government has wavered on tax reforms.
Unemployment reduction was Schroeder's No. 1 election promise, and
trying to fulfill it has led him to fumble over tax reforms. After
announcing new taxes in his inaugural address, he soon withdrew
them for fear of hampering the creation of low-wage jobs.
(GERMANY-SCHROEDER)
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Facing mounting frustration on
all sides, British Prime Minister Tony Blair sought solutions
Wednesday to the profound disagreements that are hobbling Northern
Ireland's peace agreement. Blair discussed the tense situation with
the province's British Protestant and Irish Catholic politicians,
who are supposed to form a multiparty coalition government as the
centerpiece of April's historic accord. Seamus Mallon, the deputy
head both of the new government and of the major Catholic-supported
party, the Social Democratic and Labor Party, said the accord would
lose credibility if the two sides failed to agree by early December
on specific areas of cooperation between Northern Ireland's new
government and the Irish government in Dublin. (NORTHERN IRELAND)
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ In its first response to the new dispute
over sensitive Iraqi documents, the U.N. Security Council said it
fully supported the work of weapons inspectors charged with
destroying Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. The council's
one-line and relatively innocuous statement was issued Tuesday
after a three-hour council meeting during which members were
briefed by the top inspector, Richard Butler, on his efforts to
obtain documents he says are necessary to his work. In its
statement, the council didn't address the issue of whether Iraq's
reluctance to turn over the documents showed it wasn't cooperating
fully with the inspectors. Iraq promised that cooperation when _
confronted with U.S. and British airstrikes _ it agreed Nov. 14 to
resume working with arms experts after a two-week hiatus. (UN-IRAQ)
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Bitter wartime memories and decades of Cold War
division stand between Asia's political and economic powerhouses.
But a major force is helping bring China and Japan together: the
region's economic crisis. Chinese President Jiang Zemin arrived
Wednesday in Japan _ the first visit by a Chinese head of state
since World War II _ to begin a trip trumpeted as opening a new
partnership between Tokyo and Beijing. A cornerstone of that new
relationship is the economy. Japan is the region's top source of
aid and investment; China needs all the help it can get to fend off
crisis and develop its vast economy. (JAPAN-CHINA)

China's economy grows 10 percent in October
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China's annual economic growth rate surged to
more than 10 percent in October, boosted by government spending to
stimulate business, the state-run newspaper Economic Information
Daily reported Wednesday.
	   The gross domestic product rose by more than 10 percent in
October compared with the same month a year earlier, a substantial
jump from the 7.6 percent growth rate recorded in the third quarter
of the year, the report said.
	   The figure, mentioned in passing in a commentary on the economy,
appeared to indicate that huge increases in fixed asset investment,
which surged 28.4 percent in October from a year earlier, are
beginning to show results.
	   The government plans to invest dlrs 1.2 trillion in
infrastructure over the next three years to help maintain annual
economic growth of 8 percent, the level deemed necessary to create
enough jobs to maintain social stability.

Newcastle closes deal for Ferguson
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEWCASTLE, England (AP) _ Newcastle's board Wednesday came up
seven million pounds (dlrs 11.5 million) to complete Duncan
Ferguson's transfer from Everton.
	   Whether it will help Ruud Gullit's lowly Magpies is another
matter.
	   The 6-foot-4 (1.93-meter) Ferguson is expected to debut Saturday
at home against Wimbledon, playing up front with England
international Alan Shearer _ a record 15-million-pound (dlrs 25
million) transfer two years ago from Blackburn.
	   ``Everybody knows that Alan Shearer is one of the best players
in Europe and I'm looking forward to teaming up with him,''
Ferguson said. ``I think it will be a good partnership.
	   ``Alan's a proven goalscorer and I'm looking forward to getting
up there and teaming up with him and scoring a few goals myself.''
	   Gullit, who has been assured by Shearer that he wants to stay
with the club, said he had been after Ferguson since his days at
Chelsea.
	   ``In my previous job I was already sniffing to get him there,''
he said. `He's a very good player, not only because of is height
but because of his football skills.''
	   Gullit thanked club management for spending money on new
players. Newcastle has only 16 points from 14 games, good for 14th
place and 12 points behind leaders Aston Villa.
	   ``The board reacted to my pleas and understood also the
importance of getting new players in. I'm very delighted with the
coming of Duncan.''

China's stock investors need more risk awareness: report
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SHANGHAI (AP) _ China's stock-market investors should pay more
attention to risk and not count on the government if the market
sinks, a senior Chinese leader was quoted as saying.
	   In a front-page editorial carried by many state-run newspapers
Wednesday, national legislative chairman Li Peng urged local
investors to be better informed about the risks of investing.
	   ``We have to do more to raise the level of risk awareness among
stock investors,'' Li, No. 2 in the ruling Communist Party, was
quoted as saying. ``Investors can't just be happy when they make
money and then turn to the government for help when they lose
money.''
	   Rapid growth of China's nascent stock markets _ fueled partly by
the widespread belief that the government props up share prices _
has prompted fears that a market dive could wipe out the savings of
millions of vulnerable stock investors and lead to unrest.
	   Investors who lost their nest eggs in fraudulent futures and
real estate deals recently staged protests in Beijing and other
cities demanding government compensation for their losses.
	   The editorial said Li made the comments while speaking to a
group of China's top market regulators, including Zhou Zhengqing,
head of the China Securities Regulatory Commission.
	   The comments were made during a trip to southern China last
week, where Li was canvassing opinions from local regulators,
exchange officials and industry executives on changes made to the
country's pending Securities Law.
	   Though China's exchanges were opened more than eight years ago
and now have about 850 listed companies and 40 million investors,
the industry still doesn't have a unified body of rules to regulate
it. That has created large loopholes and strong bouts of
volatility, with prices of certain stocks soaring and crashing by
more than 100 percent in a matter of weeks.
	   Li, chairman of the National People's Congress, said the
Securities Law was needed to guarantee healthy development of the
markets, although some issues remained to be resolved.
	   Lax regulation was underscored last week after the disclosure of
a huge market fraud.
	   Sichuan Hongguang Industrial Co., a television picture tube
maker, was punished by the China Securities Regulatory Commission
for providing false information _ including inflated profits _ in
its listing application. The commission had granted approval to
list although the company was actually losing money.

	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Millions of Indians voted Wednesday in
provincial elections that could cast shadows on the fortunes of
Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee's wobbly coalition.
	   The ballot count begins Saturday, but an exit poll forecast a
sweeping victory for the Congress Party, led by Sonia Gandhi, in
the state of New Delhi, which would dislodge the state government
of the rightwing Bharatiya Janata Party.
	   The poll, conducted by the private Center for Media Studies and
broadcast on STAR television, covered 1,500 voters. Results of the
exit polls from three other states were not immediately released.
	   More than 80 million voters were eligible to choose 626 state
legislators from among 5,000 candidates in the northern state of
New Delhi where the federal capital is located, in Rajasthan in
India's western desert, in the central state of Madhya Pradesh and
in the tiny northeastern state of Mizoram _ four of India's 26
states.
	   Pre-election surveys predicted gains by the Congress Party over
the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, mainly because of
discontent with the soaring prices of vegetables. The BJP, which
also heads the federal government, governs two of the four states,
and Congress rules two.
	   Voting was largely peaceful but some violence was reported in
Madhya Pradesh state. Tens of thousands of armed police guarded
voting stations in four states where borders were sealed to prevent
the entry of criminals from other states.
	   Police arrested a Congress Party candidate, Hari Singh Narvaria,
after he fired gunshots in the air apparently to scare away his
opponents in Madhya Pradesh state, United News of India news agency
said.
	   The election commission in the state also ordered authorities to
seize Congress leader Kamal Nath's helicopter, which was being used
to ferry voters, UNI said.
	   A group of Naxalites, who asked the voters to boycott the
elections, looted a polling station in Bastar region of Madhya
Pradesh. The Naxalites are waging an armed struggle to create a
communist state comprising tribal areas of four neighboring states.
	   Vajpayee and his party colleagues shrugged off adverse
pre-election voter surveys, saying they were taken even before the
dates for the elections were announced.
	   But most analysts see the vote as the first test of popularity
for the BJP-led government since it came to office in March. A poor
showing by the Hindu nationalist BJP could increase tension within
the 19-party ruling alliance, now strained by restive allies.
	   It also is a key electoral test for the Congress Party's new
leader, Sonia Gandhi, widow of slain former Prime Minister Rajiv
Gandhi and torchbearer of the dynasty that gave India three prime
ministers.
	   Despite aggressive campaigning by both Vajpayee and Gandhi,
political analysts said the electorate appeared apathetic.
	   ``This is the most low-key provincial election in 40 years,''
said N. Bhaskara Rao, whose Center for Media Studies carried out
pre-election surveys in the four states.
	   Rao said voters' concern was focused on the spiraling rise in
prices of essential commodities in recent months, including a
massive shortage of onion which became a powerful symbol of protest
for opposition ranks.

Final touches on land route between West Bank and Gaza Strip
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NASSER SHIYOUKHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TARKUMIYA, West Bank (AP) _ Keeping a promise under the new
peace agreement, Israel on Wednesday erected a military check post
that will mark the starting point of an 80-kilometer (50-mile) land
route for Palestinians between the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
	   Israel and the Palestinians still need to settle a few minor
points, but expect to sign a protocol for operating the so-called
``safe passage'' through Israel next week, said Palestinian
negotiator Abdel Razek al Yehiyeh.
	   Under the Wye River peace accord negotiated last month, the safe
passage is to open four weeks after the protocol is signed.
	   The route will make it easier for Palestinians to travel between
the West Bank and Gaza and will give a boost to trade.
	   Currently, travelers have to apply for an entry permit into
Israel, a process that can take days, but have to leave their cars
at home.
	   Under the new rules, Israel will issue permits valid for a year
to those wishing to use the safe passage. Cars are permitted, but
require separate stickers. Israel has the right to turn down
requests by those considered a security risk.
	   Once the safe passage opens, West Bank residents will have
easier access to Gaza International Airport which opened Tuesday
and will soon offer regular flights to several Arab capitals.
	   Al Yehiyeh said the land route would stay open during Israeli
security closures which have been imposed repeatedly in the past in
response to terror attacks by Islamic militants on Israelis. During
closures, Israel seals the West Bank and Gaza, barring all
Palestinians from entering Israel.
	   The new land route, using existing roads, begins at the village
of Tarkumiya, near the West Bank town of Hebron, cuts westward
through Israel, and swerves south to Gaza just before the Israeli
coastal town of Ashkelon.
	   On Wednesday, bulldozers cleared dirt and rocks around the new
Tarkumiya check post. A sign in Arabic, English and Hebrew read
``Safe Passage Entrance.''
	   Another sign directed travelers to a fortified inspection area
with a watch tower where travel permits and cars will be checked.
	   In the future, a second safe passage route will link the West
Bank town of Ramallah, the Palestinians' commercial center, with
Gaza, but negotiations have not been concluded.
	   Hatem Fatafta, 21, a Hebron university student watching
Wednesday's construction, said he has never been to Gaza because of
the difficulties such a trip entails. ``I would love to go there to
sit on the beach and eat fish,'' he said.
	   Near the West Bank village of Ein Arik, meanwhile, Palestinians
protesting the construction of a bypass road for Jewish settlers
ignited a fuel tank, forcing Israeli workers to leave the area.
	   After approving a West Bank troop pullback earlier this month,
Israel's government authorized the construction of 13 new access
roads to Jewish settlements.
	   Palestinians oppose the road projects which will require the
expropriation of thousands of acres of Palestinian-owned land.
	   Israel has asked the United States for a drls 1.2 billion grant
to pay for the cost of the troop withdrawal, including bypass roads
and the fortification of settlements.
	   U.S. officials have said privately that the Clinton
administration does not want to spend aid money on Jewish
settlements, which would be a violation of longstanding U.S.
policy.
	   Israeli Finance Minister Yaakov Neeman, who met with U.S.
officials in Washington this week to discuss the aid package, said
Wednesday the road projects would need to be reviewed.
	   ``The issue of the roads needs to be examined to see which roads
are necessary for security,'' Neeman said.

	   KRUGER NATIONAL PARK, South Africa (AP) _ Kruger National Park
will limit the number of day-trippers during the holiday season to
prevent crowding, a spokesman said Tuesday.
	   Spokesman Luther Masukusaid the southern and far northern
sections of the park were particularly vulnerable to crowding over
busy periods.
	   Each of the eight entrances will have a maximum quota of day
visitors. At the Paul Kruger gate, 750 people will be allowed in,
500 each at Numbi, Malelane, Orpen and Phalaborwa, and 300 each at
Punda Maria, Crocodile Bridge and Pafuri.
	   Day visits can be booked, he said.

	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Delegates from Olympic committees in 22
African countries met Wednesday in the continent's first seminar on
sport and the environment, the U.N. Environment Program said.
	   ``No athlete can perform at his or her optimum level if the air
he breathes or the water she swims in is polluted,'' said UNEP
Executive Director Klaus Toepfer.
	   He said the seminar was another in a series of activities
undertaken by the UNEP and the International Olympic Committee,
under an agreement reached in 1994, to alert those involved in
sports events to the need to protect the environment.
	   The two-day seminar from Wednesday was held at the UNEP
headquarters in Nairobi.
	   The seminar focused on the impact of sporting events on the
environment, and the wider relationship between environment, sport,
culture and health in the region, Toepfer said.
	   Delegates from Hungary, Iran, Norway and Switzerland also
participated.

	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ Ukrainian Foreign Minister Borys
Tarasiuk on Wednesday awarded President Nelson Mandela with
Ukraine's highest honor.
	   During a trip to cement political and economic ties between the
two countries,Tarasiuk gave a beaming Mandela the Order of Prince
Yaroslav the Wise, a chain of medallions named for an early ruler
of Kiev.
	   ``Your name is well known thoughout the world. It has become a
symbol of unbreakable spirit,'' Tarasiuk said at a ceremony at
Mandela's official residence in Cape Town.
	   Mandela, wearing an orange-patterned African shirt, shook hands
with Tarasyuk and praised Ukraine's struggle for independence from
the former Soviet Union.
	   ``This is a great honor,'' he said ``As usual I accept on behalf
of all the people of South Africa, black and white.''

	   DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania (AP) _ Police in western Tanzania have
arrested 17 armed Congolese soldiers who entered Tanzania after
fleeing the fighting in Congo, the regional police commissioner
said Wednesday.
	   Jaka Mwambi, commissioner of police in the Rukwa region, about
90 kilometers (55 miles) east of Lake Tangyanika whose west bank is
in Congo, said the soldiers had been arrested in small groups since
Nov. 12.
	   He said it was unclear which side they had been fighting on.
	   The rebellion that began Aug. 2 in Congo to overthrow President
Laurent Kabila has taken place mostly in the east, where rebels
have taken control of large areas.
	   Mwambi said 11 soldiers were arrested in the Nkansi district of
Rukwa after being found in possession of nine submachine guns, 887
rounds, a hand grenade and five military uniforms.
	   Another six soldiers were detained at Kabwe in Rukwa. They were
in possession of four submachine guns and 400 rounds of ammunition,
Mwambi said.
	   He said the soldiers would be transferred to Kigoma where they
will join other Congolese refugees who have fled the fighting in
their country.

	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ President Yoweri Museveni met a former
rebel leader who recently returned from self-exile and said he
hoped for peace in a region where the dissident is a tribal leader,
the state-owned New Vision newspaper reported Wednesday.
	   Charles Wesley Mumbere had been living in exile in the United
States for 14 years following the collapse of his rebel Uganda Army
for the Liberation of Uganda in 1993.
	   The rebels were waging war in western Kasese district from bases
in eastern Congo, formerly Zaire.
	   The Ugandan military recently found photographs of a youthful
Mumbere in the hands of the Allied Democratic Forces, which are
fighting Museveni's troops also from bases in eastern Congo.
	   But at the meeting with Museveni, Mumbere denounced all rebel
activities,
	   New Vision said. The meeting at the presidential residence was
attended by three Cabinet ministers.
	   New Vision said Mumbere thanked Museveni for making possible his
return home.
	   Meanwhile, the ADF killed six people and abducted another four
in a Kasese suburb Monday, said The Monitor, a privately-owned
newspaper.

	   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) _ Twenty-six people were killed and 59
seriously injured in a head-on collision between a bus and another
vehicle near Soubre, 300 kilometers (185 miles) east of Abidjan,
the French language daily Soir Info reported Wednesday.
	   The overloaded passenger bus was climbing a steep hill when it
slammed into an oncoming vehicle. The accident happened late
Tuesday.
	   The bus, carrying 84 instead, was full of people from
neighboring Burkina
	   Faso on their way home from the Ivory Coast, the paper said.
	   --
	   MBABANE, Swaziland (AP) _ South African bomb experts have
arrived to help the Swazi police investigate the bombing of a
government office building last week, authorities said Tuesday.
	   A security guard died and six people were injured in the
explosion on Friday that heavily damaged the two-story on one of
the capital's busiest streets.
	   Police acknowledged Tuesday that a bomb had exploded several
hours before Friday's attack near the police barracks outside
Mbabane, the capital of this small kingdom sandwiched between South
Africa and Mozambique. There were no reports of injuries in the
earlier explosion.
	   Meanwhile, a rash of bomb threats this week has forced the
evacuations of several buildings in the capital. Police have
increased security at all government buildings and are erecting
checkpoints around Mbabane in a search for explosives and illegal
weapons.

	   STRASBOURG, France (AP) _ An 11-year-old boy was seriously hurt
after falling four stories into a stairwell, apparently pulled over
the bannister by the weight of his book bag, police said Wednesday.
	   Hakim Chemtal suffered serious head injuries in the fall Tuesday
at the Fustel de Coulanges junior high school in eastern France. He
was hospitalized and underwent surgery, police said.
	   According to an initial police investigation, the sixth-grader's
heavy book bag pulled him over as he was leaning against the
bannister.
	   Further details on the boy's condition were not available.
	   School children in France do not have lockers, and regularly
carry large loads to and from classes.
	   France's deputy education minister, Segolene Royal earlier this
year announced measures to limit the weight of school backpacks. To
combat the problem, some schools now provide a double set of books
so students can leave one set at home.

Primakov: Emergency measures needed, but there's no emergency
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES thruout with finance minister delivering proposed
budget, analyst saying worst has passed &QL; 
 &UR; By MITCHELL LANDSBERG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Emergency measures are needed to save Russia's
people from the ravages of the country's economic collapse, Prime
Minister Yevgeny Primakov said Wednesday.
	   Primakov said the 1999 budget would have to include the
unspecified measures to cushion the economic blows. A draft of the
long-awaited budget was delivered to the Cabinet later in the day.
	   However, Primakov, speaking at the Ministry of Emergency
Situations, went on to insist that the country was not in a state
of emergency. He said the economy had no problems that couldn't be
fixed with help from the state.
	   ``We can't go on waiting for the market environment to solve our
problems,'' the prime minister said, according to the Interfax news
agency. ``In such a difficult transition, development must progress
along a mechanism worked out in advance.''
	   The remarks were consistent with Primakov's previous statements
regarding the role of government in steering the economy. The
extent of that role should become clearer Thursday, when Primakov
promised that the government would agree on the budget.
	   So far, Primakov's Cabinet has been unable to settle on a
budget, and was reportedly divided last week among three rival
versions of the plan. The Finance Ministry submitted a new plan
Wednesday that is intended to meet the Cabinet's concerns, Interfax
said.
	   The new budget will encompass the government's approach to
tackling the worst economic crisis since the Soviet era. However, a
private economic analyst was quoted as saying the worst of the
crisis had passed.
	   Speaking to an economic forum, Andrei Illarionov, director of
the private Institute of Economic Analysis, said the crisis reached
a peak in September and has eased since then under Primakov's
leadership, Interfax said. He noted that the ruble, which was
trading at about 18 to the U.S. dollar on Wednesday, had settled
into a relatively stable range of value.
	   Primakov's remarks about the country needing emergency measures
were presumably meant to offer support to the Emergency Situations
Ministry, which carries out relief missions throughout the country.
	   Primakov said a new federal rescue service should be established
in 2005, the ITAR-Tass news agency said. And he called on the
Emergency Situations Ministry to improve its civil defense
preparedness in light of the potential for regional conflicts in
Russia.
	   Also Wednesday, Deputy Finance Minister Mikhail Kasyanov was
quoted as saying that the first stage of debt restructuring talks
between Russia and the London Club of creditors was nearing an end.
The talks began Monday in London.
	   The government is trying to persuade creditors to restructure a
portion of the Paris and London Club debts that is inherited from
the Soviet Union.

Moscow customs chiefs fired following capital flight investigation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The heads of four customs departments in Moscow
were fired Wednesday following an investigation into capital flight
from Russia, officials said.
	   Billions of dollars have been taken out of Russia, often
illegally, during the past few years. Russian companies stashed
about dlrs 2.5 billion abroad in September alone, officials said.
	   Following a series of checks by the State Customs Committee,
chairman Valery Draganov fired the chiefs of Moscow's northern,
southern, eastern and western customs departments, the Interfax
news agency reported, citing the committee press service.
	   The customs committee has learned ``where our billions (of
dollars) are going, and it can prove it with documents,'' Draganov
was quoted as saying.
	   However, committee spokesman Sergei Oleinik said the officials
were dismissed as part of a ``personnel rotation plan in the State
Customs Committee,'' and the committee was looking for new jobs for
them, Interfax reported.
	   The dismissed Moscow officials will be replaced by customs
officers from other regions, the committee's press service said.
	   The committee also investigated importers and exporters,
Draganov said.

Vietnam criticizes Philippine position on disputed island
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Vietnam complained Wednesday about
the Philippines accepting China's proposal for ``joint use'' of
structures being enlarged by Chinese workers on a disputed South
China Sea reef, a Philippine official said.
	   In Hanoi, Philippine Ambassador Jorge Lardizabal was summoned by
Vietnamese Foreign Ministry officials to explain why Manila agreed
to the proposal, the official said.
	   ``They're not comfortable about this joint use and they want to
clarify why we suddenly agreed to it,'' said the senior Philippine
foreign affairs official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   Vietnam fears that such action will encourage Beijing to further
expand structures in the area, where Vietnam also has competing
territorial claims.
	   The official also said Foreign Affairs Secretary Domingo Siazon
was called to a special meeting of defense and legislative
officials to explain the joint use concept.
	   In earlier talks with reporters, Siazon said accepting the offer
was not a surrender of the country's sovereign rights over Mischief
Reef.
	   The reef is part of the Spratly Islands, which straddle vital
sea lanes in the South China Sea, and are claimed in whole by
China, Vietnam and Taiwan, and in part by Malaysia and the
Philippines. Brunei claims one reef.
	   Earlier this month, Manila lodged a diplomatic protest with
Beijing over the construction of the concrete structures on
Mischief Reef. The Philippines says it believes they could be used
militarily.
	   Siazon, who met with his Chinese counterpart Tang Jiaxuan during
the recent Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meetings in Malaysia,
asked that China remove all structures on the reef, which lies
within the Philippines' 200-mile exclusive economic zone. His
request was rejected.
	   During that meeting, Siazon said, China expressed a willingness
for possible joint use of the structures.
	   Philippine President Joseph Estrada and Chinese President Jiang
Zemin, who also attended the APEC meetings, also discussed Mischief
Reef and agreed to settle the dispute peacefully.
	   They agreed as well that natural resources in the area of the
reef should be used jointly by the two nations.

Netanyahu makes tentative deal with Levy to rejoin coalition
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with report that Gesher party approved return to
coalition, ministers calling for national unity government &QL; 
 &UR; By SARI BASHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday
struck a tentative deal to bring his former foreign minister, David
Levy, back to the fragile coalition government.
	   Hardliners in Netanyahu's government have been threatening to
leave over the land-for-security agreement with the Palestinians,
thus robbing Netanyahu of his majority in parliament.
	   Without such a majority, Netanyahu would either have to call
early elections or try to bring other parties into his coalition.
	   Levy's return would not be enough to guarantee the survival of
Netanyahu's government. Political commentators said Wednesday that
the prime minister wanted Levy back in the fold so he would be in a
stronger position when opening negotiations with the main
opposition party, Labor, to join the government.
	   In a sign that a so-called ``national unity government'' was
becoming a real possibility, three senior Cabinet ministers _
Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon, Trade Minister Natan Sharansky and
Finance Minister Yaakov Neeman _ said Netanyahu should court Labor.
	   Netanyahu offered Levy either the finance or infrastructure
ministry. As part of the deal, Levy's Gesher Party would run on a
joint slate with Netanyahu's Likud Party in the next elections,
with Levy guaranteed the No. 2 spot.
	   Israel radio said Gesher approved a return to Netanyahu's
coalition, but opposed a merger with Likud. Levy was not
immediately available for comment. Two of five Gesher legislators,
David Magen and Michael Kleiner, did not attend the meeting, an
apparent sign that they will not rejoin the coalition.
	   Levy had resigned in January in protest over the deadlock in the
peace talks with the Palestinians and the government's failure to
spend as much money as promised on social welfare programs.
	   At the time, he said the government was ``on a flight to
nowhere.''
	   On Tuesday, Levy suggested that with the signing of the Mideast
accord last month, the government looked more appealing.
	   ``Now that the government is taking the political course that I
demanded ... we in Gesher will convene and decide,'' he told Israel
TV's Channel Two.
	   Using intermediaries, Netanyahu and Levy negotiated through the
night and a tentative deal was reached before dawn Wednesday,
Israel radio and Israel army radio said.

Senior police officials resign in manslaughter case
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ Three senior police officials resigned
Wednesday, assuming responsibility for an accident in which an
officer fatally shot a teen-age girl.
	   Nikolai Radulov, secretary of the Interior Ministry, Slavcho
Bosilkov, national police chief and Lyubomir Kyuchukov, regional
police chief in the town of Sliven, 300 kilometers (188 miles) east
of Sofia handed their resignations. The government was to consider
them next Monday.
	   The three police officials have been under fierce criticism
since earlier this month, when an officer near Sliven accidentally
shot and killed a 17-year-old girl during a routine check of the
car in which she was traveling.
	   Investigators found the policeman illegally held his charged
Kalashnikov automatic rifle during the check.
	   The policeman has been charged with manslaughter and could face
up to five years in prison, if found guilty.
	   Media and the public have accused police bosses of poor
discipline and incompetence among their staff.

EU takes US to WTO over anti-dumping legislation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Union on Wednesday filed a
complaint with the World Trade Organization over a U.S.
anti-dumping law which the EU claims discriminates against sales of
EU steel products in the United States.
	   In a statement, the EU executive Commission said it requested a
WTO panel after a first round of WTO-led discussions with the
United States failed.
	   ``The EU believes the 1916 Anti-Dumping Act, which prohibits the
import and sale of goods on the U.S. market when the price is lower
than in the country of production, breaks WTO rules,'' the
statement said.
	   The Commission's decision to call for a WTO panel, which
followed complaints by the EU steel industry, is also the latest in
a series of trade tiffs between the EU and the United States.
	   The two sides are currently squabbling over the EU's banana
import system which the U.S. administration claims is in violation
of WTO rules as it unfairly favors imports from former European
colonies.

Netanyahu cancels visit to Switzerland
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS background graf on Israeli spy scandal &QL; 
 &UR; By SARI BASHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday
canceled a visit to Switzerland which had been scheduled to try and
defuse tensions over a campaign to have Swiss banks pay restitution
to Holocaust victims.
	   Netanyahu called off his trip at the last minute ``because of
his effort to expand the Cabinet and achieve a stronger base for
policy measures,'' his office said.
	   Netanyahu spent most of the night from Tuesday to Wednesday
negotiating the return of his former foreign minister, David Levy,
in an attempt to shore up his fragile coalition government.
	   The prime minister also delayed his departure for Britain
although he was expected to make the trip late Wednesday. Spain is
also on his itinerary.
	   A shadow was cast over Netanyahu's trip to Switzerland after he
participated last week in a ceremony honoring Americans and
Israelis who had campaigned against Swiss banks.
	   Those honored played a key role in winning the agreement of the
banks to pay dlrs 1.2 billion to Holocaust survivors and the heirs
of victims to settle claims for assets deposited in the banks
during World War II.
	   Swiss officials expressed their irritation over the award
ceremony but did not rescind the invitation to Netanyahu.
	   Even before the cancellation was disclosed, the
Switzerland-Israel Society, which fosters closer ties between the
two countries, said relations were at a low point.
	   Israeli-Swiss relations also have been hurt by a failed spy
mission by Israel's famed Mossad agency in February. Five Mossad
were caught trying to bug an apartment building in the Swiss
capital of Berne. One agent, caught with wiretapping equipment, was
held until late April and only released after Israel paid some dlrs
2 million in bail. Israel also apologized.
	   Swiss officials said they expected the Swiss Cabinet to discuss
a new date for Netanyahu's visit later Wednesday.

Afghanistan releases last of Iranian prisoners
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Afghanistan's Taliban militia released
Wednesday the last Iranian prisoner it had been holding since
August, the official Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
	   Truck driver Manuchehr Amiri was handed over to an Iranian
Foreign Ministry official in Afghanistan and the two later left for
Iran, the agency said.
	   It said Amiri's release came through the intervention of the
Iranian Foreign Ministry.
	   Iran says Afghanistan had been holding 70 Iranians, half of them
truck drivers.
	   The truck drivers were captured by Taliban forces when they
captured the northern Afghan city of Mazar-e-Sharif in August.
Taliban forces killed eight Iranian diplomats and a journalist
during the city's capture, which resulted in a straining of ties
between the two neighboring countries.
	   Iran deployed some 200,000 troops, backed by tanks and fighter
aircraft, on its Afghan border in September.
	   But the situation improved in early October after the
intervention of U.N. special envoy Lakhdar Brahimi, who shuttled
between Tehran and Kabul and secured the release of 26 of the
Iranians held captive in Afghanistan.
	   The first batch of five truck drivers were released in
September.
	   The truck drivers were in Afghanistan delivering humanitarian
goods, Iran says. But the Taliban claim they were smuggling weapons
to the Afghan opposition.

Turkish government faces confidence vote

	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Lawmakers gathered Wednesday for a
confidence vote that is expected to topple Turkey's
corruption-tainted government and launch a struggle to form the
country's fifth governing coalition since 1995.
	   The downfall of Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz would again leave
political leaders with a difficult choice: trying to set aside
feuds and build a coalition of Western-style parties or accept an
alliance with the powerful pro-Islamic bloc.
	   Turkey's powerful army strongly opposes any return of the
Islamic party, now known as Virtue. The military sees itself as the
protector of secular principles in this mostly Muslim nation.
	   Opponents need 276 votes in the 550-seat parliament to topple
Turkey's fourth government since 1995. The three parties that
presented the confidence motion have 298 seats.
	   President Suleyman Demirel, who would designate the new premier,
said he would meet with all party leaders before announcing his
choice.
	   Politicians gave no hint of what kind of coalition could be set
up to replace the current minority left-right government.
	   ``Our principle is to weigh all kinds of government formulas,''
said former Prime Minister Tansu Ciller, leader of the opposition
center-right True Path Party.
	   Yilmaz and his economy minister, Gunes Taner, are accused of
entertaining ties with the mafia and tampering with the sale of a
state bank. It is part of a widening probe into ties between
political leaders and underworld figures.
	   A government collapse could distract officials during a tense
diplomatic battle for the return of Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah
Ocalan, who is seeking asylum in Italy.
	   Traditionally, Demirel is expected to choose the head of
parliament's largest party _ now Recai Kutan of the Virtue Party.
	   But the president may seek to avoid a confrontation with the
military and pick someone from Turkey's deeply divided secular
parties.
	   Most analysts seemed to point at a coalition between Yilmaz and
his longstanding rival, Mrs. Ciller.
	   The first signals of a rapprochement came Monday when Yilmaz and
Mrs. Ciller had their parties spare each other from corruption
probes in parliament. But the two center-right parties do not have
enough votes in parliament to survive alone.
	   Many believe that Bulent Ecevit, leader of the Democratic Left
Party, could be the glue between Yilmaz and Mrs. Ciller, whose
rivalry already brought down a government in 1996.
	   Parties would have 45 days to set up a coalition. If they fail,
the president will appoint a caretaker government to rule until
elections scheduled for April.

Benelux stock exchanges form alliance
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ The Amsterdam, Brussels and
Luxembourg stock exchanges said Wednesday they have formed a pact
allowing members access to each other's markets starting Jan. 4.
	   The collaboration will put the three bourses in a good position
for the fast-approaching launch of the single European currency,
the Amsterdam Stock Exchange said. The new currency, known as the
euro, debuts on Jan. 1.
	   The Benelux alliance will make a member of one exchange ``more
or less automatically recognized as a member of the other two
exchanges,'' the Amsterdam bourse said in a statement.
	   Members still would have to comply with the countries'
particular administrative requirements.
	   The cooperation also will allow mutual access to each other's
markets by integrating their networks, including the installation
of reciprocal telecommunication lines.
	   In the future, the three bourses plan to further harmonize their
market regulations.
	   The Benelux agreement comes two days ahead of a meeting in Paris
of officials from nine stock exchanges seeking to form a
pan-European stock market.
	   The exchanges planning to participate in the Paris meeting are
London, Frankfurt, Amsterdam, Madrid, Milan, Paris, Brussels,
Zurich and Stockholm.
	   It was not immediately clear whether the Benelux accord meant
that Luxembourg also would join a pan-European exchange.

Students march on Suharto's house demanding he be tried for graft

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES, RECASTS with ex-president's son criticizing students &QL;

 &UR; By GEOFF SPENCER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Troops blocked hundreds of students
trying to march on Suharto's heavily guarded home Wednesday despite
a plea from one of his millionaire children to stop hounding the
former president over corruption allegations.
	   The students want Suharto to face trial for graft and human
rights abuses during his 32 years of autocratic rule. They also
want the state to seize his wealth, estimated at dlrs 4 billion.
	   Under pressure to take action, the government said it would
announce details of a proposed commission of inquiry into Suharto's
business affairs later this week.
	   It also announced that the 77-year-old former president had
ceded control of seven charitable foundations that he established.
	   Critics have alleged that the foundations, worth dlrs 530
million, siphoned off state wealth to benefit business empires
built by the Suharto clan.
	   Suharto, who quit in May after deadly riots and protests, has
denied any wrongdoing and has said he is willing to face any
investigation.
	   Suharto's youngest son, Tommy, who is at the center of separate
corruption allegations, criticized the students for seeking revenge
against his father and family instead of helping Indonesia's
growing number of poor.
	   Millions of Indonesians have slipped into poverty amid the worst
economic crisis in a generation.
	   ``Will prosecution, slander and defamation, as well as taking
over the wealth of the Suharto family, guarantee that the people
will become prosperous?'' the official Antara news agency quoted
him as saying.
	   Tommy made the comments after police questioned him for a second
day in relation to an allegedly shady real estate deal.
	   Suharto's successor, President B.J. Habibie, announced last week
that he would set up a new inquiry into his former mentor's wealth.
	   Some senior government officials have said Suharto might face
house arrest during the investigation.
	   However, that has failed to appease student activists.
	   About 1,500 protesters were stopped Wednesday at a park adjacent
to the U.S. ambassador's residence after they moved from a busy
downtown traffic circle through an exclusive suburb where the
former leader lives.
	   There were no arrests or injuries.
	   Blocked about a half-mile (one kilometer) from Suharto's home,
the students chanted anti-government slogans and shouted, ``Suharto
is a dog!'' Some taunted a line of soldiers who were carrying
sticks and bamboo shields.
	   Students have tried several times in recent days to reach the
home where Suharto lives as a virtual recluse.
	   Two busloads of students also were blocked from demonstrating
outside the State Secretariat, next door to the presidential
palace.
	   The latest protests came after 1,000 students occupied the
office of Attorney General Andi Muhammad Ghalib for 12 hours before
being forced out by troops Tuesday.
	   Ghalib, a three-star general, headed an earlier corruption
investigation but has been widely criticized by opposition groups
for going soft on Suharto, himself a retired general.
	   Students produced a live hen during their sit-in protest and
chanted: ``Ghalib wants to be a chicken, not a tiger.''
	   On Wednesday, Ghalib criticized the students for interrupting
his work and said his office had tried hard to investigate
Suharto's wealth.
	   Unrepentant, hundreds congregated at nearby Atma Jaya Catholic
University Wednesday morning before starting more demonstrations.
	   The campus was where security personnel opened fire on
anti-government protesters Nov. 13. As many as 17 people were
killed in the violence, including nine students.
	   Separately Wednesday, about 100 women staged a peaceful rally in
downtown Jakarta against rising violence in crisis-ridden
Indonesia.
	   On Sunday, 14 people were killed in riots that started as a
street brawl between rival Christian and Muslim gangs in the
capital's north.
	   Meanwhile, an opinion poll has suggested that Habibie is
trailing badly in popularity against opposition figures.
	   The poll published in Tempo magazine this week said only 7
percent of 500 voters polled in five cities favored Habibie as head
of state.
	   Most popular was Amien Rais, a prominent Muslim leader and
intellectual, with 31 percent. Close behind with 30 percent was
Megawati Sukarnoputri, the daughter of founding President Sukarno.
	   Despite the small sample size, pollsters said it had a 5 percent
margin of error.
	   A presidential ballot is expected to be held by a government
assembly next year after a parliamentary election that senior
legislators say will probably be held June 7.
	   Parliament Speaker Harmoko said Wednesday that a presidential
vote could be held in September or October. Originally, Habibie,
who plans to be a candidate, said the vote would take place in
December.

Sierra Leone's government orders press restrictions
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) _ President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah's
government on Wednesday announced a clampdown on unapproved press
reports about Sierra Leone's civil war, warning that offending news
outlets will be punished with the ``full force of the law.''
	   In a statement, the government said all press reports relating
to the ongoing conflict against the country's rebel alliance must
be cleared by the Ministry of Defense or the West African
intervention force, known as ECOMOG, that performs security and
national military functions throughout the country.
	   ``Members of the press perhaps need to be reminded that warfare
does not only involve the use of guns and bombs. Psychological
warfare is an important element,'' the government statement said.
	   ``Publications which demoralize our security forces or weaken
the resolve of the civilian population are in fact aiding the
enemy. Whether deliberate or inadvertent the effect is the same,''
the statement continued.
	   Unspecified harsh punishment will be meted out on offenders, the
government said.
	   The press crackdown follows local media reports of the capture
of 60 ECOMOG soldiers by rebels and the spending of millions of
dollars on residences for government ministers. Sierra Leone is one
of the world's poorest countries with an annual budget of less than
dlrs 20 million.
	   Sierra Leone's government has enlisted the aid of ECOMOG and a
traditional militia to fight rebel and former junta fighters who
were driven from power early this year, 10 months after taking
power in a coup in May 1997.
	   Fighting continues and thousands of people are believed to have
been killed, raped and maimed by the rebels in a sweeping revenge
campaign against the government. Authorities have responded by
throwing a tight security net throughout the country, while handing
down death sentences to dozens of collaborators of the former
junta, including former rebel leader Foday Sankoh.

Dismantling of controversial Brent Spar begins in Norwegian fjord
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DOUG MELLGREN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ The long-awaited dismantling of the Brent
Spar offshore oil storage buoy began Wednesday, 3 1/2 years after
Greenpeace activists boarded the unit and embarrassed oil giant
Shell into dropping plans to sink it in the North Atlantic.
	   Instead, Brent Spar was towed to the deep waters of the
Norwegian Erfjord inlet to be dismantled and reused, partly as the
foundation for a new wharf. The first major step is to remove the
buoy's 1,600 ton topside with a floating crane.
	   ``Crews are rigging for the lift. We expect to start lifting at
about 3 p.m. (1400 GMT),'' the project's senior engineer Arvid
Nygaard told The Associated Press from the crane barge. ``We have
been very lucky with the weather.''
	   Nygaard said the weather was calm, with no rain or snow, making
ideal conditions to start the lift. The process of dismantling the
15,000 ton unit is estimated to last a year.
	   Shell UK had planned to sink the obsolete Brent Spar off
Scotland, a cheaper and faster approach. But Greenpeace activists
boarded the vessel in April 1995 in a successful protest that
lasted four months and gained backing across Europe.
	   ``Off course, this is a good feeling,'' said Jan Rispens, a
Dutch Greenpeace activist who spent 2 1/2 weeks aboard the Brent
Spar during the protest. He was in western Norway to see the
dismantling begin, a step he called a victory for the millions of
people who supported the anti dumping campaign.
	   ``This is the best solution. It reuses materials; it provides
jobs in Norway, and it protects the ocean,'' he said.
	   Opponents feared that sinking the North Sea platform would
pollute the ocean with chemicals and other pollutants. But, in May
1996, a British government commission concluded that scuttling the
Brent Spar in the North Atlantic would have a minimal environmental
impact.
	   The tube-like Brent Spar will float upright, and be slowly
sliced into sections as it is lifted out of the water. The sections
will be cleaned, and then towed to the new wharf.
	   In January, Shell awarded Norway's Maritime GMC AS and
Scotland's Wood Group Engineering a joint contract to dispose of
the platform. Shell has said the disposal of Brent Spar will cost
the company up to 26 million pounds (dlrs 42 million), more than
twice the cost of sinking it.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ The United Nations will bring new
inspection teams to Iraq within days, a U.N. spokeswoman said
Wednesday, to carry out searches that have proved confrontational
in the past.
	   U.N. inspectors have carried out daily visits since Nov. 14,
when Iraq relented and allowed the arms experts to resume their
work after a two-week hiatus. Iraq has so far provided full
cooperation.
	   Most of the visits have involved checks on long-term monitoring
equipment at already-searched weapons sites.
	   A U.N. spokeswoman for the weapons inspectors, Caroline Cross,
said that so far the teams had been going ``for the normal and
routine visits to the already monitored sites.''

 &UR; EDS: OPEC meeting scheduled to begin 1700 GMT &QL;

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria, (AP) _ Ministers from the Organization of the
Petroleum Exporting Countries headed into a difficult meeting
Wednesday, as oil prices floundered around 12-year lows on world
markets.
	   Despite some voices in favor of cutting production _ Kuwait and
Algeria foremost among them _ most believe heavyweight Saudi
Arabia's fear of losing market share to overproducers in the group
may immobilize the organization.
	   ``It's a mess, as ever,'' said Leo Drollas, chief economist at
London's Global Center for Energy Studies.
	   This time though, OPEC, known for its disagreements, is facing
an especially tricky situation.
	   Its average price per barrel of crude oil has crashed dlrs 8.22
from dlrs 18.81 last November to dlrs 10.59, according to the last
available average price.
	   In London, Brent crude oil for delivery in January was trading
at noon at dlrs 11.35 a barrel, up from Tuesday's 15-year low of
dlrs 11.19.
	   Analysts say that price could hit new lows Wednesday, pushed
down by signs OPEC is largely immobilized by disagreement.
	   A badly judged decision to boost production last winter fed into
Asia's economic collapse, resulting in an oil glut worldwide.
	   Government revenue in most OPEC countries has taken a hit.
Kuwait says its 1998 oil revenue will sink by 45 percent.
	   Reflecting the sense of crisis, Algeria's oil minister Youcef
Yousfi has called for an exceptional meeting of heads of state of
OPEC's 11 members, saying the ``price crisis'' must be addressed at
the very top.
	   It would be OPEC's first heads of state meeting since 1975.
	   The year-end meeting in Vienna is expected to begin late
Wednesday, delayed by Yousfi's eleventh-hour stomp through four
Gulf nations to drum up support for action to boost prices.
	   Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas said in Jakarta late
Tuesday Indonesia supported a meeting. The United Arab Emirates
have also voiced support for the meeting.
	   The OPEC ministers are likely to discuss the suggestion of a
heads of state gathering Wednesday or Thursday, but it's unclear
how wide support is.
	   Suggestions so far on how to lift prices have focused on cutting
production further or extending current cuts, introduced in June to
soak up the oil glut pushing down prices.
	   Algeria, Kuwait and Libya all want further cuts to the 2.6
million barrel-a-day June production cut. The cut didn't work,
largely because demand is too low and some countries are
overproducing.
	   Saudi Arabia, OPEC's biggest producer at 8 million barrels a
day, is apparently unwilling to contemplate fresh cuts unless the
June round is adhered to, worried at losing market share to
overproducers.
	   Further depressing the market, Iraq's food-for-oil deal with the
United Nations rolled over Wednesday for another six months,
meaning around 1.8 million barrels of oil a day are reaching the
world market from Iraq, keeping world supplies high.
	   Overproduction by Venezuela and Iran anyway calls into question
the point of further cuts, analysts say.
	   Iran disputes it is overproducing.
	   Venezuela, facing a change of government in February, is
considered unpredictable, increasing the sense that meaningful
action this time round is unlikely.

	   The biggest hurdle to the bailout package was removed earlier
this month when the United States agreed to support a one-time deal
for Pakistan despite sanctions imposed on both Pakistan and
neighboring India in May.
	   The sanctions were imposed to punish the two often hostile
neighbors for conducting underground nuclear tests. India suffered
only slightly from the sanctions, while Pakistan was badly affected
because it is so heavily dependent on international aid.
	   The bailout comes with a number of conditions, including
structural reform of the banking sector, tax reform to increase the
tax base and revenue, and a provision to try to reduce corruption.

EU governments, parliament panel set 1999 EU budget at dlrs 113
</HEADLINE>
billion &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Representatives of the European Union
governments and the European Parliament have agreed to fix the EU's
1999 budget at 96.9 billion European currency units (dlrs 113
billion) up 7.7 percent from this year.
	   The deal with the EU assembly's budget committee was reached
late Tuesday.
	   It is expected to be approved by the full parliament next month.
	   As always, the biggest slice of spending _ 40.4 billion ecu
(dlrs 47.8 billion) - will go to farm spending, mostly subsidies to
guarantee prices for farmers.
	   Aid to the EU's poorer regions will account for 39 billion ecus
(dlrs 46 billion); assistance to non-EU nations 6 billion ecus
(dlrs 7 billion); administrative costs 4.4 billion ecu (dlrs 5.2
billion).
	   The year-on-year rise in total EU spending results primarily
from a near 17 percent increse in development funding for poorer
regions.
	   By comparison, farm spending _ although comprising almost half
of total outlays _ will remain unchanged in 1999 from this year.
	   EU nations are split over plans to overhaul the budget over the
2000-2006 period to enable the Union to finance the entry of up to
12 new members over the next decade.
	   Britain and Germany want to freeze the overall budget and cut
the level of farm spending. Spain opposes a freeze and France is
concerned its powerful farm lobby will revolt against subsidy cuts.
	   The EU budget is funded by contributions from EU nations, with
Germany, the EU's largest economy, paying the lion's share.

	   SOWETO, South Africa (AP) _The president of the West Indies

in Soweto, a sprawling black township south of Johannesburg, when
they were robbed. None of the three was hurt.
	   A five-series test between the West Indies and South Africa
begins on Thursday in Johannesburg.

Government makes 1999 budget deal with center, right-wing
</HEADLINE>
opposition &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) _ The minority government struck a deal
with opposition parties Wednesday on the 1999 budget that includes
measures to discourage workers from retiring early and a reduction
in corporate taxes.
	   The deal made by the Social Democratic-led coalition also
includes a plan to allowing local governments more freedom in
managing state-owned electricity utilities, which the government
said could generate 1.3 billion kroner (dlrs 210 million) in extra
revenues.
	   Finance Minister Mogens Lykketoft declined to elaborate on those
plans.
	   Corporate tax will be lowered to 32 percent from the current 34
percent, and state-funded pension plans will undergo reform to
discourage early retirement, while lowering the general retirement
age to 65 from 67.
	   Lykketoft reached an accord with the Liberals, the
Conservatives, and the smaller moderate parties, the Center
Democrats and the Christian Peoples Party. The Social Democrats and
their coalition partner, the Radical Party, control 72 of the 179
seats in parliament.
	   According to the government's budget proposal, a 1.7 billion
kroner (dlrs 243,000 million) budget surplus is expected in 1999,
significantly down from 27 billion (dlrs 3.9 billion) estimated for
this year.
	   Earlier this year, the government passed a package of national
budget revisions intended to cool off the economy with the support
of the left-wing opposition. The move came after the Central Bank
and independent economists began calling for fiscal restraint,
warning that the economy would overheat.

Habibie to announce commission for Suharto inquiry this week
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES, RECASTS with plans to announce investigation
commission &QL; 
 &UR; With BC-Indonesia &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ President B.J. Habibie will announce
details this week of an independent commission to investigate
alleged corruption by former President Suharto, a Cabinet minister
said Wednesday.
	   Habibie announced last week that he would set up a new inquiry
into the wealth of his predecessor and former mentor, who was
forced to step down in May amid widespread protests against his
32-year authoritarian rule.
	   ``The president decided that the commission would be announced
within this week,'' Development Planning Minister Hartarto
Sastrosoenarto said after a Cabinet meeting.
	   Meanwhile, the government said Suharto has handed over seven
charitable foundations worth dlrs 530 million that he established
during his three decades in power.
	   Critics have accused him of siphoning off state wealth to
benefit his family's business empires. Suharto's own wealth has
been estimated at dlrs 4 billion, and student protesters want the
state to seize it.
	   In response to a public outcry, the government launched an
investigation earlier this year into a dozen foundations owned by
Suharto. It said it found some indication of irregularities in the
use of foundation funds.
	   Attorney General Andi Muhammad Ghalib also headed an earlier,
separate investigation into graft allegations against Suharto. It
found little evidence of wrongdoing and was labeled a whitewash by
critics.
	   Ghalib has said the new inquiry commission will be made up
entirely of credible public figures.
	   ``It's clear that there will be no government officials among
its members,'' the newspaper Suara Pembaruan quoted Ghalib as
saying.
	   Meanwhile, Parliament Speaker Harmoko said Wednesday that the
government should take seriously suggestions that Suharto be placed
under house arrest.
	   Marzuki Darusman, chairman of the ruling Golkar party faction in
the nation's highest legislative body, has said that placing travel
restrictions on Suharto would appease growing public anger.
	   ``The parliament leaders see this suggestion as a part of
efforts for efficiency in the investigation,'' Harmoko said.
``Therefore it has to be taken into account by the government.''
	   Habibie so far has ignored calls by opposition figures and
students to detain or impose a travel ban on Suharto.
	   The coordinating minister for social affairs, Haryono Suyono,
said Suharto sent a letter Sunday to Habibie in which he ceded
control of seven foundations to the government.
	   Habibie then ordered the ministry of social welfare to supervise
the foundations, Haryono added.
	   The foundations handed over by Suharto are Yayasan Supersemar,
Yayasan Dharmais, Yayasan Dakab, Yayasan Amal Bakti Muslim
Pancasila, Yayasan Dana Sejahtera Mandiri, Yayasan Gotong Royong
and Yayasan Trikora.

Netanyahu makes tentative deal with Levy to rejoin coalition
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS that Gesher reserved decision, but did not oppose
merger with Likud &QL; 
 &UR; By SARI BASHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday
struck a tentative deal to bring his former foreign minister, David
Levy, back to the government in an effort to strengthen his fragile
coalition.
	   Hardliners in Netanyahu's government have been threatening to
leave over the land-for-security agreement with the Palestinians,
thus robbing Netanyahu of his majority in parliament.
	   Without such a majority, Netanyahu would either have to call
early elections or try to bring other parties into his coalition.
	   Levy's return would not be enough to guarantee the survival of
Netanyahu's government. Political commentators said Wednesday that
the prime minister wanted Levy back in the fold so he would be in a
stronger position when opening negotiations with the main
opposition party, Labor, to join the government.
	   In a sign that a so-called ``national unity government'' was
becoming a possibility, three influential Cabinet ministers _
Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon, Trade Minister Natan Sharansky and
Finance Minister Yaakov Neeman _ said it might be a good idea for
Netanyahu to start courting Labor.
	   Netanyahu offered Levy either the finance or infrastructure
ministry. As part of the deal, Levy's Gesher Party would run on a
joint slate with Netanyahu's Likud Party in the next elections,
with Levy guaranteed the No. 2 spot.
	   Israel radio said Gesher approved a return to Netanyahu's
coalition, but did not make a decision on a possible merger with
Likud. Two of five Gesher legislators, David Magen and Michael
Kleiner, did not attend the meeting, an apparent sign that they
will not rejoin the coalition.
	   Levy had resigned in January in protest over the deadlock in the
peace talks with the Palestinians and the government's failure to
spend as much money as promised on social welfare programs.
	   At the time, he said the government was ``on a flight to
nowhere.''
	   On Tuesday, Levy suggested that with the signing of the Mideast
accord last month, the government looked more appealing.
	   ``Now that the government is taking the political course that I
demanded ... we in Gesher will convene and decide,'' he told Israel
TV's Channel Two.
	   Using intermediaries, Netanyahu and Levy negotiated through the
night and a tentative deal was reached before dawn Wednesday,
Israel radio and Israel army radio said.

Pakistan gets IMF bailout package
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; URGENT &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: COMBINES pvs, ADDS detail. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ After two weeks of tough talks, the
International Monetary Fund agreed Wednesday to give Pakistan dlrs
5.5 billion to salvage its shattered economy, finance officials
said.
	   The agreement saves Pakistan from certain default on its dlrs 32
billion debt.
	   The agreement ends months of economic uncertainty during which
time Pakistan's stock market plunged to record lows, foreign
investment dried up and jittery Pakistani investors stayed out of
the market.
	   The biggest hurdle to the bailout package was removed earlier
this month when the United States agreed to support a one-time deal
for Pakistan despite sanctions imposed on both Pakistan and
neighboring India in May.
	   Sanctions were imposed after the two often hostile neighbors
conducted underground nuclear tests in May. India suffered only
slightly from the sanctions, while Pakistan was badly affected
because it is so heavily dependent on international aid.
	   The IMF deal still requires approval from the IMF board of
directors at a meeting in Washington next month, Pakistan's finance
ministry officials said at a news conference in the federal
capital, Islamabad.
	   The deal gives Pakistan dlrs 3.3 billion from the IMF, Asian
Development Bank and World Bank.
	   The bailout package also comes with a number of conditions,
including structural reform in the banking sector, tax reform to
increase the tax base and revenue, and a provision to try to reduce
corruption.

	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Millions of Indians voted Wednesday in
provincial elections that could cast shadows on the fortunes of
Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee's wobbly coalition.
	   The ballot count begins Saturday, but an exit poll forecast a
sweeping victory for the Congress Party, led by Sonia Gandhi, in
the state of New Delhi, which would dislodge the state government
of the right-wing Bharatiya Janata Party.
	   The poll, conducted by the private Center for Media Studies and
broadcast on STAR television, covered 1,500 voters.
	   Exit polls also predicted Congress would oust the BJP from the
state government of Rajasthan, but could lose in the central state
of Madhya Pradesh. In Mizoram, a remote northeastern state removed
from national politics, Congress was likely to lose to regional
parties.
	   Polls closed Wednesday after 10 hours of voting. Counting begins
Saturday and results will be released as they come in, but final
results will not be known until Sunday.
	   More than 80 million voters were eligible to choose 626 state
legislators from among 5,000 candidates in the northern New Delhi
state, site of the capital; in Rajasthan in India's western desert;
in the central state of Madhya Pradesh; and in the tiny
northeastern state of Mizoram _ four of India's 26 states.
	   Pre-election surveys predicted gains by the Congress Party over
the Hindu nationalist BJP due to discontent with soaring vegetable
prices. The BJP, which also heads the federal government, governs
two of the four states, and Congress rules two.
	   Voting was largely peaceful but some violence was reported in
Madhya Pradesh. Police arrested a Congress Party candidate, Hari
Singh Narvaria, after he fired gunshots in the air apparently to
scare away his opponents, United News of India news agency said.
Leftist extremists were blamed for looting a polling station.
	   Tens of thousands of armed police guarded voting stations in
four states where borders were sealed to prevent the entry of
criminals from other states.
	   About 300 slum dwellers fell ill after eating snacks that were
distributed outside polling stations in the constituency where New
Delhi Chief Minister Sushma Swaraj was contesting, Indian news
agencies reported.
	   The vote was a key electoral test for new Congress Party leader,
Sonia Gandhi, widow of slain former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi and
torchbearer of the dynasty that gave India three prime ministers.
	   Despite aggressive campaigning by both Vajpayee and Gandhi,
political analysts said the electorate appeared apathetic.
	   ``This is the most low-key provincial election in 40 years,''
said N. Bhaskara Rao of the Center for Media Studies.
	   Rao said voters' concern was focused on the spiraling rise in
prices of essential commodities in recent months, including a
massive shortage of onions, which became a powerful rallying point
for opposition ranks.
	   Opposition candidates weighed themselves in onions, several
leaders drove around Delhi wearing garlands of onions, and huge
onion-shaped balloons loomed over the sites of political rallies,
their way of protesting a 700 percent rise in the price of the
staple since September.

Four animals die from alleged poisoning at Kiev zoo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Three bison and a yak at Ukraine's largest
zoo died unexpectedly over the past week, and zoo officials claim
the animals were poisoned, newspapers reported Wednesday.
	   Three more bison and another yak remained ill with diarrhea, the
disease that killed the other four animals, the Kiev zoo's chief
veterinarian Andriy Marunchyn told the daily Fakty.
	   Zoo director Oleksiy Lepeshkov claimed the animals were poisoned
by his jealous rivals.
	   Lepeshkov said his opponents were angry over a recent court
ruling that allowed him to return to the zoo's top post following
his dismissal earlier this year, the daily Segodnya reported.
	   Marunchyn said zoo veterinarians checked the food the animals
were given before they died and found no dangerous substances,
according to Fakty.
	   Kiev city's chief veterinarian Petro Lesyk also told Fakty that
the food provided to the animals was of good quality and that he
suspected intentional poisoning in the case.
	   Other zoo officials said many more animals would have fallen ill
if the food they were given had been infected or of low quality,
Fakty said.
	   The officials alleged that someone may have added poison to the
food when it was distributed among the animals, according to Fakty.

European soccer body rejects Polish appeal against knife ban

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ European soccer's governing body Wednesday
affirmed a season-long ban from European soccer imposed on Polish
club Wisla Krakow over an alleged knife-throwing incident in a UEFA
Cup match last month.
	   The Polish club's lawyer, Reinhard Rauball, who disclosed the
decision by the UEFA appeals committee, said the rejection of the
Krakow appeal was ``a sporting and a financial disaster'' for the
club.
	   Rauball said he didn't dispute the details of the Oct. 20
incident, in which UEFA says Italian midfielder Dino Baggio was
struck by a knife thrown from the stands. He needed five stitches
to close a head wound.
	   But he said the season-long ban was too severe and that it
should be softened.
	   Rauball noted that Krakow is 10 points clear at the top of the
Polish league and expects to qualify for European cup competition
next year.
	   Being excluded will mean ``a very big financial loss'' because
of the money in the European competition that the team cannot hope
to match in Polish league play, he said.
	   Rauball said he suggested a penalty on the first two home games,
requiring that the first game be played elsewhere in Poland and the
second in another country.
	   Polish police on have detained a 19-year-old man in the
incident.
	   He noted that there were similarities to the banning of the
Italian club Fiorentina over an explosive device thrown by a fan,
but that Krakow should have treated more leniently since it was the
club's first such offense.
	   The club will be banned from the next UEFA competition in the
next five years for which it qualifies due to the ``reprehensible
act of a Wisla Krakow supporter,'' the original decision said.
	   Baggio was struck in the 80th minute of the second-round,
first-leg match between AC Parma and Wisla Krakow. The teams tied
1-1. Parma won the second game 2-1 at home to advance 3-2 on
aggregate.

	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Lawmakers gathered Wednesday for a
confidence vote that is expected to topple Turkey's
corruption-tainted government and launch a struggle to form the
country's fifth governing coalition since 1995.
	   In a clear sign that Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz was likely to
lose the vote, parliament on a vote of 315-214 censured his state
economy minister, Gunes Taner, on similar abuse of power
allegations.
	   The downfall of Yilmaz would again leave political leaders with
a difficult choice: trying to set aside feuds and build a coalition
of Western-style parties or accept an alliance with the powerful
pro-Islamic bloc.

Reports say three top Libyan officials jailed in Lockerbie case
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Three top Libyan officials have been tried
and jailed in the 1988 Pan Am bombing, newspapers reported
Wednesday. Libyan dissidents said the reports appear to be a
political ploy by Libyan leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi.
	   An Egyptian source, who like Libyan sources spoke to The
Associated Press on condition of anonymity, said he had heard
nothing about any such trials during meetings with leading
officials on a just-ended trip to the Libyan capital, Tripoli.
	   The reported jailing comes as Gadhafi is under pressure to
accept a plan to turn over for trial two other Libyans wanted for
the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, that
killed 270 people, including 189 Americans.
	   Two London newspapers, The Guardian and the leading Arabic daily
Al-Hayat, reported Wednesday that three top intelligence chiefs at
the time of the airliner bombing had been convicted and imprisoned
in Libya.
	   The Guardian said Abdullah al-Senussi, Musa Koussa and Mohammed
al-Misrati were sentenced to between five and seven years in prison
earlier this month.
	   Quoting ``well-placed sources,'' the Guardian said the charge
filed against the three was ``dereliction of duty,'' but gave no
further details.
	   Al-Hayat's report said it had questioned Libyan Justice Minister
Mohamed Belgasim al-Zuwiy about the purported trials, but he had
replied only that ``trials are going on all the time.''
	   The Guardian and Al-Hayat suggested that the jailing of the
three was aimed at blocking their testimony at a trial of the two
Libyan suspects which, under a plan approved by the U.N. Security
Council, would be heard by Scottish judges in the Netherlands.
	   After refusing for years to turn over two men for trial in the
United States or Britain, Libya recently accepted in principle the
proposed trial in The Hague, Netherlands, but has delayed in
turning over the suspects. Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen
Khalifa Fhimah, accused by the United States and Britain, allegedly
were Libyan intelligence agents.
	   The Libyan dissidents said the jailings probably were a total
invention leaked by Gadhafi's government. One dissident said the
three men had been close associates of Gadhafi for decades and were
``too valuable for Gadhafi to dispose of them.''
	   Al-Senousi was head of the Libyan intelligence service and
Koussa was in charge of its foreign operations during the 1988
bombing. The third man, al-Misrati, was a senior official in the
Revolutionary Committees, Gadhafi's ruling party.
	   The dissidents said Gadhafi's long resistance to turning over
al-Megrahi and Fhimah stemmed from fear that their testimony would
directly implicate his government in the bombing.
	   Libya has been under U.N. sanctions since 1992 to force it to
hand over the two suspects in the Lockerbie case. The sanctions
include a ban on air links with Libya, an arms embargo and a
partial ban on the sale of oil equipment.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ The United Nations will bring new
inspection teams to Iraq within days, a U.N. spokeswoman said
Wednesday, to carry out searches that have proved confrontational
in the past.
	   U.N. inspectors have carried out daily visits since Nov. 14,
when Iraq relented and let arms experts resume their work after a
two-week hiatus. Iraq has so far provided full cooperation.
	   Most of the visits have involved checks on long-term monitoring
equipment at already-searched weapons sites.
	   A U.N. spokeswoman for the weapons inspectors, Caroline Cross,
said that so far the teams had been going ``for the normal and
routine visits to the already monitored sites.''

Angry depositors burn government offices in South Sulawesi
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Thousands of customers of a troubled
financial firm went on a rampage and burned government buildings
Wednesday when they were unable to withdraw their savings, the
official Antara news agency reported.
	   Security forces blocked them, however, from setting fire to the
prison where four executives of the firm were in custody in South
Sulawesi, Antara said. The cooperative, which acted as an illegal
bank, has been closed, it said.
	   The rioters burned the office of the regency government, the
local parliament building, the prosecution office and the district
court in the coastal town of Pinrang, about 1,370 kilometers (856
miles) northeast of Jakarta, Antara said.
	   No arrests or injuries were reported. Local officials could not
be reached for comment.
	   Indonesia is currently battling its worst economic crisis in 30
years, and many financial institutions have failed.
	   Wednesday's protest was the third since early last month. Last
Friday, a number of protesters and policemen were injured.

President begins process of setting up a new government
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ A day after his inauguration, President
Emile Lahoud met Wednesday with outgoing Prime Minister Rafik
Hariri, who will most probably be invited to form the next
government.
	   Lahoud's meeting with Hariri set in motion the process of
forming a new government, which the president has committed to
cleaning up corruption in the public service.
	   A presidential statement issued after the meeting said Lahoud
would begin consultations with members of the 128-seat parliament
on Thursday and Friday on the selection of a new premier.
	   Lahoud has asked the Hariri Cabinet to serve in a caretaker
capacity until a new government is formed.
	   Under an arrangement that has governed Lebanon's politics since
the country's independence from France in 1943, the president, a
Maronite Catholic, must name a Sunni Muslim as prime minister.
	   Hariri, the architect of multibillion dollar program to rebuild
Lebanon from the destruction of the 1975-90 civil war, has held the
premiership since October 1992.
	   Lahoud, the 62-year-old outgoing army commander, was elected
president by parliament on Oct. 15. He took over Tuesday from
President Elias Hrawi in a peaceful transition unseen in Lebanon
for nearly 30 years.

First segment of international space station develops minor flaws
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The first module of the new international space
station has developed three minor glitches, but they won't affect
its operation, Russia's top space official said Wednesday.
	   The Zarya, or Sunrise, module, built by a Russian company for
NASA, has been smoothly orbiting Earth since a flawless launch on
Friday and neither Russian officials, nor NASA, had previously
reported any problem.
	   Russian Space Agency chief Yuri Koptev said one of Zarya's eight
accumulator batteries was failing and a vibrator on one of its
antennas hadn't unfolded properly. In addition, the humidity level
in Zarya's cabin was higher than expected, probably because it
hasn't had time to heat up.
	   ``None of these affect the flight,'' Koptev said at a news
conference.
	   He explained that the humidity level may eventually normalize by
itself, and the battery problem might be explained by a faulty
gauge. In fact, for a normal flight it's enough to have half of the
batteries working, Koptev said.
	   As for the antenna, it will only be needed on the later stages
of the project and won't affect the scheduled rendezvous with the
American space shuttle Endeavour, which is to be launched Dec. 3
carrying the Unity connecting module.
	   The shuttle crew is to capture Zarya using the Endeavor's robot
arm and then attach the two modules in three space walks.
	   The antenna serves Zarya's manual docking system that would
allow the new station's crew to use manual controls to dock
arriving cargo ships to the station if there are problems with
their autopilot. Koptev said the crew will have plenty of time to
fix it.
	   ``Even if it's not fixed, the antenna is big enough to work
normally without the vibrator,'' said Sergei Gorbunov, a space
agency spokesman.
	   The 12.4-meter (41.2-feet) Zarya, built by the Russian
Khrunichev company, is designed to serve as a space tugboat in the
early stages of the project, providing propulsion, power and
communications.
	   The new station will not be inhabitable until at least early
2000, following the launch of the Russian-made crew module which is
set to blast off next July or August.
	   Russia has failed to meet two previous target dates for the crew
module's construction, putting the whole project more than a year
behind schedule. Struggling to prevent further delays, Russia has
sold its early research time on the station to NASA for dlrs 60
million.
	   Koptev said on Wednesday that he would continue talks with NASA
next month to sell other hardware and services to get more money,
as the government's financing remains scarce.
	   Russia will have to spend about dlrs 270 million next year to
fulfill its commitments on the new station, and the size of the
government's allocations remain unclear, Koptev said. Russia is
dealing with its worst economic crisis since the Soviet collapse.
	   Russia will continue operating its aging Mir space station past
the current July target for abandoning it only if it raises
additional funds. The new international station is an absolute
priority, because it will help keep the ailing Russian space
industry afloat, Koptev said.
	   ``If we give priority to the Mir and break the international
space station project, the consequences for our space industry will
be catastrophic,'' he said.
	   The new station, involving 16 nations with the United States and
Russia playing the biggest roles, will consist of more than 100
elements that will take 45 assembly flights to complete. It is due
to be completed by 2004.
	   The station will weigh 500 tons and is expected to cost at least
dlrs 40 billion, with the United States planning to pay dlrs 24
billion. It will serve as an orbital home for visiting astronauts
and cosmonauts for at least 15 years.

Scotland Yard finds no `basis' for match-fixing claims
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Scotland Yard said Wednesday it looked into claims
of match-fixing at a recent Premier League soccer game but has
found no basis for a formal investigation.
	   The game in question is reported to have been Arsenal's 1-1 home
draw last month with Southampton. Arsenal is the league's defending
champion and Southampton one of the weakest clubs.
	   The Daily Mail said the investigation was opened when police
received an anonymous letter from Malaysia saying money had been
paid to guarantee Arsenal did not win 2-0.
	   ``Preliminary inquires were conducted, but it has not been
established if there is any basis for a formal investigation,''
London's Metropolitan Police Service said in a brief statement.
	   ``The matter remains under consideration but it is thought that
no further inquiries will be made in the absence of any further
information.''
	   English soccer was rocked by a match-fixing trial last year in
which former league stars John Fashanu, Hans Segers and Bruce
Grobbelaar and a Malaysian businessman were accused of rigging
games on behalf of a Far East gambling syndicate.
	   All four men were acquitted.
	   Grobbelaar and Segers were later fined 10,000 pounds (dlrs
16,000) and given a six-month ban by the English Football
Association for breaking FA rules on betting. The two had testified
during the trial that they had been paid to forecast the results of
games. Both punishments were suspended for two years, allowing the
players to resume their careers.

Pakistan gets IMF bail out package

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ The International Monetary Fund
agreed Wednesday to rescue Pakistan's shattered economy from
default, granting a dlrs 5.5 billion bailout package, finance
officials said.
	   Pakistan's economy has been reeling from international sanctions
that followed nuclear tests in May, and owed a whopping dlrs 32
billion to international creditors.
	   The biggest hurdle to the bailout package was removed earlier
this month when the United States agreed to support a one-time deal
for Pakistan despite sanctions imposed on both Pakistan and
neighboring India last May.
	   The United States imposed economic sanctions on Pakistan and its
rival India after the two neighbors conducted underground nuclear
tests in May. The embargo hit Pakistan especially hard, because it
relied heavily on foreign loans and had meager reserves of hard
currency needed to pay for imports.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton lifted some of the sanctions earlier
this month.
	   After announcing the policy reversal, Clinton assured Prime
Minister Nawaz Sharif in a letter that the administration would
exert its influence with international lenders ``to meet Pakistan's
economic difficulties,'' according to a foreign ministry statement
issued at the time.
	   The sanctions were aimed at punishing the two often hostile
neighbors, but India suffered only slightly.
	   The bailout package for Pakistan also comes with a number of
conditions, which include structural reform in its banking sector,
tax reform to increase its tax base and revenue as well as a
provision to try to reduce corruption.
	   The deal still requires final approval from the IMF board of
directors at a meeting in Washington next month, Pakistan's finance
ministry officials said at a news conference in the capital,
Islamabad.
	   It is expected that Pakistan will have to find additional
sources of revenue, although Finance Minister Ishaq Dar said the
agreement with the IMF does not call for higher income tax or
increased wealth tax.
	   The deal gives Pakistan dlrs 3.3 billion from the IMF, Asian
Development Bank and World Bank. The remainder of the money will be
used to restructure loans.

European soccer body rejects Polish appeal against knife ban

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ European soccer's governing body Wednesday
affirmed a season-long ban from European soccer imposed on Polish
club Wisla Krakow over an alleged knife-throwing incident in a UEFA
Cup match last month.
	   The Polish club's lawyer, Reinhard Rauball, who disclosed the
decision by the UEFA appeals committee, said the rejection of the
Krakow appeal was ``a sporting and a financial disaster'' for the
club.
	   Rauball said he didn't dispute the details of the Oct. 20
incident, in which UEFA says Italian midfielder Dino Baggio was
struck by a knife thrown from the stands. He needed five stitches
to close a head wound.
	   But he said the season-long ban was too severe and that it
should be softened.
	   Rauball noted that Krakow is 10 points clear at the top of the
Polish league and expects to qualify for European cup competition
next year.
	   Being excluded will mean ``a very big financial loss'' because
of the money in the European competition that the team cannot hope
to match in Polish league play, he said.
	   Rauball said he suggested a penalty on the first two home games,
requiring that the first game be played elsewhere in Poland and the
second in another country.
	   UEFA imposed the penalty because it said Krakow's security
should have stopped the knife being brought into the stadium, but
Rauball said security had been very good.
	   ``We made the clear point that the police of Krakow did
everything which was necessary for the security of the spectators,
of the team of Palma and referees.
	   ``But on the other hand there was a knife which was thrown at
the player Dino Baggio.''
	   Polish police on have detained a 19-year-old man in the
incident.
	   Rauball noted that there were similarities to the banning of the
Italian club Fiorentina over an explosive device thrown by a fan,
but that Krakow should have treated more leniently since it was the
club's first such offense.
	   The club will be banned from the next UEFA competition in the
next five years for which it qualifies due to the ``reprehensible
act of a Wisla Krakow supporter,'' the original decision said.
	   Baggio was struck in the 80th minute of the second-round,
first-leg match between AC Parma and Wisla Krakow. The teams tied
1-1. Parma won the second game 2-1 at home to advance 3-2 on
aggregate.

	   GENEVA (AP) _ European soccer's governing body Wednesday
affirmed a season-long ban from European soccer imposed on Polish
club Wisla Krakow over an alleged knife-throwing incident in a UEFA
Cup match last month.
	   The Polish club's lawyer, Reinhard Rauball, who disclosed the
decision by the UEFA appeals committee, said the rejection of the
Krakow appeal was ``a sporting and a financial disaster'' for the
club.
	   Rauball said he didn't dispute the details of the Oct. 20
incident, in which UEFA says Italian midfielder Dino Baggio was
struck by a knife thrown from the stands. He needed five stitches
to close a head wound.
	   But he said the season-long ban was too severe and that it
should be softened.
	   Rauball noted that Krakow is 10 points clear at the top of the
Polish league and expects to qualify for European cup competition
next year.
	   Being excluded will mean ``a very big financial loss'' because
of the money in the European competition that the team cannot hope
to match in Polish league play, he said.
	   Rauball said he suggested a penalty on the first two home games,
requiring that the first game be played elsewhere in Poland and the
second in another country.
	   UEFA imposed the penalty because it said Krakow's security
should have stopped the knife being brought into the stadium, but
Rauball said security had been very good.
	   ``We made the clear point that the police of Krakow did
everything which was necessary for the security of the spectators,
of the team of Palma and referees.
	   ``But on the other hand there was a knife which was thrown at
the player Dino Baggio.''
	   Polish police on have detained a 19-year-old man in the
incident.
	   Rauball noted that there were similarities to the banning of the
Italian club Fiorentina over an explosive device thrown by a fan,
but that Krakow should have treated more leniently since it was the
club's first such offense.
	   The club will be banned from the next UEFA competition in the
next five years for which it qualifies due to the ``reprehensible
act of a Wisla Krakow supporter,'' the original decision said.
	   Baggio was struck in the 80th minute of the second-round,
first-leg match between AC Parma and Wisla Krakow. The teams tied
1-1. Parma won the second game 2-1 at home to advance 3-2 on
aggregate.

Woodhall set title defense against Italy's Vincenzo Nardiello
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ WBC world super-middleweight champion Richie
Woodhall will make his second title defense Jan. 30 against former
champion Vincenzo Nardiello of Italy.
	   Woodhall was to have faced Nardiello in his first title defense
but pulled out with an injury. Woodhall defeated England's Glenn
Catley in that bout in September.
	   Nardiello held the WBC super-middleweight title before losing it
to England's Robin Reed two years ago in Italy. Reid then lost his
first defense to Thulane ``Sugar Boy'' Malinga. Woodhall
subsequently defeated Malinga on a points decision in March to
capture the title.
	   Promoter Frank Warren said Wednesday he was looking for a venue
in central England.

Netanyahu makes tentative deal with Levy to rejoin coalition
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES Gesher approved a return to Netanyahu's coalition, but
did not make a decision on a possible merger with Likud. Minor

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu struck a
tentative deal Wednesday to bring his former foreign minister back
to the government in an effort to strengthen his fragile coalition.
	   The return of David Levy, the former foreign minister, would not
be enough to guarantee the survival of Netanyahu's government,
which has been endangered by hard-liners outraged over the Mideast
peace deal.
	   The hard-liners have been threatening to leave over the
land-for-security agreement with the Palestinians, thus robbing
Netanyahu of his majority in parliament.
	   Without such a majority, Netanyahu would either have to call
early elections or try to bring other parties into his coalition.
	   Political commentators said Wednesday that the prime minister
wanted Levy back in the fold so he would be in a stronger position
when opening negotiations with the main opposition party, Labor, to
join the government.
	   In a sign that a so-called ``national unity government'' was
becoming a real possibility, three influential Cabinet ministers _
Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon, Trade Minister Natan Sharansky and
Finance Minister Yaakov Neeman _ said Netanyahu should court Labor.
	   Netanyahu offered Levy either the finance or infrastructure
ministry. As part of the deal, Levy's Gesher Party would run on a
joint slate with Netanyahu's Likud Party in the next elections,
with Levy guaranteed the No. 2 spot.
	   Israel radio said Gesher approved a return to Netanyahu's
coalition, but did not make a decision on a possible merger with
Likud. Two of five Gesher legislators, David Magen and Michael
Kleiner, did not attend the meeting, an apparent sign that they
will not rejoin the coalition.
	   Levy had resigned in January to protest a deadlock in peace
talks and the government's failure to spend on social welfare
programs.
	   He said the government was ``on a flight to nowhere.''
	   On Tuesday, Levy suggested that with the signing of the Mideast
accord last month, the government looked more appealing.
	   ``Now that the government is taking the political course that I
demanded ... we in Gesher will convene and decide,'' he told Israel
TV's Channel Two.
	   Using intermediaries, Netanyahu and Levy negotiated through the
night and a tentative deal was reached before dawn Wednesday,
Israel radio and Israel army radio said.
	   After the talks, Netanyahu canceled a visit to Switzerland which
had been scheduled to defuse tensions over a campaign to have Swiss
banks pay restitution to Holocaust victims.
	   Netanyahu called off his trip at the last minute ``because of
his effort to expand the Cabinet and achieve a stronger base for
policy measures,'' his office said.

Police break up journalists' demonstration in Azerbaijan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Police broke up a demonstration Wednesday by
newspaper editors in the Azerbaijani capital, news agencies said.
Journalists there have been on a hunger strike to protest a
government crackdown on their reporting.
	   More than 20 editors of non-government newspapers attempted to
picket in front of the presidential palace in Baku, waving signs
that read ``For Freedom of Expression'' and ``Hands off the Free
Press,'' according to the Interfax news agency.
	   The Turan news agency put the number of demonstrators at 150. It
said police met them near the front of the palace, halting the
rally and beating three journalists covering the demonstration.
	   The demonstrators included a dozen journalists who have joined a
hunger strike that began Nov. 12, Turan said. The agency added that
the health of some of the hunger strikers is seriously
deteriorating.
	   The journalists are protesting a cluster of libel suits the
government has filed against reporters who have written articles
critical of President Geidar Aliev and his administration.
	   Damages sought by officials in the lawsuits exceed dlrs 500,000
_ a staggering amount in a country where average salaries rarely
exceed the equivalent of dlrs 43 a month.
	   Last week, an Azerbaijani court ordered a newspaper to pay dlrs
50,000 to the head of the presidential administration in damages
resulting from one of the libel suits.

Italian Communist party reveals it brought Kurdish rebel leader to
</HEADLINE>
Italy &QL; 
 &UR; By VANIA GRANDI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Italy's hard-line Communist party revealed Wednesday
that it was responsible for bringing Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah
Ocalan to Italy to seek political asylum, a venture that has
provoked a bitter standoff with Turkey and put the Kurdish question
on the front burner throughout Europe.
	   Ramon Mantovani, who is in charge of foreign affairs for the
Communist Refoundation Party, went to Moscow and brought Ocalan
back to Rome on Nov. 12, party spokeswoman Ritanna Armeni said
Wednesday.
	   Mantovani planned a news conference later in the day.
	   Ocalan was arrested when he arrived in Rome, using a false
passport, and detained for a week. Turkey has been stridently
demanding his extradition, but an Italian court freed Ocalan,
ruling that Italian law forbids extraditing suspects to a country
where they face the death penalty. The ruling further enraged
Turkey.
	   Refoundation's stunning revelation comes after numerous reports
_ denied by the government _ that Ocalan had a secret deal paving
his way to Italy.
	   Refoundation is part of the opposition, but its role in the
Ocalan affair still has the potential to embarrass the new
center-left government. The government is headed by a former
Communist and its justice minister belongs to a Communist party
which only recently broke away from Refoundation.
	   The head of the breakaway faction asked the government Wednesday
to grant Ocalan asylum.
	   Ocalan leads the Kurdish Workers Party, or PKK, which has been
waging a war for Kurdish autonomy in southeastern Turkey for 14
years. Turkey considers him a terrorist and its most-wanted
fugitive. Ocalan is being tried in absentia in Turkey for capital
crimes.
	   Germany also has a warrant out for Ocalan but has said it won't
ask for his extradition, a decision that leaves Italy stuck with an
extremely volatile diplomatic dilemma.
	   Granting Ocalan asylum would further enrage Turkey, a NATO ally
and major trading partner, as well as the United States, which
considers Ocalan a terrorist and wants him prosecuted. It could
also make Italy a mecca for Kurdish activists.
	   The European Union has been drawn into the conflict as well,
backing Italy against Turkish trade boycotts.
	   Italy has a small population of Kurdish exiles, about 1,000,
compared to Germany, with around 400,000.
	   There are around 20 to 25 million Kurds spread out over Turkey,
Syria, Iraq and Iran; some 12 to 15 million live in Turkey.
	   Ocalan lived in Syria for years until his expulsion in October,
forced by Turkish pressure on Syria. He sought haven in Russia
before the intervention of Italy's Communists.
	   Ocalan issued a statement Wednesday calling his decision to
abandon armed struggle and use Europe as a platform for seeking a
peaceful resolution to the Kurdish question ``irreversible.''
	   ``We want do things like the Basques in Spain and the IRA in
Northern Ireland,'' he said in a statement read by his lawyers.
``We just want more autonomy and freedom.''
	   The Kurds were promised an independent homeland in the 1920
Treaty of Sevres, which carved up Turkey after the collapse of the
Ottoman Empire, but the international community abandoned the idea
in 1923. In Turkey, they are not recognized as an official
minority, which means, among other things, that the use of the
Kurdish language is banned in education and broadcasting.
	   The conflict in Turkey has killed an estimated 37,000 people.

Disrguntled customer remodels ATM kiosk after card swallowed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ After seeing an ATM swallow
his bank card, a disgruntled customer came back Wednesday and
turned the walk-up machine into a drive-through.
	   The 53-year-old man was arrested Wednesday after he rammed his
car through the glass doors of the ATM kiosk in Rosebank, a leafy
northern Johannesburg suburb, police said.
	   Police arrested the man who faces charges of malicious damage to
property, driving under the influence of alcohol, and reckless and
negligent driving, said police Inspector Mary Martins. The man's
name was not released.

Yugoslavia upsets defending champion Italy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Yugoslavia upset defending champion Italy 15-12,
15-13, 15-13 Wednesday, clinching a place in the semifinals of the
Men's World Volleyball Championships.
	   Brazil, the only other undefeated team in the second round, also
assured itself of a place in this weekend's semifinals with a
15-11, 7-15, 15-2, 15-10 victory over Argentina.
	   Tied with Russia at 5-1 in Group H with one match left, Italy
still could reach the semifinals by beating the Netherlands (4-2)
on Thursday. The Italians are seeking to become the first men's
team ever to win three consecutive world titles.
	   The Russians, behind in sets-won ratio, could advance only if
they beat Yugoslavia, the 1996 Olympic bronze medalist, and Italy
loses again. On Wednesday, they beat the Olympic champion
Netherlands 15-6, 15-12, 15-11.
	   Cuba, 5-1 in Group G, could advance by beating Argentina on
Thursday. The Cubans defeated Spain (4-2) 12-15, 15-4, 15-5, 7-15,
15-12 Wednesday.
	   Yugoslavia, which beat the Netherlands on Tuesday, overpowered
Italy in one hour, 53 minutes.
	   ``We may have won 3-0, but we mustn't forget how close Italy was
in every set. ... We were better than them in the important
moments,'' said Yugoslavian team head coach Zoran Gajic.
	   The other Group H teams _ the United States, Greece, China and
Ukraine _ were out of semifinal contention with 1-5 records.
	   On Wednesday, the United States, the bronze medalist of the 1994
world championships, defeated Greece 15-9, 15-11, 15-11, and China
defeated Ukraine 15-10, 10-15, 15-10, 16-14.
	   ``I am happy with this victory, but we didn't play consistent
enough. We have problems in maintaining our performance. Greece had
many problems that helped us,'' said American team head coach Doug
Beal.
	   In other Group G matches, Bulgaria (3-3) beat South Korea 11-15,
15-10, 15-8, 16-14, and Canada (3-3) defeated winless Japan 11-15,
15-8, 15-9, 15-9.
	   The men's championship started Nov. 13 with 24 teams, and 16
advanced to the current round, which lasts until Thursday. The
semifinals and finals will be played in Tokyo Saturday and Sunday.

	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukrainian police have detained two brothers
suspected of stabbing to death three people during a drunken brawl,
a newspaper reported Wednesday.
	   The bodies of the three victims, a 47-year-old woman and two men
aged 39 and 50, were found soon after the Nov. 18 slaying in the
southeastern town of Zaporizhia, Kievskiye Vedomosti quoted police
as saying.
	   Authorities detained the suspects _ an Afghan war veteran and
his brother, who already had served time in prison _ on Monday, the

<TEXT>
	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) _ Finns honored former President Mauno
Koivisto on his 75th birthday Wednesday for helping Finland cling
to its ties with the West despite fears of provoking its giant
neighbor Russia during the Cold War.
	   Finland's senior statesman is also credited with building
bridges between East and West during periods of deep mistrust
between the superpowers.
	   Koivisto led Finland from 1982 to 1994 and routinely met with
leaders from both sides of the former Iron Curtain.
	   In 1990, former U.S. President George Bush and Soviet leader
Mikhail Gorbachev asked Koivisto to arrange a summit in Helsinki to
discuss the Gulf crisis with one week's notice.
	   ``From the moment I met him, I saw that he was one of the best
minds working on evaluating the Soviet Union,'' Bush said in an
article published Wednesday in the Finnish Journal of Foreign
Affairs. ``His judgment proved to be right on target.''
	   Bush said he used a ``back channel relationship'' with Koivisto
to discuss East-West relations for many years.
	   In the same magazine, Gorbachev agreed that Koivisto had a
unique understanding of Russia.
	   ``He is fluent in Russian, and knows us better probably than any
other noteworthy politician in the West,'' Gorbachev wrote.
	   In his memoirs, Koivisto relates how Gorbachev approached him in
1990, a year before the Soviet collapse, asking for help because
``he was in great trouble.'' Koivisto promised to assist Gorbachev,
and passed on the Soviet leader's concern to Bush in a private
meeting.
	   Finland, which shares a 1,270-kilometer (790-mile) border with
Russia, fought two bitter wars against the Soviet Union from 1939
to 1944, and during the Cold War the Finns subjected their foreign
policy decisions for Moscow's tacit approval.
	   But during Koivisto's term, neutral Finland joined the Council
of Europe, the European Economic Area and applied for membership of
the European Union which it joined in 1995.
	   On Wednesday, President Martti Ahtisaari hosted a luncheon for
the former president and the government honored him with a special
reception.

Thailand's state enterprise workers protest IMF plan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ More than 100 demonstrators from state
enterprises greeted Parliament's opening Wednesday with a protest
against privatization plans required under the International
Monetary Fund's economic rescue package.
	   The protesters, representing 38 different state enterprises,
used loudspeakers and banners to denounce plans to turn state
enterprises into private companies and open up the country to
foreign investors. Thailand's state enterprises employ about
300,000 people.
	   ``IMF - World Bank - Go To Hell!'' said one banner. The IMF
organized a dlrs 17 billion bailout for Thailand's economy.
	   ``We are not for sale,'' said another.
	   In a written statement, the State Enterprises Workers' Relations
Confederation accused American financier George Soros, the IMF and
the World Bank of working together to bring down the country's
economy before forcing it open for exploitation.
	   ``The undeniable fact is that the attack on the baht by George
Soros and other foreign speculators, and then the agreement between
the Thai government and the IMF which happened without the people's
knowledge or agreement, have resulted in hundreds of thousands of
Thais losing their jobs,'' the statement said.
	   Soros has denied attacking the baht, which the government
allowed to float in July last year. It quickly sank in value,
making it difficult for many Thai companies to pay back dollar- and
yen-denominated loans.
	   Most economists attribute the country's economic difficulties to
structural problems and imprudent financial practices in both the
public and private sectors.
	   Speaking to reporters upon arriving at the Parliament, Deputy
Prime Minister Supachai Panichpakdi defended the country's
privatization plans, saying the move is part of a global trend.
	   ``We're not doing this because outsiders are ordering us to,''
he said. ``What we are doing is no different from other
countries.''
	   Thailand's immediate concern is to invest in businesses that
create lots of jobs, as unemployment has become a major problem for
the country, Supachai said.

Primakov: Emergency measures needed, but there's no emergency
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Emergency measures are needed to save Russia's
people from the ravages of the country's economic collapse, Prime
Minister Yevgeny Primakov said Wednesday.
	   Primakov said the 1999 budget would have to include the
unspecified measures to cushion the economic blows. A draft of the
long-awaited budget was delivered to the Cabinet later in the day.
	   However, Primakov, speaking at the Ministry of Emergency
Situations, went on to insist that the country was not in a state
of emergency. He said the economy had no problems that couldn't be
fixed with help from the state.
	   ``We can't go on waiting for the market environment to solve our
problems,'' the prime minister said, according to the Interfax news
agency. ``In such a difficult transition, development must progress
along a mechanism worked out in advance.''
	   Russia's economy, which had begun to grow last year for the
first time since the Soviet collapse, declined sharply this year
and then crashed in August, when the government devalued the ruble
and effectively defaulted on its foreign loans.
	   Primakov's remarks were consistent with his previous statements
regarding the role of government in steering the economy. The
extent of that role should become clearer Thursday, when Primakov
promised that the government would agree on the budget.
	   So far, Primakov's Cabinet has been unable to settle on a
budget, and was reportedly divided last week among three rival
versions of the plan. The Finance Ministry submitted a new plan
Wednesday that is intended to address all the Cabinet's concerns,
Interfax said.
	   The new budget will encompass the government's approach to
tackling the economic crisis. However, a private economic analyst
was quoted as saying the worst of the crisis had passed.
	   Speaking to an economic forum, Andrei Illarionov, director of
the private Institute of Economic Analysis, said the crisis reached
a peak in September and has eased since then under Primakov's
leadership, Interfax said. He noted that the ruble, which was
trading at about 18 to the U.S. dollar on Wednesday, had settled
into a relatively stable range of value.
	   Primakov's remarks about the country needing emergency measures
were presumably meant to offer support to the Emergency Situations
Ministry, which carries out relief missions throughout the country.
	   Primakov said a new federal rescue service should be established
in 2005, the ITAR-Tass news agency said. And he called on the
Emergency Situations Ministry to improve its civil defense
preparedness in light of the potential for regional conflicts in
Russia.
	   Also Wednesday, Deputy Finance Minister Mikhail Kasyanov was
quoted as saying that foreign investors had agreed to reschedule to
country's debt to the London Club of creditors. The two sides began
talks Monday in London.
	   The government is trying to persuade creditors to restructure a
portion of the Paris and London Club debts that it inherited from
the Soviet Union.
	   Kasyanov told Interfax that an agreement was reached with the
London Club under which Russia will start repaying its debt on Dec.
2.

ANKARA: pro-Islamic supporters.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   Yilmaz opponents secured more than 276 votes in the 550-seat
parliament _ enough to sink Turkey's fourth government since 1995.
	   Yilmaz has been accused of ties with organized crime and rigging
the privatization of a state-run bank by securing loans for a
businessman linked to a mafia boss. Yilmaz has denied any links to
criminal gangs.
	   In a separate vote, the state economy minister, Gunes Taner, was
bounced from office on similar abuse of power allegations.
	   The political scene was thrown wide open by the parliament
action.
	   No single political bloc is strong enough to form a new
governing coalition on its own. Secular-minded parties will likely
try to set aside their differences and cobble together a parliament
majority that can lead until early general elections in April.
	   But failure could open the way for a return of the Islamic
party, now called Virtue, which supports bringing stricter Muslim
codes and traditions to mostly Western-looking Turkey.
	   Although Virtue has the largest number of seats in parliament,
it faces direct opposition from Turkey's extremely powerful
military.
	   The nation's first government led by a pro-Islamic party fell
apart last year under pressure from the armed forces, which sees
itself as the guardians of Turkey's secular principles. The Welfare
party was then outlawed and forced to regroup under new leaders and
a new name.

<TEXT>
	   The political reshuffling comes at a delicate time.
	   Turkey is waging an uphill fight for the extradition of Kurdish
rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan, who is seeking political asylum in
Italy. The diplomatic effort and public protests have strained
Turkey's relationships with the European Union.
	   Delays in forming a new government could distract Turkish
leaders from their goal of bringing Ocalan to justice in Turkey or
as an alternative in Germany, which is seeking his arrest.
	   Nearly 37,000 people have been killed in the 14-year battle
between Turkish forces and Kurdish rebels seeking autonomy in
southeastern Turkey.
	   Parties have 45 days to present a new governing coalition. If
they fail, it will be up to the president to set up a caretaker
government to lead the country to elections.
	   But even following the normal rules poses complications in
Turkey's volatile political climate.
	   Traditionally, the job of forming a new government goes to the
head of parliament's largest party _ now Recai Kutan of the Virtue
Party.
	   President Suleyman Demirel, however, may seek to avoid a
confrontation with the military and pick someone from Turkey's
deeply divided secular parties.
	   The first signals of a rapprochement came Monday when Yilmaz and
his longtime rival, former Prime Minster Tansu Ciller, had their
parties spare each other from corruption probes in parliament.
	   Many believe that Bulent Ecevit, leader of the Democratic Left
Party, could be the glue between Yilmaz and Mrs. Ciller, whose
rivalry already brought down a government in 1996.

Pakistan gets IMF bailout package
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ The International Monetary Fund
agreed Wednesday to rescue Pakistan's shattered economy from
default, granting a dlrs 5.5 billion bailout package, finance
officials said.
	   Pakistan's economy has been reeling from international sanctions
that followed nuclear tests in May, and owed a whopping dlrs 32
billion to international creditors.
	   The biggest hurdle to the bailout package was removed earlier
this month when the United States agreed to support a one-time deal
for Pakistan despite sanctions imposed on both Pakistan and
neighboring India last May.
	   The United States imposed economic sanctions on Pakistan and its
rival India after the two neighbors conducted underground nuclear
tests in May. The embargo hit Pakistan especially hard, because it
relied heavily on foreign loans and had meager reserves of hard
currency needed to pay for imports.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton lifted some of the sanctions earlier
this month.
	   After announcing the policy reversal, Clinton assured Prime
Minister Nawaz Sharif in a letter that the administration would
exert its influence with international lenders ``to meet Pakistan's
economic difficulties,'' according to a foreign ministry statement
issued at the time.
	   The sanctions were aimed at punishing the two often hostile
neighbors, but India suffered only slightly.
	   The bailout package for Pakistan also comes with a number of
conditions, which include structural reform in its banking sector,
tax reform to increase its tax base and revenue as well as a
provision to try to reduce corruption.
	   The deal still requires final approval from the IMF board of
directors at a meeting in Washington next month, Pakistan's finance
ministry officials said at a news conference in the capital,
Islamabad.
	   It is expected that Pakistan will have to find additional
sources of revenue, although Finance Minister Ishaq Dar said the
agreement with the IMF does not call for higher income tax or
increased wealth tax.
	   The deal gives Pakistan dlrs 1.3 billion from the IMF, Asian
Development Bank and World Bank. The remainder of the money will be
used to restructure loans.

Afghanistan releases last of Iranian prisoners
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Afghanistan's Taliban militia on Wednesday
released the last Iranian prisoner it had been holding since
August, the official Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
	   Truck driver Manuchehr Amiri was handed over to an Iranian
Foreign Ministry official in Afghanistan and the two later left for
Iran, the agency said.
	   Iran says Afghanistan had been holding 70 Iranians, half of them
truck drivers.
	   The truck drivers were detained by Taliban forces after they
captured the northern Afghan city of Mazar-e-Sharif in August.
Taliban forces killed eight Iranian diplomats and a journalist
during the city's capture, which resulted in a straining of ties
between the two neighboring countries.
	   Iran deployed about 200,000 troops, backed by tanks and fighter
aircraft, on its Afghan border in September.
	   But the situation improved in early October after the
intervention of U.N. special envoy Lakhdar Brahimi, who shuttled
between Tehran and Kabul and secured the release of 26 of the
Iranians held captive in Afghanistan.
	   The first batch of five truck drivers were released in
September.
	   The truck drivers were in Afghanistan delivering humanitarian
goods, Iran says. But the Taliban claim they were smuggling weapons
to the Afghan opposition.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Emergency measures are needed to save Russia's
people from the ravages of the country's economic collapse, Prime
Minister Yevgeny Primakov said Wednesday.
	   Primakov said the 1999 budget would have to include the
unspecified measures to cushion the economic blows. A draft of the
long-awaited budget was delivered to the Cabinet later in the day.
	   However, Primakov, speaking at the Ministry of Emergency
Situations, went on to insist that the country was not in a state
of emergency. He said the economy had no problems that couldn't be
fixed with help from the state.
	   ``We can't go on waiting for the market environment to solve our
problems,'' the prime minister said, according to the Interfax news
agency. ``In such a difficult transition, development must progress
along a mechanism worked out in advance.''
	   Russia's economy, which had begun to grow last year for the
first time since the Soviet collapse, succumbed this year to the
global economic crisis that started in Asia. It crashed in August,
when the Russian government devalued the ruble and effectively
defaulted on its foreign loans.

	   CERKLJE, Slovenia (AP) _ NATO choppers flew overhead and Italian
doctors cared for the supposedly wounded Wednesday, as the first
NATO maneuvers to be held in this former Yugoslav country were in
full swing.
	   More than 5,500 troops from the eight member countries of the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization and 10 nations of the Alliance's
Partnership for Peace program are participating in the operation,
code-named Exercise Cooperative Adventure Exchange 1998.
	   The maneuvers are primarily intended to ``conduct peace support
operations _ this is not a war operation,'' said Gen. Maj. Vito
Carlucci, chief of staff of NATO Allied land forces southern
Europe.
	   Carlucci added that the mock-scenarios are based ``in real
incidents that happened in Bosnia-Herzegovina and Somalia,'' where
NATO troops have already been deployed.
	   He said the troops have been rehearsing different scenarios,
from the deployment of NATO troops in the fiction country where an
ethnic conflict ended with a cease-fire to the release of prisoners
from the detention camp. They also were trained to search for an
assassin who shot a political leader at the rally.
	   NATO has earlier rejected speculations that the exercise was
related to efforts to contain the conflict in Kosovo, Yugoslavia's
restive southern province, where the United States and its allies
are seeking to mediate talks for a peaceful solution.
	   The exercise consisted of mock-incidents such as a Lithuanian
field hospital, where doctors from Germany and Denmark practiced
treating wounded soldiers. Another example involved three trucks _
American, British and Danish _ that recovered a military tank that
went off on the road.
	   Slovenia, which declared independence from the former Yugoslav
federation in 1991, became a member of the Partnership for Peace
program in 1995 . The country of two million is also listed as a
contender in NATO's envisaged enlargement.
	   Up to 1,200 Slovene soldiers are participating in the exercise.
	   The exercise was closed to the public, but reporters were
invited to see the part of it on Wednesday.

EU seen approving BP-Amoco deal soon
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Brussels (AP) _ The world's largest industrial merger
_ British Petroleum Co. PLC's planned purchase of Amoco Corp. _
should get clearance by European Union regulators soon, the EU's
top antitrust watchdog said Wednesday.
	   ``It looks like we can indeed authorize the operation,'' EU
Competition Commissioner Karel Van Miert told reporters. He
declined to say if the EU would attach conditions to the approval.
	   An aide to Van Miert said the decision was likely mid-December.
	   BP agreed in August to pay dlrs 48 billion for Amoco Corp.,
creating the world's No. 3 oil giant in the biggest-ever foreign
takeover of an American company.
	   Lawyers following the case have said the merger is not likely to
trigger serious EU antitrust alarms.
	   The EU's executive body, the European Commission checks all
mergers with a major impact on EU markets and can demand changes or
veto those judged harmful to fair competition.

Kenyan women launch campaign against domestic abuse

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Betty Kavata's battered face contorted in
pain as she shouted gibberish from a hospital bed in a video
broadcast on Kenyan TV last week.
	   Brain damaged and paralyzed by a man her sister identified as
her battering husband, Kavata is one of many women abused by men
who claim a traditional right to discipline their wives.
	   With the motto ``Women's rights are human rights,'' the
Coalition on Violence Against Women on Wednesday launched a global
16-day campaign to eradicate gender-based violence.
	   It's an uphill struggle.
	   Wife-beating is common throughout Kenya, and sociologists and
criminologists say it has doubled in the past decade and is rising,
partly because of Kenya's worsening economic situation.
	   Largely to blame are Kenya's outdated and discriminatory laws,
said Hilda Mawanda, coalition administrator. Wife-beating and
marital rape are not crimes, but men can be charged with the lesser
crime of assault, the coalition said.
	   The coalition urged the government to discard laws that
discriminate against women, to make wife-beating illegal, and
guarantee women's complaints are properly investigated and
prosecuted.
	   ``Many forms of violence against women that manifest themselves
through customary law practices are legally sanctioned in the
supreme law of the land, the Constitution,'' said Ann Nyabera of
the Federation of Women Lawyers.
	   Kenyan law, for example, discriminates against women in the
areas of personal law, property, burial, inheritance, adoption and
marriage, and allows practices including child marriages, female
genital mutilation, polygamy and denying a widow inheritance, she
said.
	   If enacted, legal reforms also must be enforced, the coalition
said. Male-dominated police forces often refuse to intervene in
battery cases, saying they are private affairs, it said.
	   Data on abused women is frequently unavailable. Police don't log
domestic battery or rape separately from incidents outside the
home, making it difficult to track domestic violence.
	   In 1997, a survey of 260 people commissioned by FIDA found that
94 percent those questioned in Nairobi and all of those in rural
Kajiado said women in their community were beaten.
	   FIDA receives 50 new cases each week, 45 of which involve
domestic violence.
	   The majority of women don't come forward.
	   ``Most battered women today in Kenya are still living in that
code of silence,'' said Adelina Mwau, coalition chairwoman. ``Women
still define themselves in terms of a man. She's someone's
daughter, someone's wife, someone's sister.''
	   Lena Kadeha, 37, said she suffered for more than a decade with
her abusive husband. He called her a prostitute, broke her glasses
and pounded her eyes so that she wouldn't ``look at other men,''
and beat her for not ironing his clothes when the electricity was
out.
	   Finally, he beat her in front of her mother-in-law and the
small, soft-spoken nurse and mother of five told him ``no more.''
	   ``I realized no one can change my life but me,'' Kadeha said.
	   Betty Kavata didn't get out on time. Her husband, a police
officer, has been suspended from duty, but no charges have been
brought against him.
	   ``We have a long way to go,'' Mwau said.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in grafs 6 and 7 with comment from Lafontaine's
spokesman; edits &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Britain's largest-selling daily tabloid printed a
front-page attack Wednesday on German Finance Minister Oskar
Lafontaine for his push to harmonize Europe's economies and promote
the single currency.
	   Asking ``Is this the most dangerous man in Europe?,'' The Sun
filled its front page with a large picture of Lafontaine.
	   And just to make sure no one missed its message, it teased, ``We
spell it out for Germany on page 3,'' directing readers to a second
copy of the front page written in German.
	   The tabloid said it also was printing a special German-language
edition and would circulate it in Germany.
	   ``Most of us have never heard of this man,'' opined the tabloid,
which is owned by media baron Rupert Murdoch, a fierce opponent of
economic integration. ``His name is Oskar Lafontaine. And he is the
biggest threat to the British way of life that we have seen since
1945.''
	   At a press conference later in Berlin, Lafontaine's spokesman
Torsten Albig joked about the Sun's attack, noting that the tabloid
had once printed a similar cover calling Prime Minister Tony Blair
Britain's most dangerous man.
	   ``He doesn't mind being put in the same category as Tony
Blair,'' said Albig.
	   The Sun attacked the nine-page ``policy agenda'' signed this
weekend by finance ministers from 11 governments in the 15-nation
European Union.
	   The statement, which Lafontaine helped formulate, called for
stronger policy coordination, making growth and job-creation the
top economic priority. It also exhorted central banks to turn their
attention from fighting inflation to creating jobs.
	   The tabloid highlighted Lafontaine's support for tax
harmonization across the European Union_ which British Treasury
chief Gordon Brown has strongly rejected _ as a move to ``increase
your taxes.''
	   The newspaper also warned against plans to scrap the pound in
favor of the single European currency, the euro, which launches in
11 EU nations on Jan. 1.
	   Blair says he is prepared to join the euro when it is in
Britain's interest to do so, but has set no timetable.
	   ``The Sun is not anti-German,'' the tabloid declared. ``Neither
are we anti-European. ... We want a free and proud Britain with its
own currency and its own institutions working within a free
European market.''
	   ``Despite what they want you to think, the euro is not
inevitable,'' the tabloid said. ``All this claptrap is the
invention of politicians, not the people. The people of Europe
should rise up and resist this ridiculous charade.''
	   ``The people of Britain most definitely will,'' the newspaper
promised. ``Just you wait and see, Oskar.''

Congolese rebels acknowledge government-allied attacks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Zimbabwe confirming attacks on rebel targets,
grafs 3-4; Rwandan official says no damage, grafs 8-9.
 &UR; By HRVOJE HRANJSKI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) _ Congolese rebels on Wednesday acknowledged
for the first time that Zimbabwean warplanes bombed the eastern
shore of Lake Tanganyika in an apparent escalation of the
government's counteroffensive.
	   Congolese state radio said on Tuesday the government and its
allies hit an aircraft in Kalemie, a port 500 kilometers (310
miles) south of the rebel stronghold at Goma.
	   In a statement in the capital Harare, Zimbabwean government said
the operation marked the beginning of an allied offensive against
invading Rwandan and Ugandan troops.
	   ``The offensive is part of the overall objective to rid Congo of
foreign troops illegally occupying the country and thereby
restoring the territorial integrity of (Congo),'' it said.
	   The air raid followed a similar attack last week in which the
government claimed to have sunk six barges carrying 600 rebel
troops between Kalemie and Moba, the southernmost town under rebel
control. The rebels denied the report.
	   ``There was bombing of Kalemie. But I don't know what the target
was,'' rebel leader Ernest Wamba dia Wamba said from the northern
city of Kisangani. ``As far as I know, nothing happened and there
were no casualties.''
	   ``If they are using more precise aircraft, there is a ground for
us to be extra worried,'' Wamba said. ``We are waiting for them. We
are not going let them overrun us.''
	   In Kigali, a senior Rwandan official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, confirmed Zimbabwean planes had dropped bombs over
Kalemie at the weekend but caused no casualties.
	   He said the air raids would have little impact on the situation
on the ground, which he said favored the Rwandan-backed rebels.
	   In the past, rebel military commanders have dismissed the threat
of Zimbabwean air force, saying its planes were dropping bombs from
too high an attitude to hit precise targets. They said the
Zimbabweans were not flying low for fear of being hit by
surface-to-air missiles.
	   The rebels have no air strike capacity.
	   Analysts blame the rainy season, muddy roads and low clouds for
hampering air attacks and a lull in fighting in Congo, where the
rebels have overtaken the eastern half of the country since Aug. 2.
They claim to be pushing toward the diamond city of Mbuji-Mayi,
copper-rich southern Katanga Province, and Equatoria in northern
Congo.
	   The rebels are backed by neighboring Rwanda and Uganda, which
accuse President Laurent Kabila of failing to rid the common border
of the insurgents fighting their governments.
	   So far, the government _ backed by troops, tanks and planes from
Zimbabwe, Angola, Namibia and Chad _ have had little success in
halting rebel advances.
	   Last week, Zimbabwe sent 1,500 military police to eastern Congo,
apparently to restore discipline and cut desertion among its 8,000
troops.
	   Also, Wamba dismissed as ``imprecise'' accusations by the
Amnesty International that the rebels were responsible for
killings, rape and disappearances of civilians in eastern Congo.
	   He said his Congolese Democratic Coalition had previously
admitted to killing several hundred people sheltering in a southern
church August, the most serious accusation brought by the human
rights group.
	   ``We have nothing to hide. We recognize there was a massacre. We
are conducting an inquiry. We have not come up with a conclusion
yet,'' he said.
	   Amnesty accused Kabila's forces of a string of anti-Tutsi
killings in Katanga and the capital, Kinshasa.

EU approves dlrs 1.7 million in aid for Bulgaria

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Union on Wednesday
approved 1.5 million European currency units (dlrs 1.7 million) in
humanitarian aid for Bulgaria to help the needy through the winter.
	   In a statement, the EU's humanitarian office said the money
would ``help those hardest hit by stringent economic reform
measures.''
	   The funds will help provide food and medicine to individuals as

will also contribute to the running of soup kitchens in 15 regions
throughout Bulgaria.
	   The EU will be channel the funds through humanitarian
organizations over the next nine months.
	   Bulgaria is one of 10 former-communist nations in eastern Europe
lobbying to join the EU membership next decade.

Britain's highest court rules Pinochet has no immunity from arrest
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with demonstrators' reaction, Human Rights Watch
quote, breakdown of judges' vote &QL; 
 &UR; By MAUREEN JOHNSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Britain's highest court ruled Wednesday that Gen.
Augusto Pinochet does not have immunity from arrest, meaning the
former Chilean dictator must remain under police guard while Spain
seeks his extradition on charges of murder, torture and genocide.
	   The 3-2 majority decision by a five-judge tribunal of the House
of Lords, delivered on Pinochet's 83rd birthday, overturned a High
Court ruling that Pinochet's arrest was illegal because he had
immunity under English law for actions taken as a foreign former
head of state.
	   The Spanish government and Spanish and British prosecutors had
appealed the Oct. 28 High Court judgment.
	   A Chilean government report says some 3,000 people were murdered
or disappeared during Pinochet's 1973-90 rule after he overthrew
Salvador Allende, an elected Marxist.
	   Crowds of demonstrators outside Parliament, many of them victims
and relatives of people who disappeared during the Pinochet regime,
whooped, cheered and waved flags and placards after hearing
Wednesday's ruling.
	   ``This is a great day of victory for Pinochet's thousands of
victims,'' said Reedy Brody of the New York-based group Human
Rights Watch.
	   Pinochet now must appear before Bow Street Magistrates' Court in
London on Dec. 2, the deadline by which Home Secretary Jack Straw
must decide whether extradition proceedings can go ahead.
	   Pinochet's best hope is that Straw will block the Spanish
extradition proceedings, which would mean that extradition requests
lodged by Switzerland, France and other countries also would likely
fall away.
	   If Straw gives the go-ahead, Pinochet faces a long battle
through the British courts against extradition.
	   The senior judge on the House of Lords tribunal, Lord Justice
Gordon Slynn, voted to uphold the High Court ruling, along with his
colleague, Lord Justice Anthony Lloyd.
	   But Lord Justices Donald Nicholls, Leonard Hoffman and Johan
Steyn all said the general should not be granted the cloak of
immunity.
	   Key issues in the appeal were whether international law and
custom _ including trials of Rwanda Hutus and Bosnian Serbs for
genocide and war crimes, and Britain's 1988 adoption of a U.N.
Convention on Torture _ override this country's sweeping State
Immunity Act passed in 1978.
	   Prosecutors' lawyers argued that Pinochet's alleged crimes were
beyond immunity.
	   Pinochet supporters looked stunned at the judgment, which
delighted international human rights organizations and many
Chileans both at home and in exile.
	   The general and his wife, Lucia, heard the news _ broadcast live
on British television _ in his room at the Grovelands Priory, the
north London hospital where he had remained under police guard
awaiting news of his fate.
	   Pinochet underwent back surgery Oct. 9 during a regular visit to
Britain and was arrested Oct. 16 in his bed at another hospital.

FIFA boss to get S.Africa's highest award
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ President Nelson Mandela on
Thursday planned to present the head of soccer's world governing
body FIFA with its highest honary award for foreigners, a
presidential spokeswoman said Wednesday.
	   Joseph S. Blatter will receive the Order of Good Hope at
Mandela's private home in Houghton, a plush suburb of the country's
biggest city, Johannesburg, said Priscilla Naidoo.
	   South Africa is keen to host the 2006 soccer World Cup and
Blatter is on record supporting the bid _ provided facilities are
up to par.
	   After losing out on a bid for the 2004 Olympics, South Africa
wants to host the largest sporting event in the world and further
mark an end to apartheid times when the country was barred from
international competition.
	   South Africa has already held the 1995 rugby World Cup, 1996
Africa Cup of Nations and 1998 athletics World Cup.

Russia finds way to feed guard units _ issue hunting licenses
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia can't afford to feed meat to its military
conscripts, so it's fallen back on the next best thing: hunting
licenses.
	   Border guards in the northern district of Karelia have been
granted 120 free hunting licenses that will allow them to hunt elk
for food this winter, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported Wednesday.
	   The report noted that the same ploy was used with border guards
in Russia's Far East last winter, and they were able to stock up on
plenty of meat.
	   In Karelia, special brigades of up to 12 border are being formed
to go on hunting expeditions. The guards are supposed to use
hunting rifles, not their military weapons, authorities said.
	   The report also said guards in Russia's Arctic regions are using
snares to catch hares and partridges. It said the servicemen have
not received meat, fish or butter in their regular military diets
for the past three months.
	   The head of the Arctic border guard department, Maj. Gen.
Anatoly Koretsky, said special groups had been formed in all border
guard units to fish and to forage for mushrooms and berries.

 &UR; Spain respects House of Lords ruling against Pinochet

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar said
Wednesday Spain will respect the ruling by British judges upholding
Augusto Pinochet's arrest in London for possible extradition to
Spain on charges of genocide.
	   Aznar said his government, which opposed the human rights probe
that led to Pinochet's arrest in London, would nonetheless show
``common sense and of course, strict observance of judicial
independence.''

Italian Communist party reveals it brought Kurdish rebel leader to

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Italy's hard-line Communist party revealed Wednesday
that it was responsible for bringing Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah
Ocalan to Italy to seek political asylum, a venture that has
provoked a bitter standoff with Turkey and put the Kurdish question
on the front burner throughout Europe.
	   Ramon Mantovani, who is in charge of foreign affairs for the
Communist Refoundation Party, went to Moscow and brought Ocalan
back to Rome on Nov. 12, party spokeswoman Ritanna Armeni said
Wednesday.
	   Mantovani planned a news conference later in the day.
	   Ocalan was arrested when he arrived in Rome, using a false
passport, and detained for a week. Turkey has been stridently
demanding his extradition, but an Italian court freed Ocalan,
ruling that Italian law forbids extraditing suspects to a country
where they face the death penalty. The ruling further enraged
Turkey.
	   Refoundation's stunning revelation comes after numerous reports
_ denied by the government _ that Ocalan had a secret deal paving
his way to Italy.
	   Refoundation is part of the opposition, but its role in the
Ocalan affair still has the potential to embarrass the new
center-left government. The government is headed by a former
Communist and its justice minister belongs to a Communist party
which only recently broke away from Refoundation.
	   The head of the breakaway faction asked the government Wednesday
to grant Ocalan asylum. The leader of Premier Massimo D'Alema's
party has also spoken out in favor of asylum.
	   Ocalan leads the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, which has been
waging a war for Kurdish autonomy in southeastern Turkey for 14
years. Turkey considers him a terrorist and its most-wanted
fugitive. Ocalan is being tried in absentia in Turkey for capital
crimes.

	   SOWETO, South Africa (AP) _Three men robbed the president of the
West Indies Cricket Board, his wife and a journalist of their car,
money and jewelry at gunpoint Wednesday.
	   Cricket Board President Pat Rousseau said he, his wife Hester
and Jamaican journalist Tony Becca were forced to lay on the ground
while they were returning to their car after visiting a cricket
development project in Soweto, a sprawling black township south of
Johannesburg.
	   The robbers took their watches and Hester's purse, then left in
a car the visitors had borrowed from a South African cricket board
official, Rousseau said.
	   No one was hurt in the mid-day robbery.
	   Police Inspector John Shiburi said police were investigating.
	   A five-series test between the West Indies and South Africa
begins Thursday in Johannesburg.
	   In February, two visiting Pakistani cricket players, paceman
Mohammad Akram and off spinner Saqlain Mushtaq, said three black
men mugged them outside their posh hotel.
	   Amid reports the players were really injured in a brawl at a
strippers bar, the two players refused to give sworn statements to
police.

	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Millions of Indians voted Wednesday in
provincial elections that could cast shadows on the fortunes of
Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee's wobbly coalition.
	   The ballot count begins Saturday, but an exit poll forecast a
sweeping victory for the Congress Party, led by Sonia Gandhi, in
the state of New Delhi, which would dislodge the state government
of the right-wing Bharatiya Janata Party.
	   The exit poll, conducted by the private Center for Media Studies
and broadcast on STAR television, covered 1,500 voters.
	   Exit polls also predicted Congress would oust the BJP from the
state government of Rajasthan, but could lose in the central state
of Madhya Pradesh. In Mizoram, a remote northeastern state removed
from national politics, Congress was likely to lose to regional
parties.
	   Polls closed Wednesday after 10 hours of voting. Counting begins
Saturday and results will be released as they come in, but final
results will not be known until Sunday.
	   Two people were killed and 16 wounded in a gunfight between
political rivals in a rural area of Madhya Pradesh in central
India, Press Trust of India reported. Barring the fatal clash,
voting was largely peaceful.
	   Nearly 55 percent of more than 80 million electorates were
estimated to have voted in four of India's 26 states where
elections were held Wednesday, said the Election Commission in New
Delhi. The states were the northern New Delhi state, site of the
capital; Rajasthan in India's western desert; the central state of
Madhya Pradesh; and the tiny northeastern state of Mizoram.
	   Pre-election surveys predicted gains by the Congress Party over
the Hindu nationalist BJP due to discontent with soaring vegetable
prices. The BJP, which also heads the federal government, governs
two of the four states, and Congress rules two.
	   Other violence was reported in Madhya Pradesh where a Congress
Party candidate, Hari Singh Narvaria, was arrested after firing
gunshots in the air apparently to scare away his opponents, United
News of India news agency said. Leftist extremists were blamed for
looting a polling station.

	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Turkey's government collapsed Wednesday
after losing a confidence vote in parliament over a corruption
scandal that tainted the prime minister with allegations of mob
ties.
	   The downfall of Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz and his nearly
17-month-old government could push Turkey toward another crisis
between Western-oriented forces and pro-Islamic supporters that
anger Turkey's powerful military.
	   Lawmakers were left with a difficult choice: trying to set aside
feuds and build a coalition of secular parties or accept an
alliance with the Islamic party, now known as Virtue.
	   A senior Virtue official, Nevzat Yalcintas, insisted the party
``must lead'' the next government.
	   Yilmaz opponents carried a convincing 314-214 margin in the
550-seat parliament _ well beyond the threshold needed to sink
Turkey's fourth government since 1995.
	   Yilmaz has been accused of ties with organized crime and rigging
the privatization of a state-run bank by securing loans for a
businessman linked to a mafia boss. Yilmaz has denied any links to
criminal gangs.
	   ``I believe that it will be the people who will very soon make
the real judgment about our government,'' Yilmaz told parliament.
	   In a separate vote, the state economy minister, Gunes Taner, was
bounced from office on similar abuse of power allegations.
	   The political scene was thrown wide open by the parliament
action.
	   No single political bloc is strong enough to form a new
governing coalition on its own. Secular-minded parties will likely
try to set aside their differences and cobble together a parliament
majority that can lead until early general elections in April.
	   But failure could open the way for a return of the Islamic
party, which supports bringing stricter Muslim codes and traditions
to mostly Western-looking Turkey.
	   Although Virtue has the largest number of seats in parliament,
it faces direct opposition from Turkey's extremely powerful
military.
	   The nation's first government led by a pro-Islamic party fell
apart last year under pressure from the armed forces, which sees
itself as the guardians of Turkey's secular principles. The Welfare
party was then outlawed and forced to regroup under new leaders and
a new name.
	   The latest political reshuffling comes at a delicate time.
	   Turkey is waging an uphill fight for the extradition of Kurdish
rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan, who is seeking political asylum in
Italy. The diplomatic effort and public protests have strained
Turkey's relationships with the European Union.
	   Delays in forming a new government could distract Turkish
leaders from their goal of bringing Ocalan to justice in Turkey or
as an alternative in Germany, which is seeking his arrest.
	   Nearly 37,000 people have been killed in the 14-year battle
between Turkish forces and Kurdish rebels seeking autonomy in
southeastern Turkey.
	   Parties have 45 days to present a new governing coalition. If
they fail, it will be up to the president to set up a caretaker
government to lead the country to elections.
	   But even following the normal rules poses complications in
Turkey's volatile political climate.
	   Traditionally, the job of forming a new government goes to the
head of parliament's largest party _ now Recai Kutan of the Virtue
Party.
	   President Suleyman Demirel, however, may seek to avoid a
confrontation with the military and pick someone from Turkey's
deeply divided secular parties.
	   The first signals of a possible deal to exclude Virtue came
Monday when Yilmaz and his longtime rival, former Prime Minster
Tansu Ciller, had their parties spare each other from corruption
probes in parliament.
	   Many believe that Bulent Ecevit, leader of the Democratic Left
Party, could be the glue between Yilmaz and Mrs. Ciller, whose
rivalry already brought down a government in 1996.

Chinese president arrives in Japan to seek closer ties

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ In the first visit by a Chinese head of state to
Japan since World War II, President Jiang Zemin arrived Wednesday
for a trip billed as the start of a new partnership between the
once estranged Asian powers.
	   A cornerstone of that relationship will be increased economic
cooperation, made more urgent by the region's severe financial
crisis.
	   Japan is Asia's top source of aid and investment; China needs
all the help it can get to fend off the crisis and develop its vast
economy.
	   But memories of the war will also figure high on the agenda of
Jiang and his Japanese host, Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi. Beijing
has made it clear that it expects an unequivocal expression of
remorse from Tokyo for the murder and carnage by Japanese troops
that invaded China in the 1930s.
	   ``It's important to seriously review the history of the
relations of China and Japan in order to advance future friendship
and cooperation,'' Jiang said after arriving in Tokyo Wednesday
night.
	   Jiang later attended a welcome dinner with Obuchi and other
Japanese leaders. His formal meetings here begin Thursday, when he
is to confer with the Japanese prime minister.
	   Japanese news reports said the two sides agreed beforehand that
Obuchi would offer a spoken apology during the meeting and an
expression of Japanese regret would be included in a joint
statement afterward.
	   China has sought a clearly worded expression of remorse since
last month, when Obuchi offered visiting South Korean President Kim
Dae-jung Japan's fullest apology yet for its 1910-1945 colonial
rule over the Korean Peninsula.
	   Another major issue is Taiwan.
	   Jiang came from a trip to Russia, where he obtained promises
that Moscow would not undermine China's claim to Taiwan and not
sell weapons to the island, which Beijing considers a renegade
province.
	   Japan does not sell weapons abroad, but Taiwan is watching
nervously to see whether Jiang will extract Tokyo's promises not to
otherwise support the island, whose government enjoys some backing
from conservative Japanese politicians.
	   The Chinese are also eager to see Japan promise that recently
updated defense cooperation guidelines with the United States do
not require Tokyo to join any U.S. military actions around Taiwan.
	   But settling those differences could pave the way for the main
thrust of Japan-China relations in the coming decades: the economy.
	   Even with political strains, economic ties between the two
countries have been blossoming. China is Japan's second-largest
trading partner and Japan is China's largest, with annual trade
volume of more than dlrs 60 billion.
	   The Asian malaise has made those ties all the more important.
Though China so far has avoided the meltdown that has afflicted
neighbors in South Korea, Thailand and Indonesia, its economy faces
major problems. State-run industries are deep in trouble, finance
companies struggle with massive bad loans and unemployment is on
the rise.
	   This comes at a time when Japan's aid is expected to drop and
Japanese banks have cut back on lending to Asia as Tokyo grapples
with its own recession-bound economy.
	   ``China has to maintain a certain level of economic growth,''
said Satoshi Amako, political scientist at Aoyama Gakuin University
in Tokyo. ``To do that, it needs to encourage investment from
overseas, including Japan.''
	   For Japan, a stronger Chinese economy and closer ties to Beijing
can anchor stability in a region where North Korea is still a wild
card and Southeast Asia is caught in financial and political
turmoil.
	   ``We want the visit to be the beginning of the establishment of
a stable relationship between Japan and China toward the 21st
century so we can cooperate in vital international issues,''
Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiromu Nonaka said Wednesday
before Jiang's arrival.
	   Still, signs of lingering divisions remain.
	   Japanese right-wing groups, which claim the Imperial Army's
thrust into Asia during the war was actually meant to help Asians
by ending white colonialism, planned to demonstrate during Jiang's
visit in protest of his calls for an apology.
	   China also faces criticism of its human rights record. A former
Japanese lawmaker and other supporters of Tibetan autonomy
scheduled a dinner Thursday.
	   The London-based Amnesty International also held a rally after
Jiang's arrival to push for more human rights protections and an
end to capital punishment in China.

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Britain's highest court ruled Wednesday that Gen.
Augusto Pinochet does not have immunity from arrest, meaning the
former Chilean dictator must remain under police guard while Spain
seeks his extradition on charges of murder, torture and genocide.
	   The 3-2 majority decision by a five-judge tribunal of the House
of Lords overturned a High Court ruling that Pinochet's arrest was
illegal because he had immunity under English law for actions taken
as a foreign former head of state.
	   It was delivered on Pinochet's 83rd birthday.
	   A Chilean government report says some 3,000 people were murdered
or disappeared during Pinochet's 1973-90 rule after he overthrew
Salvador Allende, an elected Marxist.
	   The Spanish government and Spanish and British prosecutors had
appealed the Oct. 28 High Court judgment awarding him immunity.
	   Crowds of demonstrators outside Parliament, many of them victims
and relatives of people who disappeared during Pinochet's regime,
whooped, cheered and waved flags and placards after hearing
Wednesday's ruling.
	   ``I think it's a victory over every murderer in the world,''
said George Madaraga, a former solider in the Chilean army who had
tears streaming down his face. ``It's a human victory, not a
political victory. Every torturer should be brought to justice.''

Serbia offers talks, rejects broad autonomy for Kosovo

 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES throughout with quotes from Serb
negotiator, ethnic Albanian leader

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serbia's top negotiator for Kosovo
warned Sunday that any solution resembling independence for the
province would trigger a war, within and beyond the province.
	   Speaking in the provincial capital, Serbian Vice Premier Ratko
Markovic said giving Kosovo status as a separate republic ``would
not only be against the constitution, but also a tragic political
act leading inevitably to a military conflict, not only within
Serbia but also among countries bordering Kosovo.''
	   Kosovo is a province of Serbia, the dominant republic in
Yugoslavia, which also includes Montenegro.
	   Markovic, the appointed head of Serbia's negotiating team for
Kosovo, arrived in Pristina Wednesday with President Milan
Milutinovic for talks with the pro-independence ethnic Albanians _
who refused for the 18th time to attend.
	   The attempt comes a week after Serb authorities rejected a
U.S.-drafted peace plan for Kosovo, countering it with their own
plan.
	   The U.S. plan loosens Kosovo's ties with Serbia's central
authorities, but keeps the province formally within the republic
and Yugoslavia, which consists of Serbia and Montenegro.
	   ``There is no solution for Kosovo if the area is excluded from
Serbian authorities,'' said Markovic.
	   The Serb plan keeps Kosovo firmly within Serbia, but grants the
province self-rule. Ethnic Albanian politicians have already
dismissed this version.
	   ``It's not a serious, but a propaganda proposal for dialogue,''
said ethnic Albanian activist Gjergj Dedaj, about the Serb-proposed
plan. ``They want to show alleged readiness for talks with the
Albanians side,''
	   Most of Kosovo's ethnic Albanian majority want independence from
Serbia, but Serbs consider Kosovo the cradle of their statehood and
are unwilling to let it go. The province has been in turmoil since
Serbs launched a crackdown last February to crush an armed
rebellion. The clashes claimed hundreds of lives and forced some
300,000 people to leave their homes.
	   Kosovo Albanian political leaders, headed by Ibrahim Rugova, has
said giving Kosovo rights equal to Serbia and Montenegro would be
acceptable. Still, they refuse to meet face-to-face with Serb
officials.
	   A key factor in the crisis is Kosovo Liberation Army, a
guerrilla force fighting for full independence and threatening to
undermine any deal that they don't agree to.
	   Adem Demaci, a human rights activist who became spokesman for
the KLA, said they might, however, support the U.S. plan although
it falls short of their demand for independence.
	   So far Serbia has refused to meet representatives of the KLA,
which it considers ``terrorists,'' inviting only Rugova to the
talks.
	   Earlier this week, Milutinovic condemned the KLA's continuing
``terrorist acts'' and declared that its attacks on ``innocent
citizens, police and soldiers'' must be stopped.
	   An Oct. 12 agreement mediated by U.S. envoys led to an end of
hostilities in Kosovo and the withdrawal of many of the government
forces. But sporadic violence continues, with each side accusing
the other of starting it.
	   Serb sources in Pristina said Wednesday the KLA had carried out
176 attacks in the past month, killing five policemen and four
civilians and wounding many others. The official Serb information
could not be independently confirmed.
	   Demaci warned Tuesday that the rebels were preparing for more
fighting in spring if peaceful solution is not found.

Forum on rival claims to Spratly Islands planned in Jakarta
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ An annual forum on the disputed
Spratly Islands in the South China Sea will be held next week in
Jakarta, Indonesia's Foreign Office announced Wednesday.
	   Indonesia, which is not among the claimants, has sponsored the
forum since 1990 to help find a peaceful settlement on overlapping
claims to the islands.
	   Participants in the Dec. 1-3 workshop include government
officials, experts and academicians, all attending in their
personal capacities.
	   They come from Brunei, China, Taiwan, Malaysia, the Philippines,
Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, Singapore and host Indonesia.
	   The first six have claims to the Spratlys, a group of 33 mostly
barren atolls that are believed to harbor large deposits of gas,
oil and minerals. They also sit astride major sea lanes.
	   Foreign Minister Ali Alatas is scheduled to open the workshop,
also sponsored by the Canadian International Development Agency.

Hoechst confirms merger talks with French firm Rhone-Poulenc
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ German pharmaceutical and chemical
company Hoechst AG confirmed Wednesday that it is in merger talks
with France's Rhone-Poulenc to create the world's biggest
pharmaceutical firm.
	   Hoechst cautioned that ``no guarantee can be made as to the
outcome of the current discussions.''
	   Industry sources said it's likely that Hoechst and Rhone-Poulenc
will make an announcement early next week.
	   The merged firm would be worth some 80 billion marks (dlrs 50
billion), and sales in its pharmaceutical sector would outstrip
market leader Glaxo Wellcome's. Hoechst's annual sales are
estimated at about 22 billion (dlrs 13.75 billion) marks, with
Rhone-Poulenc at 17.5 billion (dlrs 11 billion).
	   Analyst said the merger would improve the companies' market
share, while enabling the combined firm to save hundreds of
millions of marks a year in the pharmaceutical sector by fusing
areas where they overlap, including cancer and allergy treatments.
	   The two companies together employ 180,000 people. The
pharmaceutical company would be based in Frankfurt and headed by
Richard Markham, currently chief executive of Hoechst's
pharmaceutical division Hoechst Marion Roussel. The joint company's
agrochemical activities would be based in Lyon, France, and headed
by Alain Godard, the current chairman of Rhone-Poulenc's plant and
animal health division.
	   Sources familiar with the talks also said that Hoechst would
have to get the go-ahead from German pharmaceutical maker Schering,
with which it shares a pesticide joint venture.

	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The Spanish government agreed Wednesday to
respect a British ruling upholding Augusto Pinochet's possible
extradition to Spain on charges of genocide, the prime minister
said.

Schroeder holds first cabinet meeting in Berlin

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Cabinet agreement on youth jobs program &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and his ministers
agreed Wednesday to launch a 2 billion mark (dlrs 1.25 billion)
program for easing youth unemployment.
	   Fighting joblessness, stubbornly stuck at over 10 percent, was a
key campaign pledge by Schroeder, whose Cabinet gathered for its
first meeting in Berlin in advance of the government return next
year from Bonn to its prewar capital.
	   With a goal of finding jobs for 65,000 unemployed youths and
training positions for 35,000, the new program will devote almost
half its funding to young people in the former communist east.
Unemployment in the east is almost twice as severe as in the west,
and Schroeder promised eastern state leaders Tuesday night to make
improving the economy there a top priority.
	   The Cabinet met Wednesday morning in a former communist East
German government building. The stately red brick-and-glass
structure will be Schroeder's temporary chancellery until his new
one, near the refurbished Reichstag parliament building that once
abutted the Berlin Wall, is completed in October 2000.
	   So keen is Schroeder to start work in Berlin that he sped up his
move to April from the fall. His cabinet meeting Wednesday came
just two days after President Roman Herzog's staff moved into its
new Berlin offices, signaling the start of the government
relocation.
	   Still, Schroeder's verve to get down to business has not stopped
critics who say his political goals lack direction. In office for
less than a month, Schroeder's government has wavered on tax
reforms and drawn concerns that it is backing off pro-market
campaign promises and hewing to the left with plans to bolster
social programs.
	   After announcing new taxes in his inaugural address, Schroeder
soon withdrew them for fear of hampering the creation of low-wage
jobs. His decision won praise from industry but complaints from the
opposition Christian Democrats, ousted from 16 years in government
by Schroeder and the Social Democrats in September.
	   Such political wriggling could signal growing pains as Schroeder
and Oskar Lafontaine, finance minister and Social Democrat party
chief, adjust from being state leaders to running the nation. And
it could take a while for the two to get comfortable, according to
Helmut Schmidt, the previous Social Democrat chancellor.
	   ``They need a couple of years for sure,'' Schmidt said Tuesday
at a reception launching his latest book on politics.

On Belgium visit, Kabila faces criticism over fighting, human

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Kabila setting April elections; TRIMS previous &QL; 
 &UR; By ANNA SATHIAH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - Congolese President Laurent Kabila's
first official visit to Belgium attracted a flurry of criticism
Wednesday over his refusal to negotiate with rebels and alleged
role in human rights violations.
	   Kabila faced demands from the European Union that he negotiate
with the rebels waging a four-month insurgency.
	   ``This allows me to ... encourage him to change his policy and
look for a political instead of a military solution, because there
is no military solution for Congo,'' said Aldo Ajello, the EU's
special envoy to central Africa.
	   Conceicao Van Dunem, the EU's spokeswoman on African affairs,
hinted EU aid could depend on solution to the conflict. ``There is
no development without peace, and no peace without
reconciliation,'' she told reporters Tuesday.
	   At a dinner Tuesday with Belgian politicians, Kabila said he
will allow political parties again starting in January and
announced elections for April. ``As of January, the freedom of
political parties will be proclaimed ... and the (April) ballot
results will be respected,'' he said.
	   Kabila has previously announced elections for next year but
specified a a date or a month.
	   Kabila has refused direct talks with rebels in his country
demanding instead that Rwanda and Uganda end their support for the
insurgents. He rejected negotiations again Tuesday on the first leg
of his European tour in Rome.
	   ``There are no rebels in our country,'' he told Associated Press
Television News. ``There are puppets used by the invaders of our
country.''
	   Human rights abuses under the late President Mobutu Sese Seko
led the EU to suspend all aid but emergency humanitarian supplies
in 1992, when the country was known as Zaire. Aid has not been
resumed.
	   European officials are anxious to resolve the Congolese conflict
fearing it could escalate into a wider regional war. Already the
fighting has dragged in troops from Namibia, Zimbabwe, Chad and
Angola to support Kabila while Rwanda and Uganda back the rebels.
	   Kabila arrived late Tuesday for a three-day stay in Belgium that
includes meetings with Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene, King Albert
II as well as the EU officials.
	   The visit is Kabila's first to Congo's former colonial ruler
since he toppled Mobutu to take power in 1997. His trip has sparked
protests from human rights organizations and alleged victims of
rights abuse.
	   Lawyers representing members of Congo's Tutsi minority and an
opposition political group have filed law suits against Kabila in
Belgian courts accusing him of inciting ethnic hatred against
Tutsis and other violations of international law.
	   But lawyers acknowledged that, as a serving head of state,
Kabila can claim diplomatic immunity.
	   On Monday, Amnesty International released a report on Congo
highlighting atrocities by government and opposition forces.
	   It cited widespread human rights abuses by the rebels including
killings, torture and rape, but said Kabila's forces also massacred
civilians suspected of sympathizing with the opposition.
	   Fearing protests from opposition supporters among Belgium's
12,000-strong Congolese community, the Congolese embassy in
Brussels has demanded enforced security during the visit. ``We
don't want him to be thrown into danger,'' Charge d'Affaires Emile
Kanengele told RTL-TVI television.

BT, AT and T alliance faces in-depth EU probe
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ European Union regulators will launch a
four-month in-depth probe into the dlrs 10 billion alliance between
British Telecommunications PLC and AT and T, the EU's top antitrust
official said Wednesday.
	   In a news conference, EU Competition Commissioner Karel Van
Miert confirmed comments by EU officials that the venture would
face further scrutiny following the conclusion next week of an
initial four-week inquiry.
	   ``The deal has to be looked at in its global context,'' Van
Miert said. ``Both companies have different partners in different
countries. We will be able to look at all this in a four-month
investigation.''
	   BT, the biggest British telephone company and AT and T, the
largest U.S. carrier, announced in July they will combine their
international telephone operations and create a new Internet system
to put them ``at the forefront of the global information age.''
	   The deal also needs approval from regulators in the United
States and Britain.

OPEC meets amid low expectations of an agreement to lift prices
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria, (AP) _ Ministers from the Organization of the
Petroleum Exporting Countries headed into a difficult meeting
Wednesday, as oil prices floundered around 12-year lows on world
markets.
	   Despite some voices in favor of cutting production _ Kuwait and
Algeria foremost among them _ most believe heavyweight Saudi
Arabia's fear of losing market share to overproducers in the group
may immobilize the organization.
	   ``It's a mess, as ever,'' said Leo Drollas, chief economist at
London's Global Center for Energy Studies.
	   This time though, OPEC, known for its disagreements, is facing
an especially tricky situation.
	   Its average price per barrel of crude oil has crashed dlrs 8.22
from dlrs 18.81 last November to dlrs 10.59, according to the last
available average price.
	   In London, Brent crude oil for delivery in January was trading
at noon at dlrs 11.35 a barrel, up from Tuesday's 15-year low of
dlrs 11.19.
	   Analysts say that price could hit new lows Wednesday, pushed
down by signs OPEC is largely immobilized by disagreement.
	   A badly judged decision to boost production last winter fed into
Asia's economic collapse, resulting in an oil glut worldwide.
	   Government revenue in most OPEC countries has taken a hit.
Kuwait says its 1998 oil revenue will sink by 45 percent.
	   Reflecting the sense of crisis, Algeria's oil minister Youcef
Yousfi has called for an exceptional meeting of heads of state of
OPEC's 11 members, saying the ``price crisis'' must be addressed at
the very top.
	   It would be OPEC's first heads of state meeting since 1975.
	   The year-end meeting in Vienna is expected to begin late
Wednesday, delayed by Yousfi's eleventh-hour stomp through four
Gulf nations to drum up support for action to boost prices.
	   Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas said in Jakarta late
Tuesday Indonesia supported a meeting. The United Arab Emirates
have also voiced support for the meeting.
	   The OPEC ministers are likely to discuss the suggestion of a
heads of state gathering Wednesday or Thursday, but it's unclear
how wide support is.
	   Suggestions so far on how to lift prices have focused on cutting
production further or extending current cuts, introduced in June to
soak up the oil glut pushing down prices.
	   Algeria, Kuwait and Libya all want further cuts to the 2.6
million barrel-a-day June production cut. The cut didn't work,
largely because demand is too low and some countries are
overproducing.
	   Saudi Arabia, OPEC's biggest producer at 8 million barrels a
day, is apparently unwilling to contemplate fresh cuts unless the
June round is adhered to, worried at losing market share to
overproducers.
	   Further depressing the market, Iraq's food-for-oil deal with the
United Nations rolled over Wednesday for another six months,
meaning around 1.8 million barrels of oil a day are reaching the
world market from Iraq, keeping world supplies high.
	   Overproduction by Venezuela and Iran anyway calls into question
the point of further cuts, analysts say.
	   Iran disputes it is overproducing.
	   Venezuela, facing a change of government in February, is
considered unpredictable, increasing the sense that meaningful
action this time round is unlikely.

	   Human rights lawyers welcomed the decision as long-overdue.
	   ``Sooner or later, justice arrives,'' said Enrique Santiago, a
private attorney who has worked with Judge Baltasar Garzon in
seeking to bring Pinochet to trial in Spain. ``We think it is an
excellent decision.''
	   Virginia Diez, another lawyer involved in the proceedings,
jumped up and down in joy upon hearing the news in the Puerta del
Sol.
	   ``At last we will bring Pinochet to trial for the savage crimes
that he has committed,'' she said. ``It is great news for us. The
next step is extradition.''
	   ``It is a very important day for all humanity, not just for
Chileans'' said Ana Maria Gonzalez, a 45-year-old who fled her
native Chile after the 1973 coup in which Pinochet seized power.
	   ``I never thought I would see this day,'' Gonzalez said with
tears in her eyes.

Hopeful Price favorite to win his third Zimbabwe Open 
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOHN KELLEY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ World ranking Zimbabwean golfer Nick
Price tees off as the favorite to win his country's open golf
championship when it gets under way Thursday.
	   Ranked No. 7 in the world, Price is attempting to be the first
player to defend the title successfully in its 15 years and the
first to win it three times.
	   Victory would be especially gratifying for him because this is
the centenary year of the venue, the Royal Harare Golf Club.
	   It will be the first international professional tournament to be
staged at Royal Harare _ granted a Royal prefix by British King
George V in 1929 _ since Price's own design company made
significant alterations to the course two years ago.
	   Price also won the Zimbabwe Open in 1995 on this course. His
score was 264, or 24 under par, though he beat South Africa's
Brendan Pappas by only one shot.
	   Price believes Royal Harare is now about six shots more
difficult, although it retains a flat parkland aspect with no
water.
	   As soon as the tournament ends Sunday, he will move a few
hundred kilometers (miles) across the South African border for the
Sun City Million Dollar Classic tournament, which he has also won
twice.
	   Price, who has earned over dlrs 1.2 million prize money in 1998,
said he has high hopes of an African ``double'' to round off
another good year.
	   ``A great deal depends on my putting'' he said Wednesday. ``It
has been suspect ever since the U.S. Open, so it needs to come
together quickly.''
	   His main rival this week will be Mark McNulty, who has also won
the Zimbabwe Open twice. And with Tony Johnstone winning it in
1993, only one non-Zimbabwean, British-born South African resident
Chris Williams, has won it in the last six years.
	   A previous winner in 1989, current USPGA champion Vijay Singh
will not be playing.
	   The field of 144 includes mainly South Africans, but also other
Zimbabwe contenders such as Nasho Kamungeremu, who toured Canada
this season and was seventh last year, and Marc Cayeux, winner last
week of the Zambia Open.
	   Prize money is about dlrs 70, 000.

Belgrade authorities block more tribunal investigations
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ Belgrade authorities have again
refused to let Yugoslav war crimes tribunal staff carry out
investigations in Yugoslavia, a court official said Wednesday.
	   But unlike a recent refusal, when Belgrade barred the U.N. court
from the troubled southern province of Kosovo, the latest case
involved investigations of alleged war crimes against Serbs.
	   ``I find it puzzling,'' the tribunal's deputy prosecutor Graham
Blewitt said.
	   The latest dispute between the tribunal and Yugoslavia comes
just a week after the Security Council ordered Belgrade to
cooperate with the Hague-based court.
	   Blewitt said his investigators wanted to visit Yugoslavia to
finalize cases in which Serbs were the victims of alleged war
crimes. He gave no further details of the investigations.
	   Set up in 1993, the 14-judge tribunal has jurisdiction to
prosecute breaches of international humanitarian law committed
anywhere on the territory of the former Yugoslavia since 1991.
	   Belgrade officials deny that the court has jurisdiction over the
dispute in Kosovo where hundreds have died and hundreds of
thousands have been made homeless in eight months of fighting
between Serb forces and secessionist ethnic Albanians.

reverberated around Spain, hundreds of people, some crying from
emotion, hugged and cheered at a rally in the Madrid's central
Puerta del Sol plaza.
	   ``It is a very important day for all humanity, not just for
Chileans'' said Ana Maria Gonzalez, a 45-year-old who fled her
native Chile after the 1973 coup in which Pinochet seized power.
	   ``I never thought I would see this day,'' Gonzalez said with
tears in her eyes.
	   Human rights lawyers welcomed the decision as long-overdue.

 &UR; Space chief: More than 80 percent of Russian satellites worn out &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Eighty-two percent of Russia's military and
civilian satellites have expired their service lifetime but are
still being used because Russia cannot afford to replace them, the
nation's top space official said Wednesday.
	   Russia has 127 satellites in orbit, about one fourth of the
world's total, but it only spends about 2 percent of all money
spent worldwide on satellite operations, Russian Space Agency chief
Yuri Koptev told a news conference.
	   ``We will get (from the satellites) just as much as we spend,''
he said.
	   He said 82 percent of them were due to be replaced or scrapped.
	   Russia's military has long expressed concern about its dwindling
number of modern satellites, used to monitor missile launches,
collect intelligence data and provide communications, but the
cash-strapped government has no money to launch replacements.
	   Koptev's statement highlighted the steady degradation of the
Russian space program, which has been struggling for survival since
the Soviet collapse when generous state funding came to a halt.
	   Koptev said the battered space industry's only hope for survival
is in the new international space station, an ambitious 16-nation,
dlrs 40 billion project in which Russia and the United States play
the biggest roles.

	   ``Sooner or later, justice arrives,'' said Enrique Santiago, a
private attorney who worked with Judge Baltasar Garzon, who is
seeking to bring Pinochet to trial in Spain. ``We think it is an
excellent decision.''
	   Virginia Diez, another lawyer involved in the proceedings,
jumped up and down in joy upon hearing the news in the Puerta del
Sol.
	   ``At last we will bring Pinochet to trial for the savage crimes
that he has committed,'' she said. ``It is great news for us. The

OPEC meets amid low expectations of an agreement to lift prices

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria, (AP) _ Ministers from the Organization of the
Petroleum Exporting Countries headed into a difficult meeting
Wednesday, as oil prices floundered around 12-year lows on world
markets.
	   Despite some voices in favor of cutting production _ Kuwait and
Algeria foremost among them _ most believe heavyweight Saudi
Arabia's fear of losing market share to overproducers in the group
may immobilize the organization.
	   ``It's a mess, as ever,'' said Leo Drollas, chief economist at
London's Center for Global Energy Studies.
	   This time though, OPEC, known for its disagreements, is facing
an especially tricky situation.
	   Its average price per barrel of crude oil has crashed dlrs 8.22
from dlrs 18.81 last November to dlrs 10.59, according to the last
available average price.
	   In London, Brent crude oil for delivery in January was trading
in the afternoon at dlrs 11.31 a barrel, up from Tuesday's 15-year
low of dlrs 11.19.
	   Analysts say that price could hit new lows Wednesday, pushed
down by signs OPEC is largely immobilized by disagreement.
	   A badly judged decision to boost production last winter fed into
Asia's economic collapse, resulting in an oil glut worldwide.
	   Government revenue in most OPEC countries has taken a hit.
Kuwait says its 1998 oil revenue will sink by 45 percent.
	   Reflecting the sense of crisis, Algeria's oil minister Youcef
Yousfi has called for an exceptional meeting of heads of state of
OPEC's 11 members, saying the ``price crisis'' must be addressed at
the very top.
	   It would be OPEC's first leaders' meeting since 1975.
	   The formal year-end meeting in Vienna is expected to begin late
Wednesday, delayed by Yousfi's eleventh-hour stomp through four
Gulf nations to drum up support for action to boost prices.
	   Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas said in Jakarta late
Tuesday that Indonesia supported a meeting. The United Arab
Emirates have also voiced support for the meeting.
	   The OPEC ministers are likely to discuss the suggestion of a
heads of state gathering, but it's unclear how wide support is.
	   Suggestions so far on how to lift prices have focused on cutting
production further or extending current cuts, introduced in June to
soak up the oil glut pushing down prices.
	   Indonesia says it supports extending current cuts, which OPEC
president Obaid bin Saif Al-Nasseri of the United Arab Emirates
called ``a possibility.''
	   Analysts say extending cuts is a bare minimum to avoid a price
rout.
	   Algeria, Kuwait and Libya all want further cuts to the 2.6
million barrel-a-day June production cut. The cut didn't work,
largely because demand is too low and some countries are
overproducing.
	   Saudi Arabia, OPEC's biggest producer at 8 million barrels a
day, is apparently unwilling to contemplate fresh cuts unless the
June round is adhered to, worried at losing market share to
overproducers.
	   Further depressing the market, the United Nations Security
Council voted to roll over for six months Wednesday Iraq's
food-for-oil deal, meaning around 1.9 million barrels of oil a day
are reaching the world market from Iraq, keeping world supplies
high.
	   Overproduction by Venezuela and Iran anyway calls into question
the point of further cuts, analysts say.
	   Iran disputes it is overproducing.
	   Venezuela, facing a change of government in February, is
considered unpredictable, increasing the sense that meaningful
action this time round is unlikely.

Dublin's historic boulevard getting monument to replace one IRA
</HEADLINE>
destroyed &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) _ Dublin's O'Connell Street, the broadest
and most historic boulevard in the capital, will receive a modern
monument to replace its former landmark blown up by the Irish
Republican Army.
	   Lord Mayor Joe Doyle announced that a 120-meter-high (120-yard)
cone of stainless steel would be erected next year at the top of
the street overlooking the River Liffey, where a pillar in honor of
British naval hero Lord Nelson had stood for two centuries until
1966.
	   Doyle said he hoped the spartan new monument, which will have a
base of Kilkenny black marble and be partially lit at night, would
become ``a familiar and well-loved symbol of Dublin in the third
millennium.''
	   Head of the judging panel, Joan O'Connor, called the design a
``brave and uncompromising beacon'' that would reaffirm ``the
status of O'Connell Street as Ireland's principal urban
thoroughfare.'' It had been chosen from 205 entries.
	   The IRA destroyed Nelson's Column _ a copy of the one that still
adorns London's Trafalgar Square _ to commemorate the 50th
anniversary of the 1916 rebellion against British rule of Ireland.
Rebels had used the post office on O'Connell Street as headquarters
for their week-long insurrection, which left the street in ruins
but the monument standing.
	   The government today is hoping to restore the former cultural
glory of O'Connell Street, which since the 1970s has become a
magnet for fast-food joints, downmarket shops and street crime. The
monument, expected to cost 3 million pounds (dlrs 4.5 million), is
part of a more than 30 million pound (dlrs 45 million) investment
package for the boulevard, which is lined with statues of important
Irish statesmen.

Agassi retires in match against Corretja
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Wednesday's action &QL; 
 &UR; By NESHA STARCEVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HANOVER, Germany (AP) _ Andre Agassi, who has been battling a
back injury, retired in his opening match Wednesday at the ATP
World Championship against Alex Corretja.
	   Corretja was ahead 5-7, 6-3, 2-1 when Agassi quit during a
changeover, just after having his service broken.
	   Agassi, the 1990 champion in the elite tournament, injured his
back Monday while he was practicing with Corretja. Agassi skipped
Monday's draw ceremony and was given a Wednesday start to have more
time to recover.
	   Later Wednesday, Pete Sampras played Carlos Moya and Yevgeny
Kafelnikov battled Karol Kucera.
	   On Tuesday, Pete Sampras began his quest to secure the No. 1
ranking for a record sixth year.
	   Marcelo Rios, the only player who can threaten Sampras, lost to
Tim Henman 7-5, 6-1 and later said a recurring back injury may
force him to drop out of the ATP World Championship.
	   Sampras leads Rios by a slim 33 points in the computer rankings
and he is seeking to make history by becoming the first man to
finish as No. 1 for six years in a row. He shares the record of
five with Jimmy Connors.
	   Kicking off the season-ending dlrs 3.5 million event that brings
together the top eight players of the year, Sampras posted an
impressive 6-2, 6-4 victory over Kafelnikov.
	   Rios needs to do better than Sampras at the tournament to have a
shot at the No. 1 and with his painful back this looks a like
distant prospect now.
	   ``My back is hurting really a lot. I'm not in a good condition
to continue playing,'' Rios said.
	   ``I'm going to see how I feel tomorrow. I want to play, I want
to be No. 1 but you have to listen to your body,'' he said. ``It's
tough to run, it's tough to play when you are in pain.''
	   Rios, who has held the No. 1 spot for a total of six weeks this
year and leads the tour with seven titles, could have grabbed the
top spot again two weeks ago in Santiago but he crashed out in the
quarterfinals.
	   Spending 15 hours on a plane and switching back to a hard indoor
court from clay didn't help his back either, Rios said.
	   Sampras on the other hand looked in perfect condition after
taking a break following six grueling weeks on the indoor circuit
in Europe.
	   ``It was good to let my body and mind rest. I'm obviously very
fresh in the legs,'' he said.
	   Sampras cruised in the first set with his sharp serve-and-volley
game. Kafelnikov gave him more of a battle in the second set but
Sampras still dominated the opponent he beat in last year's final,
when he won the title for the fourth time. Sampras
	   ``I don't want to say it was a statement, but I definitely was
very focused,'' Sampras said. ``I think the guys know that, that
this is an important week and it showed.''
	   ``I just hope I can maintain this level throughout the week,
which is not going to be easy. But today was definitely a good
start,'' Sampras said.

Britain's highest court rules Pinochet has no immunity from arrest
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Margaret Thatcher calling on British government
to reject extradition request; edits throughout &QL; 
 &UR; By MAUREEN JOHNSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Britain's highest court ruled Wednesday that Gen.
Augusto Pinochet does not have immunity from arrest, meaning the
former Chilean dictator must remain under police guard while Spain
seeks his extradition on charges of murder, torture and genocide.
	   The 3-2 majority decision by a five-judge tribunal of the House
of Lords overturned a High Court ruling that Pinochet's arrest was
illegal because he had immunity under English law for actions taken
as a foreign former head of state.
	   It was delivered on Pinochet's 83rd birthday.
	   A Chilean government report says some 3,000 people were murdered
or disappeared during Pinochet's 1973-90 rule after he overthrew
Salvador Allende, an elected Marxist.
	   The Spanish government and Spanish and British prosecutors had
appealed the Oct. 28 High Court judgment awarding him immunity.
	   Crowds of demonstrators outside Parliament, many of them victims
and relatives of people who disappeared during Pinochet's regime,
whooped, cheered and waved flags and placards after hearing
Wednesday's ruling.
	   ``I think it's a victory over every murderer in the world,''
said George Madaraga, a former solider in the Chilean army who had
tears streaming down his face. ``It's a human victory, not a
political victory. Every torturer should be brought to justice.''
	   ``This is a great day of victory for Pinochet's thousands of
victims,'' said Reedy Brody of the New York-based group Human
Rights Watch.
	   The general and his wife, Lucia, heard the news _ broadcast live
on British television _ in his room at the Grovelands Priory, the
north London hospital where he had remained under police guard
awaiting news of his fate.
	   Pinochet now must appear before Bow Street Magistrates' Court in
London on Dec. 2, the deadline by which Home Secretary Jack Straw
must decide whether extradition proceedings can go ahead.
	   His best hope is that Straw will block the Spanish extradition
proceedings, which would mean that extradition requests lodged by
Switzerland, France and other countries also likely would fall
away.
	   If Straw gives the go-ahead, however, Pinochet faces a long
battle through the British courts against extradition.
	   Former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, a staunch
supporter of the general's, immediately appealed for Straw to block
the proceedings.
	   ``The senator is old, frail and sick, and on compassionate
grounds alone should be allowed to return to Chile,'' she said. ``I
also remain convinced that the national interests of both Chile and
Britain would be best served by releasing him.''
	   The senior judge on the House of Lords tribunal, Lord Justice
Gordon Slynn, had voted to uphold the awarding of immunity, along
with his colleague, Lord Justice Anthony Lloyd.
	   But Lord Justices Donald Nicholls, Leonard Hoffman and Johan
Steyn all dismissing the High Court ruling. In reading out his
decision, Steyn said ``in a correct interpretation of the law,
General Pinochet has no immunity whatever.''
	   Key issues in the appeal were whether international law and
custom _ including trials of Rwanda Hutus and Bosnian Serbs for
genocide and war crimes, and Britain's 1988 adoption of a U.N.
Convention on Torture _ override this country's sweeping State
Immunity Act passed in 1978.
	   Prosecutors' lawyers argued that Pinochet's alleged crimes were
beyond immunity.
	   Pinochet underwent back surgery Oct. 9 during a regular visit to
Britain and was arrested Oct. 16 in his bed at another hospital.

Arafat: Palestinians will do everything possible to declare state
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS comments from Arafat, Chirac; new to some points. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat said Wednesday
that Palestinians would ``do everything possible'' to establish an
independent state on May 4, 1999.
	   ``I must say clearly that we will do everything possible to
establish our Palestinian state on May 4, 1999, the end of the
five-year interim period,'' Arafat said, speaking after a luncheon
with French President Jacques Chirac. He spoke in Arabic, which was
translated into French.
	   May 4, 1999 will mark the expiration of the interim framework of
peace talks, which includes the Wye land-for-peace accord signed
last month in Washington.
	   Previous Palestinian threats to unilaterally declare an
independent state have angered Israel.
	   The French president, meanwhile, pledged to contribute
financially to the Palestinian state.
	   We will ``find the financial means to make the investments
necessary for the development of the Palestinian state,'' Chirac
said. ``France and Europe will participate as generously as
possible in these investments.''
	   Arafat arrived in Paris Wednesday for a day of meetings with
Chirac and Prime Minister Lionel Jospin.
	   He arrived on Flight 001 from the newly opened Gaza
International Airport, which opened Tuesday morning.
	   The airport is a vital link for Palestinians bringing goods in
and out of Gaza and a powerful symbol of independence.
	   Arafat was later to meet Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, in
town for a Franco-African summit, and dine with Prime Minister
Lionel Jospin.

	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Jordan's trade deficit stood at 987 million
dinars (dlrs 1.4 billion) percent during the period January-August
1998, a 2.3 percent fall compared to the same period in 1997, a
Central Bank report said Wednesday.
	   No reason was given to the narrowing deficit but it seems to be
the result of cheaper fuel imports from Iraq this year, and the
fall of transport vehicle spare parts imports, one official said.
	   Jordanian exports dropped during the same period by 5.4 percent
to 669 million Jordanian dinars (dlrs 942 million), while
importation volume also fell by 3.7 percent to 1.8 billion dinars
(dlrs 2.535 billion).
	   Exports of Jordan's natural resources _ potash, phosphate and
cement _ rose slightly, but animal and vegetable oils, mainly
exported to Iraq, have fallen sharply due to U.N. sanctions.
	   The report said exports to Arab countries has declined 20
percent to 297 million dinars (dlrs 418 million). Saudi Arabia and
Iraq were the main markets for Jordanian exports worth 139 million
dinars (dlrs 196 million).

	   KUWAIT (AP) _ The Central Bank governor has submitted his
resignation to protest a decision taken by a government committee
to allow investment companies to finance Kuwait Stock Exchange
transactions, newspapers reported Wednesday.
	   The independent Al-Qabas daily said the governor, Sheik Salem
Abdul-Aziz al-Sabah, disapproved of the measure taken Monday by a
special ministerial committee in the hope of pumping liquidity into
the market whose price index has fallen to two-year lows.
	   But Al-Anba, a pro-government newspaper that also reported the
resignation, said it will probably be rejected by the government.
	   Al-Qabas quoted sources close to Sheik Salem as saying that the
special ministerial committee, of which he is a member, made a
political decision, not a technical one.
	   Sheik Salem did not attend the committee meeting Monday because
he was hospitalized. He was not immediately available for comment.
	   Al-Qabas said the Central Bank does not believe the exchange is
suffering from lack of liquidity, and that such financing would

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China's capital announced Wednesday it will bid
to serve as host to the 2008 Summer Olympics.
	   Beijing's announcement won quick support from a government
minister, who said China _ as the world's most populous nation _
should stage the games.
	   Beijing Mayor Jia Qinglin submitted the application to Wu
Shaozu, president of the Chinese Olympic Committee, during a
ceremony at the Great Hall of the People, the state-run Xinhua News
Agency reported.
	   ``We think that as the world's most populous country, with a
vigorous and growing economy, China should host the Olympic Games
and make more contributions to the Olympic movement,'' Xinhua
quoted Wu as saying.
	   ``Many people in China and foreign friends have expressed their
hope that China would bid again,'' said Wu, who is also minister of
the State Sports General Administration. The Chinese Olympic
Committee ``is very happy to receive the application,'' he said.
	   Beijing lost to Sydney by two votes in the 1993 selection for
the host of the 2000 Games. China chose not to pursue the 2004
Olympics.
	   ``I had been hoping Beijing would bid again after we beat them
so narrowly in 1993,'' said Kevan Gosper, an Australian Olympic
official and member of the International Olympic Committee
executive board. ``A lot of progress has been made and they are
better prepared to deliver a successful games.''
	   Since the loss to Sydney, Shanghai and Guangzhou have also been
rumored as possible sites for another China bid.
	   The Chinese Olympic Committee will study Beijing's bid and any
applications from other Chinese cities at a meeting in January,
said He Huixian, a committee spokeswoman. If the committee approves
a bid, it will forward the application to the International Olympic
Committee, she said.
	   She said Beijing lost the 1993 vote for the 2000 Games because
of ``non-sports factors.''
	   Criticism of China's human rights record was a factor in the
1993 vote. China's reputation has also been marred by a string of
doping scandals.
	   Another Australian IOC member, Phill Coles, said China will have
to be persuasive on doping controls and may face another barrage on
human rights.
	   ``Everyone discusses human rights,'' he said. ``It's an issue
with a lot of countries in the world.''
	   The Chinese Olympic Committee set up a special team to research
the feasibility of another bid. Wu said Beijing gave its bid
``careful consideration'' before submitting the application.
	   Officially, competition to stage the 2008 Games hasn't even
begun, although Toronto and Osaka, Japan, have already declared
they want to be host.
	   Bids are also expected from Buenos Aires, Argentina; Istanbul,
Turkey, and Seville, Spain. Paris, Kuala Lumpur and Cairo are also
weighing possible bids.
	   The IOC will open the bidding next year and the deadline is
February 2000. The IOC will select the 2008 host city in Moscow in
2001.
	   While Toronto has been seen as the early front-runner, China's
entry into the race changes the landscape dramatically.
	   Dick Pound, a Canadian who sits on the executive board of the
IOC, said China would be the clear favorite.
	   ``It would be hard for the IOC to justify going to a relatively
small country for a third time when the world's largest country has
never had the games,'' Pound told The Associated Press in a
telephone interview from Montreal.
	   Montreal staged the 1976 summer games and Calgary held the 1988
winter games.
	   A defeat for Toronto in 2008 would be good news for the United
States, which plans to bid for the 2012 games. If the 2008 games
went to Canada, the IOC would almost certainly not take the
Olympics back to North America four years later.

Father murders daughter after pledging not to harm her
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ A Jordanian has confessed to killing his
daughter in the name of family honor despite signing a pledge not
to harm her, police said Wednesday.
	   It appeared to be the 18th such killing this year in Jordan
where the slaying of daughters or sisters for having pre-marital
sex does not carry the stigma of murder and is known as a ``crime
of honor.''
	   The killing occurred Tuesday, a day after an international
conference in Amman recommended that Middle Eastern courts impose
much heavier sentences for honor crimes. In Jordan, courts impose
jail sentences ranging from three months to two years for such
crimes because of the heavy premium traditional Arab societies
place on family honor.
	   Police declined to name either the father or his daughter in the
latest killing. They said the victim was a 17-year-old woman who
returned home after being divorced by her husband.
	   Soon after, she eloped with a boyfriend, telling her parents she
was in love with him, a policeman said, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
	   Police detained the couple on Monday. The boyfriend was arrested
on a charge of raping a minor and the girl was handed over to the
Amman provincial authorities.
	   On Tuesday, she was released into the custody of her father, 42,
after he had signed a document pledging not to harm her.
	   The father then took the girl to Ghamadan Park on the outskirts
of Amman where he slit her throat, the policeman said.
	   The father turned himself in to the police and was arrested on a
murder charge, the policeman said.
	   About 25 women are killed each year in the name of honor in
Jordan, making it the most common type of murder of women in the
kingdom.
	   The Jordanian government is currently working on a project to
establish a safe home for female victims of domestic violence or
women whose relatives have threatened to kill them for honor
reasons.

Schroeder holds first cabinet meeting in Berlin

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder met with his Cabinet
for the first time in Berlin on Wednesday, more evidence of his
zeal to get working in Germany's new capital as soon as possible.
	   Deeming his government the ``Berlin Republic'' _ a phrase that's
become shorthand for leadership by a new generation _ Schroeder is
so fixed on Berlin that he sped up the government's move there from
Bonn by several months. He hopes to be here full time by April.
	   Despite his speed in getting to Berlin, critics say Schroeder
and his Social Democrats are off to a slow start in choosing a
political direction.
	   In office for less than a month, Schroeder's government has
wavered on tax reforms and drawn concerns that it is backing off
pro-market campaign promises and hewing to the left with plans to
bolster social programs.
	   One former chancellor sees the political wriggling as growing
pains. After years at being state governors, Schroeder and Oskar
Lafontaine, finance minister and Social Democrat party chief, could
take a while to get comfortable at leading the nation.
	   ``They need a couple of years for sure,'' Schmidt, the previous
Social Democrat chancellor, said Tuesday at a reception launching
his latest book on politics.
	   Schmidt, who said he always felt the burden of responsibility
while chancellor, was in office before Chancellor Helmut Kohl
settled in in 1982 for sixteen years of conservative rule which
ended when Germans eager for change elected Schroeder.
	   A dynamic, former state governor, Schroeder, 54, offered voters
a fresh face compared to the 68-year-old Kohl. He won on promises
to end record-high unemployment, stubbornly stuck at over 10
percent, and to shake Germany out of its economic malaise by
stressing the pro-market yet socially responsible ``Third Way.''
	   Unemployment was at the top of the agenda as Schroeder's and his
ministers gathered Wednesday morning, and the Cabinet swiftly
agreed to launch a 2 billion mark (dlrs 1.25 billion) program for
finding jobs for young people.
	   With a goal to create 65,000 jobs and 35,000 training positions,
the new program will devote almost half its funding to the former
communist east. Unemployment in the east is almost twice as severe
as in the west, and Schroeder promised eastern state leaders
Tuesday night to make improving their economies a top priority.
	   His efforts to ease unemployment led Schroeder to make his first
policy fumble. After announcing new taxes in his inaugural address,
he soon withdrew them for fear of hampering the creation of
low-wage jobs. His reversal drew praise from industry leaders but
accusations of wavering from opposition Christian Democrats eager
to find fault with the new government.
	   Wednesday's meeting took place in a former communist East German
government building _ one more symbol of Germany's great political
shift since the Berlin Wall fell in 1989, making way for the
reunification of East and West.
	   The stately red brick-and-glass structure, which stands on a
street named for one of the founders of Germany's former communist
party, will be Schroeder's temporary chancellery. His new one, next
to the refurbished Reichstag parliament building near where the
Wall once stood, will not be finished until October 2000.
	   Getting the government to Berlin _ a dlrs 12 billion job that
entails moving 11,000 people _ also requires an adjustment period.
President Roman Herzog's staff started working in its new Berlin
offices on Monday, signaling the start of the move, but the
government will be divided between Bonn and Berlin for months to
come.
	   With the Cabinet in Berlin on Wednesday, for example, the
government's chief spokesman held his regular press conference
here. His second-in-command handled the press back in Bonn, the
quiet Rhine River town that became Germany's temporary capital
after the devastation of World War II.

Britain's highest court rules Pinochet has no immunity from arrest

	   LONDON (AP) _ Britain's highest court ruled Wednesday that Gen.
Augusto Pinochet does not have immunity from arrest, meaning the
former Chilean dictator must remain under police guard while Spain
seeks his extradition on charges of murder, torture and genocide.
	   The 3-2 majority decision by a House of Lords tribunal
overturned a High Court ruling that Pinochet's arrest was illegal
because he had immunity under English law for actions taken as a
foreign former head of state.
	   It was delivered on Pinochet's 83rd birthday.
	   A Chilean government report says some 3,000 people were murdered
or disappeared during Pinochet's 1973-90 rule after he overthrew
Salvador Allende, an elected Marxist.
	   The Spanish government and Spanish and British prosecutors had
appealed the Oct. 28 High Court judgment awarding him immunity.
	   Crowds of demonstrators outside Parliament, many of them victims
and relatives of people who disappeared during Pinochet's regime,
whooped, cheered and waved flags and placards after hearing
Wednesday's ruling.
	   ``I think it's a victory over every murderer in the world,''
said George Madaraga, a former solider in the Chilean army who had
tears streaming down his face. ``It's a human victory, not a
political victory. Every torturer should be brought to justice.''
	   ``This is a great day of victory for Pinochet's thousands of
victims,'' said Reed Brody of the New York-based group Human Rights
Watch.

Dismantling of controversial Brent Spar begins in Norwegian fjord
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DOUG MELLGREN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ The long-awaited dismantling of the Brent
Spar offshore oil storage buoy began Wednesday, 3 1/2 years after
Greenpeace activists boarded the unit and embarrassed oil giant
Shell into dropping plans to sink it in the North Atlantic.
	   Instead, Brent Spar was towed to the deep waters of the
Norwegian Erfjord inlet to be dismantled and reused, partly as the
foundation for a new wharf. The first major step is to remove the
buoy's 1,600 ton topside with a floating crane.
	   ``Crews are rigging for the lift. We expect to start lifting at
about 3 p.m. (1400 GMT),'' the project's senior engineer Arvid
Nygaard told The Associated Press from the crane barge. ``We have
been very lucky with the weather.''
	   Nygaard said the weather was calm, with no rain or snow, making
ideal conditions to start the lift. The process of dismantling the
15,000 ton unit is estimated to last a year.
	   Shell UK had planned to sink the obsolete Brent Spar off
Scotland, a cheaper and faster approach. But Greenpeace activists
boarded the vessel in April 1995 in a successful protest that
lasted four months and gained backing across Europe.
	   ``Off course, this is a good feeling,'' said Jan Rispens, a
Dutch Greenpeace activist who spent 2 1/2 weeks aboard the Brent
Spar during the protest. He was in western Norway to see the
dismantling begin, a step he called a victory for the millions of
people who supported the anti dumping campaign.
	   ``This is the best solution. It reuses materials; it provides
jobs in Norway, and it protects the ocean,'' he said.
	   Opponents feared that sinking the North Sea platform would
pollute the ocean with chemicals and other pollutants. But in May
1996, a British government commission concluded that scuttling the
Brent Spar in the North Atlantic would have a minimal environmental
impact.
	   The tube-like Brent Spar will float upright, and be slowly
sliced into sections as it is lifted out of the water. The sections
will be cleaned, and then towed to the new wharf.
	   In January, Shell awarded Norway's Maritime GMC AS and
Scotland's Wood Group Engineering a joint contract to dispose of
the platform. Shell has said the disposal of Brent Spar will cost
the company up to 26 million pounds (dlrs 42 million), more than
twice the cost of sinking it.

EU governments, parliament panel set 1999 EU budget at dlrs 113
</HEADLINE>
billion &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Representatives of the European Union
governments and the European Parliament have agreed to fix the EU's
1999 budget at 96.9 billion European currency units (dlrs 113
billion) _ up 7.7 percent from this year.
	   The deal with the EU assembly's budget committee was reached
late Tuesday.
	   It is expected to be approved by the full parliament next month.
	   As always, the biggest slice of spending _ 40.4 billion ecus
(dlrs 47.8 billion) - will go to farm spending, mostly subsidies to
guarantee prices for farmers.
	   Aid to the EU's poorer regions will account for 39 billion ecus
(dlrs 46 billion); assistance to non-EU nations 6 billion ecus
(dlrs 7 billion); administrative costs 4.4 billion ecus (dlrs 5.2
billion).
	   The year-on-year rise in total EU spending results primarily
from a near 17 percent increase in development funding for poorer
regions.
	   By comparison, farm spending _ although comprising almost half
of total outlays _ will remain unchanged in 1999 from this year.
	   EU nations are split over plans to overhaul the budget over the
2000-2006 period to enable the Union to finance the entry of up to
12 new members over the next decade.
	   Britain and Germany want to freeze the overall budget and cut
the level of farm spending. Spain opposes a freeze and France is
concerned its powerful farm lobby will revolt against subsidy cuts.
	   The EU budget is funded by contributions from EU nations, with
Germany, the EU's largest economy, paying the lion's share.

Belarus introduces strict food rationing

<TEXT>
	   MINSK, Belarus (AP) _ Amid severe food shortages, Belarus'
authoritarian government is imposing rationing for milk, meat,
matches and other goods.
	   And to make sure that nobody lives too well, President Alexander
Lukashenko told the government Wednesday to cap salaries at this
former Soviet republic's few private companies.
	   Long lines form in grocery stores when basic goods appear on the
usually empty shelves. Officials in the capital, Minsk, have
limited customers to no more than 2 cartons of milk, 2 kilograms
(4.4 pounds) of meat or poultry, 400 grams (11 ounces) of cheese,
10 boxes of matches, and 300 grams (10.5 ounces) of chocolate.
	   Belarus still has a rigid Soviet-style economy, as Lukashenko
has blocked most serious reforms and kept enterprises under state
control.
	   The country was rocked by an economic crisis this spring, with a
dramatic slump in its currency prompting the government to order
price controls. Fallout from the latest economic crisis in Russia _
Belarus' main trading partner _ has made the situation even worse.
	   Wages average about 4 million Belarusian rubles (dlrs 40) a
month. Inflation has hit 30 percent this year and the World Bank
has warned that the country is facing a mounting trade deficit and
a sharp fall in hard-currency reserves.
	   Food shortages are most acute in provincial towns, some of which
are issuing ration cards or selling food only to those who can
prove they are local residents.
	   Stores in the city of western city of Grodno have been banned
from selling cheese or butter before 3 p.m., or sugar or cheap
Belarusian cigarettes on any day other than Saturday.
	   Local authorities argue the policy gives people who work during
the day a fair chance to stock up, and ensures that all goods are
not swept up by the unemployed and retirees.
	   The Belarusian government has set up grocery stores at factories
and state agencies that only sell food to employees.
	   Lukashenko, who insists he is trying to provide Soviet-style
stability for average Belarusians, urged the government Wednesday
to tighten price controls.
	   ``We should not sell goods at less than their actual value and
make companies unprofitable, but we should in no way create a
precedent of spiraling price jumps,'' he said.
	   He also said Wednesday that the government ``should regulate the
incomes of especially well-paid people,'' Lukashenko was quoted by
the Interfax news agency as saying.
	   ``I am not saying that somebody's wages should be cut, but there
should be a balance,'' he said. He did not elaborate.
	   ``I am doing my best to support ordinary people,'' he added.

	   VIENNA, Austria, (AP) _ Ministers from the Organization of the
Petroleum Exporting Countries headed into a difficult meeting
Wednesday, as oil prices floundered around 12-year lows on world
markets.
	   Despite some voices in favor of cutting production _ Kuwait and
Algeria foremost among them _ most believe heavyweight Saudi
Arabia's fear of losing market share to overproducers in the group
may immobilize the organization.
	   ``It's a mess, as ever,'' said Leo Drollas, chief economist at
London's Center for Global Energy Studies.
	   This time though, OPEC, known for its disagreements, is facing
an especially tricky situation.
	   Its average price per barrel of crude oil has crashed dlrs 8.22
from dlrs 18.81 last November to dlrs 10.59, according to the last
available average price.
	   In London, Brent crude oil for delivery in January was trading
in the afternoon at dlrs 11.31 a barrel, up from Tuesday's 15-year
low of dlrs 11.19.
	   Analysts say that price could hit new lows Wednesday, pushed
down by signs OPEC is largely immobilized by disagreement.
	   A badly judged decision to boost production last winter fed into
Asia's economic collapse, resulting in an oil glut worldwide.
	   Government revenue in most OPEC countries has taken a hit.
Kuwait says its 1998 oil revenue will sink by 45 percent.
	   Reflecting the sense of crisis, Algeria's oil minister Youcef
Yousfi has called for an exceptional meeting of heads of state of
OPEC's 11 members, saying the ``price crisis'' must be addressed at
the very top.
	   It would be OPEC's first leaders' meeting since 1975.
	   The formal year-end meeting in Vienna is expected to begin late
Wednesday, delayed by Yousfi's eleventh-hour stomp through four
Gulf nations to drum up support for action to boost prices.
	   Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas said in Jakarta late
Tuesday that Indonesia supported a meeting. The United Arab
Emirates have also voiced support for the meeting.
	   The OPEC ministers are likely to discuss the suggestion of a
heads of state gathering, but it's unclear how wide support is.
	   Suggestions so far on how to lift prices have focused on cutting
production further or extending current cuts, introduced in June to
soak up the oil glut pushing down prices.
	   Indonesia says it supports extending current cuts, which OPEC
president Obaid bin Saif Al-Nasseri of the United Arab Emirates
called ``a possibility.''
	   Analysts say extending cuts is a bare minimum to avoid a price
rout.
	   Algeria, Kuwait and Libya all want further cuts to the 2.6
million barrel-a-day June production cut. The cut didn't work,
largely because demand is too low and some countries are
overproducing.
	   Saudi Arabia, OPEC's biggest producer at 8 million barrels a
day, is apparently unwilling to contemplate fresh cuts unless the
June round is adhered to, worried at losing market share to
overproducers.
	   Further depressing the market, the United Nations Security
Council voted to roll over for six months Wednesday Iraq's
food-for-oil deal, meaning around 1.9 million barrels of oil a day
are reaching the world market from Iraq, keeping world supplies
high.
	   Overproduction by Venezuela and Iran anyway calls into question
the point of further cuts, analysts say.
	   Iran disputes it is overproducing.
	   Venezuela, facing a change of government in February, is
considered unpredictable, increasing the sense that meaningful
action this time round is unlikely.

	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Turkey's government collapsed Wednesday
after losing a confidence vote in parliament over a corruption
scandal that tainted the prime minister with allegations of mob
ties.
	   The downfall of Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz and his nearly
17-month-old government could push Turkey toward another crisis
between Western-oriented forces and pro-Islamic supporters that
anger Turkey's powerful military.
	   Lawmakers were left with a difficult choice: trying to set aside
feuds and build a coalition of secular parties or accept an
alliance with the Islamic party, now known as Virtue.
	   A senior Virtue official, Nevzat Yalcintas, insisted the party
``must lead'' the next government.
	   Yilmaz opponents carried a convincing 314-214 margin in the
550-seat parliament _ well beyond the threshold needed to sink
Turkey's fourth government since 1995.
	   Yilmaz has been accused of ties with organized crime and rigging
the privatization of a state-run bank by securing loans for a
businessman linked to a mafia boss. Yilmaz has denied any links to
criminal gangs.
	   ``I believe that it will be the people who will very soon make
the real judgment about our government,'' Yilmaz told parliament.
He is expected to remain in power in a caretaker role until a new
government is formed.
	   In a separate vote, the state economy minister, Gunes Taner, was
bounced from office on similar abuse of power allegations.
	   The political scene was thrown wide open by the parliament
action.
	   No single political bloc is strong enough to form a new
governing coalition on its own. Secular-minded parties will likely
try to set aside their differences and cobble together a parliament
majority that can lead until early general elections in April.
	   But failure could open the way for a return of the Islamic
party, which supports bringing stricter Muslim codes and traditions
to mostly Western-looking Turkey.
	   Although Virtue has the largest number of seats in parliament,
it faces direct opposition from Turkey's extremely powerful
military, which forced the country's first Islamic-led government
out of power last year.
	   The latest political reshuffling comes at a delicate time.
	   Turkey is waging an uphill fight for the extradition of Kurdish
rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan, who is seeking political asylum in
Italy. The diplomatic effort and public protests have strained
Turkey's relationships with the European Union.
	   Delays in forming a new government could distract Turkish
leaders from their goal of bringing Ocalan to justice in Turkey or
as an alternative in Germany, which is seeking his arrest.
	   Nearly 37,000 people have been killed in the 14-year battle
between Turkish forces and Kurdish rebels seeking autonomy in
southeastern Turkey.
	   Parties have 45 days to present a new governing coalition. If
they fail, it will be up to the president to set up a caretaker
government to lead the country to elections.
	   Traditionally, the job of forming a new government goes to the
head of parliament's largest party _ now Recai Kutan of the Virtue
Party.
	   President Suleyman Demirel was expected to meet Kutan later
Wednesday as he begins his consultations with party leaders.
	   Demirel, however, may seek to avoid a confrontation with the
military and pick someone from Turkey's deeply divided secular
parties.
	   Analysts have pointed at an alliance between Yilmaz and his
longtime rival, former Prime Minster Tansu Ciller, as a possible
replacement. To have enough votes in parliament the two would have
to call in a third party, possibly the Democratic Left Party of
Deputy Premier Bulent Ecevit.

Serbia offers talks, rejects broad autonomy for Kosovo

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serbia's top negotiator for Kosovo
warned Wedesday that any solution resembling independence for the
secessionist province would trigger a war, within and beyond the
province.
	   Speaking in the provincial capital, Serbian Vice Premier Ratko
Markovic said giving Kosovo status as a separate republic ``would
not only be against the constitution, but also a tragic political
act leading inevitably to a military conflict, not only within
Serbia but also among countries bordering Kosovo.''
	   The mostly ethnic Albanian Kosovo is a province of Serbia, the
dominant republic in Yugoslavia.
	   Markovic, the appointed head of Serbia's negotiating team for
Kosovo, arrived Wednesday in Pristina with President Milan
Milutinovic for talks with the pro-independence ethnic Albanians _
who refused for the 18th time to attend.
	   The attempt comes a week after Serb authorities rejected a
U.S.-drafted peace plan, which loosens Kosovo's ties with Serbia's
central authorities, but keeps the province formally within the
republic and Yugoslavia, which now consists of Serbia and
Montenegro.
	   ``There is no solution for Kosovo if the area is excluded from
Serbian authorities,'' said Markovic.
	   A Serb counterplan keeps Kosovo firmly within Serbia, but grants
the province self-rule. Ethnic Albanian politicians have already
dismissed this version.
	   ``It's not a serious, but a propaganda proposal for dialogue,''
said ethnic Albanian activist Gjergj Dedaj, about the Serb-proposed
plan. ``They want to show alleged readiness for talks with the
Albanians side,''
	   Most of Kosovo's ethnic Albanian majority want independence from
Serbia, but Serbs consider Kosovo the cradle of their state and are
unwilling to let it go. The province has been in turmoil since
Serbs launched a crackdown last February to crush an armed
rebellion. The clashes claimed hundreds of lives and forced some
300,000 people to leave their homes.
	   Kosovo Albanian political leaders, headed by Ibrahim Rugova, has
said giving Kosovo rights equal to Serbia and Montenegro would be
acceptable. Still, they refuse to meet face-to-face with Serb
officials.
	   A key factor in the crisis is the Kosovo Liberation Army, a
guerrilla force fighting for full independence and threatening to
undermine any deal they don't approve.
	   Adem Demaci, a human rights activist who became spokesman for
the KLA, said they might, however, support the U.S. plan although
it falls short of their demand for independence.
	   So far Serbia has refused to meet representatives of the KLA,
which it considers ``terrorists,'' inviting only Rugova to the
talks.
	   Earlier this week, Milutinovic condemned the KLA's continuing
``terrorist acts'' and declared that its attacks on ``innocent
citizens, police and soldiers'' must be stopped.
	   An Oct. 12 agreement mediated by U.S. envoys led to an end of
hostilities in Kosovo and the withdrawal of many of the government
forces. But sporadic violence continues, with each side accusing
the other of starting it.
	   Serb sources in Pristina said Wednesday the KLA had carried out
176 attacks in the past month, killing five policemen and four
civilians and wounding many others. The official Serb information
could not be independently confirmed.
	   Demaci warned Tuesday that the rebels were preparing for more
fighting in spring if peaceful solution is not found.

British Telecom, AT&AMP;T alliance faces European probe
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ European Union regulators will launch a
four-month probe into the proposed dlrs 10 billion alliance between
British Telecommunications PLC and AT and T Corp., the EU's top
antitrust official said Wednesday.
	   In a news conference, EU Competition Commissioner Karel Van
Miert confirmed comments by EU officials that the venture would
face further scrutiny following the conclusion next week of an
initial four-week inquiry.
	   ``The deal has to be looked at in its global context,'' Van
Miert said. ``Both companies have different partners in different
countries.''
	   BT, the biggest British telephone company and AT and T, the
largest U.S. carrier, announced in July they will combine their
international telephone operations and create a telecommunications
network targeting large corporations across different countries.
	   The deal also needs approval from regulators in the United
States and Britain.

Britain's highest court rules Pinochet has no immunity from arrest
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with excerpts from judges' rulings; trims &QL; 
 &UR; By MAUREEN JOHNSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Britain's highest court ruled Wednesday that Gen.
Augusto Pinochet does not have immunity from arrest, meaning the
former Chilean dictator must remain in custody while Spain seeks
his extradition for killings and torture by his security forces.
	   The 3-2 decision by a House of Lords tribunal overturned a High
Court ruling that Pinochet's arrest was illegal because he had
immunity under English law for actions taken as a foreign former
head of state.
	   ``It hardly needs saying that torture of his own subjects or of
aliens would not be regarded by international law as a function of
a head of state,'' wrote one of the majority judges, Lord Justice
Donald Nicholls.
	   The decision was delivered on Pinochet's 83rd birthday.
	   A Chilean government report says some 3,000 people were murdered
or disappeared during Pinochet's 1973-90 rule after he overthrew
Salvador Allende, an elected Marxist.
	   The Spanish government and Spanish and British prosecutors had
appealed the Oct. 28 High Court judgment awarding him immunity.
	   Crowds of demonstrators outside Parliament, many of them victims
and relatives of people who disappeared during Pinochet's regime,
whooped, cheered and waved flags and placards after hearing
Wednesday's ruling.
	   ``I think it's a victory over every murderer in the world,''
said George Madaraga, a former solider in the Chilean army who had
tears streaming down his face. ``It's a human victory, not a
political victory. Every torturer should be brought to justice.''
	   ``This is a great day of victory for Pinochet's thousands of
victims,'' said Reed Brody of the New York-based group Human Rights
Watch.
	   The general and his wife, Lucia, heard the news _ broadcast live
on British television _ in his room at the Grovelands Priory, the
north London hospital where he had remained under police guard
awaiting news of his fate.
	   Pinochet now must appear before Bow Street Magistrates' Court in
London on Dec. 2, the deadline by which Home Secretary Jack Straw
must decide whether extradition proceedings can go ahead.
	   His best hope is that Straw will block the Spanish extradition
proceedings, which would mean that extradition requests lodged by
Switzerland, France and other countries also likely would fall
away.
	   If Straw gives the go-ahead, however, Pinochet faces a long
battle through the British courts against extradition.
	   Former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, a staunch
supporter of the general's, immediately appealed for Straw to block
the proceedings.
	   ``The senator is old, frail and sick, and on compassionate
grounds alone should be allowed to return to Chile,'' she said. ``I
also remain convinced that the national interests of both Chile and
Britain would be best served by releasing him.''
	   Key issues in the appeal were whether international law and
custom _ including trials of Rwanda Hutus and Bosnian Serbs for
genocide and war crimes, and Britain's 1988 adoption of a U.N.
Convention on Torture _ override this country's sweeping State
Immunity Act passed in 1978.
	   Prosecutors' lawyers argued that Pinochet's alleged crimes were
beyond immunity.
	   Pinochet underwent back surgery Oct. 9 during a regular visit to
Britain and was arrested Oct. 16 in his bed at another hospital.

West Indies readies for first cricket test against SAfrica

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ It seems hard to believe there
has only been one cricket test between South Africa and the West
Indies.
	   Thursday's meeting at the Wanderers stadium in Johannesburg --
the opener of a five-test series -- marks the first real trial of
strength between the two teams rated by the authoritative Wisden
rankings as the second- and third-best test-playing teams.
	   Given the topsy-turvy tour form of the Caribbean players, South
African fans are anticipating a measure of revenge for the
come-from-behind defeat inflicted on them in the dramatic one-off
Barbados test of 1992, South Africa's first test match after the
apartheid isolation.
	   That match saw South Africa needing just 79 runs to score on the
final day, with eight second-innings wickets still in hand. They
had outplayed the West Indians comprehensively, batting and bowling
better throughout. But they had not reckoned on the celebrated
fast-bowling skills of the islanders, and Curtly Ambrose and
Courtney Walsh scythed through them like a pair of grinning
reapers. The remainder of South Africa's batting lineup mustered
just 26 runs
	   between them, and South Africa lost by 52 runs.
	   The same Ambrose and Walsh are here and will do battle. The
gentle nature of Ambrose's efforts against Free State, which beat
the West Indies last weekend, and the talk of Walsh's injury should
be ignored.
	   Despite any natural glee at the assumed decline and fall of
arguably the finest opening bowling duo in the last decade, the
giants remain fearsome when given a sniff of a breakthrough.
	   Late Wednesday, the West Indians said they were calling in
legspinner Rawl Lewis to replace Dinanath Ramnarine, who has been
suffering from a recurring shoulder injury.
	   The team suffered more bad news on the eve of the test.
	   Gunmen held up the West Indies Cricket Board President, Pat
Rousseau, his wife and a Jamaican journalist while the three were
driving in Soweto, the black township south of Johannesburg.
	   The assailants stole their car, money and jewelry. The robbery
realized fears of the West Indies players, who had insisted on
extra security as one of their demands during a pay holdout that
delayed their arrival in South Africa. The players had cited a
reported mugging of two Pakistani players recently.
	   In South Africa's favour and in a direct counter to the
customary strong point of the West Indies is an opening bowling duo
the equal or better of any in the world.
	   Allan Donald is widely regarded as the best fast bowler in world
cricket, and the Coopers and Lybrand ratings confirm this opinion.
His partner in pace, Shaun Pollock, is rapidly becoming the best
all-rounder in the world. But it is his ranking at sixth in the
world as a bowler which gives the South African attack an edge over
the West Indies.
	   While the West Indies batting is blessed with the proven skills
and scoring abilities of captain Brian Lara, Carl Hooper and
Shivnarine Chanderpaul, and the free-scoring and aggressive batting
approach of openers Clayton Lambert and Philo Wallace, the tourists
have not clicked into run-plundering mode of late. And, as
individuals, they certainly have not succeeded with any degree of
consistency.
	   Against that, seven of South Africa's top eight in the batting
order are ranked amongst the world's top 100 batsmen. Leading the
list is captain Hansie Cronje, and he has struck rich form, scoring
a quick and big hundred against the tourists in their final
first-class game before this test. The others, Gary Kirsten, Darryl
Cullinan, Jacques Kallis, Pollock, Jonty Rhodes and Mark Boucher,
have also showed form in domestic cricket, and, given the
international stage again, they will be determined to make whatever
batting they get impressive.
	   There are possible problems. South Africa will miss the
uncompromising bowling approach of Lance Klusener. While his
replacement in debutant David Terbrugge is a good prospect who has
performed very well domestically, there may be regrets at leaving
out Makaya Ntini, who has the advantage of experience and good
temperament.
	   The West Indies bowlers have really not looked the part on tour
yet, and they all suffered at the hand of Cronje last weekend. And
given the nature of the Wanderers pitch, of late no more the
venomous fast bowlers paradise, mediocre bowling is unlikely to go
unpunished.
	   In the end, though, it might come down to which team keeps their
nerve longest. And neither team will readily forget Barbados.
	    &UR; Teams &QC; 
	    &UR; West Indies (possible 12): Brian Lara (captain), Clayton
Lambert, Philo Wallace, Shivnarine Chanderpaul, Carl Hooper, Stuart
Williams, Junior Murray (wicketkeeper), Nixon McLean, Curtly
Ambrose, Courtney Walsh, Mervyn Dillon, Dinanath Ramnarine.
	    &UR; South Africa (from): Hansie Cronje (captain), Gary Kirsten,
Adam Bacher, Jacques Kallis, Darryl Cullinan, Jonty Rhodes, Shaun
Pollock, Mark Boucher (wicketkeeper), Pat Symcox, Allan Donald,
Paul Adams, David Terbrugge.

	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Betty Kavata's battered face contorted in
pain as she shouted gibberish from a hospital bed in a video
broadcast on Kenyan TV last week.
	   Brain damaged and paralyzed by a man her sister identified as
her battering husband, Kavata is one of many women abused by men
who claim a traditional right to discipline their wives.
	   With the motto ``Women's rights are human rights,'' the
Coalition on Violence Against Women on Wednesday launched a global
16-day campaign, leading up to the Dec. 10 50th anniversary of the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights, to eradicate gender-based
violence.
	   It's an uphill struggle.
	   Wife-beating is common throughout Kenya, and sociologists and
criminologists say it has doubled in the past decade and is rising,
partly because of Kenya's worsening economic situation.
	   Largely to blame are Kenya's outdated and discriminatory laws,
said Hilda Mawanda, coalition administrator. Wife-beating and
marital rape are not crimes, but men can be charged with the lesser
crime of assault, the coalition said.
	   The coalition urged the government to discard laws that
discriminate against women, to make wife-beating illegal, and
guarantee women's complaints are properly investigated and
prosecuted.
	   ``Many forms of violence against women that manifest themselves
through customary law practices are legally sanctioned in the
supreme law of the land, the Constitution,'' said Ann Nyabera of
the Federation of Women Lawyers.
	   Kenyan law, for example, discriminates against women in the
areas of personal law, property, burial, inheritance, adoption and
marriage, and allows practices including child marriages, female
genital mutilation, polygamy and denying a widow inheritance, she
said.
	   If enacted, legal reforms also must be enforced, the coalition
said. Male-dominated police forces often refuse to intervene in
battery cases, saying they are private affairs, it said.
	   Data on abused women is frequently unavailable. Police don't log
domestic battery or rape separately from incidents outside the
home, making it difficult to track domestic violence.
	   In 1997, a survey of 260 people commissioned by FIDA found that
94 percent those questioned in Nairobi and all of those in rural
Kajiado said women in their community were beaten.
	   FIDA receives 50 new cases each week, 45 of which involve
domestic violence.
	   The majority of women don't come forward.
	   ``Most battered women today in Kenya are still living in that
code of silence,'' said Adelina Mwau, coalition chairwoman. ``Women
still define themselves in terms of a man. She's someone's
daughter, someone's wife, someone's sister.''
	   Lena Kadeha, 37, said she suffered for more than a decade with
her abusive husband. He called her a prostitute, broke her glasses
and pounded her eyes so that she wouldn't ``look at other men,''
and beat her for not ironing his clothes when the electricity was
out.
	   Finally, he beat her in front of her mother-in-law and the
small, soft-spoken nurse and mother of five told him ``no more.''
	   ``I realized no one can change my life but me,'' Kadeha said.
	   Betty Kavata didn't get out on time. Her husband, a police
officer, has been suspended from duty, but no charges have been
brought against him.
	   ``We have a long way to go,'' Mwau said.

	   Despite any natural glee at the assumed decline and fall of
arguably the finest opening bowling duo in the last decade, the
giants remain fearsome when given a sniff of a breakthrough.
	   Late Wednesday, the West Indians said they were calling in
legspinner Rawl Lewis to replace Dinanath Ramnarine, who has been
suffering from a recurring shoulder injury.
	   The team suffered more bad news on the eve of the test.
	   Gunmen held up the West Indies Cricket Board President, Pat
Rousseau, his wife and a Jamaican journalist while the three were
driving in Soweto, the black township south of Johannesburg.
	   The assailants stole their car, money and jewelry. The robbery
realized fears of the West Indies players, who had insisted on
extra security as one of their demands during a pay holdout that
delayed their arrival in South Africa. The players had cited a
reported mugging of two Pakistani players recently.
	   In South Africa's favor and in a direct counter to the customary
strong point of the West Indies is an opening bowling duo the equal
or better of any in the world.
	   Allan Donald is widely regarded as the best fast bowler in world
cricket, and the Coopers and Lybrand ratings confirm this opinion.
His partner in pace, Shaun Pollock, is rapidly becoming the best
all-rounder in the world. But it is his ranking at sixth in the
world as a bowler which gives the South African attack an edge over
the West Indies.
	   While the West Indies batting is blessed with the proven skills
and scoring abilities of captain Brian Lara, Carl Hooper and
Shivnarine Chanderpaul, and the free-scoring and aggressive batting
approach of openers Clayton Lambert and Philo Wallace, the tourists
have not clicked into run-plundering mode of late. And, as
individuals, they certainly have not succeeded with any degree of
consistency.
	   Against that, seven of South Africa's top eight in the batting
order are ranked amongst the world's top 100 batsmen. Leading the
list is captain Hansie Cronje, and he has struck rich form, scoring
a quick and big hundred against the tourists in their final
first-class game before this test. The others, Gary Kirsten, Darryl
Cullinan, Jacques Kallis, Pollock, Jonty Rhodes and Mark Boucher,
have also showed form in domestic cricket, and, given the
international stage again, they will be determined to make whatever
batting they get impressive.
	   There are possible problems. South Africa will miss the
uncompromising bowling approach of Lance Klusener. While his
replacement in debutant David Terbrugge is a good prospect who has
performed very well domestically, there may be regrets at leaving
out Makaya Ntini, who has the advantage of experience and good
temperament.
	   The West Indies bowlers have really not looked the part on tour
yet, and they all suffered at the hand of Cronje last weekend. And
given the nature of the Wanderers pitch, of late no more the
venomous fast bowlers paradise, mediocre bowling is unlikely to go
unpunished.
	   In the end, though, it might come down to which team keeps their
nerve longest. And neither team will readily forget Barbados.
	    &UR; Teams &QC; 
	    &UR; West Indies (possible 12): Brian Lara (captain), Clayton
Lambert, Philo Wallace, Shivnarine Chanderpaul, Carl Hooper, Stuart
Williams, Junior Murray (wicketkeeper), Nixon McLean, Curtly
Ambrose, Courtney Walsh, Mervyn Dillon, Dinanath Ramnarine.

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Weeping with joy over a day they thought
would never come, opponents of Augusto Pinochet welcomed a ruling
Wednesday by British judges that upholds the former Chilean
dictator's arrest for possible extradition to Spain and trial on
charges of genocide.
	   ``It is a very important day for all humanity, not just for
Chileans'' said Ana Maria Gonzalez, a 45-year-old who fled her
native Chile after the 1973 coup in which Pinochet seized power.
	   ``I never thought I would see this day,'' Gonzalez said with
tears in her eyes. She was among dozens of demonstrators gathered
at Madrid's central Puerta del Sol to listen to the ruling on
radio.
	   Once it came in, they hugged each other and jumped up and down
under overcast skies. Others danced and sang. There were shouts of
``extradition'' and ``long live Chile without Pinochet!''
	   ``I have been waiting 23 years to see Pinochet brought to
trial,'' said Santiago Oyarzo, who said he was detained tortured
and held for over a year without a trial for giving a radical
newspaper to a friend soon after Pinochet seized power.
	   Human rights lawyers in Spain welcomed the decision by a
five-judge panel of the House of Lords as long-overdue.
	   ``Sooner or later, justice arrives,'' said Enrique Santiago, a
private attorney who has worked with Judge Baltasar Garzon in
seeking to bring Pinochet to trial in Spain. ``We think it is an
excellent decision.''
	   Virginia Diez, another lawyer involved in the proceedings,
jumped up and down in joy upon hearing the news in the Puerta del
Sol. ``At last we will bring Pinochet to trial for the savage
crimes that he has committed,'' she said.
	   ``It is great news for us. The next step is extradition,'' said
Diez.
	   Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar, speaking shortly before the
judges' ruling was announced, said Spain will respect any decision
by the British justice system.
	   It has been his conservative government's position since
Pinochet was arrested not to interfere in the judicial process,
even though the government is wary of ruffling relations with Chile
and disturbing lucrative trade ties.
	   The government opposed the human rights probe that led to
Pinochet's arrest in London on Oct. 16, but passed on Garzon's
extradition request to the British.
	   Aznar said Wednesday his government would show ``common sense
and, of course, strict observance of judicial independence.''

Netanyahu cancels visit to Switzerland
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS with Swiss reaction, ADDS Netanyahu will visit Britain
and Spain graf 5 &QL; 
 &UR; By SARI BASHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu canceled a
visit to Switzerland Wednesday, prompting an unusually harsh rebuke
from Bern and heightening tensions over a campaign to have Swiss
banks pay restitution to Holocaust victims.
	   Netanyahu called off his trip at the last minute ``because of
his effort to expand the Cabinet and achieve a stronger base for
policy measures,'' his office said.
	   The Swiss Cabinet expressed ``vexation'' over the cancellation
and said in a statement that ``the problems that burden the
relations between Switzerland and Israel continue.''
	   Netanyahu spent most of the night from Tuesday to Wednesday
negotiating the return of his former foreign minister, David Levy,
in an attempt to shore up his fragile coalition government.
	   The prime minister also delayed his departure for Britain
although his office said he would leave for there later Wednesday
and then travel onto Spain as originally planned.
	   A shadow was cast over Netanyahu's trip to Switzerland after he
participated last week in a ceremony honoring Americans and
Israelis who had campaigned against Swiss banks.
	   Those honored played a key role in winning the agreement of the
banks to pay dlrs 1.2 billion to Holocaust survivors and the heirs
of victims to settle claims for assets deposited in the banks
during World War II.
	   Swiss officials expressed their irritation over the award
ceremony but did not rescind the invitation to Netanyahu.
	   The Swiss Cabinet, the Federal Council, said after a meeting
Wednesday that Netanyahu's decision only caused greater anger.
	   The Council ``wanted to use this opportunity to express to
Netanyahu the vexation of the Swiss people and their government,''
it said in a statement.
	   A new date for the visit had not been set by either side, said
Council spokesman Achille Casanova.
	   A promised letter from Netanyahu regarding the recent conflict
had not been received in Switzerland, Casanova said.
	   Even before the cancellation was disclosed, the
Switzerland-Israel Society, which fosters closer ties between the
two countries, said relations were at a low point.
	   Israeli-Swiss relations also have been hurt by a failed spy
mission by Israel's famed Mossad agency in February. Five Mossad
were caught trying to bug an apartment building in the Swiss
capital of Bern. One agent, caught with wiretapping equipment, was
held until late April and only released after Israel paid some dlrs
2 million in bail. Israel also apologized.
	   Swiss officials said they expected the Swiss Cabinet to discuss
a new date for Netanyahu's visit later Wednesday.

French families of Pinochet victims cheer British ruling
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Family members of French citizens who disappeared
under the rule of Gen. Augusto Pinochet cheered and embraced
Wednesday when they heard that Britain's House of Lords had denied
immunity to the former Chilean dictator.
	   ``It's a victory for law and morality,'' said William Bourdon, a
lawyer representing some of those families, after passing the news
on to his clients. ``A trial of Pinochet is now possible in Paris
and in Madrid.''
	   France asked for Pinochet's extradition on Nov. 12. And on
Tuesday, a French judge issued a second international arrest
warrant for Pinochet.
	   The latest arrest order accuses Pinochet of the detention and
torture of two French citizens who disappeared after the ouster of
Chilean President Salvador Allende in 1973.
	   An earlier French warrant, issued Nov. 2, accused Pinochet in
the detention and torture of three other French citizens who
disappeared.
	   Pinochet was arrested on a Spanish arrest warrant Oct. 16 while
in a London hospital recuperating from back surgery.
	   Spanish authorities want to extradite Pinochet to face charges
of genocide during his 1973-90 rule.
	   A Chilean government report says 3,197 people were murdered or
disappeared during Pinochet's 1973-90 rule after he overthrew
Allende, an elected Marxist.

DaimlerChrysler invests in S. African car plant
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ DaimlerChrysler, the recently
merged German-U.S. automaker, Wednesday announced a 250 million
mark (dlrs 147 million) investment in its South African operations,
delivering a badly needed vote of confidence to the beleaguered
motor industry here.
	   The capital injection will be used to expand production capacity
from its current annual output of 12,000 units and to build a new
auto paint shop in East London, a port on the southeastern Indian
Ocean coast.
	   ``This investment in South Africa is a clear signal that the
country remains a strategically vital location for our company,''
said Jurgen Schrempp, DaimlerChrysler's chief executive.
	   Daimler-Benz, the German half of DaimlerChrysler, has been
manufacturing Mercedes-Benz vehicles in South Africa since 1958. It
has also more recently been exporting South African-built cars to
Australia as well as producing cars for Japan's Honda Motor Co.
	   ``I can tell you we intend to expand even more'' in South
Africa, Schrempp added in an address to plant workers attended by
South African President Nelson Mandela.
	   The investment comes at a time that auto makers in South Africa
are experiencing sharp slumps in vehicles sales and unrest among
unionized plant workers.
	   Car sales are down roughly 25 percent from a year ago, a
reflection of the economy's shift from slow-growth to a nascent
recession. Several car manufacturers have recently warned of deep
layoffs as a consequence of the sales slide.
	   South Africa's auto industry is one of the most important and
influential in the country.
	   In August the industry - which has attracted seven of the
world's largest car markers to operate assembly and manufacturing
plants in South Africa - was crippled for almost two weeks after
20,000 unionized workers walked off the job demanding higher wages.
Auto manufacturers lost millions of rand (dollars) and key
export-order contracts were threatened by the work stoppage.
	   DaimlerChysler's investment follows a 1 billion rand (dlrs 175
million) injection by German rival BMW. However, BMW officials have
repeatedly threatened to scale back their investment unless the
government did more to tame rising crime.
	   Without referring to the crime issue directly, Schrempp
underlined the importance of creating favorable trading conditions
to attract foreign investment.

NATO Secretary General Solana meeting with German Foreign minister
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Will be led after meeting starts at 1800 GMT &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ NATO chief Javier Solana was to meet with
Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer on Wednesday amid controversy over
Fischer's suggestion that NATO change its first-strike policy on
nuclear attacks.
	   Fischer, an environmentalist Greens party member and 1980s-era
anti-nuclear protester, drew criticism by saying it was no longer
necessary in the post-Cold War world for NATO to be able to launch
a nuclear attack without first being targeted.
	   Thrust into damage control during his visit to Washington this
week, Defense Minister Rudolf Scharping assured U.S. Secretary of
Defense William Cohen that Germany would continue to support NATO
policy as a full member, including its nuclear strategy.
	   Scharping and Fischer were to meet next week to adopt a common
stance on NATO's nuclear policy, Fischer's spokeswoman said
Wednesday.
	   After Fischer's comments were published Monday in the German
news magazine Der Spiegel, a foreign ministry spokesman clarified
that he was not suggesting Germany go its own way within NATO but
only trying to start a discussion among alliance members about
changing nuclear strategy.
	   Former Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel questioned the new Social
Democrat-led coalition government's real intention to maintain
continuity in foreign policy as it promised. The Greens are the
junior coalition partner.
	   ``Continuity in foreign and security policy has not
progressed,'' Kinkel said. ``We owe it to our allies to keep the
protection and deterrence strategies that protected us for 40
years.''
	   Opposition politicians with the Free Democratic Party criticized
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and Scharping for playing down
Fischer's real stand on nuclear arms.
	   Party chairman Wolfgang Gerhardt also demanded Wednesday that a
parliamentary committee be called to examine the coalition
agreement. The pact requires the government to work toward giving
up NATO'S first-strike option, designed as a deterrent against
would-be aggressors.
	   ``Saddam Hussein would certainly bring the world more insecurity
if he didn't have to expect a possible nuclear first-strike
option,'' he said.

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic fired his army chief and replaced him with a
neo-communist supporter following a long dispute over the country's
strategy and the crisis in Kosovo.
	   Gen. Momcilo Perisic was reported Wednesday to have refused a
new job as defense adviser after his differences with Milosevic
cost him the top military post. The report in Montenegro's Pobjeda
daily could not be independently confirmed.
	   Official word of the firing came late Tuesday night in a terse
release carried by the state-run Tanjug news agency. It said
Perisic's deputy, Gen. Lt. Dragoljub Ojdanic, would replace him as
chief of staff while Perisic would take the adviser's position.
	   Independent Belgrade media have reported that Perisic was an
opponent of a neo-Communist party run by Milosevic's wife, Mirjana
Markovic. Ojdanic was reported close to her party, whose officials
have recently infiltrated Yugoslavia's top security posts.
	   Perisic has indirectly criticized Milosevic's defiant and
isolationist policies toward the West by saying ``we cannot fight
against the rest of the world.'' Markovic reportedly denounced
Perisic for making such ``defeatist'' statements.
	   Independent B 92 radio said replacing Perisic with a Milosevic
ally shows Yugoslavia's ruling couple fears a coup by officers
unhappy with the country's deep political and economic troubles and
by Milosevic's financial support of the police rather than the
army, which is faced with severe budget cuts.
	   It's the fourth major shakeup at the top of Yugoslavia's
establishment in as many weeks, apparently a major reshuffling by
Milosevic of his closest circle of associates.
	   Earlier this month, he fired state security chief Jovica
Stanisic and a top official of his Socialist party, Milorad
Vucelic. Stanisic was also replaced by a neo-communist supporter.
	   Perisic led the army throughout the early 1990s when former
Yugoslavia began disintegrating. During that time the army largely
took the Serb side, helping to constitute present-day Yugoslavia,
made up of Serbia and Montenegro.
	   Perisic was appointed chief of staff in 1993, after serving as a
commander of Serb forces fighting the Croats in Croatia's 1991 war
of secession.
	   From the beginning, Perisic had a reputation of occasionally
opposing some of the Yugoslav president's iron-fist moves.
Recently, he subtly criticized Milosevic's policy in Kosovo, the
Serbian province where ethnic Albanians are fighting for
independence, saying the conflict was partly the result of
``certain politicians' wish to stay in power.''
	   Although he never commented specifically on political issues,
Perisic was believed to be intent on keeping the army as neutral as
possible in Kosovo.
	   Perisic has also maintained ties with Milosevic's foe, Milo
Djukanovic, the pro-Western president of Montenegro who disagrees
with the Yugoslav president on numerous economic and political
issues, including the Kosovo crisis.
	   At the Tuesday session of the Supreme Defense Council, the
five-member decision-making body for top defense issues, Djukanovic
voted against replacing Perisic, media in Montenegro reported.
	   Analysts in Montenegro, the small republic that with dominant
Serbia forms Yugoslavia, say Perisic's sacking heralds a possible
violent crackdown against the independent-minded Djukanovic.
	   Svetozar Marovic, speaker of Montenegro's parliament, said the
firing signified an attempt by Milosevic to ``consolidate his
autocracy.''
	   ``This is Milosevic's direct attack on Yugoslavia,'' he said.
``I think Milosevic doesn't want Yugoslavia to exist, he only wants
power.''

Iraq takes delivery of first spare parts for ailing oil industry
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LEON BARKHO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ The first shipment of spare parts for
Iraq's ailing oil industry has arrived in the country, a U.N.
spokesman in Baghdad said Wednesday.
	   A ship carrying 2,520 tons of material to treat crude oil and to
remove impurities has docked at the southern Iraqi port of Umm
Qasr, the spokesman, George Somerwill, said.
	   Iraq is in dire need of spare parts, whose shortage has caused
the quality of Iraqi crude to plunge.
	   The consignment at Umm Qasr is the first of the dlrs 300 million
worth of equipment Iraq was allowed to purchase under the current
six-monthly phase of the oil-for-food deal with the United Nations.
	   This phase, the fourth since the program's inception in December
1996, will expire at midnight Wednesday.
	   The Security Council voted Tuesday to extend the program by
another six months.
	   But that has set the stage for a confrontation with Iraq, which
wants to do away with the program on the ground that its continued
existence only entrenches the U.N. economic sanctions imposed after
Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   Iraq had tried to persuade the Security Council to merely extend
the current six-month phase by two months rather than renew it for
six months.
	   The oil-for-food program allows Iraq to sell dlrs 5.2 billion
dollars worth of oil over six months to buy humanitarian goods. But
Iraq could sell oil worth only dlrs 3.2 billion worth in the latest
phase because of low global oil prices and the poor shape of its
industry.
	   The government has not formally responded to the Security
Council's extension of the program. If Iraq rejects the extension,
it will have to stop pumping oil for export, likely jeopardizing
the U.N. humanitarian program.
	   Iraq appears to be willing to suffer that rather than go through
another six months of sanctions.
	   But the sanctions cannot be lifted until U.N. weapons inspectors
certify that Iraq is free of weapons of mass destruction.

	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Weeping with joy over a day they thought
would never come, opponents of Augusto Pinochet welcomed a British
ruling Wednesday upholding his arrest for possible extradition to
Spain and trial on charges of genocide.
	   ``It is a very important day for all humanity, not just for
Chileans'' said Ana Maria Gonzalez, a 45-year-old who fled her
native Chile after the 1973 coup in which Pinochet seized power.
	   ``I never thought I would see this day,'' Gonzalez said with
tears in her eyes. She was among dozens of demonstrators gathered
at Madrid's central Puerta del Sol to listen to the ruling on
radio.
	   Once it came in, they hugged each other and jumped up and down
under overcast skies. Others danced and sang. There were shouts of
``extradition'' and ``long live Chile without Pinochet!''
	   ``I have been waiting 23 years to see Pinochet brought to
trial,'' said Santiago Oyarzo, who said he was detained tortured
and held for over a year without a trial for giving a radical
newspaper to a friend soon after Pinochet seized power.
	   Human rights lawyers in Spain welcomed the decision by a
five-judge panel of the House of Lords as long-overdue.
	   ``Sooner or later, justice arrives,'' said Enrique Santiago, a
private attorney who has worked with Judge Baltasar Garzon in
seeking to bring Pinochet to trial in Spain. ``We think it is an
excellent decision.''
	   Virginia Diez, another lawyer involved in the proceedings,
jumped up and down in joy upon hearing the news in the Puerta del
Sol. ``At last we will bring Pinochet to trial for the savage
crimes that he has committed,'' she said.
	   ``It is great news for us. The next step is extradition,'' said
Diez.
	   Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar, speaking shortly before the
judges' ruling was announced, said Spain will respect any decision
by the British justice system.
	   It has been his conservative government's position since
Pinochet was arrested not to interfere in the judicial process,
even though the government is wary of ruffling relations with Chile
and disturbing lucrative trade ties.
	   The government opposed the human rights probe that led to
Pinochet's arrest in London on Oct. 16, but passed on Garzon's
extradition request to the British.
	   Aznar said Wednesday his government would show ``common sense
and, of course, strict observance of judicial independence.''

Protesters demand action against Jehovah's Witnesses

<TEXT>
	   GEORGIA, Tbilisi (AP) _ About 100 protesters marched across the
Georgian capital on Wednesday to demand a ban on Jehovah's
Witnesses, saying they are diverting believers from the Georgian
Orthodox Church.
	   The protesters, led by several Georgian Orthodox priests, said
the increasingly active Jehovah's Witnesses were threatening the
strength of the Orthodox Church.
	   ``The Georgian Orthodox Church has been the foundation of the
state, allowing Georgia to survive through all crises and turmoil
of the past,'' said Father Vaso, one of the protest leaders.
	   The unsanctioned protest was peaceful and ended when police
urged participants to disperse.
	   Jehovah's Witnesses have attracted thousands of new members and
opening several churches in Tbilisi, the Georgian capital, since
the 1991 Soviet collapse.
	   The government and the Georgian Orthodox Church _ which remained
the dominant religion in this Caucasus Mountains nation even under
the official atheism of the Soviet Union _ haven't interfered into
their activities.
	   In neighboring Russia, prosecutors are trying to ban Jehovah's
Witnesses under a recent religion law that allows the government to
disband any religious group it thinks is inciting hatred or
intolerant behavior.
	   Last week, a Russian court sent the case back to prosecutors,
saying they hadn't fully prepared their case.

DiMaggio, improving steadily, marks 84th birthday in hospital
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with doctor confirming player had cancer
surgery; prognosis good. &QL; 
 &UR; By MARV SCHNEIDER
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Joe DiMaggio got good news for his 84th birthday
on Wednesday: He was improving steadily after lung cancer surgery
and could be removed from intensive care by the end of the day.
	   ``The prognosis for his recovery is good,'' said Dr. Earl
Barron, the lead doctor on a team of six physicians who have been
treating the Hall of Fame baseball player in Florida.
	   Barron, in a telephone interview with The Associated Press on
Wednesday, for the first time confirmed DiMaggio had a cancerous
tumor removed from his right lung.
	   He said the surgery was done two days after DiMaggio entered the
hospital Oct. 12, and that the New York Yankees great had suffered
severe post operative complications, including a serious lung
infection.
	   ``For a while, it was touch and go, but he has been showing
steady improvement and he possibly could be out of intensive care
today,'' Barron said.
	   Because of his age, DiMaggio's progress is ``guarded,'' Barron
said, but he added that the former centerfielder's condition is
very good, compared to what it had been.
	   DiMaggio began his birthday celebration at 6 a.m. with a group
of well-wishers crowded into his room at Memorial Regional Hospital
in Hollywood, Florida. Among them were his brother Dom, also a
former major league outfielder; Dom's wife, Emily; DiMaggio's
granddaughter Paula and her husband, Jim; his lawyer and longtime
friend, Morris Engelberg; Barron; and a couple of nurses.
	   Barron said DiMaggio still was on a respirator, but the setting
was 50 percent of what it had been at the height of the crisis, and
he could be weaned from it by the end of the week.
	   The main problem was a buildup of fluid in DiMaggio's lungs as
the result of the infection, and at one point, an opening was made
in his trachea to help his breathing.
	   Barron said DiMaggio had never had a heart attack, contrary to
television reports earlier this week.
	   ``It was a tremendous drop in blood pressure, and it scared the
life out of me,'' said Engelberg, who has been acting as DiMaggio's
spokesman.
	   Engelberg said he became so concerned by the DiMaggio's critical
turn on Nov. 16 that a Roman Catholic priest was summoned to give
last rites.
	   ``But I came in the next morning and there he was, shaving
himself,'' said Engelberg. ``He's amazing.''
	   Engelberg said DiMaggio had instructed him not to divulge any
medical information about his condition, but because of recent
erroneous TV reports, DiMaggio agreed to allow Barron to speak with
the AP.

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Brussels (AP) _ The world's largest industrial merger
_ British Petroleum Co. PLC's planned purchase of Amoco Corp. _
should get clearance by European Union regulators soon, the EU's
top antitrust watchdog said Wednesday.
	   ``It looks like we can indeed authorize the operation,'' EU
Competition Commissioner Karel Van Miert told reporters. He
declined to say if the EU would attach conditions to the approval.
	   An aide to Van Miert said the decision was expected in
mid-December.
	   BP agreed in August to pay dlrs 48 billion for Amoco Corp.,
creating the world's No. 3 oil giant in the biggest-ever foreign
takeover of an American company.
	   Lawyers following the case have said the merger is not likely to
trigger serious EU antitrust alarms.
	   The EU's executive body, the European Commission checks all
mergers with a major impact on EU markets and can demand changes or
veto those judged harmful to fair competition.

Latest resignation jeopardizes government
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VILNIUS, Lithuania (AP) - Prime Minister Gediminas Vagnorius on
Wednesday accepted the resignation of Transport Minister Algis
Zvaliauskas, but may be forced to reseek Parliament's approval for
his government to continue in power.
	   Zvaliauskas resigned Tuesday after an ethics committee ruled he
had abused his position by spending part of a state-funded visit to
Sweden on a hunting expedition.
	   The latest resignation is the ninth in the original 17-member
Cabinet since 1996. Lithuanian law stipulates that if more than
half of the government resigns during a single term in office, it
needs to get parliamentary approval to stay in power.
	   However, the center-right Cabinet has 68 lawmakers in the
138-member legislature, and likely would be reelected to power.
	   A new transport minister is expected to be appointed next week.

Arafat: Palestinians will do everything possible to declare state

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat said Wednesday
that Palestinians would ``do everything possible'' to establish an
independent state on May 4, 1999.
	   ``I must say clearly that we will do everything possible to
establish our Palestinian state on May 4, 1999, the end of the
five-year interim period,'' Arafat said, speaking after a luncheon
with French President Jacques Chirac. He spoke in Arabic, which was
translated into French.
	   May 4, 1999 will mark the expiration of the interim framework of
peace talks, which includes the Wye land-for-peace accord signed
last month in Washington.
	   Previous Palestinian threats to unilaterally declare an
independent state have angered Israel.
	   In his remarks to reporters, Arafat accused Israel of acting
unilaterally in confiscating territory and building new
settlements.
	   ``You know very well how patient our people can be,'' Arafat
said. ``But there are limits to this patience.''

EU set to extend suspension of aid to Togo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - European Union aid to Togo should
remain suspended because the country fails to meet democratic
standards, the EU's executive body said Wednesday.
	   The European Commission said it was breaking off consultations
with the Togolese government after months of talks left it
unconvinced recent presidential elections were fair.
	   The EU last year suspended the 68 million European currency unit
(dlrs 80 million) aid program earmarked for Togo under the Lome
Convention, the EU's trade-and-aid agreement with 71 African,
Caribbean and Pacific countries.
	   The decision to extend the suspension needs approval from the 15
member nations.
	   The Union said presidential elections held in June were unfair.
President Gnassigbe Eyadema's party proclaimed him winner after the
top electoral officer resigned. Protests against Eyadema were
crushed.
	   Eyadema has ruled the small West African country for 31 years
since taking power as a military dictator.

Agassi retires in match against Corretja
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with quotes, Rios to stay in tournament &QL; 
 &UR; By NESHA STARCEVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HANOVER, Germany (AP) _ Andre Agassi, who has been battling a
back injury, retired in his opening match Wednesday at the ATP
World Championship against Alex Corretja.
	   Corretja was ahead 5-7, 6-3, 2-1 when Agassi quit during a
changeover, just after having his service broken.
	   ``It was definitely painful even this morning in my warmup. I
needed to give it a go, at least try to keep the points short,''
Agassi said.
	   ``But I hit a swinging volley and when I twisted it was just
like somebody stuck a knife in me. Pretty soon it got quite
pointless,'' he said.
	   Agassi said he would wait until tomorrow before deciding whether
to continue the tournament, which is possible under its round-robin
format, but added that he would be surprised if he played.
	   Agassi, the 1990 champion in the elite tournament, injured his
back Monday when he fell while practicing with Corretja. Agassi
skipped Monday's draw ceremony and was given a Wednesday start to
have more time to recover and to receive treatment.
	   In 1995, Agassi qualified for the event but could not play
because of injury and in 1996 he quit after playing one match.
	   Later Wednesday, Pete Sampras played Carlos Moya and Yevgeny
Kafelnikov battled Karol Kucera.
	   On Tuesday, Pete Sampras began his quest to secure the No. 1
ranking for a record sixth year.
	   Marcelo Rios, the only player who can threaten Sampras, lost to
Tim Henman 7-5, 6-1 and blamed a recurring back injury for his poor
performance.
	   Rios told reporters Wednesday that he consulted a doctor and
would continue in the tournament.
	   Sampras leads Rios by a slim 33 points in the computer rankings
and he is seeking to make history by becoming the first man to
finish as No. 1 for six years in a row. He shares the record of
five with Jimmy Connors.
	   Kicking off the season-ending dlrs 3.5 million event that brings
together the top eight players of the year, Sampras posted an
impressive 6-2, 6-4 victory over Kafelnikov.
	   Rios needs to do better than Sampras at the tournament to have a
shot at the No. 1 and with his painful back this looks a like
distant prospect now.
	   Rios, who has held the No. 1 spot for a total of six weeks this
year and leads the tour with seven titles, could have grabbed the
top spot again two weeks ago in Santiago but he crashed out in the
quarterfinals.
	   Spending 15 hours on a plane and switching back to a hard indoor
court from clay didn't help his back either, Rios said.
	   Sampras on the other hand looked in perfect condition after
taking a break following six grueling weeks on the indoor circuit
in Europe.
	   ``It was good to let my body and mind rest. I'm obviously very
fresh in the legs,'' he said.
	   Sampras cruised in the first set with his sharp serve-and-volley
game. Kafelnikov gave him more of a battle in the second set but
Sampras still dominated the opponent he beat in last year's final,
when he won the title for the fourth time. Sampras
	   ``I don't want to say it was a statement, but I definitely was
very focused,'' Sampras said. ``I think the guys know that, that
this is an important week and it showed.''
	   ``I just hope I can maintain this level throughout the week,
which is not going to be easy. But today was definitely a good
start,'' Sampras said.

Swiss prosecutor satisfied by Pinochet ruling
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Britain-Pinochet, Spain-Pinochet &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The prosecutor behind Switzerland's extradition
request for former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet expressed
``great satisfaction'' Wednesday at a ruling that he is not immune
from arrest.
	   The decision ``marks an evolution in British justice,'' Geneva
State Prosecutor Bernard Bertossa said.
	   Although Switzerland says Spain's extradition request has
priority, it should maintain its own request, Bertossa added.
	   The 3-2 decision by Britain's highest court means Pinochet must
remain in custody while Spain seeks his extradition for killings
and torture by his security forces.
	   Pinochet was arrested in London last month on an arrest warrant
from Spanish magistrate Baltasar Garzon, who is seeking his
extradition on charges of genocide, torture and terrorism during
his 17-year rule which ended 1990.
	   Switzerland subsequently requested Pinochet's arrest with a view
to extradition on charges of murder, kidnapping and torture.
	   The move followed a criminal complaint filed in Geneva by the
widow of Alexis Jaccard, a student of Swiss-Chilean dual
nationality who disappeared in Argentina in May 1977.

Police offer award for missing first edition of Copernicus theory
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ A man who used stolen documents to pose as
a researcher stole a first edition of astronomer Nicholas
Copernicus' 16th century theory on planetary motion by saying he
had to go to the bathroom.
	   Police offered a dlrs 2,900 reward Wednesday for information
that helps recover the book, one of 260 copies of the first edition
of Copernicus' ``De revolutionibus orbium coelestium'' (Concerning
the revolutions of the heavenly spheres).
	   The theory established the foundation of modern astronomy by
saying the sun, and not the earth, was the center of the universe
with other planets, including the earth, revolving around it.
	   The book was printed in Nuremberg in 1543, when Copernicus was
on his deathbed.
	   Eugeniusz Szczerbak, deputy police chief in the southern city of
Krakow, said a middle-aged man asked to see the work on Tuesday at
the library of the Polish Academy of Sciences.
	   Saying he had to use the toilet, the man left with the book,
valued at dlrs 320,000, Szczerbak said.
	   Researchers are allowed to study old books and documents at the
library. The suspect showed library workers stolen identification
documents, Szczerbak said.
	   Police opened an investigation Tuesday and informed Interpol,
the international police agency.

Serb police reportedly kill KLA fighter
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serbian police on Wednesday killed a
Kosovo Liberation Army guerrilla while repelling an attack by a
group of armed rebels in Kosovo, the Serb Media Center said.
	   The shootout occurred around noon on a road near Rakovina, close
to the southwestern Kosovo town of Djakovica, the pro-Serb center
said.
	   The report could not be independently confirmed.
	   A regular police patrol came under machine-gun fire and grenade
launchers from the rebels and returning fire, the police killed
39-year old Isuf Oluri, the center said.
	   Oluri wore a camouflage uniform with the KLA insignia and
carried a grenade launcher, the report said.
	   In the cellar of a nearby roadside house, next to a road
barricade set up by the rebels, police discovered an automatic
rifle, a stash of KLA uniforms and food supplies, the center said.

Israel puts final touches on land route between West Bank and Gaza
</HEADLINE>
Strip &QL; 
 &UR; By NASSER SHIYOUKHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TARKUMIYA, West Bank (AP) _ Keeping a promise under the new
peace agreement, Israel on Wednesday erected a military check post
that will mark the starting point of an 80-kilometer (50-mile) land
route for Palestinians between the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
	   Israel and the Palestinians still need to settle a few minor
points, but expect to sign a protocol for operating the so-called
``safe passage'' through Israel next week, said Palestinian
negotiator Abdel Razek al Yehiyeh.
	   Under last month's Wye River peace accord, the safe passage is
to open four weeks after the protocol is signed.
	   The route will make it easier for Palestinians to travel between
the West Bank and Gaza and will give a boost to trade.
	   Currently, travelers have to apply for an entry permit into
Israel, a process that can take days, but have to leave their cars
at home.
	   Under the new rules, Israel will issue permits valid for a year
to those wishing to use the safe passage. Cars are permitted, but
require separate stickers. Israel has the right to turn down
requests by those considered a security risk.
	   Once the safe passage opens, West Bank residents will have
easier access to Gaza International Airport which opened Tuesday
and will soon offer regular flights to several Arab capitals.
	   Al Yehiyeh said the land route would stay open during Israeli
security closures which have been imposed repeatedly in the past in
response to terror attacks by Islamic militants on Israelis. During
closures, Israel seals the West Bank and Gaza, barring all
Palestinians from entering Israel.
	   The new land route, using existing roads, begins at the village
of Tarkumiya, near the West Bank town of Hebron, cuts westward
through Israel, and swerves south to Gaza just before the Israeli
coastal town of Ashkelon.
	   On Wednesday, bulldozers cleared dirt and rocks around the new
Tarkumiya check post. A sign in Arabic, English and Hebrew read
``Safe Passage Entrance.''
	   Another sign directed travelers to a fortified inspection area
where travel permits and cars will be checked.
	   After future negotiations, a second safe passage route will link
the West Bank town of Ramallah, the Palestinians' commercial
center, with Gaza.
	   Hatem Fatafta, 21, a Hebron university student watching
Wednesday's construction, said he has never been to Gaza because of
the difficulties of such a trip. ``I would love to go there to sit
on the beach and eat fish,'' he said.
	   Near the West Bank village of Ein Arik, meanwhile, Palestinians
protesting the construction of a bypass road for Jewish settlers
ignited a fuel tank, forcing Israeli workers to leave the area.
	   After approving a West Bank troop pullback this month, Israel's
government authorized the construction of 13 new access roads to
Jewish settlements.
	   Palestinians oppose the road projects, which require the
expropriation of thousands of acres (hectares) of Palestinian-owned
land.

EU files grievance with WTO over U.S. anti-dumping legislation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Union on Wednesday filed a
complaint with the World Trade Organization over a U.S.
anti-dumping law that the EU claims discriminates against sales of
EU steel products in the United States.
	   The EU executive commission said it decided on the action after
a first round of WTO-led discussions with the United States failed.
	   ``The EU believes the 1916 Anti-Dumping Act, which prohibits the
import and sale of goods on the U.S. market when the price is lower
than in the country of production, breaks WTO rules,'' the EU
executive commission said in a statement.
	   The commission's decision, which followed complaints by the EU
steel industry, is also the latest in a series of trade tiffs
between the EU and the United States.
	   The two sides are also squabbling over the EU's banana import
system that the Clinton administration claims is in violation of
WTO rules because it unfairly favors imports from former European
colonies.

Benelux stock exchanges form alliance
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ The Amsterdam, Brussels and
Luxembourg stock exchanges said Wednesday they have formed a pact
allowing members access to each other's markets starting Jan. 4.
	   The collaboration will put the three bourses in a good position
for the fast-approaching launch of the single European currency,
the Amsterdam Stock Exchange said. The new currency, known as the
euro, debuts on Jan. 1.
	   The Benelux alliance will make a member of one exchange ``more
or less automatically recognized as a member of the other two
exchanges,'' the Amsterdam bourse said in a statement.
	   Members still would have to comply with the countries'
particular administrative requirements.
	   The cooperation also will allow mutual access to each other's
markets by integrating their networks, including the installation
of reciprocal telecommunication lines.
	   In the future, the three bourses plan to further harmonize their
market regulations.
	   The Benelux agreement comes two days ahead of a meeting in Paris
of officials from nine stock exchanges seeking to form a
pan-European stock market.
	   The exchanges planning to participate in the Paris meeting are
London, Frankfurt, Amsterdam, Madrid, Milan, Paris, Brussels,
Zurich and Stockholm.
	   It was not immediately clear whether the Benelux accord meant
that Luxembourg also would join a pan-European exchange.

BP shareholders approve Amoco acquisition

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Shareholders of British Petroleum PLC on Wednesday
gave overwhelming support to the company's merger with Amoco Corp.,
the largest industrial merger in U.S. history, worth dlrs 58
billion.
	   The 99.8 percent majority vote ``keeps us firmly on track to
meet our target of closing the deal by the end of the year, BP
chief executive Sir John Browne said.
	   Amoco shareholders are to vote on the proposed merger in Chicago
on Dec. 10.
	   BP, the world's third-largest oil company, agreed in August to
acquire Amoco.
	   To secure shareholder approval, BP required a 75 percent
majority of the shares voted. The company said that the yes vote
constituted a majority of 99.82 percent.
	   The new company would be the second-biggest gasoline retailer in
the United States, behind a joint venture that covers Shell and
Texaco gasoline stations. Existing BP stations would be converted
to Amoco.

Printing press turns away Belarusian paper for mocking president
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MINSK, Belarus (AP) _ A Belarusian newspaper was turned out of a
printing house Wednesday for trying to run a composite photograph
ridiculing the country's authoritarian President Alexander
Lukashenko.
	   The composite, which the weekly Imya planned to run in its
Thursday issue, showed Lukashenko as a convict behind barbed wire,
with the caption: ``People, I suffer together with you.''
	   Lukashenko, who has harshly cracked down on dissent and
independent media in Belarus, insists that he shares all the
economic hardships of ordinary people in the former Soviet
republic.
	   Imya, a weekly with a circulation of 28,000, has long been
persecuted by authorities and for a while was printed abroad. It
has lately been using a private Belarusian printing firm called
Magic.
	   But on Wednesday, printing firm head Yuri Butko called the
newspaper's editor-in-chief Irina Khalip to say he could not print
the issue.
	   ``Printing plant workers called me, they are horrified,'' the
editor quoted Butko as saying.
	   Magic has also suffered government persecution, and authorities
threatened to take away Butko's license two years ago. Butko told

Swiss prosecutor, international jurists satisfied by Pinochet

ruling &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comment from International Commission of
Jurists. &QL; 
 &UR; With Britain-Pinochet, Spain-Pinochet &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The prosecutor behind Switzerland's extradition
request for former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet expressed
``great satisfaction'' Wednesday at a ruling that he is not immune
from arrest.
	   The decision ``marks an evolution in British justice,'' Geneva
State Prosecutor Bernard Bertossa said.
	   Meanwhile, an influential commission of jurists based in Geneva
said it ``wholeheartedly welcomes'' the ruling.
	   ``Today's ruling by the highest court in England is a very
important victory in the fight for accountability of perpetrators
of crimes against humanity and other international crimes,'' the
International Commission of Jurists said in a statement.
	   ``The ruling protects future potential victims of human rights
violations,'' ICJ Secretary General Adama Dieng said.
	   The 3-2 decision by Britain's highest court means Pinochet must
remain in custody while Spain seeks his extradition for killings
and torture by his security forces.
	   Pinochet was arrested in London last month on an arrest warrant
from Spanish magistrate Baltasar Garzon, who is seeking his
extradition on charges of genocide, torture and terrorism during
his 17-year rule which ended 1990.
	   Although Switzerland says Spain's extradition request has
priority, it should maintain its own request, Bertossa said.
	   Switzerland subsequently requested Pinochet's arrest with a view
to extradition on charges of murder, kidnapping and torture.
	   The move followed a criminal complaint filed in Geneva by the
widow of Alexis Jaccard, a student of Swiss-Chilean dual
nationality who disappeared in Argentina in May 1977.

Italian club still hoping for neutral site
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TURIN, Italy (AP) _ Juventus will petition UEFA to move its
Champions League match at Istanbul's Galatasaray to a neutral venue
if anti-Italian sentiment in Turkey continues.
	   European soccer's governing body already has moved the game,
originally slated for Wednesday, to Dec. 2, because of tensions
over Italy's refusal to extradite Turkish Kurd rebel leader
Abdullah Ocalan.
	   But Juventus president Vittorio Chiusani Ocalan told the
Turin-based newspaper Tuttosport, in an interview published
Wednesday, that his club doubts the situation will be any calmer in
a week.
	   ``Eight days, in effect, are almost nothing,'' Chiusani is
quoted as saying. ``We had told UEFA that there were not the proper
conditions to play in Istanbul and we will do the same on the eve
of Dec. 2, unless the situation improves.''
	   Juve's players, meanwhile, are sticking to their threats to
refuse to play the match in Turkey.
	   ``We won't go to Istanbul. It's too risky,'' French midfielder
Zinedine Zidane said. ``I speak only for myself, but all of my
teammates think the same way. Galatasaray-Juventus should be played
in a country other than Turkey.''

Repentant thieves leave pre-Incan cloak in confessional booth in
</HEADLINE>
Peru &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LIMA, Peru (AP) _ Repentant thieves who stole a precious Indian
cloak covered in yellow-and-blue parrot feathers from a Peruvian
museum returned it in a church confessional booth, authorities said
Wednesday.
	   Officials in the southern city of Arequipa found the 6
1/2-foot-by-2-foot (2-meter-by-0.6 meter) ceremonial garment in a
black garbage bag Tuesday in La Merced church after receiving a tip
from an anonymous caller telling them where to find it.
	   The cloak was stolen last week from Arequipa's municipal museum
and replaced by a chicken-feather imitation, said the director of
community services in Arequipa, Walter Espinoza.
	   The cloak was woven from alpaca wool and adorned with 560
feathers by the Wari Indian culture, which thrived in Peru's
southern highlands between 800 and 1200 A.D.
	   It was discovered in 1943 during an archaeological dig in the
mountainous province of Condesuyos, in the department of Arequipa.
	   The looting of archaeological sites, museums and colonial
churches by thieves is a major problem in ruin-rich Peru, which was
the home to the great Inca, Nazca and Moche cultures.

Sharon cancels visit to United States due to Cabinet crisis
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon canceled
an upcoming visit to the United States Wednesday in order to help
solve a crisis within the government.
	   Sharon had been slated to head the Israeli delegation at a
50-nation conference of donors to the Palestinian Authority taking
place in Washington Nov. 30.
	   In addition, Sharon has been scheduled to meet with U.S.
Secretary Madeleine Albright and members of Congress to discuss
Israeli aid requests to pay for troop withdrawals and new security
arrangements in the West Bank as a result of the latest
U.S.-brokered Mideast peace accord.
	   A foreign ministry statement said the delegation to the
conference would be led by the ministry's director-general, Eitan
Ben Tsur. A new date for Sharon's trip has not been set.
	   Earlier Wednesday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu canceled a
trip to Switzerland in order to put his crumbling coalition in
order by seeking the return of a moderate deserter whose support
could be critical to the survival of the government.
	   Netanyahu's coalition government was weakened after he failed to
win support from hard-liners for the land-for-peace deal with the
Palestinians signed last month in Washington.

Sampras wins again, Agassi retires in match against Corretja,
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Sampras beating Moya &QL; 
 &UR; By NESHA STARCEVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HANOVER, Germany (AP) _ Pete Sampras clinched a place in the ATP
World Championship semifinals and moved closer to securing the No.
1 ranking for a record sixth year in a row when he beat Carlos Moya
6-3, 6-3 on Wednesday.
	   Earlier, Andre Agassi, who has been battling a back injury,
retired in his opening match against Alex Corretja.
	   Sampras improved his record in the round-robin portion of the
tournament to 2-0, while Moya, the French Open champion, dropped to
1-1.
	   The two victories so far are enough for Sampras to reach the
semifinals, either as winner of his group or as second.
	   Sampras fired 13 aces in overwhelming Moya in 62 minutes after
another impressive performance in the championship he has won four
times.
	   ``I put him under a lot of pressure and he made quite a few
mistakes from the baseline that he normally wouldn't do,'' Sampras
said after his second quick victory. On Monday, he beat Yevgeny
Kafelnikov 6-2, 6-4.
	   Corretja was ahead 5-7, 6-3, 2-1 when Agassi quit during a
changeover, just after having his service broken.
	   ``It was definitely painful even this morning in my warmup. I
needed to give it a go, at least try to keep the points short,''
Agassi said.
	   ``But I hit a swinging volley and when I twisted it was just
like somebody stuck a knife in me. Pretty soon it got quite
pointless,'' he said.
	   Agassi said he would wait until tomorrow before deciding whether
to continue the tournament, which is possible under its round-robin
format, but added that he would be surprised if he played.
	   Agassi, the 1990 champion in the elite tournament of the top
eight players of the year, injured his back Monday when he fell
while practicing with Corretja. Agassi skipped Monday's draw
ceremony and was given a Wednesday start to have more time to
recover and to receive treatment.
	   In 1995, Agassi qualified for the event but could not play
because of injury and in 1996 he quit after playing one match.
	   Although he has surged back No. 4 this year after falling as low
as No. 141 at the same time last year, Agassi has not done well at
major tournaments this season.
	   ``The year has been great for me in many respects, but the great
tournaments have been pretty disappointing,'' Agassi said. ``I've
worked really hard and had to grind week after week to get myself
in position, only to struggle when I got into position.''
	   Sampras leads Marcelo Rios by a slim 33 points in the computer
rankings and he is seeking to make history by becoming the first
man to finish as No. 1 for six years in a row. He shares the record
of five with Jimmy Connors.
	   Rios, the only player who can threaten Sampras, lost to Tim
Henman 7-5, 6-1 on Monday and blamed a recurring back injury for
his poor performance.
	   But Rios told reporters Wednesday that he would continue the
tournament. He was not scheduled to play Wednesday.
	   In the last match of the day, Kafelnikov played Karol Kucera.

Proposed nuclear regulations anger German industry
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Proposed changes to Germany's nuclear
energy regulations could endanger talks between industry and
government on eliminating nuclear power, an industry official said
Wednesday.
	   Werner Hlubek, chairman of the RWE power company, claimed the
government is trying to set preconditions for the talks. The
proposed changes include halting nuclear waste reprocessing and
limiting transports of nuclear waste, according to a report
Wednesday in the newspaper Die Welt.
	   Germany's new center-left government, led by the Social
Democrats with the environmentalist Greens as a junior coalition
partner, announced soon after its election in September a goal of
banning nuclear energy.
	   Government talks with power industry leaders are to be held in
1999. If the two sides do not reach an agreement, the government
said it plans to enact laws against the use of nuclear power.
Environmentalist say atomic waste exudes radiation and cannot be
rendered harmless.
	   ``We always assumed that the consensus talks would take place
without preconditions and without a pre-ordained result,'' Hlubek
said.
	   The Environment Ministry would not confirm the specifics of the
proposed regulation changes outlined in the newspaper report. It
said only that it would present a first draft to parliament in
December.
	   ``The idea is to give the talks a political direction by
establishing some things which are non-negotiable,'' ministry
spokesman Franz Emde said.
	   Nuclear energy supplies about a third of Germany's power. The
German Nuclear Forum, the industry's powerful lobby group, argues
that shutting down nuclear plants would eliminate some 40,000
highly skilled jobs.

Homeless Kurds fear Greek winter
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ More than 1,000 Iraqi Kurdish refugees
stranded in Athens do everything out in the open.
	   For over two years, the homeless people known as the Kurds of
Koumoundourou Square have tried to live a normal life. There are
cut-price barbers, benches selling contraband cigarettes, stalls
made of covered baby carriages serving kebab and tea.
	   But a snap of winter weather and sinking morale have heightened
calls to put a roof _ any roof _ over their heads.
	   ``It has started raining and it is cold,'' Abu Ali, a refugee
committee leader, said Wednesday. ``There are many children here.
families in the street. We are human beings.''
	   Ali spoke at an open-air news conference called by Kurds and
volunteer groups to press authorities to grant the Kurds refugee
status and provide them with shelter.
	   Aid groups propose using old factory buildings to house the
refugees and warn of serious consequences if they spend another
winter outdoors in the square, located in a blue-collar
neighborhood.
	   But the government says it has tried to alleviate their problems
by placing thousands in refugee camps around the country. It can't
stop those who wander back to the capital and the square looking
for work.
	   An estimated 50,000 Iraqi Kurds illegally enter Greece each
year, seeking political asylum or illegal transport to western
Europe. Nearly all are economic refugees.
	   Greece is a common first stop for Kurds fleeing northern Iraq, a
semi-autonomous region protected from Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein since 1991 by a U.S.-led air force based in Turkey.
	   But although most have fared well in the square, their numbers
have started to swell as fast the waters that flooded the grassy
area during a severe storm this week which caused widespread damage
around Greece.
	   Kurds took cover in building entrances, wrapped in blankets,
carpets and plastic sheeting. A few dozen squatted in abandoned
buildings, but were forced out by police or face imminent eviction.
	   Problems are compounded by their number and the complexity of
their situation. Unlike economic immigrants from eastern Europe,
Kurds usually ask for refugee status.
	   Those eligible have been placed on enormous waiting lists by
agencies drowning in paperwork created by hundreds of thousands of
illegal immigrants seeking residence permits.
	   Most Koumoundourou Square Kurds live in legal limbo, fed and
clothed by churches, charities and local residents.
	   But the goodwill is wearing thin.
	   ``Their conditions are terrible. They live worse than cats and
dogs. We really feel sorry for them,'' said Maria, an elderly
woman, who has lived on the square for 20 years. She did not want
to give her full name.
	   ``But the shops have no business. And we can't go out our
homes,'' she said. ``These people have nowhere to wash and nowhere
to go to the toilet. It smells bad and there is a danger of
disease.''

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday
struck a tentative deal to bring his former foreign minister, David
Levy, back to the government in an effort to strengthen his fragile
coalition.
	   Hard-liners in Netanyahu's government have been threatening to
leave over the land-for-security agreement with the Palestinians,
thus robbing Netanyahu of his majority in parliament.
	   Without such a majority, Netanyahu would either have to call
early elections or try to bring other parties into his coalition.
	   Levy's return would not be enough to guarantee the survival of
Netanyahu's government. Political commentators said Wednesday that
the prime minister wanted Levy back in the fold so he would be in a
stronger position when opening negotiations with the main
opposition party, Labor, to join the government.
	   In a sign that a so-called ``national unity government'' was
becoming a possibility, three influential Cabinet ministers _
Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon, Trade Minister Natan Sharansky and
Finance Minister Yaakov Neeman _ said it might be a good idea for
Netanyahu to start courting Labor.
	   Sharon canceled a trip to Washington in order to deal with the
coalition crisis.

Mbeki brushes off concerns about buying Swedish warplanes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Just days after his government
announced plans to buy Swedish warplanes, South African Vice
President Thabo Mbeki was barraged Wednesday with questions about
whether the country should be using the money for social services
instead.
	   Mbeki dismissed the implied criticisms pointedly, suggesting
that Swedes posing the questions were being more moralistic than
pragmatic.
	   ''We want to have a defense force ... So long as it is there it
has to be equipped,'' he said at a news conference.
	   ''Maybe if Sweden said 'It's all right, don't worry, we'll take
care of your defense interests, that would be very nice for us _
and let Sweden pay for it, that would be very nice indeed,'' he
said.
	   South Africa announced last week that it planned to buy 28
Sweish-made JAS Gripen warplanes. The announcement of the
15-billion-kronor (dlrs 2 billion) plan was greeted happily in the
Swedish business community; no country other than Sweden has so far
bought the planes.
	   But critics say South Africa could better use the money by
building houses and clinics for its poor.
	   ''The argument is a false argument,'' Mbeki said. ''The idea
that the money that you are using to acquire defense equipment is
necessarily money that is being diverted from housing is ...
emotionally appealing but it is wrong.''
	   Mbeki said keeping the defense forces in good shape was
especially important to South Africa's aim of being a regional
peacekeeper.
	   ''We cannot say that we don't have responsibility for
peacekeeping processes on the African continent because we need to
build a house,'' he said. ''It's not a responsibility we can run
away from.''

IMF mission to visit Ukraine to check compliance with loan terms
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VIKTOR LUHOVYK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ A delegation from the International
Monetary Fund will visit Ukraine next week to check on whether it
is meeting conditions for the next installment of a dlrs 2.2
billion loan, Ukraine's central bank chief said Wednesday.
	   The IMF approved a three-year aid package of dlrs 2.2 billion in
September and already has disbursed about dlrs 340 million of it.
Approval of each new tranche is conditioned on Ukraine's sticking
to its projected budget deficit, inflation and foreign currency
reserves.
	   The IMF mission is scheduled to arrive in Kiev on Dec. 1,
National Bank head Viktor Yushchenko said.
	   Another delegation visited Ukraine earlier this month but left
without announcing whether it qualified for the next tranche.
	   The IMF expressed concerns at the time over the government's
failure to raise enough revenues, and said reforms in the key
sectors of Ukrainian economy _ energy and agriculture _ and
administrative reform were going too slowly.
	   The fund also criticized Ukraine's proposals to print money to
pay off some government debts.
	   Ukraine's leaders have since urged the IMF to soften its lending
conditions, namely those concerning tax collection and social
welfare payments, saying the cash-strapped government is unlikely
to implement them.
	   Yushchenko said the IMF and Ukraine are working on possible
revisions to the loan deal.
	   ``I'm sure we'll win the December discussion with the IMF,'' he
told reporters.
	   The government is owed more than 9 billion hryvna (dlrs 2.6
billion) in unpaid taxes, while the government's debt in unpaid
pensions and wages to state workers has been rising for years and
now tops 3 billion hryvna (dlrs 875 million).
	   Ukraine maintains it needs foreign aid to repay its mounting
foreign debt before it can improve tax collection and introduce
reforms needed to boost economic growth.
	   The continuing economic crisis in Ukraine has been aggravated by
the recent turmoil in neighboring Russia and has scared away
private foreign investors.

Hoechst confirms merger talks with French firm Rhone-Poulenc
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Confirming week's of speculation,
Hoechst AG said Wednesday that it was in merger talks with France's
Rhone-Poulenc, which if successful would create the world's largest
pharmaceutical firm.
	   An announcement on the outcome was expected as early as next
week, but Hoechst cautioned ``no guarantee can be made as to the
outcome of the current discussions.''
	   The merged firm would be worth some 80 billion marks (dlrs 50
billion), and analysts projected that sales in its pharmaceutical
sector would outstrip market leader Glaxo Wellcome's.
	   Hoechst's annual sales are estimated at about 22 billion (dlrs
13.75 billion) marks, with Rhone-Poulenc at 17.5 billion (dlrs 11
billion).
	   The new company would have two headquarters, one for
pharmaceuticals in Frankfurt and for agrochemicals in Lyon, France.
The two companies together employ 180,000 people.
	   Analyst said the merger would improve the companies' market
share, while enabling the combined firm to save hundreds of
millions of marks (dollars) a year in the pharmaceutical sector by
fusing areas where they overlap, including cancer and allergy
treatments.
	   A union leader, however, voiced concern over the proposed
merger, saying he feared jobs would be lost because of the
identical product ranges and questioning the financial fitness of
either company to enter such a deal.
	   Rainer Krumlehn, a supervisory board member as well as a leader
of the IGBCE workers' union, estimated the groups' high level of
corporate debt at between 25 billion and 30 billion marks (dlrs 15
billion-dlrs 18 billion).
	   ``We're on red-alert,'' Krumlehn said.
	   Hoechst's supervisory board _ one-third of which is comprised of
employee representatives _ meets to vote on another matter Dec. 8:
the proposal to merge its industrial chemicals units in an
independent company. The Rhone-Poulenc talks were not on the
agenda, Krumlehn said.
	   Sources familiar with the talks also said that Hoechst would
have to get the go-ahead from German pharmaceutical maker Schering,
with which it shares a pesticide joint venture.

Italian Communist party says it helped Kurdish rebel leader come to

	   ROME (AP) _ Italy's hard-line Communist party revealed Wednesday
that it helped Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan come to Italy
to seek political asylum, a venture that has provoked a bitter
standoff with Turkey and put the Kurdish question on the front
burner throughout Europe.
	   Ramon Mantovani, who is in charge of foreign affairs for the
Communist Refoundation Party, said he accompanied Ocalan to Rome
from Moscow on Nov. 12. He said it was Ocalan's idea to seek asylum
in Italy.
	   ``We just provided help, without informing the Italian
government,'' Mantovani told reporters.
	   Ocalan was arrested when he arrived in Rome, using a false
passport, and detained for a week. Turkey is stridently demanding
his extradition, but an Italian court freed Ocalan, ruling that
Italian law forbids extraditing suspects to a country where they
face the death penalty. That further enraged Turkey.
	   ``We were just helping the Kurds find a way to start peace
talks. Our action will force Italy and Europe to finally_ and I
hope definitively _ face the Kurdish issue,'' Mantovani said.
	   Mantovani said Ocalan's people contacted Refoundation on Nov. 11
and said the rebel leader wanted to come to Italy. ``They wanted
our advice so I told them I would travel to Moscow to meet
Ocalan,'' Mantovani said.
	   The lawmaker flew to Moscow on Nov. 12 and Russian officials
took him to the rebel leader, who was waiting for him at the
airport, he said.
	   ``He told me he had two choices: Going back to the mountains and
fighting with the guerrillas or trying initiate peace talks,
something he said he wanted _ and had _ to do,'' Mantovani said.
``He had every intention of getting on the first plane to Rome.''
	   Refoundation's stunning revelation comes after numerous reports
_ denied by the government _ that Ocalan had a secret deal paving
his way to Italy.
	   Refoundation is part of the opposition, but its role in the
Ocalan affair still has the potential to embarrass the new
center-left government. The government is headed by a former
Communist and its justice minister belongs to a Communist party
which only recently broke away from Refoundation.
	   Ocalan leads the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, which has been
waging a war for Kurdish autonomy in southeastern Turkey for 14
years. Turkey considers him a terrorist and its most-wanted
fugitive. Ocalan is being tried in absentia in Turkey for capital
crimes.
	   Germany also has a warrant out for Ocalan but has said it won't
ask for his extradition, a decision that leaves Italy stuck with an
extremely volatile diplomatic dilemma.
	   Granting Ocalan asylum would further enrage Turkey, a NATO ally
and major trading partner, as well as the United States, which
considers Ocalan a terrorist and wants him prosecuted. It could
also make Italy a mecca for Kurdish activists.
	   The European Union has been drawn into the conflict as well,
backing Italy against Turkish trade boycotts.
	   Italy has a small population of Kurdish exiles, about 1,000,
compared to Germany, with around 400,000.
	   There are around 20 to 25 million Kurds spread out over Turkey,
Syria, Iraq and Iran; some 12 to 15 million live in Turkey.
	   Ocalan lived in Syria for years until his expulsion in October,
forced by Turkish pressure on Syria. He sought haven in Russia
before the intervention of Italy's Communists.
	   Ocalan issued a statement Wednesday calling his decision to
abandon armed struggle and use Europe as a platform for seeking a
peaceful resolution to the Kurdish question ``irreversible.''
	   ``We want to do things like the Basques in Spain and the IRA in
Northern Ireland,'' he said in a statement read by his lawyers.
``We just want more autonomy and freedom.''
	   The Kurds were promised an independent homeland in 1920 after
the Ottoman Empire collapsed, but the international community
abandoned the idea in 1923. In Turkey, they are not recognized as
an official minority, which means, among other things, that the use
of the Kurdish language is banned in education and broadcasting.
	   The conflict in Turkey has killed an estimated 37,000 people.

Hoechst confirms merger talks with French firm Rhone-Poulenc
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS for AMS &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Confirming week's of speculation,
Hoechst AG said Wednesday that it was in merger talks with France's
Rhone-Poulenc, which if successful would create the world's largest
pharmaceutical firm.
	   An announcement on the outcome was expected as early as next
week, but Hoechst cautioned ``no guarantee can be made as to the
outcome of the current discussions.''
	   The merged firm would be worth some 80 billion marks (dlrs 50
billion), and analysts projected that sales in its pharmaceutical
sector would outstrip market leader Glaxo Wellcome's.
	   Hoechst's annual sales are estimated at about 22 billion (dlrs
13.75 billion) marks, with Rhone-Poulenc at 17.5 billion (dlrs 11
billion).
	   The new company would have two headquarters, one for
pharmaceuticals in Frankfurt and for agrochemicals in Lyon, France.
The two companies together employ 180,000 people.
	   Analyst said the merger would improve the companies' market
share, while enabling the combined firm to save hundreds of
millions of marks (dollars) a year in the pharmaceutical sector by
fusing areas where they overlap, including cancer and allergy
treatments.
	   A union leader, however, voiced concern over the proposed
merger, saying he feared jobs would be lost because of the
identical product ranges and questioning the financial fitness of
either company to enter such a deal.
	   Rainer Krumlehn, a supervisory board member as well as a leader
of the IGBCE workers' union, estimated the groups' high level of
corporate debt at between 25 billion and 30 billion marks (dlrs 15
billion-dlrs 18 billion).
	   ``We're on red-alert,'' Krumlehn said.
	   Hoechst's supervisory board _ one-third of which is comprised of
employee representatives _ meets to vote on another matter Dec. 8:
the proposal to merge its industrial chemicals units in an
independent company. The Rhone-Poulenc talks were not on the
agenda, Krumlehn said.
	   Sources familiar with the talks also said that Hoechst would
have to get the go-ahead from German pharmaceutical maker Schering,
with which it shares a pesticide joint venture.

Death toll from cold front approaches 100

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Preying on the poor, the homeless and
alcoholics, an Arctic cold front continued to claim lives
throughout Europe with at least ten more deaths reported Wednesday,
bringing the total killed to at least 95.
	   Most of the victims were in Poland, where police reported 49
deaths _ including eight discovered Wednesday _ since the frigid
Arctic air arrived Nov. 16.
	   In Romania, a 73-year-old man found frozen to death Wednesday
morning on a Bucharest street raised the death toll there to 31.
France has reported eight deaths, including at least three homeless
people, while Bulgaria and Italy have reported three each and
Croatia announced its first cold-related death Wednesday _ a woman
who lived alone in an unheated house.
	   Temperatures have dropped well below freezing, with minus 26
Celsius (minus 4 Fahrenheit) recorded in Poland on Sunday. On
Wednesday, Poland's low was minus 12 Celsius (10 Fahrenheit) as the
cold front appeared to be dissipating in some areas.
	   Polish police blamed heavy alcohol consumption for many of the
deaths in their country, saying most victims were middle-aged men
who drank themselves into a stupor and perished after collapsing
outside. About 30 percent of the Polish victims were homeless,
police say, and most of the homeless victims had been drinking.
	   That is no surprise in a nation where people drink 8.5 liters
(more than two gallons) of pure spirit each year on average, one of
the highest figures in Europe. A small number of Poles consuming
alcohol _ 5.3 percent _ account for almost half the total,
according to the Agency of Solving Alcohol Problems.
	   Among Poland's poor and homeless, methylated alcohol _ which is
ethyl alcohol mixed with toxic methanol to make anti-freeze and
cleaning solutions _ and apple wine are popular because they are
cheap and easily available.
	   ``They drink methylated spirit and then drop dead,'' said
Krzysztof Chmiel, 46, bundled up in a long, heavy coat at a Warsaw
homeless shelter. ``Methylated spirit warms you up really quickly,
but you also cool down quickly.''
	   Chmiel was evicted two months ago from his apartment and slept
on the floor of the Warsaw train station until Monday, when the
sub-freezing temperatures forced him to flee to one of several
shelters operated by Markot, Warsaw's biggest welfare group for the
homeless.
	   He joined about 500 others out-of-sorts men and women in the
shelter, designed for 200 people.
	   The cold has forced Markot and other agencies to change their
policy. Drunks were formerly turned away, before temperatures
dropped so low that death became a nightly threat.
	   ``The situation is critical,'' said Ewa Selke, who helps run the
Markot shelter at Marywilska street, where Chmiel is staying. ``We
don't refuse anybody.''
	   Police said they find up to 200 people sleeping on the streets
each night and take them to shelters all over Poland for safety and
sobering up.
	   That further taxes the already crowded shelters in Poland, where
post-communist economic reforms have left millions jobless. As many
as 10,000 people in Warsaw are believed homeless, and Markot
founder Marek Kotanski said his organization has 40 percent less
money now than it did last winter.
	   The high death toll so far and the likelihood of more cold
weather in upcoming months makes last winter's figure of 54 deaths
seem small.
	   ``I see several hundred corpses,'' Kotanski said.

Dallaglio returns as England makes four changes after poor
</HEADLINE>
performance against Italy &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Lawrence Dallaglio returns after injury to captain
England in a re-formed back row against Australia Saturday with the
home fans fearing a heavy defeat after last weekend's poor
performance against Italy.
	   England struggled to beat the Italians 23-15 in a World Cup
qualifying game at Huddersfield and were outplayed for long periods
by a team it was supposed to beat easily.
	   Coach Clive Woodward has made four changes to the lineup
including three in the pack where Dallaglio returns in place of Ben
Clarke, Richard Hill ousts Martin Corry and Tim Rodber, normally a
back row player, takes over at lock forward from Garath Archer.
	   The only change behind the scrum is the recall after 20 months
of experienced winger Tony Underwood in place of Dan Luger, who is
dropped despite scoring tries in the last two games, his first
appearances in England colors.
	   Lineup:
	   Matt Perry; Tony Underwood, Will Greenwood, Jeremy Guscott,
Austin Healey; Paul Grayson, Matt Dawson; Jason Leonard, Richard
Cockerill, Darren Garforth, Martin Johnson, Tim Rodber, Lawrence
Dallaglio (captain), Richard Hill, Neil Back.
	   Replacements: Nick Beal, Mike Catt, Dan Luger, Martin Corry,
Danny Grewcock, Graham Rowntree, Phil Greening.

Yeltsin ally in Russian parliament calls for early presidential
</HEADLINE>
elections &QL; 
 &UR; EDs: UPDATES in new 8th graf with Primakov insisting he won't run
for president. &QL; 
 &UR; By MITCHELL LANDSBERG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The leader of a pro-government faction in Russia's
parliament called Wednesday for early presidential elections, a
potent sign that President Boris Yeltsin has lost political clout,
even among his allies.
	   Alexander Shokhin, leader of the Our Home is Russia faction,
said parliamentary and presidential elections should be held
simultaneously next September.
	   The next presidential election is not scheduled until the middle
of 2000. The ailing Yeltsin is constitutionally barred from running
for a third term, but has insisted that he will serve out his
current term to the end.
	   The political opposition, especially the Communist Party, has
long called for Yeltsin to step down. In recent months, several
prominent allies or former allies of the president have called for
early elections.
	   ``This is an idea that might assist with constructive reforms in
the country and save money ... simultaneously,'' Shokhin said,
according to the Interfax news agency.
	   He added that Yeltsin should ``do his best to enable robust
forces to take part in parliamentary and presidential elections.''
The reference to ``robust forces'' was the closest Shokhin came to
mentioning Yeltsin's declining health, which has prompted others in
Russian politics to call for him to resign.
	   In October, the upper house of parliament, which has
consistently supported Yeltsin's government, voted 79-18 in favor
of a resolution demanding the president's resignation.
	   Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, one of the most popular figures
in Russian politics since his appointment in September, insisted
again Wednesday that he would not run for president, even
considering the ``latest developments'' _ presumably referring to
Yeltsin's latest sickness.
	   The president remained in a Kremlin hospital Wednesday,
recuperating from pneumonia, the latest in a long series of
frequent illnesses that have reduced him to being a part-time
president.
	   The president's press service said Yeltsin's condition was
``stable'' and doctors were continuing to provide treatment for his
pneumonia.
	   One of the potential candidates in the next presidential race,
Krasnoyarsk territorial Gov. Alexander Lebed, said Wednesday that
he opposed early elections, ITAR-Tass reported.
	   Lebed added that he found it ``improper'' for former associates
of the president to be calling for early elections.
	   Lebed is a strong and persistent critic of Yeltsin, but has also
said he wouldn't run for president until he had time to improve the
situation in Krasnoyarsk.

European soccer body rejects Polish appeal against knife ban

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ European soccer's governing body Wednesday
affirmed a season-long ban from European soccer imposed on Polish
club Wisla Krakow over an alleged knife-throwing incident in a UEFA
Cup match last month.
	   The English Football Association also failed in its attempt to
overturn a fine imposed over alleged racist chants from fans at a
Sept. 5 match in Sweden.
	   The Polish club's lawyer, Reinhard Rauball, who disclosed the
decision by the UEFA appeals committee, said the rejection of the
Krakow appeal was ``a sporting and a financial disaster'' for the
club.
	   Rauball said he didn't dispute the details of the Oct. 20
incident, in which UEFA says AC Parma midfielder Dino Baggio was
struck by a knife thrown from the stands. He needed five stitches
to close a head wound.
	   But he said the season-long ban was too severe and that it
should be softened.
	   Rauball noted that Krakow is 10 points clear at the top of the
Polish league and expects to qualify for European cup competition
next year.
	   Being excluded will mean ``a very big financial loss'' because
of the money in the European competition that the team cannot hope
to match in Polish league play, he said.
	   Rauball said he suggested a penalty on the first two home games,
requiring that the first game be played elsewhere in Poland and the
second in another country.
	   UEFA imposed the ban because it said Krakow's security should
have stopped the knife being brought into the stadium, but Rauball
said security had been very good.
	   ``We made the clear point that the police of Krakow did
everything which was necessary for the security of the spectators,
of the team of Parma and referees.
	   ``But on the other hand there was a knife which was thrown at
the player Dino Baggio.''
	   Polish police have detained a 19-year-old man over the incident.
	   Rauball noted that there were similarities to the banning of the
Italian club Fiorentina over an explosive device thrown by a fan,
but that Krakow should have been treated more leniently since it
was the club's first such offense.
	   The club will be banned from the next UEFA competition in the
next five years for which it qualifies due to the ``reprehensible
act of a Wisla Krakow supporter,'' the original decision said.
	   Baggio was struck in the 80th minute of the second-round,
first-leg match. The teams tied 1-1. Parma won the second game 2-1
at home to advance 3-2 on aggregate.
	   The appeals panel also rejected an appeal by England against a
fine of 60,000 Swiss francs (about dlrs 45,000) for supporters'
behavior during the team's match in Sweden.
	   A section of fans is alleged to have chanted racist abuse at
Sweden's Henrik Larsson. Larsson, whose father is from the Cape
Verdi islands and whose mother is Swedish, is considered to be
Sweden's top player. He plays for Scottish team Celtic FC.
	   Nick Coward, lawyer for the English Football Association, said
the association had denied that there was racist chanting, but it
accepted UEFA's decision.
	   ``Whilst we're disappointed as we still believe that everything
is done within English football to eradicate racism from the game,
this does nothing more than strengthen our resolve,'' said Coward.
	   He said it wasn't specified what was said by the fans, only that
they engaged in ``monkey chanting.''
	   Sweden beat England, 2-1, in the match, which was their opening
qualifier for the European Championships in 2000.

Woman says De La Hoya raped her when she was 15
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ A woman claims in a dlrs 10 million lawsuit
that she was raped by WBC welterweight champion Oscar De La Hoya 2
1/2 years ago when she was 15 years old, a television station
reported.
	   The lawsuit, filed late Tuesday in San Bernardino County
Superior Court, alleges De La Hoya raped the woman in a hotel room
in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, in June 1996. The complaint alleges
false imprisonment, sexual battery and assault.
	   ``My client has suffered severe psychological injury since this
incident, which has affected her greatly both emotionally and
physically,'' said Lisa Maki, attorney for the plaintiff identified
only as Jane Doe, a U.S. citizen.
	   De La Hoya's lawyer, Martin Castillo, told KABC-TV that ``the
charges are false and we are looking forward to litigating the
matter in a court of law. ... We believe (the charges) are
financially motivated.''
	   The plaintiff, who is now 18, waited more than two years to sue
De La Hoya because ``she was terrified, and due to her
psychological injury we decided to wait to file the case when she
turned 18,'' Maki said.
	   Phone messages left for Castillo and Maki were not returned late
Tuesday after business hours.
	   The 25-year-old De La Hoya (29-0, with 24 knockouts) is
scheduled to defend the title against Ike Quartey of Ghana Feb. 13
at Las Vegas. The fight was scheduled for Nov. 21, but it was
postponed when De La Hoya was cut while sparring.

Garbage and death spread disease in wake of Hurricane Mitch

	   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) _ Ever since Hurricane Mitch
destroyed his home and clothing stall, Oscar Solorzano has sifted
through bloated rats, fly-infested meat and human feces for such
small treasures as a mud-caked watch or a rank-smelling Barbie doll
to wash and sell.
	   Working on the steps leading down to the fetid Choluteca River
behind the Alvarez market, Solorzano has joined a growing rank of
trash miners in Honduras' devastated capital.
	   ``I once had to push a dead horse out of my way, which was
pretty gross,'' Solorzano said. ``But you can get used to anything
after a while.''
	   Desperately poor, many people are putting sanitation second to
survival after Hurricane Mitch earlier this month killed 10,000
people, officials say, and left those already eeking out a living
with nothing.
	   From Nicaragua to Guatemala, the number of cases of cholera,
dengue and leptospirosis are rising.
	   ``I think now is when we're going to see the disease curve start
going up,'' said Dr. Luis Gerardo Castellanos, coordinator of
infectious diseases for the Pan American Health Organization in
Tegucigalpa.
	   ``We're seeing a lot of cases of respiratory illnesses, colds,
etc. with the dust, and environmental ailments, and people working
to clean up without shoes or shirts on in the mud and water, which
means their defenses are down.''
	   At least 560 cases of cholera have been confirmed in the
hardest-hit countries of Nicaragua, Honduras, Belize, El Salvador
and Guatemala, according to the Pan American Health Organization.
	   At least 21 people have died from the disease, which is
contracted mainly by contaminated food. Guatemala and Nicaragua
account for 95 percent of the cases.
	   At Tegucigalpa's main hospital, Hospital Escuela, diarrhea and
intestinal problems have risen from about three a week to more than
50, doctors said. In the northern city of San Pedro Sula, officials
warn that nearly half the meat being sold at discount prices comes
from unlicensed markets that don't meet health standards.
	   In Chimaltenango, Guatemala, for instance, doctors saw 37
cholera cases in a single day _ more than the total for the two
weeks before the disaster.
	   In Nicaragua, officials are investigating 264 possible cases of
leptospirosis, which is caused by a rare bacteria in rat urine.
	   The disease, which leads to liver and kidney failure, also has
appeared in small numbers in Honduras and Guatemala, but officials
said the increase could be due to a program that recently taught
local doctors to detect it.
	   Health workers have reported 1,086 cases of mosquito-borne
dengue _ about 400 more than the number reported during the same
period last year. Honduras accounts for all but six of those cases.
	   Doctors from a battery of international aid groups have spread
out from Nicaragua to Guatemala. The Pan American Health
Organization is calling for stronger measures to improve hygiene
and control rodents and mosquitos, particularly in shelters.
	   The Taiwanese and German governments, the World Bank and the Pan
American Health Organization donated dlrs 2 million to spray
Honduras' highest risk areas with insecticide.
	   In Tegucigalpa's central market, where huge pools of stagnant
water still block many streets, a group of Taiwanese Buddhists
fumigated this week.
	   Last week, sanitation officials declared the market off-limits,
so the 500 venders have moved into the debris-strewn street in
front of the market, where they sell food and grill meat.
	   Near the Choluteca waters where bodies were still being pulled
out last week, Maria Carbajal sells cabbage and carrots. Sewage
streams under the table of produce, which is about six inches off
the ground.
	   ``It stinks so bad my head hurts,'' she said.
	   Besides, she said, business was bad.
	   ``The people who have money won't buy here, and the ones who
don't just take from the trash and eat it.''

IOC considering life bans, dlrs 1 million fines
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STEPHEN WILSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Athletes found guilty of using steroids could face
life bans and fines of up to dlrs 1 million under new anti-doping
proposals put forward by the International Olympic Committee.
	   A package of proposed drug sanctions, including a precise
definition of doping, has been drawn up by a special IOC panel and
will be presented to leaders of 35 international sports federations
in Switzerland on Friday.
	   But some top Olympic officials say the proposals are too
complicated and confuse the issue rather than solve it.
	   The IOC wants all federations to endorse a single medical code,
embracing uniform drug rules, procedures and sanctions, in advance
of the Feb. 2-4 world anti-doping conference in Lausanne.
	   An IOC working group dealing with legal and ethical issues has
come up with a proposed definition of doping as the basis for the
fight against performance-enhancing drugs.
	   Doping is defined as one or both of the following:
	   _ ``use of an expedient substance or method potentially harmful
to health and capable of enhancing the athlete's performance''
	   _ ``the presence in the athlete's body of a substance or
evidence of a use of a method where such substance appears'' on the
IOC's list of banned substances.
	   Gunnar Werner, Swedish secretary of the international swimming
federation (FINA) and a member of the IOC panel, said the proposal
divides doping offenses into two categories: ``regular'' and
``aggravated'' cases.
	   Werner said aggravated cases were defined as ``intentional
doping,'' including attempts to mask or manipulate urine samples or
refusal to take a drug test.
	   The package lists four types of penalties: disqualification from
an event, a warning, suspension and fines.
	   In the so-called regular cases, sanctions for use of stimulants
such as ephedrine would be punished by suspensions of one to six
months. For harder drugs, the penalty would range from six months
to two years.
	   For aggravated cases, the proposal calls for suspensions of two
years to eight years. If ``intentional doping'' with steroids is
proven, a life ban is recommended.
	   The proposal calls for fines of up to dlrs 100,000 for minor
drug offenses and fines of up to dlrs 1 million for serious
infractions.
	   Any third parties, such as doctors or coaches involved in
supplying drugs to athletes, would also be liable to penalties.
	   Existing IOC guidelines are much simpler, recommending a maximum
two-year suspension for athletes committing a first steroid
offense. There is no provision for fines.
	   Even though Werner was on the IOC panel which drew up the new
proposals, he said he thought the measures were flawed.
	   ``As a lawyer, I understand the discussions, but it won't be so
easy to apply it for those non-lawyers,'' he said in a telephone
interview Wednesday. ``This proposal is complicated, maybe a little
too complicated.''
	   He questioned the differentiation between doping and
``intentional doping.''
	   ``How can anybody prove intentions?'' he said. ``How many cases
of doping are not intentional?''
	   Werner also expressed concern that the proposals put the entire
burden of proof in doping cases on the sports bodies. The
federations would have to prove the athletes guilty, rather than
the athletes proving their innocence.
	   ``Now I can see every athlete saying, `This was not my sample,
it was not my urine,' or whatever,'' Werner said. ``We would have
to prove that it is. It's my opinion that in steroids and more
severe drugs like human growth hormone, the burden of proof should
be shifted from the federations to the athlete.''
	   Dick Pound, a Canadian member of the IOC executive board, also
said the proposals were too complicated and missed the key point.
	   ``You've got doping or you don't,'' he said. ``If you take a
cold medicine, you can have a basis for inadvertent doping. But if
you are using human growth hormone or steroids, come on. I think
doping is doping. We should put the onus on the person who tested
positive to prove his innocence. There is no point nuancing all
these things.''

Primakov: Emergency measures needed, but there's no emergency
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in new 8th graf with details on budget, CORRECTS in
6th graf that government to agree on budget in next few days, sted
Thursday. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Emergency measures are needed to save Russia's
people from the ravages of the country's economic collapse, Prime
Minister Yevgeny Primakov said Wednesday.
	   Primakov said the 1999 budget would have to include the
unspecified measures to cushion the economic blows. A draft of the
long-awaited budget was delivered to the Cabinet later in the day.
	   However, Primakov, speaking at the Ministry of Emergency
Situations, said the economy had no problems that couldn't be fixed
with help from the state.
	   ``We can't go on waiting for the market environment to solve our
problems,'' the prime minister said, according to the Interfax news
agency. ``In such a difficult transition, development must progress
along a mechanism worked out in advance.''
	   Russia's economy, which had begun to grow last year for the
first time since the Soviet collapse, succumbed this year to the
global economic crisis that started in Asia. It crashed in August,
when the Russian government devalued the ruble and effectively
defaulted on its foreign loans.
	   Primakov's remarks were consistent with his previous statements
regarding the role of government in steering the economy. The
extent of that role may become clearer when the government agrees
on a budget, which Primakov promised in the next few days.
	   So far, Primakov's Cabinet has been unable to settle on a
budget, and was reportedly divided last week among three rival
versions of the plan. The Finance Ministry submitted a new plan
Wednesday that is intended to address all the Cabinet's concerns,
Interfax said.
	   It envisages a 2.5 percent deficit and assumes that Russia will
be able to reschedule some of its debts, Finance Minister Mikhail
Zadornov was quoted by Interfax as saying.
	   The budget will encompass the government's approach to tackling
the economic crisis. However, a private economic analyst was quoted
as saying the worst of the crisis had passed.
	   Speaking to an economic forum, Andrei Illarionov, director of
the private Institute of Economic Analysis, said the crisis reached
a peak in September and has eased since then under Primakov's
leadership, Interfax said. He noted that the ruble, which was
trading at about 18 to the U.S. dollar on Wednesday, had settled
into a relatively stable range.
	   Primakov's remarks about emergency measures were presumably
meant to offer support to the Emergency Situations Ministry, which
carries out relief missions.
	   Primakov said a new federal rescue service should be established
in 2005, the ITAR-Tass news agency said. And he called on the
Emergency Situations Ministry to improve its civil defense
preparedness in light of the potential for regional conflicts in
Russia.
	   Also Wednesday, Deputy Finance Minister Mikhail Kasyanov was
quoted as saying that foreign investors had agreed to reschedule to
country's debt to the London Club of creditors. The two sides began
talks Monday in London.
	   The government is trying to persuade creditors to restructure a
portion of the Paris and London Club debts that it inherited from
the Soviet Union.
	   Kasyanov told Interfax that an agreement was reached with the
London Club under which Russia will start repaying its debt on Dec.
2.

UN chief doesn't rule out Libyan visit, U.N. officials optimistic
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Secretary-General Kofi Annan said
Wednesday that he may travel to Libya next week in hopes of closing
a deal to try two Libyan suspects in the Pan Am Lockerbie bombing.
	   Annan is heading to North Africa beginning Thursday to resume a
visit cut short to deal with the Iraq crisis.
	   A Libyan legal team has been meeting regularly with Annan's
legal counsel to discuss a U.S.-British proposal to try the
suspects in the Netherlands, according to Scottish law and using
Scottish judges.
	   Because of some positive developments over the past few weeks,
``there is now a good chance that the suspects might finally be
brought'' to trial, a U.N. source said on condition of anonymity.
	   There is ``a sense of optimism,'' he said.
	   Libya had accepted the proposal in theory, but had objected to
its call for the suspects to be jailed in a Scottish prison if
found guilty. The Tripoli government has insisted that the suspects
serve any prison time in Libya or the Netherlands.
	   It wasn't immediately known if Libyan officials had indicated
some flexibility on that point, which diplomats have said was
Libya's major concern.
	   Annan said he had hoped that there would be some breakthruogh by
the end of November.
	   ``If that doesn't happen, I will be in the region next week and
the question has been raised if it would be helpful for me to go
there and bring the issue finally to closure,'' he said.
	   ``I haven't made up my mind yet, but it has not been excluded,''
he said.
	   Two Libyans, Abdel Basset Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah, are
accused of planting the suitcase bomb that ripped apart the New
York-bound Pan Am jet on Dec. 21, 1988, killing 270 people in the
air and on the ground at Lockerbie.
	   For 10 years, the United States and Britain had demanded the two
be tried in the United States or Britain, but agreed in August to a
trial in the Netherlands in hopes of finally bringing the issue to
a close.
	   The Security Council endorsed the plan and agreed to suspend
sanctions once the two men are turned over. Council members also
agreed to consider additional sanctions if Libya didn't produce the
suspects.

U.N. promises to begin tougher inspections within days
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs; UPDATES with Iraq denouncing opposition meetings,
background, CHANGES byline. No pickup.
 &UR; By ANTHONY SHADID &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ The United Nations will bring new
inspection teams to Iraq within days to carry out searches, a U.N.
spokeswoman said Wednesday, in what will likely pose a major test
to Iraq's promise to cooperate with U.N. inspectors.
	   U.N. teams have carried out more than a week of visits since
Iraq relented Nov. 14 and allowed them to resume their work after a
two-week hiatus. So far, Iraq has fully cooperated with the
searches.
	   But most of those visits were to sites that monitors had already
checked and usually involved maintenance work on long-term
monitoring equipment. The real test will likely come during
searches of new sites by the visiting teams of weapons experts.
	   Caroline Cross, a U.N. spokeswoman for the weapons inspectors in
Baghdad, said the teams should arrive this week.
	   ``We do not know when the visiting teams will arrive but they
should be coming to carry out the inspections in the next few
days,'' Cross told The Associated Press.
	   Over the past week, a new dispute seemed to be emerging over the
demand by Richard Butler, the chief weapons inspector, for
documents on Iraq's weapons program. Iraq refused the request,
saying many were already destroyed. Other documents, like personal
diaries, were either irrelevant or had already been viewed by
inspectors, it said.
	   Although the United States and Britain have said their forces in
the Gulf could still attack Iraq over the dispute, they seem
willing to wait to see how much help Iraq provides in the coming
weeks.
	   The inspectors must certify that Iraq has destroyed its
long-range missiles, chemical, biological and nuclear weapons and
programs to build them before the Security Council will lift
crippling sanctions imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990.
	   Inspectors blame Iraq's lack of cooperation for the long tenure
of their work. But Iraq believes the inspections are used as an
excuse to prolong the sanctions, which have impoverished the
country. Often, official media blame Butler personally.
	   Butler looks for ``a new excuse to be used by the United States
and Britain in order to trigger a new aggression against Iraq,''
said Al-Thawra, the newspaper of the ruling Baath Party.
	   ``It seems that his part is confined to creating a new crisis,
no more,'' the newspaper said in an editorial Wednesday.
	   But the crisis atmosphere in Iraq has largely subsided.
Officials have toned down their angry rhetoric, and attacks in the
official media have diminished somewhat in recent days.
	   The one exception is the Iraqi opposition, which was vilified by
a government spokesman Wednesday. The spokesman accused them of
``selling their national honor'' to U.S. and British intelligence.
	   Iraqi opposition groups, riven by ethnic, religious and
political differences, have sought to close their ranks in meetings
this week with the support of the United States and Britain.
	   The spokesman said the two countries are ``under wishful
thinking and pursuing the impossible'' if they try to topple Saddam
Hussein.

Tudjman announces dialogue with opposition parties
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DARKO LABOR &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ President Franjo Tudjman called on the
opposition for the first time Wednesday to cooperate with his
ruling party in dealing with both domestic politics and foreign
policy.
	   Tudjman's remarks represent an acknowledgement that his Croatian
Democratic Union, whose rule has been unchallenged since Croatia
proclaimed independence from former Yugoslavia in 1991, is rapidly
losing popularity ahead of upcoming parliamentary elections.
	   The elections are scheduled for late 1999 but may be called as
early March.
	   The Croatian leader made his comments in a speech at Zagreb
airport after returning from an official visit to Greece.
	   Increasingly opposed at home for his virtual one-man rule, he
evidently is hoping to improve his party's image by ceding some
influence.
	   The six-party opposition coalition, which has overcome past
divisions and held together for months, poses a new threat to his
party.
	   He also may have acted under pressure from Western governments,
which have long been pushing him to strengthen Croatia's fledgling
democracy and loosen his grip on power.
	   Tudjman said his party ``offers cooperation to all constructive
political forces in solving current internal problems and even in
finding common attitude in the country's foreign affairs.''
	   Croatia has recently been rocked by a series of political
scandals. Three close aides to Tudjman resigned, and one accused
another Tudjman associate of using military counter-intelligence in
a media campaign against his opponents.
	   A parliamentary commission rejected these claims, but opposition
deputies accused Tudjman's party of a coverup.
	   Vladimir Seks, a senior member of Tudjman's party, said late
Tuesday his party was negotiating cooperation with the opposition,
possibly even including a reopening of the intelligence service
investigation.
	   There was no immediate reaction from the opposition.

<TEXT>
	   MONTE CARLO, Monaco (AP) _ The world governing body of track and
field on Wednesday ratified Kenyan Tegla Loroupe's one-hour record
set Aug. 7 in Borgholzhausen, Germany.
	   Loroupe, who also holds the world record for the marathon,
covered 18,340 meters (11.396 miles) in an hour to beat the old
mark of 18,084 meters (11.237 miles) set in 1981 by Italy's Silvana

	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Turkey's president began trying to
construct a new government Wednesday but the pieces do not neatly
fit: pro-Islamic forces pressing for power and their
military-backed, Western-style opponents struggling to unite.
	   President Suleyman Demirel opened talks with party leaders just
hours after the corruption-battered coalition of Prime Minister
Mesut Yilmaz lost a confidence vote in parliament. It was Turkey's
fourth government to collapse since 1995.
	   Demirel's meeting agenda clearly showed the potential
difficulties ahead in a nation with a growing Islamic movement but
a fiercely protected tradition of Western and secular principles.
	   One of his first meetings was with the leader of the largest
bloc in parliament: the Islamic-oriented Virtue Party, which seeks
to instill greater Muslim codes and values in Turkey.
	   Traditionally, the job of forming a new government goes to the
head of parliament's largest party.
	   But Demirel is under heavy pressure from the armed forces and
secular political leaders to keep Virtue on the fringe. Such
rumblings from the military are taken seriously in Turkey, where
the generals view themselves as guardians of the Western
orientation.
	   The military has already helped push out one Islamic-led
government last year in what's been called a ``soft coup'' _ which
cleared the way for Yilmaz's coalition. And the generals have
warned they could do it again.
	   Many business leaders fear a Virtue-led government could be
another setback to Turkey's attempts to draw closer to the European
Union.
	   ``It's not very likely that Virtue will get a shot forming a
government,'' said Ilter Turan, a professor of political affairs at
Bilgi University in Istanbul.
	   Turan speculated there is a ``state of disarray and changing
ideology'' within Virtue, formed after its predecessor, Welfare,
was outlawed by the government for allegedly undermining secular
values.
	   Turan believes Virtue is in the process of trying to expand its
base beyond the urban poor and strict Muslims. Some Virtue backers
now attend functions where alcohol is consumed and women in Western
dress are among the party ranks.
	   ``They are looking ahead to the next elections,'' said Turan.
	   Virtue officials say they don't want to wait until the next
general elections in April. A senior Virtue official, Nevzat
Yalcintas, insisted the party ``must lead'' the next government.
	   On the other side, the Western-style parties may seek to suspend
their ceaseless feuds and unite in a coalition until elections. A
truce, however, is not so easy.
	   The most likely alliance, analysts say, could be led by Yilmaz
and his longtime rival, former Prime Minster Tansu Ciller. But
their animosity runs deep.
	   Also, both Yilmaz's and Mrs. Ciller's parties have been tainted
by a widening corruption scandal that includes allegations of power
abuse and links to organized crime.
	   The weight of the accusations brought down Yilmaz's nearly
17-month-old coalition in the confidence vote in parliament, where
opponents carried a convincing 314-214 margin.
	   Yilmaz has been accused of ties with organized crime and rigging
the privatization of a state-run bank by securing loans for a
businessman linked to a mafia boss. Yilmaz has denied any links to
criminal gangs.
	   He is expected to remain in power in a caretaker role until a
new government is formed.
	   The latest political reshuffling comes at a delicate time.
	   Turkey is waging an uphill fight for the extradition of Kurdish
rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan, who is seeking political asylum in
Italy. The diplomatic effort and public protests have strained
Turkey's relationships with the European Union.
	   Nearly 37,000 people have been killed in the 14-year battle
between Turkish forces and Kurdish rebels seeking autonomy in
southeastern Turkey.

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Secretary-General Kofi Annan said
Wednesday that he is considering a trip to Libya next week that
could close a deal to try Libyan suspects in the Pan Am Lockerbie
bombing.
	   Annan is heading to North Africa beginning Thursday to resume a
visit cut short to deal with the Iraq crisis.
	   A Libyan legal team has been meeting regularly with Annan's
legal counsel to discuss a U.S.-British proposal to try the
suspects in the Netherlands, according to Scottish law and using
Scottish judges.
	   Because of some positive developments in recent weeks, ``there
is now a good chance that the suspects might finally be brought''
to trial, a U.N. source said on condition of anonymity.
	   There is ``a sense of optimism,'' he said.
	   Libya had accepted the proposal in theory, but objected to its
call for the suspects to be jailed in a Scottish prison if found
guilty. The Tripoli government has insisted the suspects serve any
prison time in Libya or the Netherlands.
	   It wasn't immediately known if Libyan officials had indicated
some flexibility on that point, which diplomats have said was
Libya's major concern.
	   Annan said he had hoped that there would be some breakthruogh by
the end of November.
	   ``If that doesn't happen, I will be in the region next week and
the question has been raised if it would be helpful for me to go
there and bring the issue finally to closure,'' he said.
	   ``I haven't made up my mind yet, but it has not been excluded,''
he said.
	   Two Libyans, Abdel Basset Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah, are
accused of planting the suitcase bomb that ripped apart the New
York-bound Pan Am jet on Dec. 21, 1988, killing 270 people in the
air and on the ground at Lockerbie.
	   For 10 years, the United States and Britain had demanded the two
be tried in the United States or Britain, but agreed in August to a
trial in the Netherlands in hopes of finally bringing the issue to
a close.
	   The Security Council endorsed the plan and agreed to suspend
sanctions once the two men are turned over. Council members also
agreed to consider additional sanctions if Libya didn't produce the
suspects.
	   The sanctions, which include an air embargo, were imposed to
force Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi to turn the men over.
	   Annan said his discussions on the proposal had been ``very
constructive.''
	   The U.N. source said Annan wouldn't travel to Libya unless he
had a sense that he could achieve a breakthrough.

Netanyahu cancels visit to Switzerland

 &UR; By LAURIE COPANS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu canceled a
visit to Switzerland Wednesday, prompting an unusually harsh rebuke
from Bern and heightening tensions over a campaign to have Swiss
banks pay restitution to Holocaust victims.
	   Netanyahu called off his trip at the last minute ``because of
his effort to expand the Cabinet and achieve a stronger base for
policy measures,'' his office said.
	   The Swiss Cabinet expressed ``vexation'' over the cancellation
and said in a statement that ``the problems that burden the
relations between Switzerland and Israel continue.''
	   Swiss President Flavio Cotti said relations with Israel were
``tense'' in light of the affair.
	   Netanyahu spent most of the night from Tuesday to Wednesday
negotiating the return of his former foreign minister, David Levy,
in an attempt to shore up his fragile coalition government.
	   The prime minister also delayed his departure for Britain by
several hours and took-off at 16:00gmt for London. He will travel
onto Spain from there as originally planned.
	   Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon also postponed a trip to
the United States in order to deal with the coalition crisis.
	   A shadow was cast over Netanyahu's trip to Switzerland after he
participated last week in a ceremony honoring Americans and
Israelis who had campaigned against Swiss banks.
	   Those honored played a key role in winning the agreement of the
banks to pay dlrs 1.2 billion to Holocaust survivors and the heirs
of victims to settle claims for assets deposited in the banks
during World War II.
	   Swiss officials expressed their irritation over the award
ceremony but did not rescind the invitation to Netanyahu.
	   Cotti lashed out at Netanyahu for granting the honors to
``people who systematically make sweeping accusations and unfounded
assertions.''
	   Relations had been good but, ``today, I must say, they are
tense,'' Cotti said.
	   The crisis will continue for some time until Switzerland gets
``some clear signs'' from Israel, he added.

Czech Parliament approves 1999 state budget
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Despite heated debates on how high
its deficit should be, Parliament on Wednesday approved the 1999
state budget presented by the minority government of Milos Zeman.
	   Deputies in the 200-seat chamber voted 113-82 to give overall
approval to the budget.
	   Approval had been expected after opposition Christian Democrats
openly supported the draft. The budget was approved thanks to
Zeman's Social Democrats, Christian Democrats and Communists.
	   Legislators on Oct. 14 had rejected an earlier version,
stipulating a deficit of dlrs 930 million in a budget of just over
dlrs 20 billion (605 billion Czech crowns).
	   Zeman's cabinet rewrote the budget to increase the deficit to
dlrs 1 billion, arguing the stagnating economy needs investment
that leads to growth.
	   ``The people who want to take this country out of a crisis
caused by the previous cabinet have prevailed,'' Zeman said,
referring to the former center-right cabinet of now-opposition
leader Vaclav Klaus.
	   ``This is a bad budget, we've said over and over _ no need to
repeat it today,'' Klaus told Czech radio.

European soccer body rejects Polish appeal against knife ban

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ European soccer's governing body Wednesday
affirmed a season-long ban from European soccer imposed on Polish
club Wisla Krakow over an alleged knife-throwing incident in a UEFA
Cup match last month.
	   The English Football Association also failed in its attempt to
overturn a fine imposed over alleged racist chants from fans at a
Sept. 5 match in Sweden.
	   The Polish club's lawyer, Reinhard Rauball, who disclosed the
decision by the UEFA appeals committee, said the rejection of the
Krakow appeal was ``a sporting and a financial disaster'' for the
club.
	   Rauball said he didn't dispute the details of the Oct. 20
incident, in which UEFA says AC Parma midfielder Dino Baggio was
struck by a knife thrown from the stands. He needed five stitches
to close a head wound.
	   But he said the season-long ban was too severe and that it
should be softened.
	   ``The Appeals Body considered the Polish club responsible not
only for the act of the spectator but also for the action of the TS
Wisla Krakow player, Ryszard Czerwiec, who thre the knife back into
the crowd in an attempt to conceal evidence,'' a UEFA statement
said.
	   Rauball noted that Krakow is 10 points clear at the top of the
Polish league and expects to qualify for European cup competition
next year.
	   Being excluded will mean ``a very big financial loss'' because
of the money in the European competition that the team cannot hope
to match in Polish league play, he said.
	   Rauball said he suggested a penalty on the first two home games,
requiring that the first game be played elsewhere in Poland and the
second in another country.
	   UEFA imposed the ban because it said Krakow's security should
have stopped the knife being brought into the stadium, but Rauball
said security had been very good.
	   Polish police have detained a 19-year-old man over the incident.
	   Rauball noted that there were similarities to the banning of the
Italian club Fiorentina over an explosive device thrown by a fan,
but that Krakow should have been treated more leniently since it
was the club's first such offense.
	   The club will be banned from the next UEFA competition in the
next five years for which it qualifies due to the ``reprehensible
act of a Wisla Krakow supporter,'' the original decision said.
	   Baggio was struck in the 80th minute of the second-round,
first-leg match. The teams tied 1-1. Parma won the second game 2-1
at home to advance 3-2 on aggregate.
	   The appeals panel also rejected an appeal by England against a
fine of 60,000 Swiss francs (about dlrs 45,000) for supporters'
behavior during the team's match in Sweden.
	   UEFA said evidence from match referee Pierluigi Collina and the
UEFA delegate Matthieu Sprengers stressed that on at least eight
occasions during the game English fans directed racist chants at
Swedish player Henrik Larsson.
	   Larsson, whose father is from the Cape Verdi islands and whose
mother is Swedish, is considered to be Sweden's top player. He
plays for Scottish team Celtic FC.
	   Nick Coward, lawyer for the English Football Association, said
the association had denied that there was racist chanting, but it
accepted UEFA's decision.
	   ``Whilst we're disappointed as we still believe that everything
is done within English football to eradicate racism from the game,
this does nothing more than strengthen our resolve,'' said Coward.
	   He said it wasn't specified what was said by the fans, only that
they engaged in ``monkey chanting.''
	   Sweden beat England, 2-1, in the match, which was their opening
qualifier for the European Championships in 2000.

Dismantling of controversial Brent Spar begins in Norwegian fjord
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with lift started in new 3rd graf &QL; 
 &UR; By DOUG MELLGREN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ The long-awaited dismantling of the Brent
Spar offshore oil storage buoy began Wednesday, 3 1/2 years after
Greenpeace activists boarded the unit and embarrassed oil giant
Shell into dropping plans to sink it in the North Atlantic.
	   Instead, Brent Spar was towed to the deep waters of the
Norwegian Erfjord inlet to be dismantled and reused, partly as the
foundation for a new wharf. The first major step is to remove the
buoy's 1,600 ton topside with a floating crane.
	   ``We have at least 800 tons on the hook. It's exciting,'' the
project's senior engineer Arvid Nygaard told The Associated Press
from the crane barge, as the lift of the topside started Wednesday
afternoon. He said the lift would take a few hours.
	   ``We have been very lucky with the weather,'' he added. Nygaard
said the weather was calm, with no rain or snow, making ideal
conditions to start the lift. The process of dismantling the 15,000
ton unit is estimated to last a year.
	   Shell UK had planned to sink the obsolete Brent Spar off
Scotland, a cheaper and faster approach. But Greenpeace activists
boarded the vessel in April 1995 in a successful protest that
lasted four months and gained backing across Europe.
	   ``Off course, this is a good feeling,'' said Jan Rispens, a
Dutch Greenpeace activist who spent 2 1/2 weeks aboard the Brent
Spar during the protest. He was in western Norway to see the
dismantling begin, a step he called a victory for the millions of
people who supported the anti dumping campaign.
	   ``This is the best solution. It reuses materials; it provides
jobs in Norway, and it protects the ocean,'' he said.
	   Opponents feared that sinking the North Sea platform would
pollute the ocean with chemicals and other pollutants. But, in May
1996, a British government commission concluded that scuttling the
Brent Spar in the North Atlantic would have a minimal environmental
impact.
	   The tube-like Brent Spar will float upright, and be slowly
sliced into sections as it is lifted out of the water. The sections
will be cleaned, and then towed to the new wharf.
	   In January, Shell awarded Norway's Maritime GMC AS and
Scotland's Wood Group Engineering a joint contract to dispose of
the platform. Shell has said the disposal of Brent Spar will cost
the company up to 26 million pounds (dlrs 42 million), more than
twice the cost of sinking it.

New snag in labor talks threatens upcoming meeting
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHRIS SHERIDAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Basketball Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ They've found something new to fight about in
the NBA lockout, and it could lead to the cancellation of further
collective bargaining talks.
	   Whatever progress owners and players made last week had
deteriorated by Wednesday into another public fight. This time,
it's a squabble over the details of the ``breakthrough'' they made
in a 9 1/2-hour negotiating session Friday.
	   NBA deputy commissioner Russ Granik sent a letter to union
director Billy Hunter, saying Saturday's scheduled resumption of
talks should be called off in light of the newest dispute over a
previously undisclosed ``backup tax'' that was put on the table at
the last bargaining session.
	   The union's negotiating committee planned a conference call for
Wednesday to assess the situation.
	   ``Now we have nothing. We're back to the beginning,'' Granik
said.
	   The league also informed NBC television on Tuesday that the
network's popular Christmas Day doubleheader is the latest casualty
of the nearly 5-month-old lockout.
	   In place of the New York Knicks at the Chicago Bulls and the Los
Angeles Lakers at the Phoenix Suns doubleheader, NBC will show
Frank Capra's Christmas movie ``It's A Wonderful Life'' starring
Jimmy Stewart.
	   Unless a deal is reached by mid-December, more of NBC's schedule
will be in jeopardy. The network is scheduled to begin its weekly
telecasts Jan. 16 with regional coverage of three games.
	   The so-called ``backup tax'' might be charged to the
highest-spending owners in the final three or four years of a six-
or seven-year agreement.
	   The second tax, which Granik called a ``breakthrough,'' was
proposed by the players Friday. The tax would only be collected if
a previously agreed upon escrow tax _ 10 to 15 percent of players'
paychecks _ failed to cover any discrepancy between the targeted
percentage of revenues that owners agreed to devote to salaries and
the amount they actually ended up paying.
	   In other words, if owners exceeded a targeted salary total of
dlrs 1.2 billion by dlrs 200 million, and the players paid only
dlrs 150 million in escrow taxes, an extra dlrs 50 million would be
collected from the highest-spending owners.
	   The owners said the backup tax rate should be 200 percent; the
players said they agreed to 100 percent. Using the above example,
it's a question of whether dlrs 50 million or dlrs 100 million
would be collected.
	   ``They wanted to charge a double penalty on the owners who went
over their share of the designated percentage, and we clarified
that that part of their counterproposal was unacceptable. We aren't
into the punitive aspect of it,'' said union lawyer Jeffrey
Kessler.
	   On Friday, the sides made progress on establishing a framework
for a deal that would include a three-year period in which the
sides would use different mechanisms to try to bring the growth of
salaries under control. But if the amount of revenues devoted to
salaries exceeded a certain percentage after three years, a
so-called escrow tax would be withheld from players' paychecks and
returned to the owners.
	   Other major differences remain, yet there was hope that the
owners and players could work things out this weekend.
	   Now, that possibility looks remote.
	   ``I don't know if we'll have a meeting, and I'll be surprised if
we have one,'' Granik said. ``The owners have said that if this is
the players' position, then there's no point in having a meeting
now. And we have communicated that to Billy Hunter in a letter.''
	   Kessler, the lead outside counsel for the union, said the league
was ``grandstanding in the media.''
	   ``It's not going to lead to a deal, and that's very sad. Because
they're playing with the lives of millions of people and thousands
of fans, and they don't care.
	   ``The players care, and we intend to be there Saturday. We hope
someone shows up from their side,'' Kessler said.
	   The union also issued a statement:
	   ``If the NBA is serious about making a deal, they should stop
posturing and come to the bargaining table this Saturday with the
goal of ending the lockout and saving the season.''

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Family members of French citizens who disappeared
under the rule of Gen. Augusto Pinochet cheered and embraced
Wednesday upon hearing that Britain's House of Lords had denied
immunity to the former Chilean dictator.
	   Socialist Prime Minister Lionel Jospin said the decision was ``a
joy.'' But France's extreme-right National Front party -- the only
voice out of step with the euphoria -- called it ``scandalous.''
	   ``It's a victory for law and morality,'' said William Bourdon, a
lawyer representing some of those families, after passing the news
on to his clients. ``A trial of Pinochet is now possible in Paris
and in Madrid.''
	   France asked for Pinochet's extradition on Nov. 12. And on
Tuesday, a French judge issued a second international arrest
warrant for Pinochet.
	   The latest arrest order accuses Pinochet of the detention and
torture of two French citizens who disappeared after the ouster of
Chilean President Salvador Allende in 1973.
	   An earlier French warrant, issued Nov. 2, accused Pinochet of
the detention and torture of three other French citizens who
disappeared.
	   ``This is a surprise. This is a joy,'' Jospin told reporters.
``It's bad news for all dictators.''
	   The prime minister said he felt the British decision amounts to
``new progress in the idea that no crime can go unpunished.''
	   The International Federation of Human Rights Leagues expressed
its ``profound satisfaction.''
	   But the National Front party said the decision was neither
judicious nor equitable. ``Half the heads of state'' taking part in
the French-African summit opening Thursday in Paris ``could find
themselves in handcuffs'' were the same measures applied to them as
to Pinochet, the party statement said.
	   Pinochet was arrested on a Spanish arrest warrant Oct. 16 while
in a London hospital recuperating from back surgery.
	   Spanish authorities want to extradite Pinochet to face charges
of genocide during his 1973-90 rule.
	   A Chilean government report says 3,197 people were murdered or
disappeared during Pinochet's 1973-90 rule after he overthrew
Allende, an elected Marxist.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with criminal complaint filed against Rodman. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ A cocktail waitress who sued Dennis Rodman
for assault this month has filed a criminal complaint against the
NBA star.
	   The action, confirmed Wednesday by authorities and the woman's
lawyer, comes two days after Rodman filed papers to end his
marriage to actress Carmen Electra. They wed in Las Vegas on Nov.
14, and Rodman now wants an annulment, citing fraud and unsound
mind.
	   Susan Patterson says Rodman jammed a dlrs 100 bill down her
blouse and grabbed her breast while she was working at the Fenix in
the Argyle Hotel in West Hollywood.
	   The criminal complaint was filed Tuesday with the Los Angeles
County Sheriff Department, Deputy Terry Holden and lawyer Gloria
Allred said.
	   Like the lawsuit she filed Nov. 10, the criminal complaint cites
assault, battery, negligence, false imprisonment and emotional
distress in a confrontation with Rodman on Oct. 3. Detectives will
decide whether to ask the local prosecutor if charges should be
filed.
	   ``I have all the confidence in the police to make an intelligent
decision,'' Rodman's agent, Dwight Manley, said today.
	   Gerry Phillips, the lawyer who filed Rodman's petition in Orange
County Superior Court, said the couple married at 7 a.m. after
being out drinking, separated the same day and haven't seen each
other since.
	   Rodman ``didn't have all his faculties about him'' at the time
of the wedding, Phillips said.
	   Electra's publicist denied that her client took advantage of
Rodman, as his agent claimed two days after the wedding.
	   However, spokeswoman Cindy Guagenti did acknowledge the marriage
quickly unraveled and that both had agreed to end the marriage.
	   Manley said previously the 26-year-old actress who once starred
on ``Baywatch'' exploited his client.
	   Rodman, 37, is the rebounding champion in the U.S. National
Basketball Association.

Car bomb at Medellin airport injures nine

<TEXT>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ A car bomb packed with dynamite exploded
Wednesday at a Medellin airport, injuring nine bystanders and
damaging air courier offices, a fire station and six parked cars,
Colombian police said.
	   The vehicle used in the bombing, a blue Renault sedan stolen
Tuesday and loaded with about 130 pounds (60 kilos) of dynamite,
exploded in the morning outside a cargo warehouse at the Olaya
Herrera airport, used for domestic flights in Colombia's
second-largest city.
	   None of the injuries_ to construction workers, employees of two
air courier companies and an auxiliary policeman _ were serious,
police said. Damages were estimated at dlrs 250,000.
	   No group claimed responsibility for the attack, and police have
not assigned blame in the second bombing in Colombia in less than a
week. Last Friday, explosives went off in five banks in the
capital, Bogota, causing property damage but no injuries.

Tudjman rejects request to restore mention of Muslims in
</HEADLINE>
constitution &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ President Franjo Tudjman on Wednesday
rejected an international official's request to reinsert a mention
of Muslims in the country's constitution.
	   ``No one from abroad can order Croatia what to write in the
constitution,'' Tudjman said. ``That is an internal issue.''
	   The suggestion was made earlier this week by the top
international official in neighboring Bosnia, Carlos Westendorp.
	   The earlier reference to the Muslim and Slovene minorities,
which each comprise less than 1 percent of Croatia's 4.7 million
people, was deleted from the constitution late last year. They are
now referred to as simply minorities.
	   The move was largely symbolic because minority rights are
specified in separate laws. But it caused a sharp reaction from
both Bosnia and Slovenia.
	   Relations between Croatia and Bosnia have been fragile since
Zagreb supported Bosnia's Croats in their 1993-4 war with Muslims.
Bosnian Muslim leaders remain wary of Croatia's intentions toward
Bosnian territory and are also suspicious about Tudjman's treatment
of minorities.
	   Tudjman said the new census would show how many Muslims actually
live in Croatia. The question of their position ``is a question of
their number,'' he said.
	   He referred to Bosnian Muslims' requests that Muslims be
guaranteed the same rights as Croats in Bosnia.
	   Bosnian Croats make up 17 percent of Bosnia's people but are one
of three separate entities in that divided nation, rather than a
minority. Tudjman said the situation in two countries ``cannot be
compared.''
	   He added, however, that Muslims in Croatia ``have the same
rights as any other minority,'' and said the government would take
special care of them for the sake of good relations with Bosnia.

Norway's minority government averts crisis with budget compromise
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Leads throughout to ADD quote from prime minister, details of
compromise &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) - Norway's minority government averted a
political crisis Wednesday by reaching a last-minute compromise
with two opposition parties on a proposed 1999 national budget.
	   The centrist three-party coalition and two right-wing parties
reached an accord hours before the scheduled opening of a two-day
parliamentary budget debate that many feared would end in a
deadlock and bring down the government. The debate was rescheduled
for Monday due to the deal.
	   The opposition Conservatives and Party of Progress had agreed to
a new round of budget negotiations with the coalition on Tuesday,
after the government offered heavy concessions in exchange for
their support in Parliament.
	   After talks that lasted into the early morning, Prime Minister
Kjell Magne Bondevik, a Christian Democrat, said the parties had
reached a compromise agreement and that only technical adjustments
to the budget remained.
	   `This is a victory for the political system, and a victory for
the parties involved,'' Bondevik said.
	   The deal eliminated all 4.0 billion kroner (dlrs 530 million) in
proposed tax and tariff hikes, as the political right demanded. It
also reduced the government's planned budget tightening to 7.8
billion kroner (dlrs 1.04 billion) from 9.0 billion kroner (dlrs
1.2 billion) originally proposed by the coalition.
	   ``It is correct to have a tight budget, but not with the help of
higher taxes. We are extremely satisfied that our goal was
reached,'' said Conservative leader Jan Petersen.
	   The agreement also opened for the partial sale of the
state-owned telephone company Telenor and parts of the state liquor
monopoly to private investors in response to another demand from
the right.
	   The coalition has just 42 seats in the 165-seat parliament, and
needs the support of opposition parties to remain in office.
	   Bondevik formed his government in October 1997, after Labor
Party Prime Minister Thorbjoern Jagland resigned due to a
disappointing national election result.
	   This weekend, Jagland, head of Norway's largest party, said he
was ready to return to office if the coalition fell.
	   ``This has to be seen as a defeat for Labor,'' Bondevik said at
a news conference after it became clear that his coalition would
survive.
	   The budget agreement was broadly seen as a move to the political
right by the centrists that might allow the coalition to remain in
power for the remaining three years of the current parliamentary
term.
	   When the Bondevik government took office, few gave it a chance
of lasting more than a few weeks.

<TEXT>
	   Next steps in the case of Gen. Augusto Pinochet following a
ruling by Britain's highest court Wednesday that the former Chilean
dictator has no immunity from prosecution:
	   _Britain's Home Secretary, Jack Straw, has until Dec. 2 to
decide whether Spain may initiate extradition proceedings. If he
says yes, proceedings will then begin in court. If he says no,
Pinochet would be free to leave Britain.
	   _Pinochet has been ordered to appear at Bow Street Magistrate's
Court in London on Dec. 2. The law requires anyone who is the
subject of an extradition order to appear in court as soon as
possible. Pinochet, 83, has been recuperating from back surgery
since he was arrested Oct. 16 in his hospital bed.
	   _If legal proceedings start, they would take many months. If
Pinochet eventually lost, the Home Secretary again would have to
decide whether to permit the extradition.

Report: One in 10 Russian inmates has tuberculosis
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Nearly one in 10 Russian prisoners has
tuberculosis and the country's dilapidated prisons are increasingly
overcrowded, Russia's Justice Minister said Wednesday, suggesting
that police make fewer arrests to remedy the problems.
	   ``Courts sentence criminals to a deprivation of freedom, but not
to an inhuman existence,'' Justice Minister Pavel Krasheninnikov
was quoted by the Interfax news agency as saying.
	   About 100,000 of the slightly more than 1 million prisoners in
Russia have tuberculosis, which is highly infectious, he said.
Russia's tuberculosis rate has been rising since the 1991 Soviet
collapse, and health officials estimated earlier this fall that 2.5
million people had been infected with the disease this year.
	   Krasheninnikov said Russia was violating international
conventions that require prisoners to have at least 4 square meters
(4.8 square yards) of space to themselves. In Russia, overcrowding
has left prisoners with just 1-1.5 square meters (1.2-1.8 square
yards) of space.
	   Krasheninnikov urged a drastic reduction in the number of
arrests to stem overcrowding, Interfax said. The report did not
elaborate.

Netanyahu makes tentative deal with former foreign minister
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES top 4 grafs with foreign minister canceling U.S. trip.
Minor edits throughout. TRIMS. No pickup. &QL; 
 &UR; By SARI BASHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu struck a
tentative deal Wednesday to bring his former foreign minister back
to the government in an effort to strengthen his fragile coalition.
	   The return of David Levy, the former foreign minister, would not
be enough to guarantee the survival of Netanyahu's government,
which has been endangered by hard-liners outraged over the Mideast
peace deal.
	   The hard-liners have been threatening to leave over the
land-for-security agreement with the Palestinians, thus robbing
Netanyahu of his majority in parliament.
	   Without such a majority, Netanyahu would either have to call
early elections or try to bring other parties into his coalition.
	   Also Wednesday, Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon canceled an
upcoming visit to the United States to help solve the crisis within
the government.
	   Sharon was to lead the Israeli delegation at a 50-nation
conference of donors to the Palestinian Authority on Nov. 30 in
Washington.
	   In addition, he has been scheduled to meet with U.S. Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright and members of Congress to discuss
Israeli aid requests to pay for troop withdrawals and new security
arrangements in the peace deal.
	   Political commentators said Wednesday that the prime minister
wanted Levy back in the fold so he would be in a stronger position
when opening negotiations with the main opposition party, Labor, to
join the government.
	   In a sign that a so-called ``national unity government'' was
becoming a real possibility, three influential Cabinet ministers _
Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon, Trade Minister Natan Sharansky and
Finance Minister Yaakov Neeman _ said Netanyahu should court Labor.
	   Netanyahu offered Levy either the finance or infrastructure
ministry. As part of the deal, Levy's Gesher Party would run on a
joint slate with Netanyahu's Likud Party in the next elections,
with Levy guaranteed the No. 2 spot.
	   Israel radio said Gesher approved a return to Netanyahu's
coalition, but did not make a decision on a possible merger with
Likud. Two of five Gesher legislators, David Magen and Michael
Kleiner, did not attend the meeting, an apparent sign that they
will not rejoin the coalition.
	   Levy had resigned in January to protest a deadlock in peace
talks and the government's failure to spend on social welfare
programs.
	   He said the government was ``on a flight to nowhere.''
	   On Tuesday, Levy suggested that with the signing of the Mideast
accord last month, the government looked more appealing.
	   ``Now that the government is taking the political course that I
demanded ... we in Gesher will convene and decide,'' he told Israel
TV's Channel Two.
	   Using intermediaries, Netanyahu and Levy negotiated through the
night and a tentative deal was reached before dawn Wednesday,
Israel radio and Israel army radio said.
	   After the talks, Netanyahu canceled a visit to Switzerland which
had been scheduled to defuse tensions over a campaign to have Swiss
banks pay restitution to Holocaust victims.
	   Netanyahu called off his trip at the last minute ``because of
his effort to expand the Cabinet and achieve a stronger base for
policy measures,'' his office said.

	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Crucial legislative elections Wednesday
in four states appeared to hand a crushing defeat to India's
governing Hindu nationalist party in its strongholds, exit polls
showed, opening the possibility that other parties will vie to
unseat the ruling coalition.
	   This was the first political test since Prime Minister Atal
Bihari Vajpayee's 19-party coalition government took office eight
months ago. Exit polls showed a resurgent Congress Party, led by
Sonia Gandhi, heading for landslide victories in two Bharatiya
Janata Party-governed states.
	   Violence marred voting in at least one state. Three people were
killed and 16 wounded in a gunfight between political rivals in a
rural area of Madhya Pradesh in central India, Press Trust of India
reported. Voting was peaceful in the other three states.
	   Nearly 58 percent of more than 80 million voters turned out
Wednesday in four of India's 26 states. Counting begins Saturday
and final results are expected Sunday.
	   Such results could aggravate tensions in Prime Minister
Vajpayee's wobbly coalition. Already, the BJP's relations with
three key allies are precarious and a fourth coalition partner is
breaking up because of political infighting.
	   Analysts expect Sonia Gandhi, the new leader of the Congress
Party, to try to cobble together a new coalition to replace the
Hindu nationalist-led federal government. Communist and socialist
lawmakers already have pledged support to the widow of slain former
Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi.
	   Vajpayee denied that the state results would affect his
government. ``Even if the results go against us, this is not going
to affect the government at the center,'' he said in Lucknow,
capital of the northern Uttar Pradesh state.
	   His BJP party had hoped that testing of nuclear devices in May
would create a euphoria and instill a sense of pride among people.
	   But the key issues during the election campaign turned out to be
shortages of onion, edible oil, electricity and water, especially
at the peak of summer.
	   ``The humble onion seems set to prevail over the nuclear
mushroom,'' wrote Swapan Dasgupta, a political analyst, in India
Today magazine.
	   A massive shortage of onion and 700 percent price increase since
September became a powerful symbol of protest for opposition ranks.
Opposition candidates weighed themselves in onions, drove around
New Delhi wearing garlands of onions and huge onion-shaped balloons
loomed over the sites of political rallies.
	   Exit polls after 10-hour voting on Wednesday forecast the
Congress Party will sweep two-thirds of the 70 seats in the state
assembly of New Delhi. That would dislodge the state government of
the right-wing Bharatiya Janata Party in India's capital.
	   The exit poll, conducted by the private Center for Media
Studies, covered 1,500 voters. A separate poll conducted by the
state television, Doordarshan, agreed.
	   More than 80 million voters were eligible to choose 626 state
legislators from 5,000 candidates in New Delhi state; Rajasthan in
India's western desert; the central Madhya Pradesh state; and in
the remote northeastern state of Mizoram.
	   In other states, the exit polls predicted Congress would oust
the BJP from Rajasthan but may lose Madhya Pradesh. In Mizoram,
which is removed from national politics, Congress was likely to
lose to regional parties, according the exit polls.
	   In another violent incident, police arrested a Congress Party
candidate, Hari Singh Narvaria, after he fired into the air
apparently to scare away his opponents, United News of India news
agency said. Leftist extremists were blamed for looting a polling
station.

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Secretary-General Kofi Annan said
Wednesday that he is considering a trip to Libya next week that
might help close a deal to try two Libyan suspects in the Pan Am
Lockerbie case.
	   Annan is traveling to North Africa beginning Thursday to resume
a visit he cut short Nov. 12 to deal with the Iraq crisis.
	   A Libyan legal team has been meeting regularly with Annan's
legal counsel to discuss the U.S.-British proposal to try the
suspects in the Netherlands according to Scottish law and using
Scottish judges.
	   Because of some positive developments over the past few weeks,
``there is now a good chance that the suspects might finally be
brought,'' to trial, a U.N. source said on condition of anonymity.
	   He said there is a ``sense of optimism,'' and that Annan
wouldn't go to Libya unless he had a sense that a deal was
possible.
	   Libya has accepted the proposal in theory, but had objected to
its call for the suspects to be jailed in a Scottish prison if
found guilty. The Tripoli government had insisted the suspects
serve any prison time in Libya or the Netherlands.
	   It wasn't immediately known if Libyan officials had indicated
some flexibility on that point, which diplomats have said was
Libya's major concern.
	   Two Libyans, Abdel Basset Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah, are
accused of planting the suitcase bomb that ripped apart the New
York-bound Pan Am jet on Dec. 21, 1988, killing 270 people in the
air and on the ground at Lockerbie, Scotland.
	   Annan told reporters entering U.N. headquarters Wednesday that
he had hoped for a breaththrough in the case by the end of
November.
	   ``If that doesn't happen, I will be in the region next week and
the question has been raised if it would be helpful for me to go
there and bring the issue finally to closure,'' he said.
	   ``I haven't made up my mind yet, but it has not been excluded,''
he said.
	   He said the discussions so far on the proposal had been ``very
constructive.''
	   On Wednesday, two British newspapers reported that Libya had
tried and jailed three officials for the 1988 bombing. The Guardian
said Abdullah al-Senussi, Musa Koussa and Mohammed al-Misrati _ who
were senior intelligence officials at the time of the bombing _
were sentenced to five to seven years in prison this month for
``dereliction of duty.''
	   The jailings, also reported by the Arabic newspaper Al-Hayat,
could not be immediately confirmed. And Libyan dissidents said the
reports appeared to be a political ploy by Libyan leader Col.
Moammar Gadhafi, who is under pressure to turn over the two primary
suspects.
	   For 10 years, the United States and Britain had demanded the two
be tried in the United States or Britain, but agreed in August to a
trial in the Netherlands in hopes of finally bringing the issue to
a close.
	   The Security Council endorsed the plan and agreed to suspend
sanctions once the two men are turned over. Council members also
agreed to consider additional sanctions if Libya didn't produce the
suspects.
	   The sanctions, which include an air embargo, were imposed to
force Gadhafi to turn the men over.
	   Annan was leaving Thursday for Paris, where he would attend a
conference before visiting Algeria, Tunisia, Abu Dhabi and Paris
again before returning to New York on Dec. 9.

U.S., Europeans stick to positions in banana row
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The banana trade dispute between the United States
and the European Union returned to the World Trade Organization
Wednesday with neither side changing its position.
	   While the United States maintained the threat of imposing
sanctions against the 15-nation EU, the European Union said the
threat must be dropped.
	   They two sides, who both insist they are complying with WTO
rules, agreed to keep the door open for further consultations.
	   The EU said last week it will support an accelerated WTO dispute
settlement procedure for the banana dispute if the United States
lifts the threat to impose 100 percent duties on a range of EU
imports.
	   The U.S. threat was in response to a new EU banana import system
that the U.S. administration claims is in violation of WTO rules
and unfairly favors imports from former European colonies.
	   The EU agreed this year to change its banana import system by
Jan. 1, 1999 after the WTO ruled that the existing system is
illegal.
	   If the EU agrees to a WTO panel examining the new system, ``it
would not then be logical for the United States to seek retaliatory
measures,'' a senior EU official said Wednesday, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
	   ``The United States cannot have its cake and eat it.''
	   The EU planned to ask for the opening of a separate dispute
settlement procedure against the U.S. sanctions move, the official
added.
	   ``These are not threats of unilateral sanctions,'' U.S. trade
ambassador Rita Hayes countered. ``Rather, they are preparation for
a measured, multilaterally authorized response to the EU's failure
to implement (the WTO ruling).''

OPEC meets amid low expectations of an agreement to lift prices
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs. UPDATES and RECASTS with start of meeting delayed, other
new material. Opening time uncertain. &QL; 
 &UR; By DIDI KIRSTEN TATLOW &QC;

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria, (AP) _ Internal divisions clouded the official
year-end gathering of OPEC ministers on Wednesday, making effective
action to lift slumping oil prices unlikely.
	   The opening of the meeting Wednesday evening was delayed while
oil ministers aired their differences informally behind closed
doors.
	   The problem: The oil market hasn't been this bad in over 11
years, and OPEC members don't know what to do about it.
	   Brent crude oil for delivery in January was trading in London at
just dlrs 11.31 on Wednesday, only slightly up from Tuesday's
15-year low.
	   OPEC's average oil price has nearly halved since this time last
year because of a world oil glut brought on by its ill-timed
decision last winter to boost production, coinciding with Asia's
economic crisis and falling demand.
	   Analysts said only fresh production cuts will raise the low
prices that are making gas cheap for consumers, badly hurting
economies in OPEC ountries.
	   That was unlikely to happen. Heavyweight Saudi Arabia believes
further cuts _ in addition to reductions agreed to in June _ would
be premature. It wants OPEC members to comply with the overall 2.6
million barrels-a-day June cut.
	   Several countries, including Venezuela, Iran and Indonesia, are
overproducing, analysts say.
	   Saudi Arabia fears further cuts will deprive the country of
market share if other nations don't stop overproducing.
	   Kuwait, Algeria and Liberia favor fresh cuts.
	   A possible outcome of the OPEC meeting, which could run through
Thursday morning or later, is a decision to extend June's cuts
beyond the initial one year, to the end of 1999.
	   Analysts said that's the bare minimum OPEC could do to prevent a
price rout.
	   But Saudi Arabia's fear of losing market share to overproducers
in the group, they said, may immobilize the organization.
	   ``It's a mess, as ever,'' said Leo Drollas, chief economist at
London's Center for Global Energy Studies.
	   Known for its disagreements, OPEC is facing an especially tricky
situation this time.
	   Its average price per barrel of crude oil has crashed dlrs 8.22
from dlrs 18.81 last November to dlrs 10.59, according to the last
available average price.
	   Government revenue in most OPEC countries has taken a hit.
Kuwait says its 1998 oil revenue will sink by 45 percent.
	   Further depressing the market, the United Nations Security
Council voted to roll over for six months Wednesday Iraq's
food-for-oil deal, meaning around 1.9 million barrels of oil a day
are reaching the world market from Iraq, keeping world supplies
high.
	   Reflecting the sense of crisis, Algeria's oil minister Youcef
Yousfi called this week for a special meeting of heads of state of
OPEC's 11 members, saying the ``price crisis'' must be addressed at
the very top.
	   It would be OPEC's first leaders' meeting since 1975.
	   The oil ministers were expected to discuss the suggestion, but
the extent of support for it was unclear.
	   Suggestions on how to lift prices focused on cutting production
further or extending current cuts, introduced in June to soak up
the oil glut pushing down prices.
	   Indonesia said it supported extending current cuts, which OPEC
president Obaid bin Saif Al-Nasseri of the United Arab Emirates
acknowledged as ``a possibility.''

Rwandan leader says he is ready to talk to Congo's president
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) _ Rwandan President Pasteur Bizimungu, whose
government is supporting rebels in neighboring Congo, said
Wednesday he was ready to talk to Congolese President Laurent
Kabila during a summit of African leaders in France.
	   ``We're prepared to meet Kabila because we're looking at ways to
resolve crisis in the Great Lakes,'' he told reporters. ``But in
our view, that wouldn't make Kabila innocent. We think he has to be
prosecuted for the crimes of genocide.''
	   The two-day summit opens Thursday in Paris. Kabila is expected
to take part.
	   ``I will not say it will be a pleasure for me to be with
somebody who has time and again incited the population to
exterminate another section of the population,'' Bizimungu said.
``But on the other hand, I don't see how we can move this process
forward without involving Kabila who has the power of the gun.''
	   So far, Kabila, who has the support of troops and arms from
Zimbabwe, Angola, Namibia and Chad, has refused to negotiate with
the Congolese rebels, who rose up on Aug. 2.
	   Kabila has instead demanded that Rwanda and Uganda withdraw
support for the insurgents and leave Congo.
	   Rwanda and Uganda say they will stay in Congo as long as the
country remains unstable. They accuse Kabila of enlisting in war
thousands of Rwandan and Ugandan rebels who had used Congo as their
rear base.
	   Bizimungu said Kabila had incited the population to kill members
of the Tutsi minority, and was responsible for a series of
anti-Tutsi massacres in eastern, central and southern Congo.
	   On Monday, the United Nations urged member states to stop the
flow of arms into the hands of former Rwandan Hutu soldiers and
militiamen responsible for a 1994 genocide in Rwanda and who have
joined forces with Congolese army.
	   More than 500,000 minority Tutsis and politically moderate Hutus
were slaughtered before Tutsi-led rebels won power in Rwanda in
July 1994 and stopped the killing.
	   Bizimungu described the relations with France, an ally of the
former Hutu government, as ``not good, not bad.''
	   He said future relations will depend on the results of the
French parliamentary inquiry into allegations that the former
President Francois Mitterand's government provided arms to the Hutu
soldiers when it became clear the genocide was imminent.

Public `desperate' for Belfast accord to work, Blair says
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs; UPDATES throughout with meeting ends &QL; 
 &UR; By SHAWN POGATCHNIK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ The ordinary Protestant and
Catholic citizens of Northern Ireland are ``desperate'' for their
politicians to put Belfast's peace accord into action, British
Prime Minister Tony Blair said Wednesday after meeting with all
major parties.
	   Blair traveled on to Dublin, where on Thursday he will become
the first British leader to address the Irish Republic's parliament
since the country won independence from Britain in 1922.
	   But that hopeful encounter is being overshadowed by the profound
difficulties hobbling the formation of a new compromise government
for Northern Ireland, the intended cornerstone of the accord struck
by eight parties in April.
	   Blair emphasized his sense of frustration after the all-day
talks at Stormont, the center of British administration in Northern
Ireland and venue for the still-unformed local government, which is
supposed to take over many powers in February.
	   He pledged ``to keep the momentum going forward, because I know
the people out there are just desperate for this thing to work.''
	   Gerry Adams, leader of the IRA-allied Sinn Fein party, left the
discussions early after declaring that the north's British
Protestant politicians were conspiring to exercise a ``veto'' over
previous agreements.
	   Sinn Fein is expecting to receive two positions in Northern
Ireland's new administration, which could have up to 12 posts.
	   ``While no one likes to use the word `crisis,' there can be no
doubt about the seriousness of the situation,'' Adams said.
	   But David Trimble, Protestant leader of the Ulster Unionist
Party and would-be leader of the new government, is insisting Sinn
Fein won't be eligible unless the Irish Republican Army first
starts to destroy its weapons stocks, a goal contained in the
accord.
	   Trimble's designated Catholic deputy in the new government,
Seamus Mallon, said if he, Trimble and Adams didn't sort out their
difficulties within the next 10 days there would be ``a grave
danger that in effect the political process will lose
credibility.''

U.N. promises to begin tougher inspections within days
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES with Iraq denouncing opposition meetings,
background, CHANGES byline. No pickup. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ The United Nations will bring new
inspection teams to Iraq within days to carry out searches, a U.N.
spokeswoman said Wednesday, in what will likely pose a major test
to Iraq's promise to cooperate with U.N. inspectors.
	   U.N. teams have carried out more than a week of visits since
Iraq relented Nov. 14 and let them resume work after a two-week
hiatus. So far, Iraq has fully cooperated with the searches.
	   But most of those visits were to sites that monitors had already
checked and usually involved maintenance work on long-term
monitoring equipment. The real test will likely come during
searches of new sites by the visiting teams of weapons experts.
	   Caroline Cross, a U.N. spokeswoman for the weapons inspectors in
Baghdad, said the teams should arrive this week.
	   ``We do not know when the visiting teams will arrive but they
should be coming to carry out the inspections in the next few
days,'' Cross told The Associated Press.
	   Over the past week, a new dispute seemed to be emerging over a
demand by chief inspector Richard Butler for documents on Iraq's
weapons program. Iraq refused the request, saying many were already
destroyed. Other documents, like personal diaries, were either
irrelevant or had already been viewed by inspectors, it said.
	   Although the United States and Britain have said their forces in
the Gulf could still attack Iraq over the dispute, they seem
willing to wait to see how much help Iraq provides in the coming
weeks.
	   The inspectors must certify that Iraq has destroyed its
long-range missiles, chemical, biological and nuclear weapons and
programs to build them before the Security Council will lift
crippling sanctions imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990.
	   Inspectors blame Iraq's lack of cooperation for the long tenure
of their work. But Iraq believes the inspections are used as an
excuse to prolong the sanctions, which have impoverished the
country. Often, official media blame Butler personally.
	   Butler looks for ``a new excuse to be used by the United States
and Britain in order to trigger a new aggression against Iraq,''
said Al-Thawra, the newspaper of the ruling Baath Party.
	   ``It seems that his part is confined to creating a new crisis,
no more,'' the newspaper said in an editorial Wednesday.
	   But the crisis atmosphere in Iraq has largely subsided.
Officials have toned down their angry rhetoric, and attacks in the
official media have diminished somewhat in recent days.
	   The one exception is the Iraqi opposition, which was vilified by
a government spokesman Wednesday. The spokesman accused them of
``selling their national honor'' to U.S. and British intelligence.
	   Iraqi opposition groups, riven by ethnic, religious and
political differences, have sought to close their ranks in meetings
this week with the support of the United States and Britain.
	   The spokesman said the two countries are ``under wishful
thinking and pursuing the impossible'' if they try to topple Saddam
Hussein.

Sports Minister hopes London will bid for 2012 Games
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HUNTINGDON, England (AP) _ Sports Minister Tony Banks wants
Britain to bid for the Olympics of 2012. He believes the IOC will
regard Britain as a strong contender _ but only if London is the
bidding city.
	   Banks' announcement came the day after he met International
Olympic Committee president Juan Antonio Samaranch.
	   ``I consider the Olympics to be more significant than the World
Cup and I'm hoping that 2012 will be our year,'' Banks told
delegates at the annual National Conference for Sport and Physical
Recreation in Huntingdon.
	   ``But we must understand that the IOC are only prepared to go to
London,'' he said.
	   Previous bids, one by Birmingham for the 1992 Games and two by
Manchester for 1996 and 2000, failed badly.
	   If Britain submits a bid for the 2012 games, a decision which
has to be taken by the British Olympic Association, it will come up
against one from the United States, with eight U.S. cities already
expessing a strong interest.
	   Banks said that, for a British bid to be successful, a strong
team performance in the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games was a must.
	   ``We need to win 20 medals in Sydney to stand a chance of
hosting the Games,'' he said. ``The medal table tells you a lot
about the esteem of a country.''
	   Britain is also bidding for two other major international events
_ the 2003 world track and field championships and the 2006 World
Cup of soccer.

Portugal's attorney general drops lawmaker's request to extradite
</HEADLINE>
Suharto

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ The attorney general's office on
Wednesday said Portuguese law provided no legal grounds to pursue a
lawmaker's request seeking the extradition of former Indonesian
President Suharto.
	   The lawmaker, Nuno Correia da Silva, had based his request on
alleged human rights abuses committed in East Timor _ a former
Portuguese territory that Indonesia invaded in late 1975 and
annexed weeks later.
	   The United Nations still regards Portugal as East Timor's legal
authority. Correia da Silva had said this _ and current attempts to
extradite former Chilean dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet to Spain _
strengthened his case.
	   Indonesian lawmakers said Correia da Silva's request was
impossible and unreasonable as East Timor was an internal affair of
Indonesia and not a personal one of Suharto, who ruled Indonesia
for 32 years until resigning in May.
	   Human rights groups have accused Indonesian troops of widespread
abuses in East Timor, such as killing up to 200 people at a
pro-independence protest in 1991.

UN refugee group chides South Africa for new law failings
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAT REBER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ United Nations refugee
officials on Wednesday chided South Africa for falling short of
international standards in new legislation that would regulate
applications for asylum.
	   `We're not sure basic international standards will be met,''
said Dennis McNamara, a Swiss-based official of the United Nations
High Commissioner for Refugees.
	   He spoke at a press conference during a two-day symposium on
refugee protection within the Southern African Development
Community, a 14-nation regional organization.
	   UNHCR officials also warned against increasing xenophobia
throughout southern Africa that has resulted in sometimes fatal
attacks on both legitimate refugees fleeing unrest or persecution
in their homelands and larger numbers of so-called economic
immigrants _ people seeking jobs and a better life.
	   The new South African law, which has been passed by Parliament
and is awaiting signature by President Nelson Mandela, remains
silent on such issues as rights to education and health care for
refugees and excludes consideration of asylum for certain
nationalities, McNamara said.
	   South Africa was singled out because of its international
leadership role and membership on the UNHCR's governing body.
	   But officials said similarly restrictive laws were under
consideration in Botswana, Malawi and Zimbabwe, countries which
currently have few refugees.
	   ``Southern African states should use this period of
consolidation of democracy and fragile peace and stability to put
in place'' refugee protection, said Pretoria-based UNHCR official
Nicolas Bwakira in a statement.
	   About 40,000 people have applied for asylum status in South
Africa since the first democratic elections in 1994, but only half
have received approval. McNamara called for speedier handling of
applications.
	   Zambia has the largest number of refugees with 160,000, many of
them Angolans who have been there for years. About 200 Angolans
have been arriving every day during the current renewal of
conflict, said Yusuf Hassan, a UNHCR official.
	   Another 2,000 Angolans have fled to Namibia in recent months.
	   Officials refused to comment on the status of 700 Namibians who
have fled the Caprivi strip for Botswana, some of them advocates
for secession of the small neck of land.
	   The Botswana government has said a final decision on refugee
status would come from UNHCR.
	   But McNamara said such decisions must be made by the host
country.

	   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) _ Ever since Hurricane Mitch
destroyed his home and clothing stall, Oscar Solorzano has sifted
through bloated rats, fly-infested meat and human feces for such
small treasures as a mud-caked watch or a rank-smelling Barbie doll
to wash and sell.
	   Working on the steps leading down to the fetid Choluteca River
behind the Alvarez market, Solorzano has joined a growing rank of
trash miners in Honduras' devastated capital.
	   ``I once had to push a dead horse out of my way, which was
pretty gross,'' Solorzano said. ``But you can get used to anything
after a while.''
	   Desperately poor, many people are putting sanitation second to
survival after Hurricane Mitch swept through a month ago. Officials
say it killed 10,000 people and left those already eking out a
living with nothing.
	   From Nicaragua to Guatemala, the number of cases of cholera,
dengue and leptospirosis are rising.
	   ``I think now is when we're going to see the disease curve start
going up,'' said Dr. Luis Gerardo Castellanos, coordinator of
infectious diseases for the Pan American Health Organization in
Tegucigalpa.
	   ``We're seeing a lot of cases of respiratory illnesses, colds,
etc. with the dust, and environmental ailments, and people working
to clean up without shoes or shirts on in the mud and water, which
means their defenses are down.''
	   At least 560 cases of cholera have been confirmed in the
hardest-hit countries of Nicaragua, Honduras, Belize, El Salvador
and Guatemala, according to the Pan American Health Organization.
	   At least 21 people have died from the disease, which is
contracted mainly by contaminated food. Guatemala and Nicaragua
account for 95 percent of the cases.
	   At Tegucigalpa's main hospital, Hospital Escuela, diarrhea and
intestinal problems have risen from about three a week to more than
50, doctors said. In the northern city of San Pedro Sula, officials
warn that nearly half the meat being sold at discount prices comes
from unlicensed markets that don't meet health standards.
	   In Chimaltenango, Guatemala, for instance, doctors saw 37
cholera cases in a single day _ more than the total for the two
weeks before the disaster.
	   In Nicaragua, officials are investigating 264 possible cases of
leptospirosis, which is caused by a rare bacteria in rat urine.
	   The disease, which leads to liver and kidney failure, also has
appeared in small numbers in Honduras and Guatemala, but officials
said the increase could be due to a program that recently taught
local doctors to detect it.
	   Health workers have reported 1,086 cases of mosquito-borne
dengue _ about 400 more than the number reported during the same
period last year. Honduras accounts for all but six of those cases.
	   Doctors from a battery of international aid groups have spread
out from Nicaragua to Guatemala. The Pan American Health
Organization is calling for stronger measures to improve hygiene
and control rodents and mosquitos, particularly in shelters.
	   El Salvador reinforced sanitary checks at its borders with
Guatemala and Honduras on Wednesday to prevent leptispirosis and
cholera from entering the country.

Penguins trade Nedved to Rangers
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ALAN ROBINSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PITTSBURGH (AP) _ Petr Nedved's 1 1/2-year contract dispute
finally ended on Wednesday, with the Pittsburgh Penguins dealing
the unhappy center to the New York Rangers in a five-player trade.
	   The Penguins sent Nedved, seldom-used defenseman Chris Tamer and
center Sean Pronger to the Rangers for right wing Alexei Kovalev,
center Harry York and future considerations _ likely a significant
amount of cash.
	   The Rangers agreed to the deal only after working out a contract
with Nedved, who hasn't played in the North American National
Hockey League since the 1997 playoffs. The three-year contract is
believed to be worth slightly less than dlrs 4 million a season.
	   The bankrupt Penguins previously wanted as much as dlrs 4
million cash in a proposed Nedved for Kovalev trade, but NHL
commissioner Gary Bettman said he wouldn't allow so much money to
change hands.
	   The money would help the Penguins, who filed for bankruptcy
protection last month and may owe creditors as much as dlrs 123
million _ or more than the franchise's value. A French bank
recently lent them dlrs 20 million to get through the season.
	   ``We are fortunate to add a world class player like Alexei under
these difficult circumstances,'' Penguins general manager Craig
Patrick said. ``We finally feel we received proper value for our
asset.''
	   That asset is the 26-year-old Nedved, who sat out the 1997-98
season in a contract dispute and is playing for Las Vegas of the
International Hockey League this season. He promised never to play
again for the Penguins.
	   The Florida Panthers also were bidding for Nedved, who had 170
points in 154 games with Pittsburgh, including 45 goals and 54
assists in 1995-96.
	   Kovalev, 23, had seven points, including three goals, in 14
games with the Rangers this season after having a team-high 23
goals last season. In 402 career games with the Rangers, he had 119
goals and 156 assists.
	   Kovalev's contract is worth dlrs 1.5 million this season.

U.S. backs new Iraqi dissident in effort to oust Saddam
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SALAH NASRAWI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ The U.S. administration has decided to back
a new Iraqi dissident leader to spearhead a reinvigorated campaign
to oust President Saddam Hussein, Iraqi exiles said Wednesday.
	   The United States nominated Adnan al-Pachachi, a former foreign
minister, to forge a united Iraqi opposition movement that would
try to topple Saddam, the dissidents in exile said.
	   U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Martin Indyk proposed
al-Pachachi's name during his meeting with 16 Iraqi opposition
leaders in London on Tuesday, said some of the participants.
	   Al-Pachachi, who also attended the meeting, said in a telephone
interview from London: ``I think this is our last chance and we
should not loose it.''
	   There was no immediate statement from U.S. embassies about the
meeting.
	   President Bill Clinton has proclaimed that Saddam's ouster is a
major U.S. goal in efforts to protect U.S. interests in the region.
The U.S. Congress has also allocated dlrs 97 million aid for Iraqi
dissidents.
	   On Tuesday, Indyk urged the opposition figures to drop their
differences and unite in the struggle against Saddam, said the
participants, speaking on condition of anonymity. The dissidents,
who spoke with The Associated Press, included supporters of
al-Pachachi as well as members of other opposition groups.
	   The backing for al-Pachachi indicates that the United States is
edging away from Ahmed Chalabi, the head of the U.S.-backed Iraqi
National Congress.
	   The INC is a 7-year-old umbrella organization of Kurdish, Shiite
and leftist groups. Most of its activists have abandoned the
organization in protest against Chalabi's leadership.
	   Al-Pachachi was the foreign minister in the government that was
toppled in the 1968 military coup that brought Saddam's Baath party
to power. He later became a political adviser to the president of
the United Arab Emirates.
	   He has been involved in opposition efforts to topple Saddam
since the end of the 1991 Gulf War and is widely respected among
Iraq exiles.
	   One reason why al-Pachachi was chosen could be that he is a
Sunni. Members of this mainstream sect of Islam hold key positions
in the Iraqi regime and al-Pachachi would be in the best position
to woo them if he ever won control of the country.
	   The dissidents said Indyk's proposal backing al-Pachachi came
after many participants told him that there was no consensus on
Chalabi's leadership. Chalabi is a member of the Shiite community,
which despite being in a slight majority in Iraq wields little
power.
	   On Wednesday, Iraq dismissed the London talks as ``miserable and
impossible dreams.''
	   ``Those who sold their honor ... have becoming agents of the
U.S., British and Zionist intelligence agencies'' said a spokesman
for the Iraqi Culture and Information Ministry.

On Belgium visit, Kabila faces criticism over fighting, human

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Kabila, Pinheiro quotes
 &UR; By ANNA SATHIAH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - Congolese President Laurent Kabila's
first official visit to Belgium attracted a flurry of criticism
Wednesday over his refusal to negotiate with rebels and alleged
role in human rights violations.
	   Kabila faced demands from the European Union that he negotiate
with the rebels waging a four-month insurgency.
	   But Kabila, who met with the EU's Commissioner for relations
with Africa, Joao de Deus Pinheiro for two hours late Wednesday,
denied there was a rebellion in his country and blamed the violence
on outside interference.
	   ``There is no rebellion. There are Ugandan and Rwandan troops
occupying the territory,'' Kabila told reporters on his way out of
the meeting.
	   The Congolese leader also emphatically denied reports of alleged
human rights violations by him and his government. ``These reports
have been made up by those who couldn't stand the (political)
change,'' he said.
	   Conceicao Van Dunem, the EU's spokeswoman on African affairs,
had earlier hinted that EU aid could depend on a solution to the
conflict. ``There is no development without peace, and no peace
without reconciliation,'' she told reporters Tuesday.
	   Kabila said after his talks with Pinheiro that they had
discussed the situation in Congo and the EU had promised aid ``to
rebuild roads, and for democracy'' in Congo, but neither he nor
Pinheiro gave details.
	   ``We must try first to solve the problem of instability in
Congo, then prepare the reconstruction of the country,'' Pinheiro
simply told reporters, adding that he and Kabila had had ``very,
very frank talks.''
	   At a dinner Tuesday with Belgian politicians, Kabila said he
will allow political parties again starting in January and
announced elections for April. ``As of January, the freedom of
political parties will be proclaimed ... and the (April) ballot
results will be respected,'' he said.
	   Kabila has previously announced elections for next year but
without specifying a date or a month.
	   Kabila has refused direct talks with rebels in his country
demanding instead that Rwanda and Uganda end their support for the
insurgents.
	   Human rights abuses under the late President Mobutu Sese Seko
led the EU to suspend all aid but emergency humanitarian supplies
in 1992, when the country was known as Zaire. Aid has not been
resumed.
	   European officials are anxious to resolve the Congolese conflict
fearing it could escalate into a wider regional war. Already the
fighting has dragged in troops from Namibia, Zimbabwe, Chad and
Angola to support Kabila while Rwanda and Uganda back the rebels.
	   Kabila arrived late Tuesday for a three-day stay in Belgium. On
Thursay he will meet with Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene and King
Albert II.
	   The visit is Kabila's first to Congo's former colonial ruler
since he toppled Mobutu to take power in 1997. His trip has sparked
protests from human rights organizations and alleged victims of
rights abuse.
	   Lawyers representing members of Congo's Tutsi minority and an
opposition political group have filed law suits against Kabila in
Belgian courts accusing him of inciting ethnic hatred against
Tutsis and other violations of international law.
	   But lawyers acknowledged that, as a serving head of state,
Kabila can claim diplomatic immunity.
	   On Monday, Amnesty International released a report on Congo
highlighting atrocities by government and opposition forces.
	   It cited widespread human rights abuses by the rebels including
killings, torture and rape, but said Kabila's forces also massacred
civilians suspected of sympathizing with the opposition.
	   Fearing protests from opposition supporters among Belgium's
12,000-strong Congolese community, the Congolese embassy in
Brussels has demanded enforced security during the visit.

Sampras wins again, Agassi retires in match against Corretja
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOVER, Germany (AP) _ Pete Sampras is playing too well to have
to worry about figuring out the intricacies of the round-robin
format.
	   After beating Carlos Moya 6-3, 6-3 on Wednesday, Sampras was not
even aware that he had clinched a place in the semifinals of the
ATP World Championship.
	   ``That's nice to hear,'' Sampras said after being told at the
post-match news conference that he had secured a place in the last
four.
	   ``It's certainly a good feeling to be here over the weekend,''
Sampras said.
	   Sampras is seeking to become the first man to finish as No. 1 in
the world for six years in a row.
	   Marcelo Rios, the only player who can threaten Sampras, trails
by 33 points in the computer rankings and has to do better than
Sampras in the elite season-ending championship that brings
together the top eight players of the year.
	   But Rios, who was not scheduled to play Wednesday, lost his
first match to Tim Henman and is battling a back injury. He now has
to win his next two round-robin matches to reach the semifinals and
stay in the chase.
	   The eight players are split into two groups and Sampras and Rios
cannot meet until the semifinals.
	   ``It helps,'' Sampras said of Rios losing the first match. ``I'm
also helping myself by winning. I can't really be too concerned
about what Marcelo is doing.''
	   ``I have to concentrate on my matches. If I take care of things
myself and go out and win, then it should be hopefully good enough.
But I must admit I was rooting for the Englishman (Henman)
yesterday,'' Sampras said.
	   Sampras was certainly good enough to beat Moya in only 62
minutes. Moya, the French Open champion who is now 1-1, had beaten
Sampras in a group match last year but Sampras went on to win the
dlrs 3.5 million event for the fourth time.
	   On Tuesday, Sampras was equally impressive in dismissing Yevgeny
Kafelnikov in straight sets.
	   ``It's not easy to play well like I have been today and
yesterday. I was coming into today's match pretty confident,''
Sampras said. ``I wanted to make sure I was coming in a little bit
more than last year, chipping and charging, trying to put as much
pressure on him as possible.''
	   ``Last year I must admit I felt a little flat. This year, with
the ranking up for grabs, I just made a concerted effort to come
here a little bit early and prepare as best as I can.
	   ``It's obviously a very big week for Marcelo and I. I just
wanted to give myself the best chance possible to play well here,''
said Sampras, who fired 13 aces.
	   The second American in the field, Andre Agassi, retired in his
opening match against Alex Corretja because of a back injury.
Corretja was leading 5-7, 6-3, 2-1 when Agassi quit.
	   Agassi was practicing with Corretja on Monday when he fell and
hurt his back and has been receiving shots and other treatment
since then.
	   ``It was definitely painful even this morning in my warmup. I
needed to give it a go, at least try to keep the points short,''
Agassi said.
	   ``But I hit a swinging volley and when I twisted it was just
like somebody stuck a knife in me. Pretty soon it got quite
pointless,'' he said.
	   Agassi, who won the event in 1990, said he would wait until
Thursday before deciding whether to continue the tournament, which
is possible under its round-robin format, but added that he would
be surprised if he played.
	   Although he has surged back No. 4 this year after falling as low
as No. 141 at the same time last year, Agassi has not done well at
major tournaments this season.
	   ``The year has been great for me in many respects, but the great
tournaments have been pretty disappointing,'' Agassi said. ``I've
worked really hard and had to grind week after week to get myself
in position, only to struggle when I got into position.''

OPEC meets amid low expectations of an agreement to lift prices
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES and RECASTS with start of meeting delayed, other new
material. Opening time uncertain. &QL; 
 &UR; By DIDI KIRSTEN TATLOW &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria, (AP) _ Internal divisions clouded the official
year-end gathering of OPEC ministers on Wednesday, making effective
action to lift slumping oil prices unlikely.
	   The opening of the meeting Wednesday evening was delayed while
oil ministers aired their differences informally behind closed
doors.
	   The problem: The oil market hasn't been this bad in over 11
years, and OPEC members don't know what to do about it.
	   Brent crude oil for delivery in January was trading in London at
just dlrs 11.31 on Wednesday, only slightly up from Tuesday's
15-year low.
	   OPEC's average oil price has nearly halved since this time last
year because of a world oil glut brought on by its ill-timed
decision last winter to boost production, coinciding with Asia's
economic crisis and falling demand.
	   Analysts said only fresh production cuts will raise the low
prices that are making gas cheap for consumers, badly hurting
economies in OPEC countries.
	   That was unlikely to happen. Heavyweight Saudi Arabia believes
further cuts _ in addition to reductions agreed to in June _ would
be premature. It wants OPEC members to comply with the overall 2.6
million barrels-a-day June cut.
	   Several countries, including Venezuela, Iran and Indonesia, are
overproducing, analysts say.
	   Saudi Arabia fears further cuts will deprive the country of
market share if other nations don't stop overproducing.
	   Kuwait, Algeria and Liberia favor fresh cuts.
	   A possible outcome of the OPEC meeting, which could run through
Thursday morning or later, is a decision to extend June's cuts
beyond the initial one year, to the end of 1999.
	   Analysts said that's the bare minimum OPEC could do to prevent a
price rout.
	   But Saudi Arabia's fear of losing market share to overproducers
in the group, they said, may immobilize the organization.
	   ``It's a mess, as ever,'' said Leo Drollas, chief economist at
London's Center for Global Energy Studies.
	   Known for its disagreements, OPEC is facing an especially tricky
situation this time.
	   Its average price per barrel of crude oil has crashed dlrs 8.22
from dlrs 18.81 last November to dlrs 10.59, according to the last
available average price.
	   Government revenue in most OPEC countries has taken a hit.
Kuwait says its 1998 oil revenue will sink by 45 percent.
	   Further depressing the market, the United Nations Security
Council voted to roll over for six months Wednesday Iraq's
food-for-oil deal, meaning around 1.9 million barrels of oil a day
are reaching the world market from Iraq, keeping world supplies
high.
	   Reflecting the sense of crisis, Algeria's oil minister Youcef
Yousfi called this week for a special meeting of heads of state of
OPEC's 11 members, saying the ``price crisis'' must be addressed at
the very top.
	   It would be OPEC's first leaders' meeting since 1975.
	   The oil ministers were expected to discuss the suggestion, but
the extent of support for it was unclear.
	   Suggestions on how to lift prices focused on cutting production
further or extending current cuts, introduced in June to soak up
the oil glut pushing down prices.
	   Indonesia said it supported extending current cuts, which OPEC
president Obaid bin Saif Al-Nasseri of the United Arab Emirates
acknowledged as ``a possibility.''

Mbeki brushes off concerns about buying Swedish warplanes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Just days after his government
announced plans to buy Swedish warplanes, South African Vice
President Thabo Mbeki was barraged Wednesday with questions about
whether the country should be using the money for social services
instead.
	   Mbeki dismissed the implied criticisms pointedly, suggesting
that Swedes posing the questions were being more moralistic than
pragmatic.
	   ``We want to have a defense force ... So long as it is there it
has to be equipped,'' he said at a news conference.
	   ``Maybe if Sweden said 'It's all right, don't worry, we'll take
care of your defense interests, that would be very nice for us _
and let Sweden pay for it, that would be very nice indeed,'' he
said.
	   South Africa announced last week that it planned to buy 28
Sweish-made JAS Gripen warplanes. The announcement of the
15-billion-kronor (dlrs 2 billion) plan was greeted happily in the
Swedish business community; no country other than Sweden has so far
bought the planes.
	   But critics say South Africa could better use the money by
building houses and clinics for its poor.
	   ``The argument is a false argument,'' Mbeki said. ``The idea
that the money that you are using to acquire defense equipment is
necessarily money that is being diverted from housing is ...
emotionally appealing but it is wrong.''
	   Mbeki said keeping the defense forces in good shape was
especially important to South Africa's aim of being a regional
peacekeeper.
	   ``We cannot say that we don't have responsibility for
peacekeeping processes on the African continent because we need to
build a house,'' he said. ``It's not a responsibility we can run
away from.''

Serbia warns of war if Kosovo is granted more than self-rule
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Defying U.S. efforts to hammer out a
peace deal for Kosovo, Serbia on Wednesday moved to impose its own
plan and warned that anything beyond self-rule for the province
would trigger a regional war.
	   Top Serbian officials, led by President Milan Milutinovic,
arrived in Kosovo's capital for another doomed attempt to hold
talks with majority ethnic Albanians, who refuse to attend without
foreign mediation.
	   But the government signaled its determination to push through a
Serb proposal granting self-rule for Kosovo, signing a declaration
of support for it with representatives of other ethnic groups.
	   Although it will have little effect without ethnic Albanian
support, the declaration reflects Serbia's defiance of
international and ethnic Albanian attempts to loosen the republic's
grip on Kosovo.
	   ``There is no solution for Kosovo if the area is excluded for
Serbian authorities. In state territory, nobody has the right ...
to create another state,'' declared the delegation leader, Ratko
Markovic.
	   He warned that granting anything more than self-rule for Kosovo
would amount to ``a tragic political act leading inevitably to a
military conflict, not only within Serbia but also among countries
bordering Kosovo and probably a wider regional war.''
	   Kosovo is a province of Serbia, the dominant republic in
Yugoslavia, which also includes Montenegro. Kosovo's ethnic
Albanians are seeking independence for the region, but Serbia wants
to keep it under its rule.
	   With the two sides' positions still far apart, there are fears
that Kosovo could explode into fierce fighting again next spring.
	   Markovic's warning came a week after Serb authorities rejected a
U.S.-drafted plan which envisages loosening Kosovo's ties with
Serbia's central authorities, while keeping it formally within its
borders and under federal jurisdiction.
	   A spokesman for the chief U.S. envoy for Kosovo, Christopher
Hill, dismissed the declaration signed in Pristina, saying ``it has
nothing to do with us.''
	   Phillip Reeker said Hill would continue his shuttle diplomacy
between the two sides with a visit to Pristina on Friday.
	   Ethnic Albanian politicians have already dismissed the Serb
plan, which would keep Kosovo firmly within Serbia while granting
the province self-rule.
	   Negotiator Fatmir Seidiu called Serbia's insistence on its own
plan ``obstruction of international efforts, especially those of
the United States.''
	   He praised the American plan, saying ``we hope that plan will be
further enriched with our suggestions and in the end fit our
legitimate demands.''
	   Markovic said proposals to make Kosovo a third, separate entity
within Yugoslavia, which some on the Albanian side advocate,
``would only mean the eventual loss of Kosovo.''
	   In an indirect reference to the U.S. plan, Markovic called it
``most cunning fraud to make Kosovo a separate federal unit.''
	   Kosovo has been in turmoil since Serbs launched a crackdown last
February to crush an armed rebellion by separatist rebels. The
clashes claimed hundreds of lives and forced some 300,000 people to
leave their homes.
	   An Oct. 12 agreement mediated by U.S. envoys led to an end of
hostilities in Kosovo and the withdrawal of many of the government
forces. But sporadic violence continues, with each side blaming the
other.
	   On Wednesday, Serb authorities said police had killed an ethnic
Albanian rebel after guerrillas attacked them in southwestern
Kosovo. They said the Kosovo Liberation Army had carried out 176
attacks in the past month, killing five policemen and four
civilians.
	   Ethnic Albanian sources, meanwhile, said Serb forces sealed off
the area around Kraljane, near the Albanian border town of
Djakovica, for an hour and a half.
	   The claims could not be independently verified.

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ In its first response to the new dispute
over sensitive Iraqi documents, the Security Council said it fully
supports the work of U.N. weapons inspectors charged with
destroying Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
	   The council's one-line statement was issued Tuesday after a
three-hour council meeting that included a briefing by the top
inspector, Richard Butler, on his efforts to obtain documents he
says are necessary to his work.
	   According to his speaking notes, Butler reminded members of his
right to the documents under their own resolutions and noted that
verifying Iraq's disarmament through documents was actually less
confrontational than intrusive inspections.
	   In its statement, the council didn't address the issue of
whether Iraq's reluctance to turn over the documents showed it
wasn't cooperating fully with the inspectors. Iraq promised that
cooperation when _ confronted with U.S. and British airstrikes _ it
agreed Nov. 14 to resume working with arms experts after a two-week
hiatus.
	   The council won't lift sanctions imposed after Iraq's 1990
invasion of Kuwait until inspectors report that Baghdad's chemical,
biological and nuclear arms and missiles have been destroyed.
	   Iraq said the disputed papers either don't exist, were already
shown to inspectors or had no relevance to the work of Butler's
U.N. Special Commission, which is responsible for disarming Iraq of
its banned weapons.
	   Russia and China, which along with France take a more
sympathetic line toward Baghdad, pressed Butler on Tuesday to
explain how he knows the requested documents actually exist,
diplomats attending the closed meeting said.
	   ``We want to make sure that what we are discussing is based on
fact,'' said Sergey Lavrov of Russia.
	   China's deputy ambassador, Shen Guofang, told reporters that the
council itself should decide what documents were relevant to the
work of UNSCOM.
	   ``Then the council should consider what steps to take,'' he
said.
	   Russia blocked the council from issuing a stronger statement
that would have noted Iraq's Nov. 14 pledge to cooperate fully,
expressed concern at Iraq's response and called on Baghdad to
respond positively, council diplomats said.

Prime ministers of ex-Soviet republics discuss cooperation

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Prime ministers from 12 former Soviet republics
gathered Wednesday to seek ways to bolster cooperation at a time
when many face deep economic problems.
	   The prime ministers from the Commonwealth of Independent States,
an alliance of former Soviet republics, also discussed establishing
a free trade zone among member states _ an idea first put forward
when the alliance was founded seven years ago _ and cooperation in
defense and border controls.
	   Russia's Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, who chaired the
Wednesday session, told his colleagues that ``only together can the
Commonwealth nations overcome today's crisis.''
	   He conceded that the devaluation of the Russian ruble in August
has added new problems to the already complicated economic
relations within the CIS, but insisted at a news conference later
that ``something good comes out of the bad: The difficulties spur
us toward closer economic relations among ourselves.''
	   Boris Berezovsky, a controversial Russian tycoon who serves as
CIS executive secretary, organized Wednesday's meeting. He had just
returned to Moscow from visits to all the CIS nations, where he
sought to build support for a plan that would give additional
powers to the group.
	   Berezovsky says his proposals have broad backing, though a
number of CIS leaders have opposed them.
	   Some have expressed concerns that a strong CIS structure would
interfere with their sovereignty, but Berezovsky insisted that the
worries revolved mostly around the method of reform, not the need
for it.
	   ``My many meetings with the presidents of the Commonwealth
states have unambiguously demonstrated an interest in a more
effective Commonwealth; there is no doubt about that,'' he told the
news conference.
	   ``I have discussed this topic with presidents for five, six
hours. Obviously, presidents are not the kind of people who would
discuss an empty, uninteresting subject,'' he said.
	   The CIS, formed in the wake of the 1991 Soviet collapse, meets
often. But members have been unable to realize ambitious plans for
closer cooperation. Most member states are reluctant to surrender
their independence to a group they believe will be dominated by
Russia.
	   Attempts at closer integration have also been hampered by
economic troubles and big differences in the size and level of
development of the countries' economies.
	   Berezovsky, an unconventional figure for a bureaucratic post,
added that a reformed CIS would need to be ``filled with
intelligent, modern people'' to succeed.
	   Presidents of the CIS nations are expected to meet next month or
in January.

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Italy's Communist lawmakers revealed Wednesday that
an asylum-seeking Turkish Kurd guerrilla came into Italy under
their escort, defending a venture that has sparked boycotts, hunger
strikes and international tensions as a way to bring the Kurdish
cause to the forefront.
	   Ramon Mantovani, chief of foreign affairs for the hard-line
Communist Refoundation Party, said he accompanied Abdullah Ocalan
to Rome from Moscow on Nov. 12. Mantovani said he had assured
Ocalan that Italian law would forbid his extradition to Turkey but
insisted the idea of seeking asylum in Italy was Ocalan's.
	   ``He told me he had two choices: Going back to the mountains and
fighting with the guerrillas or trying initiate to peace talks,
something he said he wanted _ and had _ to do,'' Mantovani . ``He
had every intention of getting on the first plane to Rome.''
	   Ocalan was arrested as soon as he came to Rome with a false
passport. A Rome court freed him after a week, rejecting Turkey's
arrest warrant under Italian law forbidding extradition of suspects
who face a possible death penalty, as Ocalan does in Turkey.
	   Kurds in cities across Europe protested Ocalan's arrest with
marches, sit-ins, hunger strikes, self-immolations and a
suicide-bombing. The people of Turkey protested with almost equal
fervor when Italy freed Ocalan, burning Italian clothes and cars
and launching boycotts that brought threats of European Union
sanctions against Turkey.
	   Mantovani said the Communists did not tell the Italian
government of their actions. He said the episode started when
Ocalan's people contacted Refoundation on Nov. 11, looking for
haven for the rebel leader after Syria expelled him.
	   The lawmaker flew to Moscow the next day and Russian officials
took him to the rebel leader, who was waiting for him at the
airport, he said.
	   Refoundation's stunning revelation comes after numerous reports
_ denied by the government _ that Ocalan had a secret deal paving
his way to Italy.
	   Ocalan leads the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, which has
waged a 14-year-old war for Kurdish autonomy in southeastern
Turkey. The conflict has killed 37,000 people.
	   Germany also has warrants out for Ocalan but has said it won't
ask for his extradition. That leaves Italy stuck with a volatile
diplomatic dilemma.
	   Granting Ocalan asylum would further enrage Turkey, a NATO ally
and major trading partner, as well as the United States, which
wants him prosecuted. It could also make Italy a mecca for Kurdish
activists.
	   Italy has a small population of Kurdish exiles, about 1,000,
compared to Germany, with around 400,000. There are around 20 to 25
million Kurds spread out over Turkey, Syria, Iraq and Iran; some 12
to 15 million live in Turkey.
	   The Kurds were promised an independent homeland in 1920 after
the Ottoman Empire collapsed, but the international community
abandoned the idea in 1923. In Turkey, they are not recognized as
an official minority, which means, among other things, that the use
of the Kurdish language is banned in education and broadcasting.
	   Ocalan said Wednesday that his decision to abandon armed
struggle and use Europe as a platform for peaceful resolution to
Kurds' complaints was ``irreversible.''
	   ``We want to do things like the Basques in Spain and the IRA in
Northern Ireland,'' he said in a statement read by his lawyers.
``We just want more autonomy and freedom.''
	   Ocalan was willing to stand trial, the lawyers said _ but not in
Turkey or Germany.

U.S., Europeans stick to positions in banana row
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The banana trade dispute between the United States
and the European Union returned to the World Trade Organization on
Wednesday with neither side changing its position.
	   While the United States maintained the threat of imposing
sanctions against the 15-nation EU, the European Union said the
threat must be dropped.
	   They two sides, who both insist they are complying with WTO
rules, agreed to keep the door open for further consultations.
	   The EU said last week it will support an accelerated WTO dispute
settlement procedure for the banana dispute if the United States
lifts the threat to impose 100 percent duties on a range of EU
imports.
	   The U.S. threat was in response to a new EU banana import system
that the U.S. administration claims is in violation of WTO rules
and unfairly favors imports from former European colonies.
	   The EU agreed this year to change its banana import system by
Jan. 1, 1999 after the WTO ruled that the existing system is
illegal.
	   If the EU agrees to a WTO panel examining the new system, ``it
would not then be logical for the United States to seek retaliatory
measures,'' a senior EU official said Wednesday, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
	   ``The United States cannot have its cake and eat it.''
	   The EU planned to ask for the opening of a separate dispute
settlement procedure against the U.S. sanctions move, the official
added.
	   ``These are not threats of unilateral sanctions,'' U.S. trade
ambassador Rita Hayes countered. ``Rather, they are preparation for
a measured, multilaterally authorized response to the EU's failure
to implement (the WTO ruling).''

	   Next steps in the case of Gen. Augusto Pinochet following a
ruling by Britain's highest court Wednesday that the former Chilean
dictator has no immunity from prosecution:
	   _Britain's Home Secretary, Jack Straw, has until Dec. 2 to
decide whether Spain may initiate extradition proceedings. If he
says yes, proceedings will then begin in court. If he says no,
Pinochet would almost certainly be free to leave Britain as French
and Swiss extradition warrants, and complaints from other
countries, would likely also be blocked.
	   _Pinochet has been ordered to appear at Bow Street Magistrate's
Court in London on Dec. 2. The law requires anyone who is the
subject of an extradition order to appear in court as soon as
possible. Pinochet, 83, has been recuperating from back surgery
since he was arrested Oct. 16 in his hospital bed.
	   _If legal proceedings start, they would take many months. If
Pinochet eventually lost, the Home Secretary again would have to
decide whether to permit the extradition.

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Prosecutors and human rights advocates from
around the world hailed a British court ruling Wednesday upholding
the arrest of former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet as a
landmark decision against impunity.
	   Pinochet supporters in Chile called it a violation of national
sovereignty and the work of communists.
	   But the cheers way outnumbered the jeers worldwide.
	   Especially elated by the news was Isabel Allende, the daughter
of Socialist Chilean President Salvador Allende, who died during
the 1973 coup that put Pinochet in power for 17 years.
	   ``I feel enormous satisfaction on this historic day which has
been a blow to impunity and an encouragement to justice,'' she said
at a press conference in Madrid. Allende, a Socialist party
parliamentary deputy in Chile, said she had come to Spain to await
the announcement of the British ruling.
	   ``When crimes against humanity are committed, humanity has to
react,'' she said.
	   In Geneva, the United Nation's High Commissioner for Human
Rights Mary Robinson said the ruling ``will hearten human rights
defendants around the world.''
	   Robinson said the British court had ``confirmed the emerging
international consensus against impunity.''
	   Spain's conservative government reacted cautiously. Sticking to
a position that he would let the judicial process take its course,
Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar said Spain would respect any
decision by the British justice system and was confident that
relations with Chile would remain good.
	   The government has been reluctant to embrace prosecution of
Pinochet for fear of ruffling relations and damaging lucrative
trade ties.
	   Amnesty International called it ``a landmark breakthrough'' that
``reaffirms the international community's commitment towards the
fulfillment of basic human rights for all.''
	   Family members of Chileans killed or who disappeared during
Pinochet's dictatorship celebrated on the streets of London,
Santiago and Madrid at the 3-2 vote by Britain's highest court that
Pinochet does not enjoy diplomatic immunity from arrest.
	   The decision means Pinochet must remain in custody while Spain
seeks his extradition on charges of genocide related to killings
and torture by his security forces.
	   ``This is a surprise. This is a joy,'' France's Socialist Prime
Minister Lionel Jospin told reporters. ``It's bad news for all
dictators.''
	   Prosecutors in France, Switzerland and Germany saluted the
decision.
	   ``It's a victory for law and morality,'' said William Bourdon, a
lawyer representing some of the family members of French citizens
who disappeared. ``A trial of Pinochet is now possible in Paris and
in Madrid.''
	   France first asked for Pinochet's extradition on Nov. 12. A
French judge issued a second international arrest warrant Tuesday.
	   Pinochet was arrested on a Spanish arrest warrant Oct. 16 while
in a London hospital recuperating from back surgery.
	   In Switzerland, Geneva State Prosecutor Bernard Bertossa said
the decision ``marks an evolution in British justice.''
	   A state court in Dusseldorf, Germany also greeted the court
ruling.
	   ``This is another step toward opening a trial here with us,''
said court spokeswoman Brigitte Nordmann.
	   She said complaints from three German citizens against Pinochet
had been received by the court and that it was possible prosecutors
would now open an investigation and decide to ask British officials
for extradition.
	   There was no elation at the Pinochet Foundation headquarters in
Santiago, where supporters of the former dictator _ including many
retired military men _ gathered to await the British court's
decision.
	   Some supporters insulted and spat at journalists and even tried
to beat them.
	   ``This is a result of a job well-done by the ... communists,
they have so much money and support in Europe,'' said a woman in
tears who identified herself only as Monica.
	   ``Chilean sovereignty has been violated,'' said Alberto Espina,
president of the right-wing National Renewal Party. He said the
government should send a high-level mission to London to convince
the British government to release Pinochet.
	   There was no immediate reaction from the Chilean military or
President Eduardo Frei.

Milosevic fires Yugoslav Army chief

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic fired his army chief and replaced him with a
neo-communist supporter after a long dispute over the country's
strategy and the crisis in Kosovo.
	   Gen. Momcilo Perisic was reported Wednesday to have refused a
new job as defense adviser after his differences with Milosevic
cost him the top military post. The report in Montenegro's Pobjeda
daily could not be independently confirmed.
	   Official word of the firing came late Tuesday night in a terse
release carried by the state-run Tanjug news agency. It said
Perisic's deputy, Gen. Lt. Dragoljub Ojdanic, would replace him as
chief of staff while Perisic would take the adviser's position.
	   Independent Belgrade media have reported that Perisic was an
opponent of a neo-Communist party run by Milosevic's wife, Mirjana
Markovic. Ojdanic was reported close to her party, whose officials
have recently infiltrated top security posts in Yugoslavia, which
is dominated by its Serb republic.
	   Perisic has indirectly criticized Milosevic's defiant and
isolationist policies toward the West by saying ``we cannot fight
against the rest of the world.'' Markovic reportedly denounced
Perisic for making such ``defeatist'' statements.
	   Independent B 92 radio said replacing Perisic with a Milosevic
ally shows Yugoslavia's ruling couple fears a coup by officers
unhappy with the country's deep political and economic troubles and
by Milosevic's financial support of the police rather than the
army, which is faced with severe budget cuts.
	   It's the fourth major shakeup at the top of Yugoslavia's
establishment in as many weeks, as Milosevic apprently reshuffles
his closest associates.
	   Earlier this month, he fired state security chief Jovica
Stanisic and a top official of his Socialist party, Milorad
Vucelic. Stanisic was also replaced by a neo-communist supporter.
	   Perisic led the army throughout the early 1990s when former
Yugoslavia began disintegrating. During that time the army largely
took the Serb side, helping to constitute present-day Yugoslavia,
made up of Serbia and Montenegro.
	   Perisic was appointed chief of staff in 1993, after serving as a
commander of Serb forces fighting the Croats in Croatia's 1991 war
of secession.
	   From the beginning, Perisic had a reputation of occasionally
opposing some of the Yugoslav president's iron-fist moves.
Recently, he subtly criticized Milosevic's policy in Kosovo, the
Serbian province where ethnic Albanians are fighting for
independence, saying the conflict was partly the result of
``certain politicians' wish to stay in power.''
	   Although he never commented specifically on political issues,
Perisic was believed to be intent on keeping the army as neutral as
possible in Kosovo.
	   Perisic has also maintained ties with Milosevic's foe, Milo
Djukanovic, the pro-Western president of Montenegro who disagrees
with the Yugoslav president on numerous economic and political
issues, including the Kosovo crisis.
	   Analysts in Montenegro say Perisic's sacking heralds a possible
violent crackdown against the independent-minded Djukanovic.
	   Svetozar Marovic, speaker of Montenegro's parliament, said the
firing signified an attempt by Milosevic to ``consolidate his
autocracy.''
	   ``This is Milosevic's direct attack on Yugoslavia,'' he said.
``I think Milosevic doesn't want Yugoslavia to exist, he only wants
power.''

	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ Talk about a political football.
	   The first goal, a penalty, was scored by a Smallholder, a junior
coalition partner in the Hungarian parliament. The second was by a
member of the ruling Young Democrats-Civic Party, and Political
State Secretary of the Finance Ministry.
	   The Prime Minister didn't score.
	   To commemmorate the 45th anniversary of Hungary's famous 6-3
crushing of England at Wembley, the lawmakers of the two nations
played a sort of rematch Wednesday and, this time, the Hungarians
won 2-0.
	   The British were invited by Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who was
also member of the Hungarian squad. Orban is the only registered
soccer-playing prime minister in the world.
	   The scorers at the Ferencvaros stadium were Mate Fenyvesi, a
former international soccer player, from a penalty kick, and Mihaly
Varga, the man from the Finance Ministry.
	   Among the guests of honor were the few survivors of the
legendary match in 1953, which is popularly called the `match of
the century.'
	   The English team was represented by George Robb, while the
Hungarians by Ferenc Puskas, Nandor Hidegkuti, Jenoe Buzanszky and
Gyula Grosics.
	   Proceeds of the match was to go to aid flood victims of eastern
Hungary.

African lawmakers urge France to stay committed to Africa

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Faced with war, tribal conflicts and poverty,
African lawmakers Wednesday sought to persuade French politicians
not to step back from a commitment to the African continent.
	   ``We can't accept the absence of France in African conflicts,''
Abdelhadad Gamaledine, head of Egypt's parliament, told a
conference on France's African policy.
	   With European integration its top foreign policy priority,
France over the past several years gradually has signaled an
economic and military pullback from its former French-speaking
colonies in Africa.
	   The retreat along with a growing French interest in countries
like South Africa, where its influence has been limited, is a
growing worry to its traditional African partners.
	   ``If French relations with Africa expand, it can only be good
for us,'' said Sir Ramesh Jeewoolal, President of the National
Assembly of Mauritius. But, he asked, shouldn't Paris ``first
deepen ties with French-speaking countries ... before going
further.''
	   Seeking to allay African concerns, France is hosting a summit
this week of more than 40 African leaders that will focus on
security concerns and ways to help Africa achieve political and
military stability, as well as economic growth on the troubled
continent.
	   ``This policy is not one of rupture but of opening. It
integrates profound changes in the world and in Africa,'' said
French lawmaker Pierre Brana, a member of the National Assembly's
Foreign Affairs Commission.
	   The participants include not only French-speaking countries,
mainly France's former colonies in Africa, but countries where
French is not spoken and which now account for 50 percent of
France's trade on the continent.
	   Throughout Wednesday's conference, French lawmakers and
government officials insisted that France was not about to let go
of Africa but stressed that the terms of the relationship were
changing.
	   French officials say their new policy is ``no interference but
not indifference'' and maintain that is the purpose of troop
reductions in Africa announced last year.
	   France also wants the Organization of African Unity to play a
greater role as a mediator of African conflicts and for Africa to
develop its own peacekeeping forces.
	   At least some Africans say France still has an important
military role to play in restructuring their armed forces and
overcoming ethnic animosity to form national armies, said Mohamed
Sahnoun, U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan's special envoy to
Africa.
	   ``French military cooperation should be able to make a
contribution to this transformation of yesterday's soldier into a
modern soldier,'' said Sahnoun.
	   During the debates, African participants pleaded for greater
consultation by France in working out its Africa policy, more debt
relief and help in creating political institutions that will lead
to better government.

Duesseldorf court, rights group welcome London decision against
</HEADLINE>
immunity &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   DUESSELDORF, Germany (AP) _ The state court in Duesseldorf and
Amnesty International on Wednesday greeted a decision by Britain's
highest court that said former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet
has no immunity from arrest.
	   A Chilean government report says some 3,000 people were murdered
or disappeared during Pinochet's 1973-90 rule after he overthrew
Salvador Allende, an elected Marxist. At least three people in
Germany have filed complaints as victims.
	   ``This is another step toward opening a trial here with us,''
court spokeswoman Brigitte Nordmann told The Associated Press.
	   Nordmann said that state prosecutors had complaints from three
people on Pinochet, but could not predict how they would proceed
with the case.
	   It was possible they will investigate and ask for extradition,
she added. Pinochet is also wanted in Spain, Switzerland, France
and Belgium.
	   Lawyer Konstantin Thun said he represents a 70-year-old priest
and a 60-year-old union worker, both German citizens, who were
arrested and tortured in Chile under Pinochet's regime. He hopes
the Duesseldorf court will pursue their complaints.
	   The human rights group Amnesty International in Bonn said the
London court decision could help to make for a more just world.
	   ``It sees to it that the victims of the Chilean military
dictator no longer are made a mockery of,'' spokesman Nils Geissler
said.
	   Pinochet, who turned 83 on Wednesday, underwent back surgery
Oct. 9 during a regular visit to Britain and was arrested Oct. 16
in his bed at another hospital.

	   LONDON (AP) _ Prompting tears and whoops of joy, Gen. Augusto
Pinochet lost a court bid for immunity from arrest Wednesday,
leaving a British Cabinet minister to decide whether Spain can
start trying to extradite the former Chilean dictator on charges of
genocide and torture.
	   By a 3-2 vote, Britain's highest court ruled, in the words of
Lord Justice Johan Steyn, that Pinochet's alleged crimes were no
more part a head of state's functions than ``murdering his gardener
or arranging the torture of his opponents for the sheer spectacle
of it.''
	   Demonstrators, some sobbing with emotion, linked arms outside
Britain's highest court chanting ``Now is the time to pay for your
crime,'' and human rights organizations declared that the ruling
told dictators everywhere that there is no hiding place.
	   Pinochet, under police guard at a north London hospital, learned
the news on his 83rd birthday.
	   A Chilean government plane had been waiting to whisk him home.
But now he remains under arrest in Britain for what could be a long
time if Home Secretary Jack Straw, who must rule by Dec. 2, says
extradition proceedings can start.
	   In Chile, Pinochet supporters were enraged. His son, also named
Augusto, called the ruling sadistic and cruel, adding, ``Our hearts
are broken. A first battle has ended.''
	   In the capital of Santiago, police sprayed water cannons as
rival groups took to the streets, but generally it was peaceful.
	   In London's oak-panelled House of Lords, Pinochet opponents
gasped when, one by one, members of the five-judge tribunal
announced their decision. They overturned a High Court ruling that
Pinochet's arrest was illegal because he had immunity under English
law for actions taken as a foreign former head of state.
	   Key issues in the appeal were whether international law and
custom _ including trials of Rwanda Hutus and Bosnian Serbs for
genocide and war crimes, and Britain's 1988 adoption of a U.N.
Convention on Torture _ overrode this country's sweeping State
Immunity Act passed in 1978.
	   A Chilean government report says some 3,000 people were murdered
or disappeared at the hands of secret police during Pinochet's
1973-90 rule after he overthrew Salvador Allende, an elected
Marxist.
	   Pinochet was arrested Oct. 16 on a Spanish warrant soon after
undergoing back surgery.
	   The move upset the Chilean government because he has a
diplomatic passport and senator status as a compromise between his
right-wing supporters and the new democratic government.
	   ``We decided a long time ago it was better to be unpopular than
to be wrong,'' Chilean Ambassador Mario Artaza said Wednesday
evening, announcing Foreign Minister Jose Miguel Insulza will visit
Madrid and London to try to get Pinochet freed.
	   With hopes of immunity dashed, the general's best hope is that
Straw will block the proceedings _ a decision that would almost
certainly prompt international criticism of Prime Minister Tony
Blair's Labor government.
	   Pinochet, who doctors say is fit enough to be moved, also has to
appear at London's Bow Street Magistrate Court on Dec. 2 in what
would be his first public appearance since arriving in September on
a regular visit.
	   Britain's opposition Conservative Party immediately called for
Pinochet's release, and former prime minister Margaret Thatcher
said he was ``old, frail and sick, and on compassionate grounds
alone should be allowed to return to Chile.''
	   For the hundreds of Chileans who gathered at the Lords or
outside the Grovelands Priory, where Pinochet is hospitalized, it
was a day of highly charged celebration.
	   ``It has been a very long, difficult and sad road that we have
walked to get where we are today,'' said Sola Sierra, head of the
Families of Disappeared of Chile.
	   While a line of police stood impassively and tourists stared,
puzzled at all the fuss, Juan Zevola leaned over a police barricade
outside the House of Lords and shouted, ``It's a triumph for
democracy!''
	   ``It's a wake-up call to tyrants around the world who think
about embarking on mass murder,'' said Reed Brody of the New
York-based group Human Rights Watch.

Serbia warns of war if Kosovo is granted more than self-rule

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Defying U.S. efforts to hammer out a
peace deal for Kosovo, Serbia on Wednesday moved to impose its own
plan and warned that anything beyond self-rule for the province
would trigger a regional war.
	   Top Serbian officials, led by President Milan Milutinovic, tried
in vain again to hold talks in the provincial capital, Pristina,
with majority ethnic Albanians, who refuse to attend without
foreign mediation.
	   But the government signaled its determination to push through a
Serb proposal granting self-rule for Kosovo, signing a declaration
of support for it with representatives of other ethnic groups.
	   Although it will have little effect without ethnic Albanian
support, the declaration reflects Serbia's defiance of
international and ethnic Albanian attempts to loosen the republic's
grip on Kosovo.
	   ``There is no solution for Kosovo if the area is excluded for
Serbian authorities. In state territory, nobody has the right ...
to create another state,'' declared the delegation leader, Ratko
Markovic.
	   He warned that granting anything more than self-rule for Kosovo
would amount to ``a tragic political act leading inevitably to a
military conflict, not only within Serbia but also among countries
bordering Kosovo and probably a wider regional war.''
	   Kosovo is a province of Serbia, the dominant republic in
Yugoslavia, which also includes Montenegro. Kosovo's ethnic
Albanians are seeking independence for the region, but Serbia wants
to keep it under its rule.
	   With the two sides' positions still far apart, there are fears
that Kosovo could explode into fierce fighting again next spring.
	   Markovic's warning came a week after Serb authorities rejected a
U.S.-drafted plan which envisages loosening Kosovo's ties with
Serbia's central authorities, while keeping it formally within its
borders and under federal jurisdiction.
	   A spokesman for the chief U.S. envoy for Kosovo, Christopher
Hill, dismissed the declaration signed in Pristina, saying ``it has
nothing to do with us.''
	   Phillip Reeker said Hill would continue his shuttle diplomacy
with a visit to Pristina on Friday.
	   Ethnic Albanian politicians have already dismissed the Serb
plan, which would keep Kosovo firmly within Serbia while granting
the province self-rule.
	   Negotiator Fatmir Seidiu called Serbia's insistence on its own
plan ``obstruction of international efforts, especially those of
the United States.''
	   He praised the U.S. plan, saying ``we hope that plan will be
further enriched with our suggestions and in the end fit our
legitimate demands.''
	   Markovic said proposals to make Kosovo a third, separate entity
within Yugoslavia, which some on the Albanian side advocate,
``would only mean the eventual loss of Kosovo.''
	   In an indirect reference to the U.S. plan, Markovic called it
``most cunning fraud to make Kosovo a separate federal unit.''
	   Kosovo has been in turmoil since Serbs launched a crackdown last
February to crush an armed rebellion by separatist rebels. The
clashes claimed hundreds of lives and forced some 300,000 people to
leave their homes.
	   An Oct. 12 agreement mediated by U.S. envoys led to an end of
hostilities in Kosovo and the withdrawal of many of the government
forces. But sporadic violence continues, with each side blaming the
other.
	   On Wednesday, Serb authorities said police had killed an ethnic
Albanian rebel after guerrillas attacked them in southwestern
Kosovo. They said the Kosovo Liberation Army had carried out 176
attacks in the past month, killing five policemen and four
civilians.
	   Ethnic Albanian sources, meanwhile, said Serb forces sealed off
the area around Kraljane, near the Albanian border town of
Djakovica, for an hour and a half.
	   The claims could not be independently verified.

First segment of international space station develops minor flaws

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ After a flawless launch, the first piece of the
international space station has developed three minor problems,
Russia's top space official acknowledged Wednesday _ but he
insisted they wouldn't affect its operation.
	   Neither Russian officials nor NASA, which is leading the dlrs 40
billion space station project, had reported any glitches since the
Russian-built Zarya, or Sunrise, module entered orbit Friday.
	   Now one of Zarya's eight accumulator batteries is failing. A
vibrator on one of its antennas hasn't unfolded properly. And the
humidity level in Zarya's cabin is higher than expected, probably
because it hasn't had time to heat up, said Russian Space Agency
chief Yuri Koptev.
	   He also said his struggling agency would renew talks with NASA
on selling hardware and other services to increase revenues, as
financing from the Russian government remains scarce.
	   The 12.4-meter (41.2-feet) Zarya is designed to serve as a space
tugboat in the early stages of the international space station,
providing propulsion, power and communications.
	   Koptev said the humidity level may eventually normalize itself,
and the battery problem might be explained by a faulty gauge. In
fact, for a normal flight it's enough to have half of the batteries
working, he said.
	   ``None of these affect the flight,'' Koptev told a news
conference.
	   As for the antenna, it will only be needed on the later stages
of the project and won't affect the scheduled rendezvous with the
American space shuttle Endeavour, which is to be launched Dec. 3
carrying the Unity connecting module.
	   The antenna serves Zarya's manual docking system, which would
allow the station's crew to use manual controls to dock arriving
cargo ships if there are problems with the autopilot system. Koptev
said the first crew will have plenty of time to fix it.
	   ``Even if it's not fixed, the antenna is big enough to work
normally without the vibrator,'' said Sergei Gorbunov, a space
agency spokesman.
	   The new station will not be inhabitable until at least early
2000, following the launch of the Russian-made crew module which is
set to blast off next July or August.
	   Russia has failed to meet two previous target dates for
construction of the crew module, putting the whole project more
than a year behind schedule. Struggling to prevent further delays,
Russia has sold its early research time on the station to NASA for
dlrs 60 million.
	   Russia will have to spend about dlrs 270 million next year to
fulfill its commitments for the new station, and the size of the
government's allocations remain unclear, Koptev said. Russia is
dealing with its worst economic crisis since the Soviet collapse.
	   The Russian Space Agency is pinning its survival on its
participation in the international space station.
	   The station, involving 16 nations with the United States and
Russia playing the biggest roles, will consist of more than 100
elements that will take 45 assembly flights to complete. It is due
to be completed by 2004.

	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Turkey's president started trying to
construct a new government Wednesday but the pieces do not fit
neatly: pro-Islamic forces pressing for power and their
military-backed, Western-style opponents struggling to unite.
	   President Suleyman Demirel opened talks with party leaders just
hours after the corruption-battered coalition of Prime Minister
Mesut Yilmaz lost a confidence vote in parliament. It was Turkey's
fourth government to collapse since 1995.
	   Demirel's meeting agenda clearly showed the potential
difficulties ahead in a nation with a growing Islamic movement but
a fiercely protected tradition of Western and secular principles.
	   One of his first meetings was with the leader of the largest
bloc in parliament: the Islamic-oriented Virtue Party, which seeks
to instill greater Muslim codes and values in Turkey.
	   ``If we are given the authority, we will try to form a
government that would win the vote of confidence,'' said Recai
Kutan, leader of Virtue Party, after meeting with Demirel.
	   Demirel will continue his consultations with party leaders on
Thursday and Friday.

Newly deployed carrier's warplanes train with Iraq in sight

<TEXT>
	   ABOARD THE USS ENTERPRISE (AP) _ American fighter jets dropped
dummy bombs on targets in the sea and refueled in mid-air to
practice over a potential bombing terrain only a short flight away:
Iraq.
	   About 100 sorties, including familiarization and target practice
flights, were scheduled throughout the day from the deck of this
92,000 ton vessel, the fastest carrier in the U.S. Navy.
	   In coming days, the carrier will be ``capable of handling
anything that might be presented to us,'' said Rear Adm. James
Cutler Dawson, the commander of the USS Enterprise battle group.
	   It arrived Tuesday to replace the USS Eisenhower, which was all
set to launch crippling strikes on Iraq on Nov. 14 before President
Bill Clinton called off the attack. The stand down was ordered
after Iraq agreed at the eleventh hour to allow U.N. weapons
inspectors to resume their work.
	   The United States has said its forces in the Gulf are ready to
strike at the first sign of Iraqi non-cooperation with the
inspectors responsible for eliminating Iraq's weapons of mass
destruction.
	   For now, the nuclear-powered Enterprise, accompanied by five
ships, will remain on a low state of alert in the Gulf near the
Iraqi coast. The Navy will not disclose the exact location for
security reasons.
	   Dawson said Wednesday's flights were to help pilots acquaint
with the territory.
	   He said that in a few days the 72 aircraft on board will be
taking part in enforcing the no-fly zone over southern Iraq.
	   The United States created the zone to keep out Iraqi planes from
southern Iraq where President Saddam Hussein's forces had brutally
crushed a rebellion by Shiite dissidents after the end of the 1991
Gulf War.
	   Fighter pilot Lt. Commander Eric Rasmussen said the the no-fly
zone mission notwithstanding, the pilots are ready to ``do
something else'' if required to.
	   The Gulf War veteran said he dropped ``some fake'' bombs on
targets at sea on Wednesday. The 7-foot (2-meter), indigo colored
bombs with silver tails emit white smoke on impact, said Rasmussen.
	   ``We do a standard practice bombing every time we fly. It is
just a routine training to maintain proficiency,'' said Rasmussen,
32, of Pensacola, Florida.
	   Wednesday's mission began with a dozen fighter jets, including
F-14 Tomcats and F/A-18 Hornets, roaring off the deck of the
carrier.
	   Some 200 people, mostly men wearing turtle neck sweaters, white
jackets and noise resistant helmets, toiled on the steel deck to
get the plane ready for take-offs.
	   ``It doesn't make a difference whether it is Thanksgiving or
Christmas when you are in a war zone,'' said Petty Officer Joe
Sprague, 33, of Hornell, New York.
	   Sprague, who leads some 16 men to load ordnance on the fighter
jets on the flight deck, said he was glad for the extra dlrs 150
given to sailors working on the flight deck _ the most hazardous
area of the carrier.
	   ``At least I can save some extra bucks to buy belated
Thanksgiving and Christmas gifts for my daughter Christine and my
wife Annette,'' he said.

 &UR; Duesseldorf court, rights group welcome London decision against
immunity &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   DUESSELDORF, Germany (AP) _ The state court in Duesseldorf and
Amnesty International on Wednesday greeted a decision by Britain's
highest court that said former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet
has no immunity from arrest.
	   A Chilean government report says some 3,000 people were murdered
or disappeared during Pinochet's 1973-90 rule after he overthrew
Salvador Allende, an elected Marxist. At least three people in
Germany have filed complaints as victims.
	   ``This is another step toward opening a trial here with us,''
court spokeswoman Brigitte Nordmann told The Associated Press.
	   Nordmann said that state prosecutors had complaints from three
people on Pinochet, but could not predict how they would proceed
with the case.
	   It was possible they will investigate and ask for extradition,
she added. Pinochet is also wanted in Spain, Switzerland, France
and Belgium.
	   Lawyer Konstantin Thun said he represents a 70-year-old priest
and a 60-year-old union worker, both German citizens, who were
arrested and tortured in Chile under Pinochet's regime. He hopes
the Duesseldorf court will pursue their complaints.
	   The human rights group Amnesty International in Bonn said the
London court decision could help to make for a more just world.
	   ``It sees to it that the victims of the Chilean military
dictator no longer are made a mockery of,'' spokesman Nils Geissler
said.
	   Pinochet, who turned 83 on Wednesday, underwent back surgery
Oct. 9 during a regular visit to Britain and was arrested Oct. 16
in his bed at another hospital.

In Chile, anger, joy, concern, after ruling against Pinochet
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By EDUARDO GALLARDO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) _ The ruling against Gen. Augusto Pinochet
by Britain's highest court further polarized Chile, where there is
concern about the dispute's effect on the nation's fragile
democratic transition.
	   Chileans followed the announcement on television broadcasts, and
reactions ranged from disbelief, frustration and anger among
Pinochet supporters to loud cheer and joyful applause among his
foes.
	   ``We now want him extradited to Spain, so we can finally have
justice for our loved ones. We want justice, not revenge,'' said
Viviana Diaz, vice president of an organization of relatives of
more than 1,000 dissidents still unaccounted for after their
detention by Pinochet's security services.
	   At her organization's downtown headquarters, the House of Lords'
ruling that Pinochet is not immune from prosecution on charges of
genocide and torture was met with cheers, applause, tears and the
chant, ``Justice! Justice!''
	   Small groups of demonstrators on both sides took to the streets
in mostly peaceful marches. A few scattered clashes were broken up
by police using water cannons.
	   In a brief nationwide address, President Eduardo Frei vowed to
renew efforts to secure the release of the 83-year-old former
dictator and ordered Foreign Minister Jose Miguel Insulza to fly to
London and Madrid to represent his government's position ``at all
levels.''
	   ``This is not the end of the process,'' Frei said.
	   Frei said he was concerned about the effect of the ruling, and
urged calm.
	   ``The government knows that this ruling may bring abrupt
reactions from some sectors,'' he said. ``But it is necessary to
warn that one condition for the success of the government's efforts
is responsible and serene behavior by our institutions and our
citizens.''
	   The term ``institutions'' is generally used in Chile to refer to
the military.
	   The army, calling the ruling unfair and unacceptable, criticized
several socialist legislators who went to London to support the
detention of Pinochet, and urged the government to step up efforts
on behalf of its former commander.
	   Pinochet seized power in a bloody 1973 coup and ruled until
1990. He remained commander in chief of the army until March, when
he was sworn in as a senator for life. That post was guaranteed by
a constitution his regime drafted. A government report says that
2,095 people were killed for political reasons under Pinochet, and
1,102 disappeared after being arrested.
	   Pinochet supporters, including many retired military men,
gathered at the Pinochet Foundation. They expressed anger and
sorrow. Some, particularly women, insulted and spat at journalists
and even beat several of them, especially foreign correspondents.
	   ``This is the result of a job well done by the ... communists.
They have so much money and support in Europe,'' said a crying
woman who identified herself only as Monica. ``It is so sad. The
general gave everything for Chile, all he did was for Chile.''
	   The foundation president, retired Gen. Luis Cortes, made an
appeal for calm but warned that ``this will, unfortunately, deepen
polarization among Chileans.''
	   The same concern was expressed in a stern communique by the
navy.
	   Pinochet's son, also named Augusto, said it was ``especially
cruel and sadistic'' that the ruling was issued on his father's
83rd birthday.
	   Right-wing politicians denounced the ruling as a violation of
Chile's sovereignty.
	   ``This is the most serious aggression on Chile's sovereignty in
decades,'' said Alberto Espina, president of the right-wing
National Renewal party.
	   At leftist parties' headquarters, the ruling was met with
applause and cheers, but comments appeared more moderate.
	   Leftist leaders said the ruling shows that justice is still
pending when it comes to human rights abuses under Pinochet.
	   They insisted that Pinochet should ask for pardon from his
victims and recognize responsibility.

	   MOSCOW, Russia (AP) _ Spartak Moscow and Sturm Graz played a
scoreless draw Wednesday in the Champions League Group C fifth
rotation match.
	   Spartak dominated through the game but didn't have many scoring
chances. In the 17th minute, Sturm's goalkeeper Kazimierz Sidorczuk
made a stunning save to deny a header from his teammate defender
Mario Posch, who tried to intercept a shot from midfielder Egor
Titov.
	   A minute later, Sidorczuk stopped a cross by Spartak Brazilian
striker Luis Robson from the left, and saved his net in the 44th,
when Titov fired from the penalty box line into the left corner.
	   Sturm, the only club in the competition to lose all four
previous group games, was close to open scoring early in the second
half, when Austrian midfielder Markus Shopp overplayed several
Russian defenders but kicked the ball right into the leg of Russian
goalkeeper Alexander Filimonov.
	   Spartak attacked furiously in the last 15 minutes but Sturm's
defense was strong enough to keep its net untouched and bring it
the first point in the tournament.
	   A crowd of about 30.000 fans came to support the home team in
sub-zero (Celsius) temperatures at the Luzhniki stadium.

NATO planners: alliance must retain nuclear arms in post-Cold War
</HEADLINE>
strategy &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ NATO's military planners recommended
Wednesday that in the post-Cold War era, the alliance remain able
to prevent conflicts and crises with anything from peacekeepers to
the threat of nuclear arms.
	   Though Russia _ NATO's nearest nuclear neighbor _ is no longer a
credible threat, military chiefs from the 16 NATO nations said the
alliance must not abandon its nuclear arms nor promise it won't be
the first to use them.
	   Retaining the first-strike option creates uncertainty in an
opponent's mind and ``that is an important element to preserve the
peace and prevent conflict,'' said German Gen. Klaus Naumann,
chairman of NATO's military committee.
	   In two days of talks, the military chiefs finalized a new
military strategy the NATO leaders are to adopt at a summit in
Washington in April.
	   It aims to keep collective defense as ``the core task of the
NATO alliance,'' said Naumann.
	   He said NATO needs fewer troops and hardware than during the
Cold War yet must be able to ``cope with the entire spectrum of
military activities ... from high-tech warfare to peacekeeping
operations,'' he said.
	   Germany assured the United States this week it does not insist
on NATO changing its strategy on the use of nuclear weapons.
	   German Defense Minister Rudolf Scharping said in Washington that
although Germany's new government includes the anti-nuclear Greens
party it did not question ``the core elements of NATO strategy.''
	   The military chiefs of Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary _
three countries due to join the alliance next year _ attended the
NATO meeting and endorsed the new strategy, said Naumann.
	   He said the military chiefs also agreed on a smaller network of
commands throughout Western Europe as part of the new, leaner NATO.
That agreement ended five years of debate and disagreements between
Greece and Turkey about a new command structure for southern
Europe.

Allies of slain Russian lawmaker receive death threats
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANNA DOLGOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Political allies of a prominent Russian liberal
lawmaker who was gunned down last week have been receiving death
threats since her slaying, a party member said Wednesday.
	   Dmitry Shagin, a well-known artist who heads the Northern
Capital movement organized by lawmaker Galina Starovoitova, said
that he and his colleagues have been receiving telephone threats to
``send (them) along with Starovoitova'' since her death Friday,
Russian news reports said.
	   Russian media have suggested that Starovoitova may have been
killed to prevent Northern Capital from winning local parliamentary
elections in St. Petersburg set for Dec. 6.
	   Starovoitova, 52, who was also a leader of the reformist
Russia's Democratic Choice party, was shot to death by unidentified
assailants on the stairs of her apartment building in St.
Petersburg.
	   The killing of such a prominent politician has caused an uproar
in Russia and prompted calls from all sides for a crackdown on the
country's growing lawlessness. Scores of business leaders and
others have been gunned down in recent years in contract killings
that are almost never solved.
	   Starovoitova's aide, 27-year-old Ruslan Linkov, suffered serious
head wounds during the attack. Doctors described his condition
Wednesday as ``moderately serious'' on Wednesday, the ITAR-Tass
news agency reported.
	   Linkov has been moved from intensive care unit to a heavily
guarded private ward. He talked to police after regaining
consciousness earlier this week, but investigators said they
learned nothing significant.
	   A detective said Wednesday that ``interesting clues'' have
emerged in the investigation, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   The report also quoted the unidentified detective as saying that
police believed ``the contract for murdering Starovoitova
originated from St. Petersburg, not Moscow,'' as investigators
earlier suggested. The detective gave no other details.
	   St. Petersburg has become a particularly crime-ridden city even
for Russia, where contract hits have become common. Several
business and political figures have been killed in the city in
recent weeks.
	   Prominent democratic lawmaker Alexander Shokhin said Wednesday
that Starovoitova's killing was staged by an organized criminal
group trying to gain political power, Interfax reported.
	   Other liberal leaders charged _ without any concrete evidence _
that Starovoitova's Communist foes in the Duma, the lower house of
parliament, were the most likely culprits.
	   Interior Minister Sergei Stepashin has said that Starovoitova
had received threats before her death.
	   The slaying has galvanized Russia's democratic forces and
prompted appeals for a joint front to prevent Communists from
returning to power. Communists, meanwhile, lambasted the government
for its inability to contain soaring crime.

Namibia leader talks with Catholic group trying to broker peace in
</HEADLINE>
Africa's Great Lakes &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Namibia's president talked Wednesday with Catholic
mediators trying to broker peace in Africa's troubled Great Lakes
region, the latest in a series of Rome sessions between the
mediators and visiting African leaders.
	   President Sam Nujoma's talks with the Sant' Egidio community
focused largely on international guarantees for a new cease-fire in
Burundi, the group said.
	   Fighting between Burundi's governing Tutsi minority and the Hutu
majority has killed more than 200,000 people since 1993. Peace
talks started in June but the resulting cease-fire failed.
	   Congo President Laurent Kabila met with the mediators on Tuesday
after a papal audience in which John Paul II urged him into talks
with rebels in his own country. The Congo conflict is the Great
Lakes' most volatile, since neighboring countries have entered the
fight on both the rebel and the government sides.
	   Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe is due in Rome on Friday and
also is expected to talk with mediators. Mugabe has been backing
Kabila.
	   The presidents are on their way to a Paris summit of leaders of
French-speaking African nations. Sant' Egidio has mediated talks in
conflicts worldwide.

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ A woman claims in a dlrs 10 million lawsuit
that she was raped by WBC welterweight champion Oscar De La Hoya 2
1/2 years ago when she was 15 years old, a television station
reported.
	   The lawsuit, filed late Tuesday in San Bernardino County
Superior Court, alleges De La Hoya raped the woman in a hotel room
in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, in June 1996. The complaint alleges
false imprisonment, sexual battery and assault.
	   ``My client has suffered severe psychological injury since this
incident, which has affected her greatly both emotionally and
physically,'' said Lisa Maki, attorney for the plaintiff identified
only as Jane Doe, a U.S. citizen.
	   Bob Arum, De La Hoya's longtime promoter, said Wednesday he was
``absolutely outraged.''
	   ``This is a total and complete crock,'' Arum said from his Las
Vegas office. ``Two and a half years after the alleged event, this
complaint is filed. There never, ever, ever was a complaint made to
the authorities in Cabo or to the hotel where the incident
allegedly took place.''
	   ``It's an attempt to extort money and to use the legal system to
extort money, and it's an absolute outrage because nothing ever
happened. Nothing, nothing. He wouldn't know this girl if she
walked into the same room with him.''

OPEC snagged over production cuts extension
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Venezuela reportedly opposing price reductions,
price updates; starting time of meeting still uncertain &QL; 
 &UR; By DIDI KIRSTEN TATLOW &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Troubled by plunging oil prices, OPEC
appeared at an impasse Wednesday after key member Venezuela
reportedly said it opposed extending production cuts.
	   The internal split, which delayed the official start of the
organization's year-end meeting, made effective action to lift
slumping oil prices unlikely.
	   The deadlock apparently was caused by Venezuela's announcement
to OPEC delegates that it opposed extending cuts introduced in June
in an effort to soak up the oil glut on the world market.
	   Informal talks about what action to take went on for hours past
the scheduled start of the formal meeting Wednesday meeting. It
wasn't clear when or even if it would officially convene.
	   The problem: The oil market hasn't been this bad in over 11
years, and OPEC members don't know what to do about it.
	   Analysts say extending the 2.6 million barrel-a-day June
production cuts is the bare minimum action needed to stop oil
prices from slumping further. It didn't appear OPEC was willing to
take a more bitter medicine and make new cuts.
	   Oil prices nose-dived again Wednesday in both New York and
London.
	   A key benchmark, Brent crude oil futures for delivery in
January, plunged to an all-time low of dlrs 10.89 on the
International Petroleum Exchange before settling at dlrs 11 a
barrel in late trading, down 19 cents. Prices haven't been lower
since the contract was introduced in 1986.
	   Light sweet crude oil for January delivery was trading at dlrs
11.85 at midday on the New York Mercantile Exchange, down 20 cents
as it sank toward its 12-year low of dlrs 11.42 reached in June.
	   A non-Venezuelan OPEC source told Dow Jones Newswires on
Wednesday that Venezuela had informed OPEC that it opposes an
extension of the current agreement. That decision may leave OPEC
with no choice but to abandon the pact after June 1999, the
agreement's original deadline.
	   Energy analysts weren't expecting additional cuts from OPEC, on
top of the cuts agreed to by members earlier in the year. But they
did see OPEC extending the cuts.
	   ``It's a mess, as ever,'' said Leo Drollas, chief economist at
London's Center for Global Energy Studies.
	   Venezuela is becoming the target of growing criticism within the
organization, with members saying privately it is already not
sticking to June's production cuts, putting pressure on other
members who fear losing market share.
	   Iran and Indonesia also are overproducing, analysts say.
	   Saudi Arabia, OPEC's biggest producer, is especially worried
about noncompliance as it wants to retain its dominant position. It
was pushing hard during the talks for members to stick to the
promised cuts.
	   OPEC's average oil price has nearly halved since this time last
year because of the glut brought on by its ill-timed decision last
winter to boost production, coinciding with Asia's economic crisis
and falling demand.
	   Known for its disagreements, OPEC is facing an especially tricky
situation this time.
	   Its average price per barrel of crude oil has crashed dlrs 8.22
from dlrs 18.81 last November to dlrs 10.59, according to the last
available average price.
	   Government revenue in most OPEC countries has taken a hit.
Kuwait says its 1998 oil revenue will sink by 45 percent.
	   Further depressing the market, the United Nations Security
Council voted to roll over for six months Wednesday Iraq's
food-for-oil deal, meaning around 1.9 million barrels of oil a day
are reaching the world market from Iraq, keeping world supplies
high.
	   Reflecting the sense of crisis, Algeria's oil minister Youcef
Yousfi called this week for a special meeting of heads of state of
OPEC's 11 members, saying the ``price crisis'' must be addressed at
the very top.
	   It would be OPEC's first leaders' meeting since 1975.
	   The oil ministers were pondering the proposal, but the extent of
support for it was unclear.

Russia to hand over border guard to Georgia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TBILISI, Georgia, (AP) _ Russian border guards will turn over
responsibility for Georgia's borders to Georgian counterparts by
June 1999, according to an agreement ratified Wednesday.
	   The Russian guards monitor Georgia's border with Russia _
including the volatile border of Georgia's breakaway Abkhazia
region _ and Georgia's border with Turkey.
	   Russian and Georgian officials reached agreement earlier this
month for a withdrawal of the Russian guards around this former
Soviet republic in the Caucasus Mountains. Georgia's parliament
ratified the agreement unanimously Wednesday.
	   ``Russian border guards will be pulled out gradually, the
process will be completed in June 1999,'' said Lt. Gen. Valery
Chkheidze, commander of the Georgian border guards.
	   Regarding Abkhazia, he said, ``There are several problems here,
but we'll solve them.''
	   Abkhazians declared independence after driving out Georgian
government forces in 1993 following the end of a 13-month war.
Russian peacekeepers have been deployed since 1994, though sporadic
clashes have continued.

NATO planners: Alliance must retain nuclear arms in post-Cold War
</HEADLINE>
strategy &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ NATO's military planners recommended
Wednesday that in the post-Cold War era, the alliance remain ready
to prevent conflicts and crises with anything from peacekeepers to
the threat of nuclear arms.
	   Though Russia _ NATO's nearest nuclear neighbor _ is no longer a
credible threat, military chiefs from the 16 NATO nations said the
alliance must not abandon its nuclear arms nor promise it won't be
the first to use them.
	   Retaining the first-strike option creates uncertainty in an
opponent's mind and ``that is an important element to preserve the
peace and prevent conflict,'' said German Gen. Klaus Naumann,
chairman of NATO's military committee.
	   In two days of talks, the military chiefs finalized a new
military strategy the NATO leaders are to adopt at a summit in
Washington in April.
	   It aims to keep collective defense as ``the core task of the
NATO alliance,'' said Naumann.
	   He said NATO needs fewer troops and hardware than during the
Cold War yet must be able to ``cope with the entire spectrum of
military activities ... from high-tech warfare to peacekeeping
operations,'' he said.
	   Germany assured the United States this week it does not insist
on NATO changing its strategy on the use of nuclear weapons.
	   German Defense Minister Rudolf Scharping said in Washington that
although Germany's new government includes the anti-nuclear Greens
party it did not question ``the core elements of NATO strategy.''
	   The military chiefs of Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary _
three countries due to join the alliance next year _ attended the
NATO meeting and endorsed the new strategy, said Naumann.
	   He said the military chiefs also agreed on a smaller network of
commands throughout Western Europe as part of the new, leaner NATO.
That agreement ended five years of debate and disagreements between
Greece and Turkey about a new command structure for southern
Europe.

Two people hanged for murder in southern Egypt
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Egypt on Wednesday hanged a man and a woman
who were sentenced to death in separate cases for rape and murder,
Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.
	   It said Abdel-Nasser Abdu Wahab-Allah Ali was convicted of
raping and murdering a woman last year in the southern tourist city
of Luxor.
	   Obeida Ashour Maleki Khalaf-Allah was convicted of murder, also
in 1997, in the town of Nag Hammad, MENA said. It did not give
details of the crimes.
	   The two convicts were hanged in a prison in Qena, 465 kilometers
(290 miles) south of Cairo, MENA said.
	   Murder, rape and sedition are punishable by death in Egypt.
Executions are routinely carried out by hanging.

NATO chief to Macedonia to press for early Kosovo force deployment
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ NATO secretary general Javier Solana
goes to Macedonia Thursday to press officials there to accept an
allied force that will evacuate, if necessary, civilians monitoring
a peace deal in neighboring Kosovo.
	   NATO officials said Wednesday they hope the force of some 1,700
NATO troops will be in Macedonia by the end of next week.
	   ``The extraction force will be in place in the beginning of
December depending on the final agreement from the government of
Macedonia,'' said German Gen. Klaus Naumann, head of the panel of
military chiefs from the 16 NATO nations.
	   Britain, France, the Netherlands, Germany and Spain are expected
to provide troops.
	   The NATO military chiefs met with counterparts from across
Eastern Europe and agreed the force will not include East
Europeans. Officials said that would dilute the force too much,
making it a kaleidoscope of nationalities that may undermine its
cohesion and effectiveness.
	   The extraction force will be responsible for the emergency
rescue of civilian ``ground verifiers'' being dispatched to Kosovo
should they run into unexpected physical danger.
	   Under an Oct. 12 deal struck by U.S. negotiator Richard
Holbrooke with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, some 2,000
verifiers are being sent to Serbia's southern province to ensure
Milosevic ends his crackdown there and withdraws troops and special
police forces.
	   Naumann termed the situation in Kosovo unstable ``but we have no
reason to believe there is massive non-compliance'' with the Oct.
12 agreement.

 &UR; Netanyahu makes tentative deal with Levy to rejoin coalition
 &UR; Eds: Turns for AMs. UPDATES with fresh details; INCORPORATES
material from Israel-US; CHANGES Byline &QL; 
 &UR; By DAFNA LINZER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ In an effort to save his crumbling
coalition and broaden support for peace, Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu struck a tentative deal Wednesday to bring a moderate
deserter back into his hard-line Cabinet.
	   Staunch right-wingers who oppose ceding war-captured land to the
Palestinians, have been threatening to leave Netanyahu's government
over the latest land-for-security agreement with the Palestinians.
	   Such a move would leave Netanyahu without a parliamentary
majority and thus vulnerable in no-confidence motions, which
Netanyahu will face next month when he presents the annual budget
to the Knesset.
	   The return of former foreign minister David Levy would bolster
support for Netanyahu but the premier would still need to find more
votes, most likely from his political rivals in the form of a
national unity, or power-sharing government.
	   Political commentators said Wednesday that the prime minister
wanted Levy back in the fold as an ally so he would be in a
stronger position when opening negotiations with the main
opposition Labor party.
	   Three influential Cabinet ministers _ Foreign Minister Ariel
Sharon, Trade Minister Natan Sharansky and Finance Minister Yaakov
Neeman _ said it might be a good idea for Netanyahu to start
courting Labor.
	   Both Sharon and Netanyahu canceled trips in order to deal with
the coalition crisis. Netanyahu backed-out of the Swiss portion of
a three-country European tour. He left late Wednesday to Britain
and will continue on from there to Spain.
	   Sharon was to have led Israel's delegation to a 50-nation donor
conference for the Palestinians in Washington next week and hold
talks with U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and members
of Congress but stayed behind to handle negotiations. Israeli TVs
said Sharon would meet with former prime minister Shimon Peres and
Labor leader Ehud Barak to discuss prospects for a unity
government.
	   Netanyahu's coalition has been shaky from the start. Made-up of
several small single-interest and religious parties, Netanyahu has
spent the last two and a half years trying to balance the often
conflicting needs of each partner.
	   Levy would likely return to the Cabinet as National
Infrastructures Minister, a position vacated by Sharon in
September. As part of the deal, Levy and Netanyahu would run their
parties together in the next election as a team. To sweeten the
pot, Netanyahu reportedly promised the social welfare advocate to
increase budgetary funds for social programs.
	   Neither side commented on the package, apparently struck by
intermediaries who negotiated through the night and reached a
tentative deal before dawn Wednesday. An official announcement was
not expected until Netanyahu returned home Sunday.
	   Levy's Gesher party approved a return to Netanyahu's coalition
Wednesday but two of five Gesher legislators did not attend the
meeting, an apparent sign that they will not rejoin the government.
	   Levy resigned in January in protest over the deadlock in the
peace talks with the Palestinians, saying then that the government
was ``on a flight to nowhere.''
	   On Tuesday, Levy suggested that with the signing of the Mideast
accord last month, the government looked more appealing.
	   ``Now that the government is taking the political course that I
demanded ... we in Gesher will convene and decide,'' he told Israel
TV's Channel Two.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with US ambassador welcoming Annan trip if it produces
positive result, minor editing throughout. &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Secretary-General Kofi Annan held out the
possibility Wednesday that he might visit Libya to help close a
deal to try two Libyan suspects in the Pan Am Lockerbie case.
	   Annan was traveling to North Africa beginning Thursday to resume
a visit he cut short Nov. 12 to deal with the Iraq crisis. He said
he hadn't ruled out a visit to Tripoli during his trip.
	   A Libyan legal team has been meeting regularly with Annan's
legal counsel to discuss the U.S.-British proposal to try the
suspects in the Netherlands according to Scottish law and using
Scottish judges.
	   Because of some positive developments over the past few weeks,
``there is now a good chance that the suspects might finally be
brought,'' to trial, a U.N. source said on condition of anonymity.
	   He said there is ``a sense of optimism,'' and that Annan
wouldn't go to Libya unless he had a sense that a deal was
possible.
	   Libya has accepted the proposal in theory, but had objected to
its call for the suspects to be jailed in a Scottish prison if
found guilty. The Tripoli government had insisted the suspects
serve any prison time in Libya or the Netherlands.
	   It wasn't immediately known if Libyan officials had indicated
some flexibility on that point, which diplomats have said was
Libya's major concern.
	   Two Libyans, Abdel Basset Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah, are
accused of planting the suitcase bomb that ripped apart the New
York-bound Pan Am jet on Dec. 21, 1988, killing 270 people in the
air and on the ground at Lockerbie, Scotland.
	   Annan told reporters as he entered U.N. headquarters Wednesday
that he had hoped for a breakthrough in the case by the end of
November.
	   ``If that doesn't happen, I will be in the region next week and
the question has been raised if it would be helpful for me to go
there and bring the issue finally to closure,'' he said.
	   ``I haven't made up my mind yet, but it has not been excluded,''
he said.
	   For 10 years, the United States and Britain had demanded the two
be tried in the United States or Britain, but agreed in August to a
trial in the Netherlands in hopes of finally bringing the issue to
a close.
	   Deputy U.S. Ambassador Peter Burleigh said the United States
expected Libya to respond positively since Washington and London
had already shown flexibility.
	   ``In that context, if the secretary-general feels he can be
useful and play a positive role ... we of course would welcome
that,'' Burleigh said.
	   The Security Council endorsed the U.S.-British plan and agreed
to suspend sanctions once the two men are turned over. Council
members also agreed to consider additional sanctions if Libya
didn't produce the suspects.
	   The sanctions, which include an air embargo, were imposed to
force Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi to turn the men over.
	   Annan was leaving Thursday for Paris, where he would attend a
conference before visiting Algeria, Tunisia, Abu Dhabi and Paris
again before returning to New York on Dec. 9.
	   On Wednesday, two London-based newspapers reported that Libya
had tried and jailed three officials for the 1988 bombing. The
Guardian said Abdullah al-Senussi, Musa Koussa and Mohammed
al-Misrati _ who were senior intelligence officials at the time of
the bombing _ were sentenced to five to seven years in prison this
month for ``dereliction of duty.''
	   The jailings, also reported by the Arabic newspaper Al-Hayat,
could not be immediately confirmed. Libyan dissidents said the
reports appeared to be a political ploy by Gadhafi, who is under
pressure to turn over the two primary suspects.

Van Nistelrooij hits hat-trick in PSV win
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) _ Ruud van Nistelrooij, the top scorer in
Dutch soccer, scored a hat-trick as PSV Eindhoven downed HJK
Helsinki 3-1 Wednesday in the Champions' League.
	   PSV struck on the half hour as Chris van der Weerden centred
from the right after a throw-in and goalpoacher van Nistelrooij
darted in to head into goal at the far post.
	   Before that, HJK had the better scoring chances and the home
team's pressure mounted early in the second half. PSV defender Abel
Xavier saved in front of an open goal, but at 67 minutes HJK was
caught by a counter attack with Luc Nilis playing a perfect pass
into space for van Nistelrooij who scored easily alone with the
keeper.
	   One minute later HJK replied with a penalty awarded for
handball, Mika Lehkosuo placing the ball into a bottom corner with
goalkeeper Ronald Waterreus narrowly beaten.
	   Nine minutes from the end, Van Nistelrooij was tripped by HJK
defender Ville Nylund in a one-on-one and the Dutchman himself
scored from the penalty spot for his third.
	   An attendance of 34,146 is the all-time record for a Finnish
club on home soil.

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Opponents in Spain of Augusto Pinochet
welcomed a British ruling Wednesday that allows them to keep their
dream of seeing the former Chilean dictator being tried here.
	   ``It is a very important day for all humanity, not just for
Chileans,'' said Ana Maria Gonzalez, a 45-year-old who fled her
native Chile after Pinochet seized power and who was among dozens
who turned out in Madrid's central Puerta del Sol to hear the
ruling on the radio.
	   At the rally, there were shouts of ``extradition'' and ``long
live Chile without Pinochet!''
	   ``I have been waiting 23 years to see Pinochet brought to
trial,'' said Santiago Oyarzo, who said he was tortured and held
for over a year without a trial for giving a radical newspaper to a
friend soon after Pinochet seized power.
	   Up to 1,000 people gathered in the square later Wednesday waving
banners that read: ``U.K. OK, Pinochet K.O.'' and singing the song
``Happy Birthday to You'' in reference to the coincidence that the
British ruling fell on Pinochet's 83rd birthday.
	   Pinochet was arrested in London on Oct. 16 at the instigation of
Spanish Judge Baltasar Garzon who heads the effort to see the
retired general tried for crimes against humanity allegedly
committed during his 1973-1990 dictatorship.
	   ``This is a giant step for humanity, and specifically for the
people of Latin America,'' said Carlos Slepoy, an Argentine private
attorney who has worked with Garzon.
	   ``It is a breath of fresh air,'' Slepoy said, claiming that it
put Spanish justice ``at the vanguard of human rights.''
	   Not that Spain's conservative government wants that reputation,
given that the Pinochet case has already ruffled political
relations with Chile and risks damaging lucrative trade ties and
major Spanish investments.
	   But equally keen to avoid accusations of obstructing justice,
Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar has repeated many times that Spain
would respect all judicial decisions.
	   ``We respect and we will adapt to these legal procedures,'' he
said after the British ruling. Earlier he said he was confident
that relations with Chile would remain good.
	   Most other political parties welcomed the ruling, including
Spain's main opposition Socialist party that called on the
government to pressure for extradition.

Three men dead after Viagra use
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Three men have died in France after reportedly
using the impotence pill Viagra, on the market here less than six
weeks, Pfizer Inc., the manufacturer, said Wednesday.
	   No formal link between the deaths and the popular pill to
overcome impotence has been established, said Dr. Sylvia Cuker,
spokeswoman in France for Pfizer.
	   The victims were all over 60 years old, she said.
	   More than 50,000 prescriptions for Viagra have been issued since
the medication went on sale here Oct. 15, she said.
	   One of the victims died of a heart attack 16 days after taking
Viagra, and another died of cerebral accident. She did not specify
the circumstances of the third death.
	   But the Medication Agency, which like the American Food and Drug
Administration oversees all prescription remedies, said there was
uncertainty in one case over whether the Viagra actually was taken.
	   The agency said the three cases were under study to determine
whether a causal relationship exists between the deaths and the use
of Viagra.
	   In the United States, the FDA on Tuesday added more explicit
warnings to Viagra's label, among other things advising doctors to
be cautious about prescribing Viagra to men who had a heart attack,
stroke or life-threatening arrhythmia in the last six months, or
who have significantly low blood pressure, significantly high blood
pressure, a history of cardiac failure or unstable angina or the
eye disease retinitis pigmentosa.
	   Pfizer Inc. has confirmed that 130 Americans who took Viagra
have died since the drug began selling in the United States last
spring. The majority of the deaths were heart attacks. Some 6
million prescriptions have been filled there since April.

OPEC snagged over production cuts extension
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES and RECASTS with Venezuela reportedly opposing price
reductions, price updates; starting time of meeting still
uncertain. &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Troubled by plunging oil prices, OPEC
appeared at an impasse Wednesday after key member Venezuela
reportedly said it opposed extending production cuts.
	   The internal split, which delayed the official start of the
organization's year-end meeting, made effective action to lift
slumping oil prices unlikely.
	   The deadlock apparently was caused by Venezuela's announcement
to OPEC delegates that it opposed extending cuts introduced in June
in an effort to soak up the oil glut on the world market.
	   Informal talks about what action to take went on for hours past
the scheduled start of the formal Wednesday meeting. It wasn't
clear when or even if it would officially convene.
	   The problem: The oil market hasn't been this bad in over 11
years, and OPEC members don't know what to do about it.
	   Analysts say extending the 2.6 million barrel-a-day June

OPEC snagged over extension in production caps
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Venezuela reportedly opposing an extension in
production caps; starting time of meeting still uncertain &QL; 
 &UR; By DIDI KIRSTEN TATLOW &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Troubled by plunging oil prices, OPEC
appeared at an impasse Wednesday after key member Venezuela
reportedly said it opposed extending production caps agreed to in
June.
	   The internal split, which delayed the official start of the
organization's year-end meeting, made effective action to lift
slumping oil prices unlikely.
	   The deadlock apparently was caused by Venezuela's announcement
to OPEC delegates that it opposed extending the cuts that were
introduced in June in an effort to curb the oil glut on the world
market.
	   Informal talks about what action to take went on for hours past
the scheduled start of the formal Wednesday meeting. It wasn't
clear when it would officially convene.
	   The problem: The oil market hasn't been this bad in over 11
years, and OPEC members don't know what to do about it.
	   Analysts say extending the 2.6 million barrel-a-day June
production cuts is the bare-minimum action needed to stop oil
prices from slumping further. It didn't appear OPEC was willing to
take a more bitter medicine and make new cuts.
	   Oil prices nose-dived again Wednesday in both New York and
London.
	   A key benchmark, Brent crude oil futures for delivery in

In Chile, anger, joy, concern, after ruling against Pinochet

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) _ The ruling against Gen. Augusto Pinochet
by Britain's highest court further polarized Chile, where there is
concern about the dispute's effect on the nation's fragile
democratic transition.
	   Chileans followed the announcement on television broadcasts, and
reactions ranged from disbelief, frustration and anger among
Pinochet supporters who had expected him to be freed, to loud
cheers and joyful applause among his foes.
	   ``We now want him extradited to Spain, so we can finally have
justice for our loved ones. We want justice, not revenge,'' said
Viviana Diaz, vice president of an organization of relatives of
more than 1,000 dissidents still unaccounted for after their
detention by Pinochet's security services.
	   At her organization's downtown headquarters, the House of Lords'
ruling that Pinochet is not immune from prosecution on charges of
genocide and torture was met with happy tears and the chant,
``Justice! Justice!''
	   Small groups of demonstrators on both sides took to the streets
in mostly peaceful marches. A few scattered clashes were broken up
by police using water cannons.
	   In a brief nationwide address, President Eduardo Frei vowed to
renew efforts to secure the release of the 83-year-old former
dictator and ordered Foreign Minister Jose Miguel Insulza to fly to
London and Madrid to represent his government's position ``at all
levels.''
	   ``This is not the end of the process,'' Frei said.
	   Frei said he was concerned about the effect of the ruling, and
urged calm.
	   ``The government knows that this ruling may bring abrupt
reactions from some sectors,'' he said. ``But it is necessary to
warn that one condition for the success of the government's efforts
is responsible and serene behavior by our institutions and our
citizens.''
	   The term ``institutions'' is generally used in Chile to refer to
the military.
	   The army, calling the ruling unfair and unacceptable, criticized
several socialist legislators who went to London to support the
detention of Pinochet, and urged the government to step up efforts
on behalf of its former commander.
	   Pinochet seized power in a bloody 1973 coup and ruled until
1990. He remained commander in chief of the army until March, when
he was sworn in as a senator for life. That post was guaranteed by
a constitution his regime drafted.
	   A government report says that 2,095 people were killed for
political reasons under Pinochet, and 1,102 disappeared after being
arrested.
	   Politicians from all sectors have admitted that Pinochet's
arrest, and the divided response to it at home, have highlighted
the tenuous state of Chile's democracy. Especially touchy problems
include the lack of justice for those who suffered human rights
abuses during his regime, and the considerable power still retained
by the military. Most of the abuses have gone unpunished because of
an amnesty law.
	   Pinochet supporters, including many retired military men,
gathered at the Pinochet Foundation to hear the British ruling.
They expressed anger and sorrow while some, particularly women,
insulted and spat at journalists and even beat several, seemingly
singling out foreign correspondents.
	   ``This is the result of a job well done by the ... communists.
They have so much money and support in Europe,'' said a crying
woman who identified herself only as Monica. ``It is so sad. The
general gave everything for Chile, all he did was for Chile.''
	   The foundation president, retired Gen. Luis Cortes, made an
appeal for calm but warned that ``this will, unfortunately, deepen
polarization among Chileans.''
	   The same concern was expressed in a stern communique by the
navy.
	   Pinochet's son, also named Augusto, said it was ``especially
cruel and sadistic'' that the ruling was issued on his father's
83rd birthday.
	   Right-wing politicians denounced the ruling as a violation of
Chile's sovereignty.
	   ``This is the most serious aggression on Chile's sovereignty in
decades,'' said Alberto Espina, president of the right-wing
National Renewal party.
	   At leftist parties' headquarters, the ruling was met with
applause and cheers, but comments appeared more moderate.
	   Leftist leaders said the ruling shows that justice is still
pending when it comes to human rights abuses under Pinochet.
	   They insisted that Pinochet should ask for pardon from his
victims and recognize responsibility.

NATO Secretary General Solana meeting with German Foreign minister
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Fisher, Solana meeting, no statement expected &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ NATO chief Javier Solana met with Foreign
Minister Joschka Fischer late Wednesday amid controversy over
Fischer's suggestion that NATO change its first-strike policy on
nuclear attacks.
	   Martin Erdmann a ministry spokesman said that the two were
discussing the situation in Bosnia and other political alliance
themes. A joint statement after their meeting wasn't expected.
	   Fischer, an environmentalist Greens party member and 1980s-era
anti-nuclear protester, drew criticism by saying it was no longer
necessary in the post-Cold War world for NATO to be able to launch
a nuclear attack without first being targeted.
	   Thrust into damage control during his visit to Washington this
week, Defense Minister Rudolf Scharping assured U.S. Secretary of
Defense William Cohen that Germany would continue to support NATO
policy as a full member, including its nuclear strategy.
	   Scharping and Fischer talked aside while attending a cabinet
meeting in Berlin Wednesday and agreed to maintain a joint stance
on NATO's nuclear policy , Erdmann said.
	   Government spokesman Uwe-Karsten Heye said later that Chancellor
Gerhard Schroeder did not criticize Fischer at the cabinet meeting,
because it was ``so naturally understood that one can lead a
debate.''
	   After Fischer's comments were published Monday in the
Hamburg-based Der Spiegel, the foreign ministry clarified that he
was not suggesting Germany go its own way within NATO but only
trying to start a discussion among alliance members about changing
nuclear strategy.
	   Former Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel questioned the new Social
Democrat-led coalition government's real intention to maintain
continuity in foreign policy as it promised. The Greens are the
junior coalition partner.
	   ``Continuity in foreign and security policy has not
progressed,'' Kinkel said. ``We owe it to our allies to keep the
protection and deterrence strategies that protected us for 40
years.''
	   Opposition politicians with the Free Democratic Party criticized
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and Scharping for playing down
Fischer's real stand on nuclear arms.
	   Party chairman Wolfgang Gerhardt also demanded Wednesday that a
parliamentary committee be called to examine the coalition
agreement. The pact requires the government to work toward giving
up NATO'S first-strike option, designed as a deterrent against
would-be aggressors.
	   ``Saddam Hussein would certainly bring the world more insecurity
if he didn't have to expect a possible nuclear first-strike
option,'' he said.

Yemen tribesmen force stoppage of U.S. oil drilling work
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By AHMAD AL-HAJ &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN'A, Yemen (AP) _ An U.S. oil company's drilling operations in
northern Yemen remained suspended for the fourth day Wednesday
under threats from tribesmen demanding development in the region, a
newspaper reported.
	   The tribesmen forced the shutdown Sunday at the American Hunt
Oil Co.'s al-Raja oil field in Marib province, 170 kilometers (105
miles) northeast of San`a, the independent al-Ayam biweekly said.
	   Also Sunday, members of the Jahm tribe blew up a pipeline in
another part of the province to highlight the lack of development.
Fire triggered by the explosion was put out Tuesday, officials
said.
	   A human rights groups in Marib said in a statement Wednesday
that troops sent to the region arrested 35 Jahm tribesmen in
connection with the blast.
	   Hunt Oil company officials were not available for comment.
	   The tribesmen complain that their area hasn't received its share
of the dlrs 200,000 paid annually by Hunt to the government to
develop the region, Al-Ayam said.
	   It did not say what threats the tribe used to force the
shutdown.
	   Officials say the government builds schools and roads according
to needs of a district.
	   Large parts of Yemen are lawless, inhabited by tribes who do not
hesitate to use firearms to settle scores with rivals or to express
discontent with the government.
	   Hunt Oil Company's oil field concession in Marib produces
165,000 barrels per day. The company hires 1,300 Yemeni staff in
addition to 30 foreign workers.

Russia accuses foreign agencies of inflaming ethnic tension
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's nationalities minister on Wednesday
accused foreign ``special services'' of fomenting ethnic tension in
Russia, especially in and around breakaway Chechnya.
	   Ramazan Abdulatipov said the West is using Chechnya as a base
for anti-Russian activity, Russian news agencies reported.
	   ``Many people abroad, both in Arab and European countries, even
in the United States, are pursuing their interests in Russia
through ethnic, cultural and kin ties,'' he said, according to the
Interfax news agency.
	   He said many of these groups are financing ``fundamentalist and
nationalist'' groups in Russia and said ethnic relations in the
Caucasus Mountains region _ which includes Chechnya _ have worsened
because of interference by foreign ``special services.''
	   He did not name any specific people or groups receiving or
giving foreign funding.
	   During Chechnya's 1994-1996 war for independence from Russia,
Moscow often accused foreign groups of supporting the mainly Muslim
Chechen rebels.

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ The U.S. administration has decided to back
a new Iraqi dissident leader to spearhead a reinvigorated campaign
to oust President Saddam Hussein, Iraqi exiles said Wednesday.
	   The United States nominated Adnan al-Pachachi, a former foreign
minister, to forge a united Iraqi opposition movement that would
try to topple Saddam, the dissidents in exile said.
	   U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Martin Indyk proposed
al-Pachachi's name during his meeting with 16 Iraqi opposition
leaders in London on Tuesday, said some of the participants.
	   Al-Pachachi, who also attended the meeting, said in a telephone
interview from London: ``I think this is our last chance and we
should not loose it.''
	   U.S. Embassy officials in London were not available for comment

	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Prosecutors and human rights advocates from
around the world hailed a British court ruling Wednesday upholding
the arrest of former Chilean ruler Augusto Pinochet as a landmark
decision against dictators who commit atrocities with impunity.
	   Pinochet supporters in Chile called it a violation of national
sovereignty and the work of communists.
	   But the cheers way outnumbered the jeers worldwide.
	   Especially elated by the news was Isabel Allende, the daughter
of Socialist Chilean President Salvador Allende, who died during
the 1973 coup that put Pinochet in power for 17 years.
	   ``I feel enormous satisfaction on this historic day. It's a `No'
to impunity and a `Yes' to justice,'' she said at a press
conference in Madrid. Allende, a Socialist party parliamentary
deputy in Chile, said she had come to Spain to await the
announcement of the British ruling.

IMF chief says worst of world crisis is over
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Michel Camdessus, director-general of the
International Monetary Fund, said Wednesday that the worst of the
global financial crisis is over, the state-owned news agency EFE
reported.
	   Camdessus said it was possible to avoid a global recession,
although the risk hadn't completely disappeared because, ``the
treatment has only just started,'' EFE said.
	   ``To those frivolous commentators and prophets of doom who've
been chronicling the death foretold of the Brazilian and Latin
American financial system, I say today what I said yesterday: the
Latin American domino won't fall,'' the agency quoted Camdessus as
saying during a Madrid meeting of Spanish business leaders.
	   The IMF chief reserved particular praise for what he called
Brazil's ``courageous'' three-year economic and financial reform
program.
	   Camdessus also promised the IMF would not abandon the
crisis-ridden Russian economy, but that ``Russia must first show it
is willing to help itself.''

NATO military leaders eye smaller Bosnia force in 1999
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ NATO military planners on Wednesday
recommended steps to reduce the Bosnia peacekeeping force in 1999
saying the military implementation of the Dayton peace accord
progressed faster than the civilian side.
	   ``We see no possibility for a substantial reduction'' in the
30,000-strong force now, said German Gen. Klaus Naumann, chairman
of NATO's military committee.
	   But at a meeting, the panel of allied commanders agreed to study
to cut the force's administrative setup and proposed to restructure
the force as a whole ``so we may achieve a big reduction next
year,'' said Naumann.
	   He said while the force _ which includes NATO and East European
troops _ performed well, the problem lay in implementing civilian
aspects of the 1995 Dayton peace accord.
	   One such problem is that all three ethnic groups in Bosnia --
Muslims, Serbs and Croats _ are dragging their heels in handing
over war-crimes suspects.
	   The Bosnia force now numbers around 30,000, about half the
number that entered the country in December 1995 to support the
Dayton peace agreement.
	   Its fate is subject to a review every six month. But Carlos
Westendorp, the official overseeing the civilian aspects of the
Dayton agreement, has talked about the need to keep the force in
Bosnia for two more years.

Italian Communist party says it escorted Kurdish rebel leader into
</HEADLINE>
Italy &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: ADDS new final graf to UPDATE with opposition calling for
Ocalan's expulsion, governing coalition divided on granting asylum,
ADD lawmaker quote on why Communists helped. &QL; 
 &UR; By VANIA GRANDI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Communist lawmakers revealed Wednesday that they had
escorted the fugitive chief of Turkey's Kurdish rebels to Italy in
his search for haven, defending a venture that has sparked
boycotts, hunger strikes and international ill will as a way of
making Europe confront the Kurdish problem.
	   Ramon Mantovani, chief of foreign affairs for the hard-line
Communist Refoundation Party, said he accompanied Abdullah Ocalan
to Rome from Moscow on Nov. 12.
	   Mantovani insisted the idea of seeking asylum in Italy was all
Ocalan's but acknowledged he had assured Ocalan that Italian law
would bar his extradition to Turkey.
	   ``He told me he had two choices: Going back to the mountains and
fighting with the guerrillas or trying initiate to peace talks,
something he said he wanted _ and had _ to do,'' Mantovani said.
``He had every intention of getting on the first plane to Rome.''
	   Ocalan was arrested as soon as he came to Rome with a false
passport. A Rome court freed him after a week, rejecting Turkey's
arrest warrant under Italian law forbidding extradition of suspects
who face a possible death penalty, as Ocalan does in Turkey.
	   Ocalan leads the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, which has
waged a 14-year-old war for Kurdish autonomy in southeastern
Turkey. The conflict has killed 37,000 people.
	   Kurds in cities across Europe protested his arrest with marches,
sit-ins, hunger strikes, self-immolations and a suicide bombing.
	   The people of Turkey protested with almost equal fervor when
Italy freed Ocalan, burning Italian clothes and cars and launching
boycotts that brought threats of European Union sanctions against
Turkey.
	   Mantovani said the Communists had not told Italy's government
what they were doing. He said the episode started when Ocalan's
people contacted Refoundation on Nov. 11, looking for haven for the
rebel leader after Syria expelled him.
	   The lawmaker flew to Moscow the next day and Russian officials
took him to the rebel leader, who was waiting for him at the
airport, he said. They flew back on the same plane.
	   ``We were just helping the Kurds find a way to start peace
talks. Our action will force Italy and Europe to finally_ and I
hope definitively _ face the Kurdish issue,'' Mantovani said.
	   Refoundation's stunning revelation comes after numerous reports
_ denied by the government _ that Ocalan had a secret deal paving
his way to Italy.
	   Germany also has warrants out for Ocalan but has said it won't
ask for his extradition. That leaves Italy stuck with a volatile
diplomatic dilemma.
	   Granting Ocalan asylum would further enrage Turkey, a NATO ally
and major trading partner, as well as the United States, which
wants him prosecuted. It could also make Italy a mecca for Kurdish
activists.
	   Italy has a small population of Kurdish exiles, about 1,000,
compared to Germany, with around 400,000. There are are 20- to 25
million Kurds spread out over Turkey, Syria, Iraq and Iran; some 12
to 15 million live in Turkey.
	   The Kurds were promised an independent homeland in 1920 after
the Ottoman Empire collapsed but the international community
abandoned the idea in 1923. In Turkey, they are not recognized as
an official minority; the use of the Kurdish language is banned in
education and broadcasting.
	   Ocalan said Wednesday that his decision to abandon armed
struggle and use Europe as a platform for peaceful resolution to
Kurds' complaints was ``irreversible.''
	   ``We want to do things like the Basques in Spain and the IRA in
Northern Ireland,'' he said in a statement read by his lawyers.
``We just want more autonomy and freedom.''
	   Ocalan was willing to stand trial, the lawyers said _ but not in
Turkey or Germany.
	   Italy's rightist-led opposition demanded his immediate expulsion
Wednesday, while members of the governing coalition split on his
appeal for asylum.

Suspects arrested in slaying of Iranian opposition figure
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Police on Wednesday said they had arrested a
number of suspects in connection with the murder of an opposition
figure and his wife last week.
	   The body of Dariush Foruhar, leader of the People's Party of
Iran, and his wife, Parvaneh, were found with stab wounds on
Sunday.
	   The official Islamic Republic News Agency quoted police
spokesman Col. Ali Moqadam as saying a number of suspects have been
detained. He did not elaborate.
	   Moqadam said forensic experts were examining the bodies and the
exact time of their deaths would be announced later.
	   Relatives and neighbors who had gathered in front of Foruhar's
home in central Tehran said the two were killed Saturday.
	   Foruhar's party is a small opposition group that is tolerated by
the government.
	   He served as minister of labor and social affairs in the
provisional government of Prime Minister Mehdi Bazargan immediately
after the 1979 Islamic Revolution that toppled the monarchy.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW, Russia (AP) _ Spartak Moscow and Sturm Graz played a
scoreless draw Wednesday in the Champions League Group C fifth
rotation match.
	   Spartak dominated through the game but didn't have many scoring
chances. In the 17th minute, Sturm's goalkeeper Kazimierz Sidorczuk
made a stunning save to deny a header from his teammate defender
Mario Posch, who tried to intercept a shot from midfielder Egor
Titov.
	   A minute later, Sidorczuk stopped a cross by Spartak Brazilian
striker Luis Robson from the left, and saved his net in the 44th,
when Titov fired from the penalty box line into the left corner.
	   Sturm, the only club in the competition to lose all four
previous group games, was close to open scoring early in the second
half, when Austrian midfielder Markus Shopp overplayed several
Russian defenders but kicked the ball right into the leg of Russian
goalkeeper Alexander Filimonov.
	   Spartak attacked furiously in the last 15 minutes but Sturm's
defense was strong enough to keep its net untouched and bring it
the first point in the tournament.
	   A crowd of about 30.000 fans came to support the home team in
sub-zero (Celsius) temperatures at the Luzhniki stadium.

Human rights Advocates Hail Pinochet Ruling
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Britain-Pinochet &QL; 
 &UR; By KERNAN TURNER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Prosecutors and human rights advocates from
around the world hailed a British court ruling Wednesday upholding
the arrest of former Chilean ruler Augusto Pinochet as a landmark
decision against dictators who commit atrocities with impunity.
	   Pinochet supporters in Chile called it a violation of national
sovereignty and the work of communists.
	   But the cheers far outnumbered the jeers worldwide.
	   Especially elated by the news was Isabel Allende, the daughter
of Socialist Chilean President Salvador Allende, who died during
the 1973 coup that put Pinochet in power for 17 years.
	   ``I feel enormous satisfaction on this historic day. It's a `No'
to impunity and a `Yes' to justice,'' she said at a press
conference in Madrid. Allende, a Socialist party parliamentary
deputy in Chile, said she had come to Spain to await the
announcement of the British ruling.
	   ``When crimes against humanity are committed, humanity has to
react,'' she said.
	   In Geneva, the United Nation's High Commissioner for Human
Rights Mary Robinson said the ruling ``will hearten human rights
defendants around the world.''
	   Robinson said the British court had ``confirmed the emerging
international consensus against impunity.''
	   Spain's conservative government reacted cautiously. Sticking to
a position that he would let the judicial process take its course,
Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar said Spain would respect any
decision by the British justice system and was confident that
relations with Chile would remain good.
	   The government has been reluctant to embrace prosecution of
Pinochet for fear of ruffling relations and damaging lucrative
trade ties.
	   Amnesty International called it ``a landmark breakthrough'' that
``reaffirms the international community's commitment towards the
fulfillment of basic human rights for all.''
	   Family members of Chileans killed or who disappeared during
Pinochet's dictatorship celebrated on the streets of London,
Santiago and Madrid at the 3-2 vote by Britain's highest court that
Pinochet does not enjoy diplomatic immunity from arrest.
	   The decision means Pinochet must remain in custody while Spain
seeks his extradition on charges of genocide related to killings
and torture by his security forces.
	   ``This is a surprise. This is a joy,'' France's Socialist Prime
Minister Lionel Jospin told reporters. ``It's bad news for all
dictators.''
	   Prosecutors in France, Switzerland and Germany saluted the
decision.
	   ``It's a victory for law and morality,'' said William Bourdon, a
lawyer representing some of the family members of French citizens
who disappeared. ``A trial of Pinochet is now possible in Paris and
in Madrid.''
	   France first asked for Pinochet's extradition on Nov. 12. A
French judge issued a second international arrest warrant Tuesday.
	   Pinochet was arrested on a Spanish arrest warrant Oct. 16 while
in a London hospital recuperating from back surgery.
	   In Switzerland, Geneva State Prosecutor Bernard Bertossa said
the decision ``marks an evolution in British justice.''
	   A state court in Dusseldorf, Germany also greeted the court
ruling.
	   ``This is another step toward opening a trial here with us,''
said court spokeswoman Brigitte Nordmann.
	   She said complaints from three German citizens against Pinochet
had been received by the court and that it was possible prosecutors
would now open an investigation and decide to ask British officials
for extradition.
	   There was no elation at the Pinochet Foundation headquarters in
Santiago, where supporters of the former dictator _ including many
retired military men _ gathered to await the British court's
decision.
	   Some supporters insulted and spat at journalists and even tried
to beat them.
	   ``This is a result of a job well-done by the ... communists,
they have so much money and support in Europe,'' said a woman in
tears who identified herself only as Monica.
	   ``Chilean sovereignty has been violated,'' said Alberto Espina,
president of the right-wing National Renewal Party. He said the
government should send a high-level mission to London to convince
the British government to release Pinochet.
	   There was no immediate reaction from the Chilean military or
President Eduardo Frei.

Dynamo beats Panathinaikos 2-1
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Dynamo Kiev came from behind to squeeze a
2-1 victory over group leader Panathinaikos in the Champions League
Wednesday to improve its chances of making the quarterfinal.
	   The Ukrainian team dominated in the first 45 minutes of the
game, striking many times from within the Greek penalty area, but
four of the five shots it managed missed the target.
	   Panathinaikos, meanwhile, took practically its only scoring
opportunity in the 36th minute.
	   Andreas Lagonikakis, left alone near the left corner of Dynamo's
goal area, struck a powerful shot past Kiev 'keepere Oleksandr
Shovkovsky after getting a diagonal pass from the left.
	   The Ukrainians responded with a wave of quick and pressing
attacks in the second half, but only managed to equalize the score
in the 72nd minute.
	   Dynamo's leading striker, Serhiy Rebrov, rushed into
Panathinaikos' penalty area to reach a pass from the left and
pushed the ball between goalkeeper Josef Wandzik's feet.
	   Dynamo's second 10 minutes from the end was an own goal, Angelos
Basinas turning a corner kick into the Panathinaikos' net.
	   The victory gave Dynamo eight points in five games, leaving
Panathinaikos two points behind.
	   Temperatures were well below zero C (32 F) at Kiev's Dynamo
Stadium for the match.

 &UR; Netanyahu makes tentative deal with Levy to rejoin coalition
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS, UPDATES with fresh details; CHANGES Byline &QL; 
 &UR; By DAFNA LINZER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ In an effort to save his crumbling
coalition and broaden support for peace, Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu struck a tentative deal Wednesday to bring a moderate
deserter back into his hard-line Cabinet.
	   Staunch right-wingers who oppose ceding war-captured land to the
Palestinians have been threatening to leave Netanyahu's government
over the latest land-for-security agreement with the Palestinians.
	   Such a move would leave Netanyahu without a parliamentary
majority and thus vulnerable in no-confidence motions, which
Netanyahu could face next month when he presents the annual budget
to the Knesset.
	   The return of David Levy, the former foreign minister, would
bolster support for Netanyahu but the premier would still need to
find more votes, most likely from his political rivals in the form
of a national unity, or power-sharing government.
	   Political commentators said Wednesday that the prime minister
wanted Levy back in the fold as an ally so that Netanyahu would be
in a stronger position when opening negotiations with the main
opposition Labor Party.
	   Three influential Cabinet ministers _ Foreign Minister Ariel
Sharon, Trade Minister Natan Sharansky and Finance Minister Yaakov
Neeman _ said it might be a good idea for Netanyahu to start
courting Labor.
	   Both Sharon and Netanyahu canceled trips in order to deal with
the coalition crisis. Netanyahu backed out of the Swiss portion of
a three-country European tour. He left late Wednesday to Britain
and will continue on from there to Spain.
	   Sharon was to have led Israel's delegation to a 50-nation donor
conference for the Palestinians in Washington next week and held
talks with U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and members
of Congress but stayed behind to handle negotiations. Israeli TV
networks said Sharon would meet with former prime minister Shimon
Peres and Labor leader Ehud Barak to discuss prospects for a unity
government.
	   Netanyahu's coalition has been shaky from the start. It includes
several small single-interest and religious parties, and Netanyahu
has spent the last two and a half years trying to balance the often
conflicting needs of each partner.
	   Levy would likely return to the Cabinet as national
infrastructures minister, a position vacated by Sharon in
September. As part of the deal, Levy and Netanyahu would run their
parties on the same slate in the next election. To sweeten the pot,
Netanyahu reportedly promised the social welfare advocate to
increase budgetary funds for social programs.
	   Neither side commented on the package, apparently struck by
intermediaries who negotiated through the night and reached a
tentative deal before dawn Wednesday. An official announcement was
not expected until Netanyahu returned home Sunday.
	   Levy's Gesher Party, a working-class party that broke from
Netanyahu's conservative Likud Party in 1992, approved a return to
Netanyahu's coalition Wednesday but two of five other Gesher
legislators did not attend the meeting, an apparent sign that they
will not rejoin the government.
	   Levy resigned in January in protest over the deadlock in the
peace talks with the Palestinians, saying then that the government
was ``on a flight to nowhere.''
	   On Tuesday, Levy suggested that with the signing of the Mideast
accord last month, the government looked more appealing.
	   ``Now that the government is taking the political course that I
demanded ... we in Gesher will convene and decide,'' he told Israel
TV's Channel Two.

Russian population falls to 146.9 million
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's population has shrunk by 900,000 in the
past two years to 146.9 million, a deputy economics minister said
Wednesday.
	   The population has been in decline since the Soviet Union's 1991
collapse. It has contracted by about a half-million people annually
for the past few years.
	   Deputy Economics Minister Andrei Sharonov told a meeting of
social welfare officials Wednesday that the population was down to
146.9 million, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   Demographers blame the soaring mortality rate and low birth rate
on a protracted economic crisis, and a sharp deterioration in
health care.
	   The Soviet Union had more than 288 million people when it
collapsed.

Sampras wins again, Agassi retires in match against Corretja
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Kafelnikov beating Kucera &QL; 
 &UR; By NESHA STARCEVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HANOVER, Germany (AP) _ Pete Sampras is playing too well to have
to worry about figuring out the intricacies of the round-robin
format.
	   After beating Carlos Moya 6-3, 6-3 on Wednesday, Sampras was not
even aware that he had clinched a place in the semifinals of the
ATP World Championship.
	   ``That's nice to hear,'' Sampras said after being told at the
post-match news conference that he had secured a place in the last
four.
	   ``It's certainly a good feeling to be here over the weekend,''
Sampras said.
	   Sampras is seeking to become the first man to finish as No. 1 in
the world for six years in a row.
	   Marcelo Rios, the only player who can threaten Sampras, trails
by 33 points in the computer rankings and has to do better than
Sampras in the elite season-ending championship that brings
together the top eight players of the year.
	   But Rios, who was not scheduled to play Wednesday, lost his
first match to Tim Henman and is battling a back injury. He now has
to win his next two round-robin matches to reach the semifinals and
stay in the chase.
	   The eight players are split into two groups and Sampras and Rios
cannot meet until the semifinals.
	   ``It helps,'' Sampras said of Rios losing the first match. ``I'm
also helping myself by winning. I can't really be too concerned
about what Marcelo is doing.''
	   ``I have to concentrate on my matches. If I take care of things
myself and go out and win, then it should be hopefully good enough.
But I must admit I was rooting for the Englishman (Henman)
yesterday,'' Sampras said.
	   Sampras was certainly good enough to beat Moya in only 62
minutes. Moya, the French Open champion who is now 1-1, had beaten
Sampras in a group match last year but Sampras went on to win the
dlrs 3.5 million event for the fourth time.
	   On Tuesday, Sampras was equally impressive in dismissing Yevgeny
Kafelnikov in straight sets.
	   ``It's not easy to play well like I have been today and
yesterday. I was coming into today's match pretty confident,''
Sampras said. ``I wanted to make sure I was coming in a little bit
more than last year, chipping and charging, trying to put as much
pressure on him as possible.''
	   ``Last year I must admit I felt a little flat. This year, with
the ranking up for grabs, I just made a concerted effort to come
here a little bit early and prepare as best as I can.
	   ``It's obviously a very big week for Marcelo and I. I just
wanted to give myself the best chance possible to play well here,''
said Sampras, who fired 13 aces.
	   The second American in the field, Andre Agassi, retired in his
opening match against Alex Corretja because of a back injury.
Corretja was leading 5-7, 6-3, 2-1 when Agassi quit.
	   Agassi was practicing with Corretja on Monday when he fell and
hurt his back and has been receiving shots and other treatment
since then.
	   ``It was definitely painful even this morning in my warmup. I
needed to give it a go, at least try to keep the points short,''
Agassi said.
	   ``But I hit a swinging volley and when I twisted it was just
like somebody stuck a knife in me. Pretty soon it got quite
pointless,'' he said.
	   Agassi, who won the event in 1990, said he would wait until
Thursday before deciding whether to continue the tournament, which
is possible under its round-robin format, but added that he would
be surprised if he played.
	   If Agassi pulls out, he will be replaced by Greg Rusedski, who
would play Rios on Thursday. Corretja plays Henman and Sampras
meets Karol Kucera.
	   Kafelnikov beat Kucera 6-7 (3-7), 6-3, 6-2 in the last match
Wednesday and improved to 1-1. Kucera dropped to 0-2.
	   Although he has surged back No. 4 this year after falling as low
as No. 141 at the same time last year, Agassi has not done well at
major tournaments this season.
	   ``The year has been great for me in many respects, but the great
tournaments have been pretty disappointing,'' Agassi said. ``I've
worked really hard and had to grind week after week to get myself
in position, only to struggle when I got into position.''

Iraqi exiles: U.S. backs new Iraqi dissident in effort to oust
</HEADLINE>
Saddam Hussein &QL; 
 &UR; By SALAH NASRAWI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Iraqi exiles said Wednesday that the U.S.
government has decided to back a new Iraqi dissident leader to
spearhead a reinvigorated campaign to oust President Saddam
Hussein.
	   The United States is getting behind Adnan al-Pachachi, a former
foreign minister, to forge a united Iraqi opposition movement that
would try to topple Saddam, the dissidents in exile said.
	   U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Martin Indyk proposed
al-Pachachi's name during his meeting with 16 Iraqi opposition
leaders in London on Tuesday, some of the participants said.
	   Al-Pachachi, who also attended the meeting, said in a telephone
interview from London: ``I think this is our last chance and we
should not loose it.''
	   U.S. Embassy officials in London were not available for comment
and no administration statement on the meeting was immediately
available.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton has proclaimed that Saddam's ouster
is a major U.S. goal in efforts to protect U.S. interests in the
region. The U.S. Congress has also allocated dlrs 97 million aid
for Iraqi dissidents.
	   On Tuesday, Indyk urged the opposition figures to drop their
differences and unite in the struggle against Saddam, said the
participants, speaking on condition of anonymity. The dissidents,
who spoke with The Associated Press, included supporters of
al-Pachachi as well as members of other opposition groups.
	   The backing for al-Pachachi indicates that the United States is
edging away from Ahmed Chalabi, the head of the U.S.-backed Iraqi
National Congress.
	   The INC is a 7-year-old umbrella organization of Kurdish, Shiite
and leftist groups. Most of its activists have abandoned the
organization in protest against Chalabi's leadership.
	   Al-Pachachi was the foreign minister in the government that was
toppled in the 1968 military coup that brought Saddam's Baath party
to power. He later became a political adviser to the president of
the United Arab Emirates.
	   He has been involved in opposition efforts to topple Saddam
since the end of the 1991 Gulf War and is widely respected among
Iraq exiles.
	   One reason why al-Pachachi was chosen could be that he is a
Sunni. Members of this mainstream sect of Islam hold key positions
in the Iraqi regime and al-Pachachi would be in the best position
to woo them if he ever won control of the country.
	   The dissidents said Indyk's proposal backing al-Pachachi came
after many participants told him that there was no consensus on
Chalabi's leadership. Chalabi is a member of the Shiite community,
which despite being in a slight majority in Iraq wields little
power.
	   On Wednesday, Iraq dismissed the London talks as ``miserable and
impossible dreams.''
	   ``Those who sold their honor ... have becoming agents of the
U.S., British and Zionist intelligence agencies'' said a spokesman
for the Iraqi Culture and Information Ministry.

NATO military leaders eye smaller Bosnia force in 1999
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ NATO military planners on Wednesday
recommended steps to reduce the Bosnia peacekeeping force in 1999,
saying the military implementation of the Dayton peace accord has
progressed faster than the civilian side.
	   Gen. Klaus Naumann, the German chairman of NATO's military
committee, said the alliance sees ``no possibility'' for an
immediate, substantial reduction in the 30,000-strong force.
	   But the panel of allied commanders agreed at its Brussels
meeting to streamline the force's administrative setup and prepare
for a ``big reduction next year,'' Naumann said.
	   He said that while the force _ which includes NATO and East
European troops _ performed well, problems remain in implementing
civilian aspects of the 1995 Dayton peace accord.
	   Among the problems is that all three ethnic groups in Bosnia --
Muslims, Serbs and Croats _ are dragging their heels in handing
over war-crimes suspects.
	   The Bosnia force now numbers around 30,000, about half the
number that entered the country in December 1995 to support the
Dayton peace agreement.
	   Its fate is subject to a review every six month.
	   Carlos Westendorp, the official overseeing civilian aspects of
the Dayton agreement, has said he expects peacekeepers will need to
remain for two additional years.

Security Council demands Abkhazia dispute be settled peacefully
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Expressing deep concern that serious
hostilities may resume in the breakaway Georgian province of
Abkhazia, the U.N. Security Council demanded Wednesday that both
sides resolve disputed issues peacefully.
	   Council President Peter Burleigh, the deputy U.S. ambassador,
said in a statement that the council had welcomed the reinvigorated
talks within U.N.-led peace process.
	   The statement called on both sides ``to display without delay
the necessary will to achieve substantial results on the key
issues.'' It also strongly encouraged the parties to convene a
meeting between Abkhazian leader Vladislav Ardzinba and Georgian
President Eduard Shevardnadze.
	   Georgia and Abkhazia have been locked in a bitter conflict that
began soon after Georgia gained independence in the wake of the
1991 Soviet collapse.
	   Abkhazians declared an independent republic after driving out
Georgian government forces in 1993 following a 13-month war. The
U.N. observers have been monitoring the truce between government
forces and the separatists.
	   Despite the deployment of Russian peacekeepers in 1994, sporadic
clashes have continued. In May, Abkhazian forces took control of
Georgia's fertile Ghali region.
	   ``The Security Council remains deeply concerned at the
continuing tense and unstable situation in the Ghali and Zugdidi
regions and at the threat of resumption of serious hostilities,''
Burleigh said.
	   The council also strongly condemned deliberate acts of violence
against U.N. military observers and Russian peacekeeping forces,
``including the continued laying of mines which also endangers the
civilian population and impedes the work of humanitarian
organizations.''
	   In late September, four members of the U.N. observer force were
wounded in an attack on a bus in the Abkhazian capital of Sukhumi.
	   The council approved a proposal by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan to increase the number of lightly armed international
security personnel and local security personnel to guard the
observer mission.

Police drop probe into Saudi prince
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Police have dropped an investigation into a
Saudi prince accused of mistreating his Egyptian servants after
they withdrew the complaints, officials said Wednesday.
	   The row ended amicably after nine servants withdrew allegations
that they were locked up by Prince Turki bin Abdel Aziz in the 29th
floor suite of a luxury hotel where he and his wife have lived for
16 years, the officials said.
	   The servants resigned and left after collecting their wages,
said the officials, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   Police began the investigation after two servants escaped from
the prince's 29th floor suite on Monday by knotting sheets together
and lowering themselves through a window to the 24th floor.
	   They told police that other servants were still locked up.
During investigations, the nine servants came forward to back up
that claim. It was not clear why they withdrew the complaint now.
	   But the initial complaint of the two servants still stands.
	   One of them was hospitalized for treatment of bone injuries and
bruises he sustained during the escape.
	   The issue attracted wide publicity in Egypt and the matter was
raised in Parliament on Sunday.
	   It is not clear if any charges have been filed against the
prince, who is one of Saudi King Fahd's six brothers.
	   In a similar case earlier this year, which was also settled by
the police, the prince was quoted as saying that the servants
usually sign an agreement not to leave the suite for six months.
	   Prince Turki has been living in Egypt for 16 years since he fell
out with the royal family.
	   Last year, police arrested one of the prince's American
bodyguards after he allegedly punched two men who objected to his
blocking a road with his car. Three others, including an American,
were deported from Egypt in 1995 over similar incidents.

Iraq agrees to new U.N. ``Oil-For-Food'' Sale
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Despite its continued opposition, Iraq has
agreed to the terms of a six-month renewal of the U.N. program that
lets it buy humanitarian goods with proceeds from oil sales,
Baghdad's ambassador said Wednesday.
	   Iraq will submit a plan to distribute the food, medicine and
other goods by Saturday, and will resume exports after it has been
approved, Nizar Hamdoon said.
	   Iraq has been barred from freely exporting oil since its 1990
invasion of Kuwait, which sparked the Gulf War. The council will
only lift the sanctions after U.N. arms experts report that Baghdad
has destroyed its weapons of mass destruction.
	   The council agreed to start the oil-for-food program in 1996 to
allow imports of basic necessities for Iraq's 22 million people.
	   On Tuesday, the Security Council renewed the program, agreeing
to let Iraq sell another dlrs 5.2 billion in oil over six months.
	   Iraq has criticized the program as a tool for the United States
and its allies to provide token relief for suffering Iraqis while
keeping the broader sanctions in place.
	   Iraqi leaders had proposed a two-month extension of the program,
rather than a six-month renewal, amid concern that a renewal would
implicitly extend sanctions another six months. In recent weeks,
Baghdad has interrupted U.N. weapons inspections and lobbied for a
review of sanctions it hopes will end the embargo.
	   Nevertheless, Hamdoon said Wednesday Iraq would sign on to the
new oil sale. ``We'll be submitting the distribution plan by
Saturday,'' Hamdoon said.
	   Prices for Iraqi crude have fallen from an average of dlrs 18
per barrel in the first phase of the ``oil-for-food'' program to
dlrs 10 per barrel in the present phase, which ends Wednesday, U.N.
records show.

Dismantling of controversial Brent Spar begins in Norwegian fjord

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ The long-awaited dismantling of the Brent
Spar offshore oil storage buoy began Wednesday, 3 1/2 years after
Greenpeace activists boarded the unit and embarrassed oil giant
Shell into dropping plans to sink it in the North Atlantic.
	   Instead, Brent Spar was towed to the deep waters of the
Norwegian Erfjord inlet to be dismantled and reused, partly as the
foundation for a new wharf. The first major step is to remove the
buoy's 1,600 ton topside with a floating crane.
	   ``Crews are rigging for the lift. We expect to start lifting at
about 3 p.m. (1400 GMT),'' the project's senior engineer Arvid
Nygaard told The Associated Press from the crane barge. ``We have
been very lucky with the weather.''
	   Nygaard said the weather was calm, with no rain or snow, making
ideal conditions to start the lift. The process of dismantling the
15,000 ton unit is estimated to last a year.
	   Shell UK had planned to sink the obsolete Brent Spar off
Scotland, a cheaper and faster approach. But Greenpeace activists
boarded the vessel in April 1995 in a successful protest that
lasted four months and gained backing across Europe.
	   ``Of course, this is a good feeling,'' said Jan Rispens, a Dutch
Greenpeace activist who spent 2 1/2 weeks aboard the Brent Spar
during the protest. He was in western Norway to see the dismantling
begin, a step he called a victory for the millions of people who
supported the anti dumping campaign.

NATO chief to Macedonia to press for early Kosovo force deployment
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ NATO secretary general Javier Solana
goes to Macedonia Thursday to press officials there to accept an
allied force that will be prepared to evacuate, if necessary,
civilians monitoring a peace deal in neighboring Kosovo.
	   Gen. Klaus Naumann, the German who currently heads the panel of
military chiefs from the 16 NATO nations, said that, pending final
agreement from Macedonia, the troops should be in place in
Macedonia by the end of next week.
	   Britain, France, the Netherlands, Germany and Spain are expected
to provide troops, who are to pull the monitors from Kosovo if they
run into unexpected physical danger.
	   Under an Oct. 12 deal struck between U.S. negotiator Richard
Holbrooke and Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, some 2,000
monitors are being sent to the southern Serbian province to ensure
Milosevic ends his crackdown there on separatist Albanians and
withdraws troops and special police forces.

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Joe DiMaggio got good news for his 84th birthday
on Wednesday. He's improving steadily after lung cancer surgery and
could be removed from intensive care by the end of the day.
	   ``The prognosis for his recovery is good,'' said Dr. Earl
Barron, the lead doctor on a team of six physicians who have been
treating the Hall of Fame outfielder in Florida.
	   Barron, in a telephone interview with The Associated Press
today, for the first time confirmed DiMaggio had a cancerous tumor
removed from his right lung.
	   He said the surgery was done two days after DiMaggio entered the
hospital Oct. 12, and that the New York Yankees great had suffered
severe post operative complications, including a serious lung
infection.
	   ``For a while, it was touch and go, but he has been showing
steady improvement and he possibly could be out of intensive care
today,'' Barron said.
	   Because of his age, DiMaggio's progress is ``guarded,'' Barron
said, but he added that the former centerfielder's condition is
very good, compared to what it had been.
	   DiMaggio began his birthday celebration at 6 a.m. with a group
of well-wishers crowded into his room at Memorial Regional Hospital
in Hollywood, Florida. Among them were his brother Dom, also a
former major league outfielder; Dom's wife, Emily; DiMaggio's
granddaughter Paula and her husband, Jim; his lawyer and longtime
friend, Morris Engelberg; Barron; and a couple of nurses.
	   Barron said DiMaggio still was on a respirator, but the setting
was 50 percent of what it had been at the height of the crisis, and
he could be weaned from it by the end of the week.
	   The main problem was a buildup of fluid in DiMaggio's lungs as
the result of the infection, and at one point, an opening was made
in his trachea to help his breathing.
	   Barron said DiMaggio had never had a heart attack, contrary to
television reports earlier this week.
	   ``It was a tremendous drop in blood pressure, and it scared the
life out of me,'' said Engelberg, who has been acting as DiMaggio's
spokesman.
	   Engelberg said he became so concerned by the DiMaggio's critical
turn on Nov. 16 that a Roman Catholic priest was summoned to give
last rites.
	   ``But I came in the next morning and there he was, shaving
himself,'' said Engelberg. ``He's amazing.''
	   DiMaggio, who retired in 1951 after 13 seasons with the Yankees,
had been a smoker, starting in his youth in San Francisco.
	   Engelberg said DiMaggio had instructed him not to divulge any
medical information about his condition, but because of recent
erroneous TV reports, DiMaggio agreed to allow Barron to speak with
the AP.
	   ``Joe was angry when he saw on television that he had had a
heart attack,'' Engelberg said. ``I asked Dr. Barron, `Did Joe have
a heart attack?' and Barron told Joe, `No, you didn't have a heart
attack.'''
	   DiMaggio has a private room in the the children's hospital wing
named for him. Security is tight, and only people visiting patients
were allowed in the area. There were no signs anywhere in the
hospital that it was his birthday.

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ The U.S. administration has decided to back
a new Iraqi dissident leader to spearhead a reinvigorated campaign
to oust President Saddam Hussein, Iraqi exiles said Wednesday.
	   The United States nominated Adnan al-Pachachi, a former foreign
minister, to forge a united Iraqi opposition movement that would
try to topple Saddam, the dissidents in exile said.
	   U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Martin Indyk proposed
al-Pachachi's name during his meeting with 16 Iraqi opposition
leaders in London on Tuesday, said some of the participants.
	   Al-Pachachi, who also attended the meeting, said in a telephone
interview from London: ``I think this is our last chance and we
should not loose it.''
	   U.S. Embassy officials in London were not available for comment.
But a State Department official in Washington said that while Indyk
did meet with al-Pachachi in London he made it clear that it is up
to the Iraqi opposition to organize themselves.
	   The United States cannot annoint or appoint someone to be their
leader, said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity.

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Iraqi exiles said Wednesday that the U.S.
government has decided to back a new Iraqi dissident leader to
spearhead a reinvigorated campaign to oust President Saddam
Hussein.
	   The United States is getting behind Adnan al-Pachachi, a former
foreign minister, to forge a united Iraqi opposition movement that
would try to topple Saddam, the dissidents in exile said.
	   U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Martin Indyk proposed
al-Pachachi's name during his meeting with 16 Iraqi opposition
leaders in London on Tuesday, some of the participants said.
	   In Washington, a U.S. State Department official said Indyk made
it clear at the meeting that it was up to the Iraqi opposition to
decide how it should be organized.
	   The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that
al-Pachachi was just one of the Iraqi opposition figures who met
with Indyk and that it was not up to the United States to anoint an
opposition leader.
	   Al-Pachachi, who also attended the meeting, said in a telephone
interview from London: ``I think this is our last chance and we
should not loose it.''
	   U.S. Embassy officials in London were not available for comment
and no administration statement on the meeting was immediately
available.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton has proclaimed that Saddam's ouster
is a major U.S. goal in efforts to protect U.S. interests in the
region. The U.S. Congress has also allocated dlrs 97 million aid
for Iraqi dissidents.
	   On Tuesday, Indyk urged the opposition figures to drop their
differences and unite in the struggle against Saddam, said the
opposition participants, speaking on condition of anonymity. The
dissidents, who spoke with The Associated Press, included
supporters of al-Pachachi as well as members of other opposition
groups.
	   The backing for al-Pachachi indicates that the United States is
edging away from Ahmed Chalabi, the head of the U.S.-backed Iraqi
National Congress.
	   The INC is a 7-year-old umbrella organization of Kurdish, Shiite
and leftist groups. Most of its activists have abandoned the
organization in protest against Chalabi's leadership.
	   Al-Pachachi was the foreign minister in the government that was
toppled in the 1968 military coup that brought Saddam's Baath party
to power. He later became a political adviser to the president of
the United Arab Emirates.
	   He has been involved in opposition efforts to topple Saddam
since the end of the 1991 Gulf War and is widely respected among
Iraq exiles.
	   Al-Pachaci may be a favored choice because he is a Sunni.
Members of this mainstream sect of Islam hold key positions in the
Iraqi regime and al-Pachachi would be in the best position to woo
them if he ever won control of the country.
	   The dissidents said Indyk's proposal backing al-Pachachi came
after many participants told him there was no consensus on
Chalabi's leadership. Chalabi is a member of the Shiite community,
which despite being in a slight majority in Iraq wields little
power.
	   On Wednesday, Iraq dismissed the London talks as ``miserable and
impossible dreams.''
	   ``Those who sold their honor ... have becoming agents of the
U.S., British and Zionist intelligence agencies'' said a spokesman
for the Iraqi Culture and Information Ministry.

Study: Umbilical cord blood provides life-saving tissue for cancer

	   Blood taken from newborns' umbilical cords appears to offer a
good source of life-saving tissue for cancer victims and others who
likely would die without bone marrow transplants and do not have
related donors.
	   The largest study yet of transplants using cord blood for
patients who have no related donors shows a lessened risk of
potentially fatal reactions that can result when people get marrow
from donors whose tissue types are not closely matched. Transplants
were considered successful for four out of five patients.
	   ``The procedure was wildly successful beyond anyone's
expectations,'' said LeeAnn Jensen of the National Heart, Lung and
Blood Institute, who oversaw funding for the study.
	   Marrow transplants are a standard part of cancer treatment. In
an attempt to kill cancer, doctors often give such high doses of
chemotherapy that they also destroy the bone marrow, which
manufactures blood cells. So they replace it with blood-producing
cells _ called stem cells _ that are taken from donors.
	   Stem cells can also be retrieved from the bloodstream, and in
the latest study, doctors harvested them from blood in the
discarded umbilical cords of newborns at two New York City
hospitals.
	   Eighty-one percent of the transplants in the study were
considered successful, meaning the blood graft took hold within six
weeks. Only 25 percent developed graft-vs.-host disease, a
dangerous condition in which transplanted tissue attacks the
recipient's body.
	   ``I do think that this may ultimately replace unrelated bone
marrow (transplants), but we're 10 years away from that,'' said Dr.
Joanne Kurtzberg of Duke University Medical Center, which did 170
of the study's 562 transplants.
	   The study, directed by Dr. Pablo Rubinstein of the New York
Blood Center, was published in Thursday's New England Journal of
Medicine. It reviewed transplants at 98 U.S. and foreign hospitals
using cord blood from his program, the first and largest public
placental blood bank in the world.
	   The patients had leukemia, blood disorders or genetic diseases.
	   With bone marrow transplants, Rubinstein said, at least five of
the six genetic markers on the infection-fighting white blood cells
must be identical in donor and recipient. But cord blood
transplants with only a four-of-six match have succeeded.
	   ``It turns out that with placental blood you can forgive a
little more incompatibility'' between donor and recipient, he said.
	   That leeway makes it easier to find matches, allowing the
life-saving transplant surgery for up to 90 percent of patients who
can't find a compatible bone marrow donation, Kurtzberg said.
	   Besides lessening the risk of disease, using placental blood
means no donor must suffer hundreds of painful needle jabs to draw
out bone marrow, and cells from newborns are far less likely to
harbor blood-borne diseases, Rubinstein said.
	   The study did not look at long-term survival rates.
	   Cord blood has been the subject of increasing study in recent
years. The National Institutes of Health, which financed
Rubinstein's study, has begun a five-year study of cord blood that
would also increase the cord blood available for transplants.
	   Dr. Paul Billings, director of the nonprofit Cord Blood Donor
Foundation, praised the study's conclusions. He was not involved in
the study.
	   But Billings, whose foundation operates one of the country's
half-dozen public cord blood banks and promotes donations, said
public banks need to collect specimens from genetically unique
populations, such as American Indians.
	   Another expert who did not participate in the study said cord
blood transplants may turn out to be beneficial for patients with
other conditions. Dr. Robertson Parkman, head of bone marrow
transplantation at Children's Hospital in Los Angeles, said it
could help those suffering from lymphoma and tumors in the breast,
ovaries or lungs.

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Weeping with joy over a day they thought
would never come, opponents of Augusto Pinochet welcomed a British
ruling Wednesday upholding his arrest for possible extradition to
Spain and trial on charges of genocide.
	   ``It is a very important day for all humanity, not just for
Chileans,'' said Ana Maria Gonzalez, a 45-year-old who fled her
native Chile after Pinochet seized power and who was among dozens
who turned out in Madrid's central Puerta del Sol to hear the
ruling on the radio.
	   At a rally, there were shouts of ``extradition'' and ``long live
Chile without Pinochet!''
	   ``I have been waiting 23 years to see Pinochet brought to
trial,'' said Santiago Oyarzo, who said he was tortured and held
for over a year without a trial for giving a radical newspaper to a
friend soon after Pinochet seized power.
	   Up to 1,000 people gathered in the square later Wednesday waving
banners that read: ``U.K. OK, Pinochet K.O.'' and singing the song
``Happy Birthday to You'' in reference to the coincidence that the
British ruling fell on Pinochet's 83rd birthday.
	   Pinochet was arrested in London on Oct. 16 at the instigation of
Spanish Judge Baltasar Garzon who heads the effort to see the
retired general tried for crimes against humanity allegedly
committed during his 1973-1990 dictatorship.
	   ``This is a giant step for humanity, and specifically for the
people of Latin America,'' said Carlos Slepoy, an Argentine private
attorney who has worked with Garzon.
	   ``It is a breath of fresh air,'' Slepoy said, claiming that it
put Spanish justice ``at the vanguard of human rights.''
	   Not that Spain's conservative government wants that reputation,
given that the Pinochet case has already ruffled political
relations with Chile and risks damaging lucrative trade ties and
major Spanish investments.
	   But equally keen to avoid accusations of obstructing justice,
Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar has repeated many times that Spain
would respect all judicial decisions.
	   ``We respect and we will adapt to these legal procedures,'' he
said after the British ruling. Earlier he said he was confident
that relations with Chile would remain good.
	   Most other political parties welcomed the ruling, including
Spain's main opposition Socialist party that called on the
government to pressure for extradition.

Netanyahu makes tentative deal with Levy to rejoin coalition

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ In an effort to save his crumbling
coalition and broaden support for peace, Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu struck a tentative deal Wednesday to bring a moderate
deserter back into his hard-line Cabinet.
	   Staunch right-wingers who oppose ceding war-captured land to the
Palestinians have been threatening to leave Netanyahu's government
over the latest land-for-security agreement with the Palestinians.
	   Such a move would leave Netanyahu without a parliamentary
majority and thus vulnerable in no-confidence motions, which
Netanyahu could face next month when he presents the annual budget
to the Knesset.
	   The return of David Levy, the former foreign minister, would
bolster support for Netanyahu but the premier would still need to
find more votes, most likely from his political rivals in the form
of a national unity, or power-sharing government.
	   Political commentators said Wednesday that the prime minister
wanted Levy back in the fold as an ally so that Netanyahu would be
in a stronger position when opening negotiations with the main
opposition Labor Party.
	   Three influential Cabinet ministers _ Foreign Minister Ariel
Sharon, Trade Minister Natan Sharansky and Finance Minister Yaakov
Neeman _ said it might be a good idea for Netanyahu to start
courting Labor.
	   Both Sharon and Netanyahu canceled trips in order to deal with
the coalition crisis. Netanyahu backed out of the Swiss portion of
a three-country European tour. He left late Wednesday to Britain
and will continue on from there to Spain.
	   Sharon was to have led Israel's delegation to a 50-nation donor
conference for the Palestinians in Washington next week and held
talks with U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and members
of Congress but stayed behind to handle negotiations. Israeli TV
networks said Sharon would meet with former prime minister Shimon
Peres and Labor leader Ehud Barak to discuss prospects for a unity
government.
	   Netanyahu's coalition has been shaky from the start. It includes
several small single-interest and religious parties, and Netanyahu
has spent the last two and a half years trying to balance the often
conflicting needs of each partner.
	   Levy would likely return to the Cabinet as national
infrastructures minister, a position vacated by Sharon in
September. As part of the deal, Levy and Netanyahu would run their
parties on the same slate in the next election. To sweeten the pot,
Netanyahu reportedly promised the social welfare advocate to
increase budgetary funds for social programs.
	   Neither side commented on the package, apparently struck by
intermediaries who negotiated through the night and reached a
tentative deal before dawn Wednesday. An official announcement was
not expected until Netanyahu returned home Sunday.
	   Levy's Gesher Party, a working-class party that broke from
Netanyahu's conservative Likud Party before 1996 elections,
approved a return to Netanyahu's coalition Wednesday. But two of
five other Gesher legislators did not attend the meeting, an
apparent sign that those lawmakers will not rejoin the government.
	   Levy resigned in January in protest over the deadlock in the
peace talks with the Palestinians, saying then that the government
was ``on a flight to nowhere.''
	   On Tuesday, Levy suggested that with the signing of the Mideast
accord last month, the government looked more appealing.
	   ``Now that the government is taking the political course that I
demanded ... we in Gesher will convene and decide,'' he told Israel
TV's Channel Two.

Benfica defeats Kaiserslautern 2-1 in European Champs League
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Benfica of Portugal beat Germany's
Kaiserslautern 2-1 Wednesday in the European Champions League to
keep alive its slim hope of advancing in the competition.
	   The Lisbon team's second win in five games in Group F lifted it
into second place on seven points, three points behind the German
club with one rotation left to play.
	   Karel Poborsky set up the goals in each half at the Stadium of
Light. He broke down the right on the halfhour, beating one
defender before crossing into the heart of the German area where
Gomes snuck between to defenders to head neatly past Andreas
Reinke.
	   In the thrilling second half, when Benfica dictated the run of
play, Poborsky once more charged down the right and pulled the ball
back for Joao Pinto in the area. Pinto dribbled around a defender
before slotting the ball past keeper Andreas Reinke after 70
minutes.
	   Juergen Rische pulled one back with a header in the 90th minute.
	   Kaiserslautern persistently probed down Benfica's flanks in the
first half in pursuit of the win that would have secured it a berth
in the next round.
	   Marco Reich tested goalie Sergey Ovchinikov with a thundering
shot after 15 minutes, while Michael Ballack twice came close with
shots in the 30th and 33rd minutes.
	   After the interval, Gomes had a superb chance to notch his
second when he pierced the German back line and, chased by three
defenders, ran half the pitch but shot straight at Reinke from
almost point blank range.
	   Olaf Marschall came closest for Kaiserslautern, chipping
cleverly over Ovchinikov from the edge of the area but the Russian
tipped the ball over the bar.
	   In the final minutes, Pinto shot the ball wide from close range
when he had only the goalie to beat.

Sampras wins again, Agassi retires in match against Corretja
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Agassi dropping out of tournament &QL; 
 &UR; By NESHA STARCEVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HANOVER, Germany (AP) _ Pete Sampras is playing too well to have
to worry about figuring out the intricacies of the round-robin
format.
	   After beating Carlos Moya 6-3, 6-3 on Wednesday, Sampras was not
even aware that he had clinched a place in the semifinals of the
ATP World Championship.
	   ``That's nice to hear,'' Sampras said after being told at the
post-match news conference that he had secured a place in the last
four.
	   ``It's certainly a good feeling to be here over the weekend,''
Sampras said.
	   Meanwhile, Andre Agassi dropped out of the tournament because of
a back injury and will be replaced by Greg Rusedski. Agassi retired
in the third set of his match against Alex Corretja on Wednesday.
	   Sampras is seeking to become the first man to finish as No. 1 in
the world for six years in a row.
	   Marcelo Rios, the only player who can threaten Sampras, trails
by 33 points in the computer rankings and has to do better than
Sampras in the elite season-ending championship that brings
together the top eight players of the year.
	   But Rios, who was not scheduled to play Wednesday, lost his
first match to Tim Henman and is battling a back injury. He now has
to win his next two round-robin matches to reach the semifinals and
stay in the chase.
	   The eight players are split into two groups and Sampras and Rios
cannot meet until the semifinals.
	   ``It helps,'' Sampras said of Rios losing the first match. ``I'm
also helping myself by winning. I can't really be too concerned
about what Marcelo is doing.''
	   ``I have to concentrate on my matches. If I take care of things
myself and go out and win, then it should be hopefully good enough.
But I must admit I was rooting for the Englishman (Henman)
yesterday,'' Sampras said.
	   Sampras was certainly good enough to beat Moya in only 62
minutes. Moya, the French Open champion who is now 1-1, had beaten
Sampras in a group match last year but Sampras went on to win the
dlrs 3.5 million event for the fourth time.
	   On Tuesday, Sampras was equally impressive in dismissing Yevgeny
Kafelnikov in straight sets.
	   ``It's not easy to play well like I have been today and
yesterday. I was coming into today's match pretty confident,''
Sampras said. ``I wanted to make sure I was coming in a little bit
more than last year, chipping and charging, trying to put as much
pressure on him as possible.''
	   ``Last year I must admit I felt a little flat. This year, with
the ranking up for grabs, I just made a concerted effort to come
here a little bit early and prepare as best as I can.
	   ``It's obviously a very big week for Marcelo and I. I just
wanted to give myself the best chance possible to play well here,''
said Sampras, who fired 13 aces.
	   Corretja was leading 5-7, 6-3, 2-1 when Agassi quit.
	   Agassi was practicing with Corretja on Monday when he fell and
hurt his back and has been receiving shots and other treatment
since then.
	   ``It was definitely painful even this morning in my warmup. I
needed to give it a go, at least try to keep the points short,''
said Agassi, who won the event in 1990.
	   ``But I hit a swinging volley and when I twisted it was just
like somebody stuck a knife in me. Pretty soon it got quite
pointless,'' he said.
	   Rusedski will play Rios on Thursday. Corretja plays Henman and
Sampras meets Karol Kucera.
	   Kafelnikov beat Kucera 6-7 (3-7), 6-3, 6-2 in the last match
Wednesday and improved to 1-1. Kucera dropped to 0-2.
	   Although he has surged back No. 4 this year after falling as low
as No. 141 at the same time last year, Agassi has not done well at
major tournaments this season.
	   ``The year has been great for me in many respects, but the great
tournaments have been pretty disappointing,'' Agassi said. ``I've
worked really hard and had to grind week after week to get myself
in position, only to struggle when I got into position.''

Substitute's goal gives Croatia Zagreb 1-0 victory over Ajax
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Substitute Josip Simic scored with
a delightful lob over Edwin van der Sar to give Croatia Zagreb a
surprise 1-0 victory over Ajax Amsterdam Wednesday in their
Champions League Group A clash.
	   Playing without star Robert Prosinecki, Zagreb created few
chances but made the most of its first clear opening to steal the
match.
	   Simic scored his opportunist goal in the 68th minute when Van
der Sar lost the ball after charging off his line to break down a
Zagreb attack but lost the ball. With the 'keeper stranded, Simic
fired a perfectly-judged 25-meter (yard) lob into the empty net.
	   Ajax dominated possession throughout the match but was unable to
convert its ball control into meaningful attacks as the Croatians
defended resolutely.
	   The closest four-times European Cup winner Ajax came to opening
the scoring was in the last minute before half time when Richard
Witschge's cross from the right was headed across the face of the
goal by Dani but 19-year-old Brutil Hose, making his European
debut, was beaten to the ball by defender Goran Juric.
	   The home team had the ball in the net in the 32nd minute when
Wamberto volleyed in from close range after a Ronald de Boer corner
but French referee Marc Batta ruled that Zagreb goalkeeper Drazen
Ladic had been fouled.
	   Zagreb came close to scoring in the 54th minute when Silvio
Maric released Simic but Simic, who had come on as a substitute
seconds earlier, was this time defied by Van der Sar who quickly
came off his line to clear the danger.

Rosenborg defeats Athletic Bilbao 2-1
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TRONDHEIM, Norway (AP) _ With a mental surplus Rosenborg was
unbeatable when they defeated Athletic Bilbao 2-1 in the fifth
rotation of the European Champions League Wednesday. Jan Derek
Sorensen scored both goals for the home team.
	   Rosenborg gave the Basques a cold shower in the opening minute
of the game. Andre Bergdolmo fooled Bilbao's offside trap passing
the ball to Runar Berg, who made an attempt. Sorensen took
advantage of the rebound making it 1-0 in front of 15,454 fans.
	   The Basques had a couple of chances on corner kicks in the first
half, but the Norwegians were too air-strong in the box.
	   Rosenborg continued the pressure in the second half. In the 49th
midfielder-playmaker Bent Skammelsrud was taken down by two Basque
defenders 20 meters outside the goal. Sorensen executed a perfect
free kick to make it 2-0.
	   However, Bilbao pulled one back a minute before the end of the
game with a goal from Jorge Perez.
	   Still, Rosenborg had momentum for the entire second half. There
is a reason Bilbao struggles in the lower end of the Spanish
league.
	   Skammelsrud was booked in the 52nd and misses the last game away
against Juventus on Dec. 9.

Champions: Lens wins 1-0 to oust Arsenal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WEMBLEY, England (AP) _ Lens knocked English titlist Arsenal out
of the Champions Cup with a 1-0 victory at Wembley Wednesday.
	   Mikel Debeve scored in the 72nd minute and the French club will
face Dynamo Kiev in two weeks time to decide who wins Group E and
makes it to the last eight.
	   Arsenal was missing suspended Emmanuel Petit and injured Patrick
Vieira and Dennis Bergkamp and was generally outplayed by the
French team after making most of the early running.
	   Lens defenders Cyrille Magnier and Erik Sikora made important
blocks to prevent Christophe Wreh and Nicolas Anelka firing the
Gunners ahead early in the game.
	   Wreh also fired over the top from a good position before Lens
began to move menacingly forward and Arsenal 'keeper David Seaman
did well to a block a powerful shot from Vladimir Smicer.
	   The only goal of the game came 18 minutes from the end when
Smicer crossed from the end and Debeve fired the ball home from
what looked an offside position.
	   Arsenal midfielder Ray Parlour was sent off in the final minute
for striking out at Cyril Rool and he was followed a minute later
by Tony Vairelles for a foul challenge on Lee Dixon.

Maradona off to Italy seeking compensation for drug test error
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ Diego Maradona will demand
financial compensation for an erroneous drug test taken during his
playing days in Italy, his manager said Wednesday.
	   Maradona is expected to fly on Thursday to Italy where he is
scheduled to appear on a popular Italian television program. His
plans could however be complicated by his desire to watch his
former club team play for the league championship on Sunday.
	   Guillermo Coppola told the Buenos Aires sports daily Ole that
Maradona plans to appear before a judge investigating
irregularities at an Italian drug testing facility where he once
tested positive for drug use.
	   As a result, Maradona was suspended from Italian first-division
play for 15 months after the test revealed traces of cocaine in his
backup urine sample.
	   Coppola didn't indicate what day the star planned to make his
court appearance.
	   He said the 38-year-old star wants some kind of financial
compensation from the Italian Football Federation if it's proven
that the Acqua Acetosa laboratory where his drug test results were
processed is at fault.
	   Coppola didn't indicate what amount the star might demand.
	   The Italian lab has come under intense scrutiny recently and was
blamed for mishandling drug tests and documentation of their
results. It closed last month.
	   A confessed cocaine addict, Maradona has always maintained his
innocence, saying he often took his own private tests before
matches.
	   He was suspended a second time in 1994 for another 15 months
after tesing positive for stimulant use during the 1994 World Cup
in the United States.
	   Maradona charged the suspension was revenge for Argentina's 1990
World Cup victory over Italy.

IMF chief says worst of world crisis is over

 &UR; RETRANSMITTING to fix slug &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Michel Camdessus, director-general of the
International Monetary Fund, said Wednesday that the worst of the
global financial crisis is over, a Spanish news agency reported.
	   Camdessus said it was possible to avoid a global recession,
although the risk hadn't completely disappeared because ``the
treatment has only just started,'' the state-owned news agency EFE
quoted him as saying.
	   ``To those frivolous commentators and prophets of doom who've
been chronicling the death foretold of the Brazilian and Latin
American financial system, I say today what I said yesterday: The
Latin American domino won't fall,'' the agency quoted Camdessus as
saying during a Madrid meeting of Spanish business leaders.
	   The IMF chief reserved particular praise for what he called
Brazil's ``courageous'' three-year economic and financial reform
program.
	   Camdessus also promised the IMF would not abandon the
crisis-ridden Russian economy, but that ``Russia must first show it
is willing to help itself.''

Champions: Inter Milan 3, Real Madrid 1
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ Roberto Baggio came off the bench to score
twice in the closing minutes Wednesday, leading Internazionale of
Milan past defending titlist Real Madrid 3-1 and into first place
in Group C of the Champions League.
	   Baggio, who's struggled all season with a knee injury, entered
as a substitute in the 68th minute with the score tied 1-1 after
the clubs had traded goals eight minutes apart early in the second
half.
	   With four minutes left, the 31-year-old veteran took a pass from
Argentine midfielder Diego Simeone and rifled a low shot from 11
meters (yards) out that found the net off German 'keeper Bodo
Illgner's foot.
	   Baggio then wrapped up the dramatic win in injury time, taking
another pass from Simeone and rounding Illgner with a series of
fakes before slotting the ball home before 80,000 at sold-out San
Siro Stadium.
	   Italy's 1994 World Cup goal-scoring star played alongside
two-time FIFA Player of the Year Ronaldo _ who also has had knee
trouble _ for just the third time this season.
	   And the Brazilian set up Inter's opening goal.
	   Ronaldo's rising blast from 25 meters (yards) out in the 51st
minute deflected off Chilean striker Ivan Zamorano's leg and flew
past Illgner.
	   Real equalized quickly, when Dutch midfielder Clarence Seedorf
headed in Brazilian midfielder Savio's precise cross.
	   The result likely saved Inter coach Luigi Simoni's job. Club
owner Massimo Moratti had demanded a victory Wednesday.

Jamaican executions postponed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) _ Jamaica's highest court on Wednesday
stayed the executions of three convicted killers pending a hearing
on whether the men have exhausted all of their appeals.
	   Dalton Daley and Peter Blaine had been scheduled to hang on
Thursday, and Milton Montague on Tuesday. Jamaica's Supreme Court
stayed the executions until a Tuesday hearing by a judges' panel.
	   The men claimed that their appeals to the Inter-American Human
Rights Commission, a tribunal organized by the Organization of
American States, had not been decided yet.
	   They also objected to a six-month limit on death-row appeals to
international bodies that was recently adopted by Jamaica's
government.
	   It was unclear what would happen if the commission ruled in
favor of the convicts. The rights watchdog advises member
governments, but they are not obliged to act on its
recommendations.
	   Some Caribbean countries accuse the commission of deliberately
delaying its decisions to prevent hangings. On Oct. 15, the Bahamas
ignored a last-minute appeal by the commission and hanged two
murder convicts.
	   Eager to remove barriers to executions, Jamaica plans to
withdraw from the human rights agreement that gives prisoners the
right to appeal to the commission.
	   Like other Caribbean countries, Jamaica says the death penalty
deters crime linked to drug trafficking in the region.

Cuba's `queen of guaguanco' dead at 68
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HAVANA (AP) _ Cuban singer Celeste Mendoza, known as the ``queen
of guaguanco,'' has died in Havana at the age of 68.
	   Cuban newspapers said Mendoza died Sunday. They did not give the
cause.
	   Born in the eastern city of Santiago, Mendoza began singing on
the radio at age 13 and at 21 was appearing at the famed Tropicana
nightclub. She eventually became one of Cuba's most popular
singers, touring the world.
	   With international interest in Cuban music on the rise, Mendoza
toured Europe in 1997 and this year her recording with the group
Los Papines, ``The King of Rumba,'' won an award at Cuba's version
of the Grammy Awards, Cubadisco.
	   Among her most popular recordings were ``Soy Tan Feliz'' (``I Am
So Happy''), ``Echame a mi la culpa'' (``Put the Blame on Me'') and
``Que Me Castigue Dios'' (``Let God Punish Me'').
	   She was known as a fervent supporter of Cuba's socialist
government.
	   The vice president of Cuba's Union of Artists and Writers, Jose
Loyola, praised Mendoza for ``her Cubanness, her love for the
people who made her their own and for the revolutionary process.''

	   BARCELONA, Spain (AP) _ Barcelona slipped out of the Champions
Cup after a thrilling 3-3 tie with Manchester United in the
Champions Cup Wednesday, the same result they achieved at Old
Trafford.
	   The result means United slipped to second in the Group D
standings and has to beat Bayern Munich to win the group while
Barcelona, which needed to win at Camp Nou, goes out.
	   Rivaldo, who terrorized the United defense, scored twice for the
Spanish club and also hit the crossbar with a 30-meter strike while
Dwight Yorke scored twice for United in an end-to-end game which
was a great advert for attacking soccer.
	   Barcelona was forced to play without injured Jose Guardiola,
Winston Bogarde, Luis Enrique, Abelardo Fernandez and Miguel Angel
Nadal, suspended Philippe Cocu and ineligible Patrick Kluivert but
looked impressive going forward and went ahead through Sonny
Anderson after 50 seconds.
	   Anderson stunned United with his first minute strike, collecting
a pass from the left and shrugging off a feeble challenge from Gary
Neville before firing between Peter Schmeichel and the post from 20
meters.
	   The busy Schmeichel pushed away a low, 25-meter shot from
Rivaldo and rescued his team again when Barcelona caught out United
with a swift break from defense. Anderson got clear of the defense
only for Schmeichel to race out of goal and block his shot at the
expense of a corner.
	   Instead of being 2-0 down, United drew level after 25 minutes
with its first shot of the game.
	   Jesper Blomqvist broke down the left and passed inside to the
unmarked Yorke who had plenty of room to control the ball, pick his
spot and fire home.
	   The Spaniards were kept out again by an amazing one-handed,
reflex-action save by Schmeichel, the Dane blocking a shot from
Rivaldo and recovering to push the ball away with three more
Barcelona players waiting to pounce on the rebound.
	   But United went 2-1 ahead eight minutes with Andy Cole scoring
his eighth league and cup goal in 10 games for Alex Ferguson's
team.
	   Roy Keane passed from deep, Yorke stepped over the ball to allow
it to go to Cole. He passed to his strike colleague and then took
the return pass to fire home with the Barcelona defense torn apart
	   Three minutes later it was 2-2 when Rivaldo curled a free kick
past Schmeichel who was moving the wrong way.
	   A minute after Dwight Yorke's near post header had been turned
behind for a corner, David Beckham swung in another right wing
cross and the Tobagan striker dived to head home from close range
in the 68th minute.
	   Five minutes later it was 3-3 through Rivaldo's overhead kick
from eight meters after he collected Sergi's leftwing cross under
pressure from Gary Neville.
	   Rivaldo also struck the Manchester United bar from 30 meters and
Schmeichel raced off his line to block Giovanni's shot with the
Brazilian through once again.

Official OPEC meeting pushed to Thursday
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES and RECASTS with informal talks ended, official
meeting moved to Thursday. UPDATES prices. TRIMS. &QL; 
 &UR; By DIDI KIRSTEN TATLOW &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ OPEC ministers finished meeting
informally late Wednesday, saying only that they would reconvene
the following day at the OPEC Secretariat to begin their formal
session.
	   It was unclear whether a report that Venezuela opposes extending
production cuts was blocking any kind of agreement among the
ministers to combat the worldwide decline in oil prices.
	   Oil ministers departing after roughly six hours of informal
talks declined to comment on whether an agreement had been reached.
	   The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries' official
year-end meeting was supposed to begin Wednesday, but is now slated
to begin Thursday morning.
	   Earlier in the day Venezuela reportedly told OPEC delegates that
it opposed extending cuts introduced in June in an effort to soak
up the oil glut on the world market.
	   Traders in futures markets Wednesday indicated they don't expect
a solution to be generated from this week's meeting.
	   North Sea Brent Blend crude oil for delivery in January was
trading in London at a 12-year low Wednesday, moving as low as dlrs
10.65 a barrel before settling at dlrs 10.90. In trading on the New
York Mercantile Exchange, prices of sweet crude for delivery in
January finished at dlrs 11.86 as it neared its 12-year low of dlrs
11.42 set in June.
	   OPEC's average oil price has been cut nearly in half over the
past year because of a global oil glut brought on by its ill-timed
decision last winter to boost production, coinciding with Asia's
economic crisis and falling demand.
	   Analysts said only fresh production cuts will raise the low
prices that are making gas cheap for consumers, but are hurting
economies in OPEC countries.
	   Kuwait, which says its 1998 oil revenue will sink by 45 percent,
Algeria and Libya favor fresh cuts.
	   That probably won't happen, however. Heavyweight Saudi Arabia
believes further cuts _ in addition to reductions agreed to in June
_ would be premature. It wants OPEC members to comply with the
overall 2.6 million barrels-a-day June cut.
	   Saudi Arabia fears further cuts will deprive the country of
market share if other nations don't stop overproducing. Analysts
say Venezuela, Iran and Indonesia are not in compliance.
	   A possible outcome of the OPEC meeting is a decision to extend
June's cuts beyond the initial one year, to the end of 1999.
	   Analysts said that's the bare minimum OPEC could do to prevent a
price rout.
	   But Saudi Arabia's fear of losing market share to overproducers
in the group may immobilize the organization, they said.
	   ``It's a mess, as ever,'' said Leo Drollas, chief economist at
London's Center for Global Energy Studies.
	   OPEC's average price per barrel of crude oil has crashed dlrs
8.22 from dlrs 18.81 last November to dlrs 10.59, according to the
last available average price.
	   Reflecting the sense of crisis, Algeria's oil minister Youcef
Yousfi called this week for a special meeting of heads of state of
OPEC's 11 members, saying the ``price crisis'' must be addressed at
the very top.
	   It would be OPEC's first leaders' meeting since 1975.
	   The oil ministers were expected to discuss the suggestion, but
the extent of support for it was unclear.

Munich coasts to 2-0 victory over Brondby
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ Bayern Munich coasted past Brondby
Copenhagen Tuesday and kept alive its hopes of a Champions Cup
quarterfinal berth with a 2-0 victory over the Danish champions.
	   Carsten Jancker, inserted into the match at the half, headed in
the first score in the 51st minute. The big striker also fed
midfielder Mario Basler for the 2-0 six minutes later.
	   The victory, the third straight for the German team, set up a
showdown with Manchester United for control of Group D in the last
match of round-robin play on Dec. 9.
	   Munich attacked and controlled the match from the start against
defensive-minded Brondby, which started only Bo Hansen at forward.
	   But playing in sub-freezing tempatures, the Germans suddenly
fell apart midway through the first half and gave the Danish team
their best scoring scenes.
	   ``Some our players must be frozen in place,'' complained Munich
president Franz Beckenbauer.
	   But when Jancker entered the match, the Germans regained
control. His header came six minutes after he took the pitch, off a
perfectly-timed cross by Brazilian international Giovane Elber.
	   Jancker then shook Basler free with a pass and the German
national midfielder blasted a shot from 10 meters (10 yards) past
Brondby goalie Emeka Andersen.
	   Andersen's heroics stopped Munich from ringing up several more
scores and turning the match into the routs that Brondby endured
against Manchester.
	   The British club drubbed Brondby 6-2 and 5-0.
	   The win gained Munich revenge for the way the Danish champions
had stunned the Germans 2-1 in their first match, erasing a 0-1
deficit by scoring twice in the final four minutes.

Suspects arrested in slaying of Iranian opposition figure
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Police said Wednesday they had arrested
several suspects in connection with the murder of an opposition
figure and his wife during the past week.
	   The body of Dariush Foruhar, leader of the People's Party of
Iran, and his wife, Parvaneh, were found with stab wounds on
Sunday.
	   The official Islamic Republic News Agency quoted police
spokesman Col. Ali Moqadam as saying a number of suspects have been
detained. He did not elaborate.
	   Moqadam said forensic experts were examining the bodies and that
the exact time of their deaths would be announced later.
	   Relatives and neighbors who had gathered in front of Foruhar's
home in central Tehran said the two were killed Saturday.
	   Foruhar's party is a small opposition group that is tolerated by
the government.
	   He served as minister of labor and social affairs in the
provisional government of Prime Minister Mehdi Bazargan immediately
after the 1979 Islamic Revolution that toppled the monarchy.

Substitute's goal gives Croatia Zagreb 1-0 victory over Ajax
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Substitute Josip Simic scored with
a delightful lob over Edwin van der Sar to give Croatia Zagreb a
surprise 1-0 victory over Ajax Amsterdam Wednesday in their
Champions League Group A clash.
	   Playing without star Robert Prosinecki, Zagreb created few
chances but made the most of its first clear opening to steal the
match.
	   Simic scored his opportunist goal in the 68th minute when Van
der Sar lost the ball after charging off his line to break down a
Zagreb attack but lost the ball. With the 'keeper stranded, Simic
fired a perfectly-judged 25-meter (yard) lob into the empty net.
	   Ajax dominated possession throughout the match but was unable to
convert its ball control into meaningful attacks as the Croatians
defended resolutely.
	   The closest four-times European Cup winner Ajax came to opening
the scoring was in the last minute before half time when Richard
Witschge's cross from the right was headed across the face of the
goal by Dani but 19-year-old Brutil Hose, making his European
debut, was beaten to the ball by defender Goran Juric.
	   The home team had the ball in the net in the 32nd minute when
Wamberto volleyed in from close range after a Ronald de Boer corner
but French referee Marc Batta ruled that Zagreb goalkeeper Drazen
Ladic had been fouled.
	   Zagreb came close to scoring in the 54th minute when Silvio
Maric released Simic but Simic, who had come on as a substitute
seconds earlier, was this time defied by Van der Sar who quickly
came off his line to clear the danger.

Rosenborg defeats Athletic Bilbao 2-1
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TRONDHEIM, Norway (AP) _ With a mental surplus Rosenborg was
unbeatable when they defeated Athletic Bilbao 2-1 in the fifth
rotation of the European Champions League Wednesday. Jan Derek
Sorensen scored both goals for the home team.
	   Rosenborg gave the Basques a cold shower in the opening minute
of the game. Andre Bergdolmo fooled Bilbao's offside trap passing
the ball to Runar Berg, who made an attempt. Sorensen took
advantage of the rebound making it 1-0 in front of 15,454 fans.
	   The Basques had a couple of chances on corner kicks in the first
half, but the Norwegians were too air-strong in the box.
	   Rosenborg continued the pressure in the second half. In the 49th
midfielder-playmaker Bent Skammelsrud was taken down by two Basque
defenders 20 meters outside the goal. Sorensen executed a perfect
free kick to make it 2-0.
	   However, Bilbao pulled one back a minute before the end of the
game with a goal from Jorge Perez.
	   Still, Rosenborg had momentum for the entire second half. There
is a reason Bilbao struggles in the lower end of the Spanish
league.
	   Skammelsrud was booked in the 52nd and misses the last game away
against Juventus on Dec. 9.

Report: Shin Bet discovered Hamas operated out of Israeli jail
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Cracking the elaborate command system of
Islamic militants, Israel has discovered that Hamas leaders fired
off daily orders for attacks against Jews from their cells in
Israeli jails, Israeli media reported Wednesday.
	   Instructions were passed through messages in the diapers of
infants prisoners held briefly during family visits or when kissing
relatives, Israel radio reported.
	   Israel has repeatedly blamed Yasser Arafat's Palestinian
Authority after attacks for not clamping down hard enough on
Islamic radicals.
	   Channel 2 TV said an investigation by the Shin Bet, Israel's
internal security agency, found that Hamas members were receiving
daily instructions from leaders currently serving time in an
Israeli jail in the southern city of Ashkelon.
	   A spokeswoman for the Prison Authority did not respond to
requests for a comment on the reports. The Shin Bet, shrouded in
secrecy, does not have a spokesman.
	   Channel 2 said the orders from the prison were transferred to
the head of Hamas' military wing, Awad Awadallah, a fugitive sought
and killed along with his brother by Israel in September. According
to the report Awadallah was in charge of funding for the group, and
acted as a liaison between the different branches of Hamas in the
West Bank, Gaza and Jordan.
	   The structure of Hamas' military wing has taken a severe beating
over the last year since many of its members have been caught by
Israeli and Palestinian forces or killed.
	   Hamas opposes the Israeli-Palestinian peace process and has
carried out several attacks that have killed dozens of Israelis in
efforts to derail the negotiations.
	   The radical group carried out several massive suicide bombings
and fatal drive-by shootings in 1996 and 1997, but recent attacks
have been botched or minor, killing few people and often involving
crudely constructed bombs.

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Sinisa Gogic scored one goal and Predrag
Djordjevic added another as Olympiakos Piraeus beat Portugal's
Porto 2-1 Wednesday in a Group A game for the Champions League.
	   The win, sent Olympiakos atop the group with 10 points. Ajax
Amsterdam and Croatia Zagreb follow in second place the seven
points each. Porto is the last place with four points.
	   Olympiakos went on the attack from the opening kickoff and came
close to open the scoring but Porto's goalie Silva Correia made a
key save to a blistering shot by Grigoris Georgatos in the 3rd
minute.
	   A similar chance was lost by the visitors in the 10th when
Jardel's header went just wide.
	   Olympiakos went ahead in the score with Sinisa Gogic in the
18th.
	   Gogic, the scorer of Olympiakos' equalizer in the first-leg game
in Portugal, dribbled past a defender before sending the ball into
the goalmouth.
	   Porto had a major opportunity to level in the 47th, but Dimitris
Eleftheropoulos saved a penalty kick taken by Drulovic.
	   The hosts made the score 2-0 with a free-kick by Djordjevic from
outside the area in the 55th.
	   The visitors narrowed the difference with Zlatko Zahovic in the
76th, and Jardel failed twice in the last three minutes to level
when a shot hit Olympiakos' crossbar and Eleftheropoulos saved with
his foot another from three meters (yards)

Baggio's late double leads Inter past Real 3-1
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS lede, UPDATES with detail, Baggio quote. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ Bad knee and all, Roberto Baggio saved
Internazionale of Milan and coach Luigi Simoni.
	   The veteran striker came off the bench to score twice in the
dying minutes Wednesday, leading Inter past defending titlist Real
Madrid 3-1 and into first place in Group C of the Champions League.
	   Baggio, who's battled a knee tendon injury all season, entered
as a substitute in the 68th minute with the score tied 1-1 after
the clubs had traded goals eight minutes apart early in the second
half.
	   With four minutes left, the 31-year-old took a pass from
Argentine midfielder Diego Simeone and rifled a low shot from 11
meters (yards) out that found the net off German 'keeper Bodo
Illgner's foot.
	   Baggio then wrapped up the dramatic win in injury time, taking
another pass from Simeone and rounding Illgner with a series of
fakes before slotting the ball home before 80,000 at sold-out San
Siro Stadium.
	   The result likely saved Simoni's job. The coach has been under
fire for months and club owner Massimo Moratti had demanded a
victory Wednesday.
	   ``We were well prepared. Luckily, we managed to win this
important game,'' Baggio said.
	   Italy's 1994 World Cup goal-scoring star played alongside
two-time FIFA Player of the Year Ronaldo _ who also has had knee
trouble _ for just the third time this season.
	   And the Brazilian set up Inter's opening goal.
	   Ronaldo's rising blast from 25 meters (yards) out in the 51st
minute deflected off Chilean striker Ivan Zamorano's leg and flew
past Illgner.
	   Real equalized quickly, when Dutch midfielder Clarence Seedorf
headed in Brazilian midfielder Savio's precise cross.
	   Inter, which lost 2-0 to Real Madrid in Spain Sept. 16, leads
Group C with a 3-1-1 record for 10 points. Real is one point back
and Spartak Moscow is two points off the pace with one rotation to
go before the quarterfinals.
	   Inter started strongly, dictating the pace of the match and
generating scoring opportunities. Winger Francesco Moriero sent
three shots off the mark in the first 15 minutes, including one
over the crossbar off Ronaldo's well-timed freeing pass.
	   But Real worked its way into the game, and Yugoslav striker
Pedrag Mijatovic's strong shot from the left side of the penalty
area shaved the near post in the 40th. Three minutes later, Real
striker Raul's close shot at an unprotected net was deflected over
the crossbar by defender Francesco Colonnese.
	   A slick move by Ronaldo set up sweeper Giuseppe Bergomi for a
point-blank shot in the 66th minute, but Illgner smothered the
ball.
	   Real defender Manuel Sanchis received a yellow card for a foul
on Zamorano in the 17th minute and will miss his club's final group
match, Dec. 9 against Spartak Moscow.
	   Inter faces Austria's Sturm Graz, which drew 0-0 at Spartak on
Wednesday, in two weeks.

Police offer award for missing first edition of Copernicus theory
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ A man who used stolen documents to pose as
a researcher stole a first edition of astronomer Nicholas
Copernicus' 16th century theory on planetary motion by saying he
had to go to the bathroom.
	   Police offered a dlrs 2,900 reward Wednesday for information
that helps recover the book, one of 260 copies of the first edition
of Copernicus' ``De revolutionibus orbium coelestium'' (Concerning
the revolutions of the heavenly spheres).
	   The theory established the foundation of modern astronomy by
saying the sun, and not the earth, was the center of the universe
with other planets, including the earth, revolving around it.
	   The book was printed in Nuremberg in 1543, when Copernicus was
on his deathbed.
	   Eugeniusz Szczerbak, deputy police chief in the southern city of
Krakow, said a middle-aged man asked to see the work on Tuesday at
the library of the Polish Academy of Sciences.
	   Saying he had to use the toilet, the man left with the book,
valued at dlrs 320,000, Szczerbak said.
	   Researchers are allowed to study old books and documents at the
library. The suspect showed library workers stolen identification
documents, Szczerbak said.
	   Police opened an investigation Tuesday and informed Interpol,
the international police agency.

Radical evolutionary change possible in a few generations,
</HEADLINE>
researchers say &QL; 
 &UR; By JOSEPH B. VERRENGIA &QC; 
 &UR; AP Science Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   If the world suddenly gets hotter, you might survive better with
a new skin color, or you might sprout a tail to maneuver in the
dense tropical forest that spreads around the globe.
	   And, if scientists are correct, you might already be carrying
the genes for these radical traits, and more.
	   Scientists working with fruit flies believe they have unlocked a
vault of last-ditch genetic variations that kick in to help
organisms survive in a much altered form that defies the neatly
predictable, incremental pace of evolution.
	   Researchers at the University of Chicago and the Howard Hughes
Medical Institute report in Thursday's issue of the journal Nature
that the fruit flies expressed these prefabricated variations _
from weird limbs to different wings _ when scientists fooled the
insects into thinking that climate change was real.
	   The physical changes erupted in the span of a few generations in
the face of supposedly new and dire living conditions. In doing so,
they radically changed the appearance and behavior of a creature
that had looked and lived the same for eons.
	   Researchers caution this cache of doomsday genes has been
unlocked only in controlled experiments.
	   Such emergency countermeasures are kept under tight molecular
wraps in normal circumstances, they said. Nor has it been
determined if these genes actually work this way in nature.
	   ``This sounds like a very bad thing, and no doubt it is for most
of the individuals,'' said study co-author Susan Lindquist of the
University of Chicago. ``But for some, the changes might be
beneficial for adapting to a new environment. Genetic changes
exposed in this way become the fodder for evolution.''
	   In the 19th century, Charles Darwin described evolution as a
gradual, orderly march by a species toward self-improvement.
	   In the fossil record, most evolutionary changes are seen to have
unfolded over millions of years.
	   But not always.
	   The theory of punctuated equilibrium championed by
paleontologist Stephen Jay Gould and others suggests that evolution
is a messy business driven by random disasters that force survivors
to hurriedly adapt to new environmental conditions.
	   For example, mammals and other life forms flourished after an
asteroid or comet hit Earth 65 million years ago, but dinosaurs
perished.
	   ``Evolution is often thought of as incremental,'' said biologist
Andrew Cossins of the University of Liverpool in England. ``But the
fossil record contains many examples of apparently rapid changes in
body form. This mechanism provides, for the first time, a means by
which changes in body form can be substantial and step-wise rather
than progressive.''
	   Other scientists said the key to determining the significance of
the fruit fly study will be if researchers can demonstrate such
drastic variations can quickly occur outside the laboratory.
	   ``In real life, are there organisms that change this way? Are
there examples in nature that are going begging for an explanation
like this?'' said Aaron Bauer, a lizard geneticist at Villanova
University.
	   Bauer studies a group of geckos native to the deserts of
southwest Africa. He said one type of lizard could be a candidate
for study because it looks and acts differently, yet its genome is
nearly identical to other lizards in the area.
	   ``If this molecular mechanism could be shown to be generally
applicable among different organisms, it would be an important
advance,'' Bauer said.
	   In the fruit fly experiments, the Chicago researchers determined
that the genetic variations held in reserve depended on a protein
called Heat shock protein 90.
	   Hsp90 is known as a chaperone protein. As temperatures rise, it
prevents other proteins from going awry and disrupting normal cell
functions and growth, as well as preventing degenerative diseases.
	   However, Hsp90 gets spread too thin when conditions continue to
deteriorate. With the chaperone distracted, many different proteins
begin to misfire in cells. Genetic variations that were held in
reserve begin to trigger.
	   In the experiments, the researchers deliberately reduced the
levels of Hsp90 in fruit flies to simulate the biological response
in fruit flies to climate change.
	   As many as 90 percent of the flies' offspring emerged with
oddly-shaped wings, strange bristle configurations and limb
deformities. The eventual evolutionary benefits of these genetic
changes were unknown, the researchers said.
	   The abnormalities persisted even when Hsp90 levels were returned
to normal in later generations, suggesting the changes had become
permanent in the fruit flies' genetic code, Lindquist said.

Baggio stars in Inter win over Real; Barcelona out after 3-3
</HEADLINE>
thriller with Man U &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT MILLWARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Substitute Roberto Baggio fired two goals in the
last four minutes Wednesday to lift Inter Milan to a 3-1 victory
over defending titlist Real Madrid in the Champions Cup and revive
his club's title hopes.
	   The veteran striker entered the game 22 minutes from the end
with the score tied 1-1 and Inter looking in danger of going out.
	   He edged Inter in front four minutes from the end and the
brought the 80,000 fans to their feet with a another goal in injury
time as Inter moved to the top of Group C with Real second and
Spartak Moscow third.
	   In the other Group C game, Spartak was surprisingly held 0-0 at
home by Sturm Graz, the Austrian team gaining its first point after
four losses.
	   On a night of amazing soccer and scores, Barcelona and
Manchester United fought out another 3-3 tie _ the same scoreline
they had at Old Trafford _ and the Spanish soccer giant dropped out
of the competition.
	   Rivaldo scored two goals and hit the crossbar from 30 meters and
Tobagan striker Dwight Yorke netted two for the Reds who fell
behind to Sonny Anderson after 50 seconds of a game which was a
great advert for attacking soccer.
	   United lost the Group D standings lead to Bayern Munich which
easily downed Denmark's Brondby 2-0 and the two clubs must meet at
United's Old Trafford in two weeks to see who finishes top.
	   English titlist Arsenal went out after a 1-0 flop to French
titlist Lens at Wembley in Group E, and Ajax Amsterdam surprisingly
lost 1-0 at home to last place Croatia Zagreb in Group A and is in
danger of going out too.
	   Dynamo Kiev came from behind to beat group leader Panathinaikos
2-1 and will go to Lens to decide who tops the group. Both teams
have eight points, two more than Panathinaikos.
	   With Ajax losing, Greek titlist Olympiakos went to the top of
Group A with a 2-1 victory over Portugal's FC Porto.
	   German champion Kaiserlautern suffered its first defeat, a 2-1
loss at Benfica but still looks almost certain to make it to the
last eight. Kaiserlautern still has a three point lead in the Group
F standings and needs a draw at home to HJK Helsinki in two weeks
to guarantee top place.
	   Three goals by the leading scorer in Dutch soccer, Ruud Van
Nistelrooij, gave last place PSV Eindhoven a 3-1 win at HJK
Helsinki in Finland in the other Group F game.
	   Norway's Rosenborg moved to the top of Group B by beating
Athletic Bilbao 2-1. The Norwegians replace Galatasaray because the
Turkish club's game against Juventus was postponed a week because
of an ongoing political conflict between Turkey and Italy.

	   SOWETO, South Africa (AP) _ A police escort was on Wednesday
assigned to the president of the West Indies Cricket Board after
three men robbed him, his wife and a journalist of their car, money
and jewelry at gunpoint.
	   Cricket Board President Pat Rousseau and his wife Hester and
Jamaican journalist Tony Becca were forced to lie on the ground
while they were returning to their car after visiting a cricket
development project in Soweto, a sprawling black township south of
Johannesburg.
	   Police said the group should have asked for a police escort
before they went into Soweto.
	   ``It is procedure that when people visit high risk areas such as
Soweto, that they contact police for an escort before undertaking
the trip,'' said Joseph Ngobeni, a spokesman for the national
police commissioner.
	   Delivery companies and tour buses frequently use the service.
	   Ngobeni said police would also keep a watchful eye on the West
Indies cricket team.
	   The robbers took the victim's watches and Hester's purse, then
stole the car the visitors had borrowed from a South African
cricket board official, Rousseau said.
	   No one was hurt in the mid-day robbery.
	   Police Inspector John Shiburi said police were investigating.
	   A five-series test between the West Indies and South Africa
begins Thursday in Johannesburg.
	   In February, two visiting Pakistani cricket players, paceman
Mohammad Akram and off spinner Saqlain Mushtaq, said three black
men mugged them outside their posh hotel.
	   Amid reports the players were really injured in a brawl at a
strippers bar, the two players refused to give sworn statements to
police.

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Prosecutors and human rights advocates
worldwide celebrated a British court ruling Wednesday upholding the
arrest of former Chilean ruler Augusto Pinochet, saying it was
landmark decision against dictators who commit atrocities and go
unpunished.
	   Pinochet supporters in Chile called it a violation of national
sovereignty and the work of communists.
	   But the cheers way outnumbered the jeers worldwide.
	   Particularly happy was Isabel Allende, the daughter of Socialist
Chilean President Salvador Allende, who died during the 1973 coup
led by Pinochet.
	   ``I feel enormous satisfaction on this historic day. It's a `No'
to impunity and a `Yes' to justice,'' said the Socialist party
deputy in Chile who was in Spain to await the British announcement.
	   ``When crimes against humanity are committed, humanity has to
react,'' she said.
	   In Geneva, United Nation's High Commissioner for Human Rights
Mary Robinson said the ruling ``will hearten human rights
defendants around the world,'' adding that it had ``confirmed the
emerging international consensus against impunity.''
	   Spain's conservative government reacted cautiously. Sticking to
a position that he would let the judicial process take its course,
Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar said Spain respected the decision
by the British justice system.
	   Aznar has been reluctant to embrace prosecution of Pinochet for
fear of ruffling relations and damaging lucrative trade ties.
	   Amnesty International called it ``a landmark breakthrough'' that
``reaffirms the international community's commitment towards the
fulfillment of basic human rights for all.''
	   Family members of Chileans killed or who disappeared during
Pinochet's dictatorship celebrated in London, Santiago and Madrid
at the 3-2 vote by Britain's highest court which scrapped
Pinochet's diplomatic immunity from arrest.
	   The decision means Pinochet must remain in custody while the
British government decides whether to let moves for his possible
extradition to Spain on charges of genocide, terrorism and torture
proceed.
	   ``This is a surprise. This is a joy,'' France's Socialist Prime
Minister Lionel Jospin told reporters. ``It's bad news for all
dictators.''
	   Prosecutors in France, Switzerland and Germany _ three countries
where there have been moves to follow the Spanish example _ saluted
the decision.
	   ``It's a victory for law and morality,'' said William Bourdon, a
lawyer representing some of the family members of French citizens
who disappeared. ``A trial of Pinochet is now possible in Paris and
in Madrid.''
	   Pinochet was arrested on a Spanish arrest warrant Oct. 16 while
in a London hospital recuperating from back surgery.
	   Across the Atlantic Ocean, Brazilian Human rights activists said
the decision opened the way for the trial of other dictators.
	   ``It signals the end of the impunity that has always protected
dictators. From whatever position they are, from the right or the
left, for current or former dictators it is now crystal clear that
the right to live transcends ideologies'', said Amparo Araujo, of
the Torture Never Again organization.
	   In Ecuador, Juan de Dios Parra, head of the Quito-based Latin
American Human Rights Association, said it was ``a clear message to
tyrants, to those who abuse power. It is a triumph of the new law
that puts the protection of human rights above any diplomatic
immunity.''
	   There was no elation at the Pinochet Foundation headquarters in
Santiago, where supporters of the former dictator _ including many
retired military men _ gathered to await the British court's
decision.
	   Some supporters insulted and spat at journalists and even tried
to beat them.
	   ``This is a result of a job well-done by the ... communists,
they have so much money and support in Europe,'' said a woman in
tears who identified herself only as Monica.
	   ``Chilean sovereignty has been violated,'' said Alberto Espina,
president of the right-wing National Renewal Party. He said the
government should send a high-level mission to London to convince
the British government to release Pinochet.

Report: Shin Bet discovered Hamas operated out of Israeli jail
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel has cracked the elaborate command system
of Islamic militants and discovered that Hamas leaders fired off
daily orders for attacks against Jews from their cells in Israeli
jails, Israeli media reported Wednesday.
	   Instructions were passed through messages in the diapers of
infants prisoners held briefly during family visits or when kissing
relatives, Israel radio reported.
	   Israel has repeatedly blamed Yasser Arafat's Palestinian
Authority after attacks for not clamping down hard enough on
Islamic radicals.
	   Channel 2 TV said an investigation by the Shin Bet, Israel's
internal security agency, found that Hamas members were receiving
daily instructions from leaders currently serving time in an
Israeli jail in the southern city of Ashkelon.
	   A spokeswoman for the Prison Authority did not respond to
requests for a comment on the reports. The Shin Bet, shrouded in
secrecy, does not have a spokesman.
	   Channel 2 said the orders from the prison were transferred to
the head of Hamas' military wing, Awad Awadallah, a fugitive sought
and killed along with his brother by Israel in September. According
to the report Awadallah was in charge of funding for the group, and
acted as a liaison between the different branches of Hamas in the
West Bank, Gaza and Jordan.
	   The structure of Hamas' military wing has taken a severe beating
over the last year since many of its members have been caught by
Israeli and Palestinian forces or killed.
	   Hamas opposes the Israeli-Palestinian peace process and has
carried out several attacks that have killed dozens of Israelis in
efforts to derail the negotiations.
	   The radical group carried out several massive suicide bombings
and fatal drive-by shootings in 1996 and 1997, but recent attacks
have been botched or minor, killing few people and often involving
crudely constructed bombs.

World titlist Couch knocks out German in first fight in Britain
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Jane Couch needed little more than three minutes
to score an historic mark for women's boxing Wednesday when she
knocked out Germany's Simona Lukic early in round two if the first
women's fight in a British ring.
	   Couch, who was not defending her world welterweight title, had
to fight a legal battle against the British Boxing Board of Control
and was forced to wait eight months for a license to fight in her
home country.
	   But she only needed to go into the second round to win the fight
at Caesars Nightclub in south London, staggering Lukic with a big
right hook. Referee Richie Davies took a close look at Lukic, an
economics student from Frankfurt, before halted the fight.
	   With no women's boxing allowed in Britain, Couch had to win her
world title fighting in the United States where she said she had
huge support from both men and women.
	   ``I am to show the British public that women's boxing is not a
freak show,'' she said. ``I'm a professional fighter.''
	   John Morris, secretary of the Boxing Board of Control, was at
the ringside, and siad wasn't so sure about the future of women's
boxing.
	   ``It's an historic night for British boxing. But I haven't the
foggiest about where women's boxing goes from here,'' he said.
	   ``Girls now have the opportunity to take up sport but if they
think they can go into a gym straight from the street and try to
make a few bob by becoming professional without being amateurs
first, we would look into that seriously.''

tyrants, to those who abuse power. It is a triumph of the new law
that puts the protection of human rights above any diplomatic
immunity.''
	   There was no elation at the Pinochet Foundation headquarters in
Santiago, where supporters of the former dictator _ including many
retired military men _ gathered to await the British court's
decision.
	   Some supporters insulted and spat at journalists and even tried
to beat them.
	   ``This is a result of a job well-done by the ... communists,
they have so much money and support in Europe,'' said a woman in
tears who identified herself only as Monica.
	   ``Chilean sovereignty has been violated,'' said Alberto Espina,
president of the right-wing National Renewal Party. He said the
government should send a high-level mission to London to convince
the British government to release Pinochet.

	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Sinisa Gogic scored one goal and Predrag
Djordjevic added another as Olympiakos Piraeus beat Portugal's
Porto 2-1 Wednesday in a Group A game for the Champions League.
	   The win, sent Olympiakos atop the group with 10 points. Ajax
Amsterdam and Croatia Zagreb follow in second place the seven
points each. Porto is the last place with four points.
	   Olympiakos went on the attack from the opening kickoff and came
close to open the scoring but Porto's goalie Silva Correia made a
key save to a blistering shot by Grigoris Georgatos in the 3rd
minute.
	   A similar chance was lost by the visitors in the 10th when
Jardel's header went just wide.
	   Olympiakos went ahead in the score with Sinisa Gogic in the
18th.
	   Gogic, the scorer of Olympiakos' equalizer in the first-leg game
in Portugal, dribbled past a defender before sending the ball into
the goalmouth.
	   Porto had a major opportunity to level in the 47th, but Dimitris
Eleftheropoulos saved a penalty kick taken by Drulovic.
	   The hosts made the score 2-0 with a free-kick by Djordjevic from
outside the area in the 55th.
	   The visitors narrowed the difference with Zlatko Zahovic in the
76th, and Jardel failed twice in the last three minutes to level
when a shot hit Olympiakos' crossbar and Eleftheropoulos saved with
his foot another from three meters (yards)

Jancker lifts Munich to 2-0 victory against Brondby

<TEXT>
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ Carsten Jancker may have lost his
starting role at Bayern Munich, but the big striker proved
invaluable Tuesday in a 2-0 Champions Cup victory against Brondby
Copenhagen.
	   Jancker entered the match for the second half and headed in the
first score in the 51st minute. He also fed Mario Basler for the
2-0 six minutes later as Munich jumped to the top of Group D.
	   Munich needed Jancker's score to shake off a case of first-half
nerves against the Danish champions, a clear also-ran in the tough
group.
	   ``It's pretty strange that my players were nervous against
Brondby after beating FC Barcelona twice,'' said Munich coach
Ottmar Hitzfeld. ``But there was a lot at stake.''
	   The German team's third straight win set up a showdown against
Manchester United Dec. 9 to determine who wins Group D and earns a
sure quarterfinals berth.
	   Munich now has 10 points and Manchester nine after the British
club played to a thrilling 3-3 draw against FC Barcelona,
eliminating the Spanish club.
	   ``We don't care if Manchester won or drew, we still have to
travel to Manchester with the intention of winning,'' Hitzfeld
said.
	   Brondby, still reeling from 6-2 and 5-0 blowouts against
Manchester, played defensively and started only Bo Hansen at
forward in a match played in sub-freezing tempatures.
	   ``Some our players must be frozen in place,'' complained Munich
president Franz Beckenbauer as the German players lost their
composure midway through the first half and gave Brondby its best
scoring scenes.
	   But when Jancker entered the match, the Germans regained
control. His header came six minutes after he took the pitch, off a
perfectly-timed cross by Brazilian international Giovane Elber.
	   Jancker then shook Basler free with a pass and the German
national midfielder blasted a shot from 10 meters (10 yards) past
Brondby goalie Emeka Andersen.
	   Andersen's heroics stopped Munich from ringing up several more
scores, but the German club gained revenge for the way the Danish
champions had produced a stunning 2-1 victory in their first match.
Brondby had erased a 0-1 deficit by scoring twice in the final four
minutes.

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ A huge volcano near Mexico City continued to
spew steam, ash and lava Wednesday, with its largest eruption in a
particularly active week. But officials said it posed no danger.
	   Wednesday morning's plume was up to 2 1-2 miles (4 kms) tall,
Ramon Pena Melche, head of an emergency team for the Popocatepetl
Volcano, told the government news agency Notimex.
	   Morelos state's civil protection director, Anselmo Sotelo Parra,
told Notimex that military reports indicated glowing rocks reached
more than a mile (2 kms) from the crater.
	   The 18,000-foot (5,490-meter) volcano only 50 miles (80
kilometers) southeast of Mexico City has been belching ash and
steam all week. Officials have said the ash is blowing over
sparsely populated areas.
	   About 300,000 people live on the mountain's slope and another 15
million live within 50 miles of it.

	   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) _ Police in Guatemala found 728 pounds (330
kgs) of cocaine hidden among a shipment of machetes from Colombia,
the national police said Wednesday.
	   Spokesman Gerson Lopez said a special anti-drug force found the
shipment Tuesday in Puerto Quetzal, 60 miles (100 kms) south of the
capital on the Pacific coast. He said the ship, the Saluki, had
embarked from the Colombian port of San Buenaventura.
	   Prosecutor Oscar Contreras said authorities were investigating
the possible involvement of the Guatemalan company to which the
machetes were addressed.
	   ___
	   BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) _ Brazilian street children marched in the
capital Wednesday to complain about violence against them and voice
their dreams for a better life.
	   Linking arms, hundreds of youngsters shouted: ``We want to live
and not just survive''. It was the fifth event organized by the
Street Children Movement.
	   Marchers handed a document detailing violence against street
children to President Fernando Henrique Cardoso. It proposed more
health and education projects and stiffer punishment against
violators of their rights.
	   There are no official records of how many children live on the
street in Brazil's cities. Estimates range from thousands to
millions.

<TEXT>
	   Blood taken from newborns' umbilical cords appears to offer a
good source of life-saving tissue for cancer victims and others who
likely would die without bone marrow transplants and do not have
related donors.
	   The largest study yet of transplants using cord blood for
patients who have no related donors shows a lessened risk of
potentially fatal reactions that can result when people get marrow
from donors whose tissue types are not closely matched. Transplants
were considered successful for four out of five patients.
	   ``The procedure was wildly successful beyond anyone's
expectations,'' said LeeAnn Jensen of the National Heart, Lung and
Blood Institute, who oversaw funding for the study.
	   Marrow transplants are a standard part of cancer treatment. In
an attempt to kill cancer, doctors often give such high doses of
chemotherapy that they also destroy the bone marrow, which
manufactures blood cells. So they replace it with blood-producing
cells _ called stem cells _ that are taken from donors.
	   Stem cells can also be retrieved from the bloodstream, and in
the latest study, doctors harvested them from blood in the
discarded umbilical cords of newborns at two New York City
hospitals.
	   Eighty-one percent of the transplants in the study were
considered successful, meaning the blood graft took hold within six
weeks. Only 25 percent developed graft-vs.-host disease, a
dangerous condition in which transplanted tissue attacks the
recipient's body.
	   ``I do think that this may ultimately replace unrelated bone
marrow (transplants), but we're 10 years away from that,'' said Dr.
Joanne Kurtzberg of Duke University Medical Center, which did 170
of the study's 562 transplants.
	   The study, directed by Dr. Pablo Rubinstein of the New York
Blood Center, was published in Thursday's New England Journal of
Medicine. It reviewed transplants at 98 U.S. and foreign hospitals
using cord blood from his program, the first and largest public
placental blood bank in the world.
	   The patients had leukemia, blood disorders or genetic diseases.
	   With bone marrow transplants, Rubinstein said, at least five of
the six genetic markers on the infection-fighting white blood cells
must be identical in donor and recipient. But cord blood
transplants with only a four-of-six match have succeeded.
	   ``It turns out that with placental blood you can forgive a
little more incompatibility'' between donor and recipient, he said.
	   That leeway makes it easier to find matches, allowing the
life-saving transplant surgery for up to 90 percent of patients who
can't find a compatible bone marrow donation, Kurtzberg said.
	   Besides lessening the risk of graft-vs.-host disease, using
placental blood means no donor must suffer hundreds of painful
needle jabs to draw out bone marrow, and cells from newborns are
far less likely to harbor blood-borne diseases, Rubinstein said.

Portugal and Indonesia put final touches on East Timor autonomy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By EDITH M. LEDERER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The U.N. envoy for East Timor resumed
talks Wednesday with representatives from Indonesia and Portugal to
put the final touches on an agreement that would give East Timor
wide-ranging autonomy, a U.N. official said.
	   Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alitas and his Portuguese
counterpart Jaime Gama agreed in August to hold in-depth
discussions on Indonesia's proposals for a special status for East
Timor based on wide-ranging autonomy.
	   The ministers said they hoped that an agreement could be reached
before the end of the year. A U.N. official said the three-way
talks on Wednesday and Friday were aimed at reaching a final
agreement.
	   Indonesia invaded the former Portuguese colony in 1975 and
annexed it early the next year. The United Nations and Portugal do
not recognize Indonesia's claim.
	   The U.N. talks were clouded by reports of a massacre of dozens
of East Timorese rebels in a series of clashes with Indonesian
troops. The Indonesian government denied Tuesday that it had killed
more than 40 East Timorese.
	   Portugal suspended talks with Indonesia on Saturday following
reports of the massacre and accused Jakarta of breaking promises to
reduce its military presence in East Timor.
	   U.N. envoy Jamsheed Marker met separately Tuesday with
Indonesian representative Nugroho Wisnumurti and Portugal's
delegate to the talks, Fernando Neves. The three met together on
Wednesday afternoon, U.N. officials said.
	   Before the meeting began, Marker met U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan, who has been personally involved in trying to forge an
agreement on East Timor.
	   Annan is also trying to ascertain the veracity of the massacre
reports and welcomed the announcement that the Indonesian National
Commission on Human Rights will conduct an investigation, U.N.
spokesman Fred Eckhard said.
	   ``We're trying to establish what has happened,'' he said.
``We'll rely on whatever sources we can to determine whether these
allegations are true or not.''
	   Eckhard said Marker will travel to Indonesia and East Timor in
mid-December. Other U.N. officials will visit East Timor shortly,
he said.
	   Portugal's Foreign Ministry has called for a permanent U.N.
mission in East Timor. Eckhard said he was aware of the request but
had no comment on it.
	   The August communique said the in-depth discussions were being
held without either side giving up or changing its basic
principles.
	   Indonesia wants to give East Timor autonomy in return for
international recognition of Indonesian sovereignty. East Timorese
pro-independence groups have insisted that a referendum be held in
the territory to decide its future.
	   No details were released on the autonomy agreement now being
finalized.
	   Alatas said in August that the outline of Indonesia's proposal
was for ``a special province, a special autonomous region based on
wide-ranging autonomy.'' He said this meant that the East Timorese
would control all areas except foreign policy, external defense and
some aspects of monetary and fiscal policy.
	   He also said Indonesia foresees the release of jailed East Timor
rebel leader Xanana Gusmao ``as part and parcel of an overall
solution to the East Timor question.'' Gusmao was arrested in 1991
and is serving a 20-year term for fighting Indonesian troops in the
former Portuguese colony.

	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Prosecutors and human rights advocates
worldwide celebrated a British court ruling Wednesday upholding the
arrest of former Chilean ruler Augusto Pinochet, saying it was
landmark decision against dictators who commit atrocities and go
unpunished.
	   Pinochet supporters in Chile called it a violation of national
sovereignty and the work of communists.
	   But the cheers way outnumbered the jeers worldwide.
	   Particularly happy was Isabel Allende, the daughter of Socialist
Chilean President Salvador Allende, who died during the 1973 coup
led by Pinochet.
	   ``I feel enormous satisfaction on this historic day. It's a `No'
to impunity and a `Yes' to justice,'' said the Socialist party
deputy in Chile who was in Spain to await the British announcement.
	   ``When crimes against humanity are committed, humanity has to
react,'' she said.
	   In Geneva, United Nation's High Commissioner for Human Rights
Mary Robinson said the ruling ``will hearten human rights
defendants around the world,'' adding that it had ``confirmed the
emerging international consensus against impunity.''
	   In contrast, Argentine Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella expressed
his government's ``solidarity'' with Chile and said the decision
violated the principle of ``territoriality.''
	   Di Tella said the Britsh magistrates were ``out of line'' in
denying Pinochet's immunity. Argentine President Carlos Menem, who
calls himself Pinochet's friend, refused to comment on the ruling.

Vaughn gets dlrs 80 million, six-year deal from Angels
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RONALD BLUM &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Mo Vaughn is leapfrogging Mike Piazza to become
the highest-paid player in U.S. Major League Baseball.
	   Vaughn, one of the most powerful left-handed hitters, agreed
Wednesday to an dlrs 80 million, six-year contract with the Anaheim
Angels, The Associated Press learned.
	   Vaughn's new deal, which includes a club option for 2005, has an
average annual value of dlrs 13.33 million, topping the dlrs 13
million Piazza will average under his new dlrs 91 million,
seven-year contract with the New York Mets. Piazza, however, still
has the contract with the most total guaranteed dollars.
	   There was no immediate announcement of the deal but it was
confirmed by two sources who spoke on the condition they not be
identified.
	   The first baseman, who turns 31 next month, hit .337 this year
with 40 homers and 115 RBIs, making dlrs 6.6 million. He had been
negotiating off and on with the Red Sox for the past year, but
Boston ended talks Nov. 11 after Vaughn rejected a dlrs 62.5
million, five-year offer.
	   Vaughn, who lives outside Boston in Easton, Massachusetts, had
been with the Red Sox organization since he started his
professional career in 1989.
	   With the addition of Vaughn, Anaheim anticipates moving Darin
Erstad from first base to the outfield. It's unlikely Erstad or Tim
Salmon will be traded, leaving center fielder Jim Edmonds or right
fielder Garret Anderson likely to be swapped for a pitcher. Edmonds
has been the subject of trade rumors for some time.

Organizers: Scholarship was no bribe
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) _ A scholarship given to the relative of a
late IOC member was part of an outreach program and not a bribe,
organizers for the 2002 Winter Games said.
	   Sonia Essomba received more than dlrs 10,000 in scholarship
money from the Salt Lake Olympic Committee to attend college in the
United States.
	   SLOC spokesman Frank Zang said Wednesday the scholarship was not
a payoff to make sure Salt Lake won the Olympic bid.
	   ``The bid committee never intended for this to be perceived as a
bribe and it was not a necessary action for receiving the Olympic
Games,'' Zang said. ``Instead it was an opportunity for the bid
committee to have an outreach program with national Olympic
committees.''
	   Essomba is related to Rene Essomba of Cameroon, a medical doctor
and president of the Cameroon National Olympic Committee since
1972. He died this year at 66.
	   Zang said a handful of international students attended school in
Utah and other colleges in the United States on the bid committee's
scholarship program. He was not sure exactly how many participated,
nor if any other IOC relatives participated in the program.
	   He said the program was funded by private contributors who knew
how the funds were going to be used. Participants in the
scholarship program were chosen by various National Olympic
Committees.
	   Essomba's participation in the program came to light when
KTVX-TV obtained a copy of a September 1996 letter from Dave
Johnson, a SLOC senior vice president, to Essomba. The letter
notified her that, following Salt Lake landing the Games in June
1995, SLOC was ending the scholarship program.
	   ``Under the current budget structure, it will be difficult to
continue the scholarship program with you,'' the letter read. ``The
enclosed check for dlrs 10,114.99 will have to be our last payment
for tuition.''
	   Zang said the letter obtained by the television station was an
unsigned draft. Although he did not deny the letter's authenticity,
he said the committee no longer has any record of the letter.
	   The scholarship program was scrapped during the transition from
a bid committee to an organizing committee. The letter terminating
the scholarship was sent after Salt Lake had won the bid.
	   The committee has since restructured its educational programs,
and Zang said the only scholarship program now is targeted at
Utah's high school Class of 2002.

Chile expels Spaniards who lied about kidnapping by Pinochet
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) _ A Spanish economist and his daughter who
sparked nationwide alarm by telling their family in a bogus e-mail
that they were kidnapped by supporters of former dictator Gen.
Augusto Pinochet were expelled from Chile on Wednesday, authorities
said.
	   The government said Gonzalo Fernandez de Cordoba and his
23-year-old daughter, Ana _ who had been traveling in Chile as
tourists _ must leave the country immediately.
	   News of the potential kidnapping broke Tuesday when two of
Fernandez's other daughters reported receiving an e-mail message
which read ``we are being held until Wednesday, when the ruling in
London on Sen. Augusto Pinochet will be announced.''
	   The elder Fernandez and Ana Fernandez admitted later in the day,
after police and the Spanish embassy became involved, that the
e-mail on the kidnapping had been a joke.
	   Fernandez called it ``a stupid idea'' in retrospect.
	   The alleged kidnapping had increased already stressed tensions
in Chile in the wake of Pinochet's Oct. 16 arrest in London on a
Spanish warrant for genocide, torture and murder charges. Several
incidents of violence against Spaniards have been reported.
	   Britain's highest court ruled Wednesday Pinochet's status as a
head of state did not afford him immunity from the Spanish charges
against him, thus paving the way for a trial on the Spanish
extradition request.
	   The expulsion order canceled Fernandez's plans for a family
reunion in Chile for the holidays. He and his daughter had entered
Chile last Friday as tourists from neighboring Bolivia.

Talks canceled; season again in jeopardy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Wednesday's developments &QL; 
 &UR; By CHRIS SHERIDAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Basketball Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ No talks this weekend. No basketball next month.
No end in sight to the National Basketball Association lockout.
	   Nothing but bad news emerged Wednesday from the most damaging
labor dispute in league history as the sides canceled a weekend
negotiating session.
	   Charging the union with reneging on its word, the league said
there was no point in talking. It was an ominous sign that mistrust
is building and the cancellation of the entire 1998-99 season is
again a possibility.
	   ``Where we are right now, given what's happened in the past few
days, we don't feel any useful purpose can be served by meeting
right now,'' said Jeffrey Mishkin, chief legal officer for the NBA.
	   Talks had been scheduled to resume Saturday with full
negotiating committees representing owners and players. Union
director Billy Hunter said his side was preparing for a marathon
session extending into Sunday and Monday.
	   Instead, it'll be yet another weekend of inactivity.
	   The first two months of the season are gone, players have lost
more than dlrs 300 million in salaries, and the league is risking
alienation of a fan base that is learning to live without NBA
basketball.
	   ``We're trying to analyze why they would do what they've done at
this late stage,'' Hunter said. ``The only conclusion I can arrive
at is that they're trying to play head games or mind games with our
players. It's sort of a whipsaw. You get the players' expectations
up, then you snatch the rug out.''
	   The latest dispute centers on the details of an agreement made
Friday in a 9 1/2-hour negotiating session, as well as comments
made by a union attorney earlier this week that certain rules
changes the league is seeking are a ``deal-killer.''
	   In a letter sent to Hunter by deputy commissioner Russ Granik,
the league said there was no point in resuming talks unless the
union:
	   _ agreed to the league's version of the disputed details of a
``backup tax'' that would supplement any funds collected from
players' paychecks under a previously agreed upon ``escrow tax.''
	   _ rescinded comments made by attorney Jeffrey Kessler stating
that the league's proposed changes to free agency signing rules are
unacceptable.
	   _ agreed to be flexible on its demand for 57 percent of
revenues.
	   The union saw those as unacceptable preconditions.
	   ``I don't think they are negotiating in good faith,'' Hunter
said.
	   The sides first found themselves at odds early this week when
Kessler said the union would never accept changes to the so-called
timing rules that allow teams to use the ``Larry Bird exception''
to exceed the salary cap.
	   ``It's ludicrous. It negates free agency,'' Hunter said.
	   On Tuesday, they argued over the details of a new spending
restraint _ a ``backup tax'' that was put on the table Friday
night. The owners said the players agreed to a 200 percent tax on
the top-spending teams; the union said it did not agree to any
specific rate.
	   ``They said `We accept your tax.' That's what they said, in
those words,'' Mishkin said. ``We can't have them saying, `That's
not what we meant.' That makes a mockery of negotiations.''
	   ``That's not what we said,'' Hunter responded. ``Our exact words
were, `We agree to your framework.' ''
	   By all indications, the lockout will be back on the slow track.
	   Stern has said that if an agreement can't be reached by
mid-December, there may be no way to salvage a season.
	   ``Whether or not he'll do it remains to be seen,'' Hunter said.
``We can make a deal if we want one.''
	   Some details of Friday's talks have begun to emerge. According
to sources involved in the talks who spoke on condition of
anonymity, when the owners moved on their desired percentage from
50 to 52, 52 1/2 and 53 percent (in years 4, 5 and 6 of a six-year
deal, and perhaps 53 1/2 in a seventh year), they did so with five
conditions that they said the union had to accept:
	   _ an absolute maximum salary based upon a percentage of the
salary cap;
	   _ a three-year rookie scale with an option for a fourth year and
a right of first refusal.
	   _ a decrease in the maximum annual raise from 20 percent to 5
percent, or 10 percent for players with the Bird exception.
	   _ changes to the timing rules.
	   _ eliminating the dlrs 25 million annual licensing payment to
the union and incorporating the money into basketball-related
income.

UN police mission to Haiti extended, Russia and China abstain
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The Security Council decided Wednesday to
keep a U.N. civilian police force in Haiti for another year to
continue training the nation's young force, despite objections from
China, Russia and even Haitian lawmakers.
	   Permanent council members Russia and China abstained from the
vote, saying the 1997 resolution that established the U.N. mission
stipulated it would only last for a year _ and it was time for it
to leave.
	   They also accused the council of wielding a double standard in
authorizing peacekeeping missions around the world _ a vague
reference to their complaints that the United States has used the
United Nations to achieve its own goals in the Caribbean nation.
	   ``We do not see how the situation in this country differs from
many developing countries which are also encountering drastic
problems in the areas of the establishment democracy, economic
development and the struggle with galloping crime,'' the deputy
Russian ambassador, Yuriy Fedotov, told the council.
	   Haitian lawmakers say the international troops should be
replaced by Haitian instructors. They passed a law in August
ordering the withdrawal of all foreign armed forces from Haiti.
	   The civilian police force replaced a 1,300-member U.N.
peacekeeping force that had been in Haiti since 1995. The
peacekeepers in turn had replaced an American force that entered
the country in September 1994, removing a military junta and
re-installing Jean-Bertrand Aristide as president.
	   Aristide had been elected president in 1990 but was arrested and
expelled nine months later.
	   The U.N. civilian force was sent to train and professionalize
Haiti's national police force, which was established in 1995 to
replace a corrupt and brutal army that killed as many as 4,000
civilians before the U.S. intervention.
	   While most council members and even Haitians acknowledge the
U.N. force has done a good job _ and that more police training is
necessary _ many thought the mandate would last only the one year.
	   Several council members noted that the original resolution
setting up the force stipulated that it would transfer its
authority to U.N. agencies such as the U.N. Development Program if
it didn't complete its task within the one-year timeframe.
	   Others, however, noted that because of the continued political
instability in Haiti, which hasn't had a prime minister for over a
year, a continued police presence was necessary.
	   Though President Rene Preval accepted the August law calling for
the withdrawal of all foreign forces, he nevertheless asked for an
extension of the police mandate, but left the duration up to the
council.
	   Russia and China have long resisted a U.N. peacekeeping presence
in Haiti, and Beijing threatened to veto the resolution
establishing the civilian force last year. China objects to Haiti's
diplomatic relations with Taiwan, which the Beijing government
considers a renegade province.
	   Both also say the Haitian situation doesn't threaten the region.

	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ Reigning champions Yulia Obertas and
Dmitry Palamarchuk of Ukraine defended their title Wednesday in the
pairs competition at the world junior figure skating championships.
	   Obertas, 14, and Palamarchuk, 18, collected the best score in
the short program, which makes up 30 percent of the final tally,
and then repeated that feat with a near-flawless display in the
free skating, which accounted for the remaining 70 percent.
	   Skating to the music of The Legend of Jessy James and The
Virginians, the back-to-back champions outshined their rivals in a
competition where couples try to express, through a pattern of
unified moves and steps including lifts, a feeling of harmony and
teamwork.
	   They also recieved dlrs 16,500 in prize money.
	   Americans Laura Handy, 18, and Paul Binnebose, 21, came in
second, matching their position in the short program. The Russian
couple, Victoria Maxiuta and Vladislav Zhonirsky, who led the
junoir Grand Prix curcuit after eight events this season, jumped
forward two places to land third.
	   A delay in the skating was forced during the first heat, when
Artem Knyazev of Uzbekistan clipped a panel off from the side wall
and spiked his partner, Irina Shabanov, as he was falling. Irina
was carried off to receive several stitches and the couple were
forced to retire.
	   American Tiffany Steigler, 14, and her brother Johnnie, 16, who
are coached by 12-time world and three-time Olympic pairs champion,
Irina Rodnina, also jumped two places forward to finish fourth.
	   In the ladies qualifying, Daria Timoshenko of Russia finished
atop of Group B, followed by compatriot, Viktoria Volchkova, and
Julia Sebestyen of Hungary.
	   American Sarah Hughes, 13, finished atop of Group B, followed by
Sabina Wojtala of Poland and Russian Irina Nikolaeva, the current
leader of the junior Grand Prix.
	   The men's title will be decided after their free skating program
Thursday. The original dances are also scheduled Thursday.

Maradona off to Italy seeking compensation for drug test error
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CLARIFIES that Maradona suspicion of revenge related to his
1991 suspension and tightens.

<TEXT>
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ Diego Maradona will demand
financial compensation for an erroneous drug test taken during his
playing days in Italy, his manager said Wednesday.
	   Maradona is expected to fly on Thursday to Italy where he is
scheduled to appear on a popular Italian television program. His
plans could however be complicated by his desire to watch his
former club team play for the league championship on Sunday.
	   Guillermo Coppola told the Buenos Aires sports daily Ole that
Maradona plans to appear before a judge investigating
irregularities at an Italian drug testing facility where he once
tested positive for drug use.
	   As a result, Maradona was suspended from Italian first-division
play for 15 months after the test revealed traces of cocaine in his
backup urine sample.
	   Coppola didn't indicate what day the star planned to make his
court appearance.
	   He said the 38-year-old star wants some kind of economic
reparation from the Italian Football Federation if it's proven that
the Acqua Acetosa laboratory where his drug test results were
processed is at fault. It's not known how much money he is seeking.
	   The Italian lab has come under intense scrutiny recently and was
blamed for mishandling drug tests and documentation of their
results. It closed last month.
	   A confessed cocaine addict, Maradona has always maintained his
innocence in the 1991 suspension, saying he often took his own
private tests before matches. He charged the suspension was revenge
for Argentina's 1990 World Cup victory over Italy.
	   Maradona was suspended a second time in 1994 for another 15
months after tesing positive for stimulant use during the 1994
World Cup in the United States.

Baggio stars in Inter win over Real; Barcelona out after 3-3
</HEADLINE>
thriller with Man U &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: ADDS quotes, more detail &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT MILLWARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Roberto Baggio came off the bench to fire two
goals in the last four minutes Wednesday lifting Inter Milan to a
3-1 victory over defending titlist Real Madrid in the Champions Cup
and reviving his club's title hopes of a first title in the
competition since 1965.
	   The veteran striker entered the game 22 minutes from the end
with the score tied 1-1 and Inter looking in danger of going out.
	   He edged Inter in front four minutes from the end and the
brought the 80,000 fans to their feet with a another goal in injury
time as Inter moved to the top of Group C with Real second and
Spartak Moscow third.
	   The result likely saved the job of Inter coach Gigi Simoni. He
has been under fire for months and club owner Massimo Moratti had
demanded a victory Wednesday.
	   ``We were well prepared. Luckily, we managed to win this
important game,'' Baggio said.
	   In the other Group C game, Spartak was surprisingly held 0-0 at
home by Sturm Graz, the Austrian team gaining its first point after
four losses.
	   On a night of amazing soccer and scores, Barcelona and
Manchester United fought out another 3-3 tie _ the same scoreline
they had at Old Trafford _ and the Spanish soccer giant dropped out
of the competition.
	   Rivaldo scored two goals and hit the crossbar from 30 meters and
Tobagan striker Dwight Yorke netted two for the Reds who fell
behind to Sonny Anderson after 50 seconds of a game which was a
great advert for attacking soccer.
	   But Barcelona's Camp Lou likely will be the venue for the final
in the Catalan club's centenary year and the fact that it is out of
the competition so early will be a great disappointment to its many
thousands of fans.
	   The tie meant that United lost the Group D standings lead to
Bayern Munich which easily downed Denmark's Brondby 2-0 with goals
by Carsten Janker and Mario Basler.
	   Bayern and United must meet at United's Old Trafford in two
weeks to see who finishes top even though both are likely to
qualify anyway. The six group winners and best two runners up make
it to the last eight.
	   ``We don't care if Manchester won or drew, we still have to
travel to Manchester with the intention of winning,'' said Bayern
coach Ottmar Hitzfeld.
	   English titlist Arsenal went out after a 1-0 flop to French
titlist Lens at Wembley in Group E, and Ajax Amsterdam surprisingly
lost 1-0 at home to last place Croatia Zagreb in Group A and is in
danger of going out too.
	   Dynamo Kiev came from behind to beat group leader Panathinaikos
2-1 and will go to Lens to decide who tops the group. Both teams
have eight points, two more than Panathinaikos.
	   With Ajax losing, Greek titlist Olympiakos went to the top of
Group A with a 2-1 victory over Portugal's FC Porto with goals from
Sinisa Gogic and Predrag Djordjevic.
	   German champion Kaiserlautern suffered its first defeat, a 2-1
loss at Benfica but still looks almost certain to make it to the
last eight. Kaiserslautern still has a three point lead in the
Group F standings and needs a draw at home to HJK Helsinki in two
weeks to guarantee top place.
	   Three goals by the leading scorer in Dutch soccer, Ruud Van
Nistelrooij, gave last place PSV Eindhoven a 3-1 win at HJK
Helsinki in Finland in the other Group F game.
	   Norway's Rosenborg moved to the top of Group B by beating
Athletic Bilbao 2-1. The Norwegians replace Galatasaray because the
Turkish club's game against Juventus was postponed a week because
of an ongoing political conflict between Turkey and Italy.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   LONDON (AP) _ Gen. Augusto Pinochet lost a court bid for
immunity from arrest Wednesday, leaving a British Cabinet minister
to decide whether Spain can start trying to extradite the former
Chilean dictator on charges of genocide and torture. By a 3-2 vote,
Britain's highest court ruled, in the words of Lord Justice Johan
Steyn, that Pinochet's alleged crimes were no more part of a head
of state's functions than ``murdering his gardener or arranging the
torture of his opponents for the sheer spectacle of it.'' Hhuman
rights organizations declared that the ruling told dictators
everywhere that there is no hiding place. Pinochet, under police
guard at a north London hospital, learned the news on his 83rd
birthday. (BRITAIN-PINOCHET).
	   ANKARA, Turkey _ Turkey's president began trying to construct a
new government Wednesday but the pieces do not fit neatly:
pro-Islamic forces pressing for power and their military-backed,
Western-style opponents struggling to unite. President Suleyman
Demirel opened talks with party leaders just hours after the
corruption-tainted coalition of Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz lost a
confidence vote in parliament. It was Turkey's fourth government to
collapse since 1995. Demirel's agenda clearly showed the potential
difficulties ahead in a nation with a growing Islamic movement but
a fiercely protected tradition of Western and secular principles.
(TURKEY-POLITICS)
	   ROME (AP) _ Communist lawmakers revealed Wednesday that they
escorted the fugitive chief of Turkey's Kurdish rebels to Italy,
helping in a search for haven that has badly hurt relations between
the two countries. The stunning disclosure came after numerous
reports _ denied by the government _ that Abdullah Ocalan had a
secret deal paving his way to Italy. Ocalan requested asylum in
Italy on Nov. 12, the day he arrived in Rome from Moscow on a false
passport and was arrested at the airport on a Turkish warrant.
Turkey protested when a Rome court freed Ocalan a week later under
a law forbidding extradition of suspects to countries where they
could face the death penalty, as Ocalan does in Turkey.
(ITALY-KURDS)
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ In an effort to save his crumbling
coalition and broaden support for peace, Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu struck a tentative deal Wednesday to bring David Levy, a
moderate deserter, back into his hard-line Cabinet. Staunch
right-wingers who oppose ceding war-captured land to the
Palestinians have been threatening to leave Netanyahu's government
over the latest land-for-security agreement with the Palestinians.
Such a move would leave Netanyahu without a parliamentary majority
and thus vulnerable in no-confidence motions. (ISRAEL-POLITICS)
	   PONTIAC, Michigan (AP) _ Assisted-suicide and euthanasia
crusader Jack Kevorkian was charged with first-degree murder
Wednesday for administering lethal drugs to a terminally ill man
who wanted his own death, which was shown on national television.
The Michigan physician, who had said he wanted to be charged in the
death so that his case could test the constitutionality of
anti-euthanasia laws, arrived smiling at a police station for his
arraignmnent. He was released on a dlrs 750,000 personal bond.
Thomas Youk, who suffered from Lou Gehrig's disease, was seen on a
videotape seeking Kevorkian's help in dying. (US-SUICIDE DOCTOR)

Brooks, Mohamed Al Fayed, Christian Slater, and the New York City
Ballet's 50th anniversary. Some items have moved as separates. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Breaking seven years of silence, Michael J. Fox
revealed he has Parkinson's disease.
	   ``It's not that I had a deep, dark secret,'' the 37-year-old
actor, best known for his roles in the ``Back to the Future''
movies and the old sitcom ``Family Ties,'' reveals in the Dec. 7
issue of People magazine. ``It was just my thing to deal with.''
	   By talking about the incurable disease Fox feels he can help
himself, his family _ he's married to actress Tracy Pollan, 38, and
they have a 9-year-old son and 3-year-old twin daughters _ and
other sufferers of the disease.
	   Parkinson's disease, a degenerative neurological disorder,
destroys brain cells that produce dopamine, a chemical important
for movement. Symptoms include muscle stiffening, tremors and
difficulty moving.
	   Fox, who currently stars on the television sitcom ``Spin City,''
says he was diagnosed in 1991 after noticing a ``twitch'' in his
left pinkie while on the set of the film ``Doc Hollywood.''
	   Over the next few years, the disease progressed, and his entire
left side suffered from stiffness and tremors. ``And I mean big
tremors,'' says Fox. He says he suffered a shaking of his left arm
so violent, ``I could mix a margarita in five seconds.''
	   ___
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Chelsea Clinton suffered stress-related symptoms
after splitting up with her boyfriend of several months, the New
York Post reported Wednesday.
	   Miss Clinton, a sophomore at Stanford University, broke up with
Matthew Pierce about a week ago, the newspaper said, citing
anonymous sources.
	   The students were first reported as an item in May. Pierce, a
religious studies major and member of the Stanford swim team,
attended church and had lunch with the president and first lady
during a visit to the campus last year.
	   The Post reported that the first daughter visited the
university's health center this week because of stress-related
symptoms, saying she had just ended a long-term relationship and
wasn't adjusting well.
	   Stanford officials declined to comment, the Post said. Mrs.
Clinton's spokeswoman, Marsha Berry, said she would not comment on
``tabloid reports.''
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   NASHVILLE, Tennessee (AP) _ First-week sales of the new Garth
Brooks album broke records set by the rock band Pearl Jam and
singer Whitney Houston.
	   ``Garth Brooks Double Live'' sold 1,085,373 copies during the
week following its Nov. 17 release, Bill Kennedy of Capitol
Nashville said Wednesday.
	   Pearl Jam set the previous record for a debut week, when the
Seattle rock band sold 950,378 of ``Vs.'' in 1993. Houston
previously held the record for albums sold in any week, set in 1992
by the soundtrack to ``The Bodyguard'' with sales of 1,061,000.
	   Brooks, 36, more than doubled the sales of his closest
competitor for the week, Method Man, who sold 410,871 of his album
``Tical.''
	   He has sold more than 83 million albums during his career.
	    &UR; ___
	   BALTIMORE (AP) _ Mohamed Al Fayed, whose son, Dodi, was killed
with Princess Diana in a Paris car crash, was reported in good
condition after undergoing a checkup at Johns Hopkins Hospital.
	   Al Fayed, whose holdings include Harrods department store in
London, was in the hospital for a regular checkup, said Al Fayed's
spokesman in London, Laurie Mayer.
	   ``It's something he has done every six months and takes a few
days,'' Mayer said. ``He went to Baltimore a couple of days ago.''
	   The wealthy Egyptian native has lived for more than three
decades in Britain, where he owns a Scottish castle and a 500-acre
(200-hectare) country estate.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Actor Christian Slater urges moviegoers not to
confuse his role in ``Very Bad Things'' with his own sometimes
troubled life.
	   ``Let's not read too much into that,'' he told the New York Post
in a story published Wednesday. ``Remember this is show business,
and these are the parts I'm playing.''
	   He calls ``Very Bad Things,'' a black comedy that opened
Wednesday, ``a great opportunity to play the kind of maniac that I
love to play.''
	   The 29-year-old actor also said he's on an upswing after being
sentenced to three months in a minimum security prison following a
bout with alcohol and cocaine. The prison time followed earlier
arrests for carrying a gun on a plane and drunken driving.
	   ``Drugs and alcohol aren't a good way to go, and guns are
stupid,'' he said.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Glory of the past and present shared the stage
as the New York City Ballet celebrated its 50th anniversary by
re-creating its first program from Oct. 11, 1948.
	   At the end of Tuesday night's performance at the New York State
Theater, 250 former dancers took the stage amid a cascade of gold
flakes, including Maria Tallchief who danced Eurydice in
``Orpheus'' on the 1948 opening.
	   The evening honored Tanaquil Le Clercq, who had danced the
second adagio movement, of ``Symphony in C'' at the 1948 opening.
She watched the program from a wheelchair. She contracted polio in
1956 during the company's European tour.
	   Jacques d'Amboise, a much-loved member of the company from 1949
to 1984, hugged former colleagues: Tallchief, Allegra Kent, Suzanne
Farrell, Merrill Ashley, Elise Engels, Mikhail Baryshnikov and
Arthur Mitchell.

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 0000 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The Dow edged higher just before the close
Wednesday, shaking off a second day of profit-taking after Monday's
record-setting rally. Broader stock indexes rose modestly in
predictably light trading before Thanksgiving. The Dow Jones
industrial average rose 13.13 points _ or by 0.1 percent _ at
9,314.28 after slipping as much as 48 points in the morning.
(US-CLOSING STOCKS)
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ OPEC ministers finished meeting
informally late Wednesday, saying only that they would reconvene
the following day at the OPEC Secretariat to begin their formal
session. It was unclear whether a report that Venezuela opposes
extending production cuts was blocking any kind of agreement among
the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries ministers to
combat the worldwide decline in oil prices. Oil ministers departing
after roughly six hours of informal talks declined to comment on
whether an agreement had been reached. (OPEC)
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Confirming week's of speculation,
Hoechst AG said Wednesday that it was in merger talks with France's
Rhone-Poulenc, which if successful would create the world's largest
pharmaceutical firm. An announcement on the outcome was expected as
early as next week, but Hoechst cautioned ``no guarantee can be
made as to the outcome of the current discussions.'' The merged
firm would be worth some 80 billion marks (dlrs 50 billion), and
analysts projected that sales in its pharmaceutical sector would
outstrip market leader Glaxo Wellcome's. Hoechst's annual sales are
estimated at about 22 billion (dlrs 13.75 billion) marks, with
Rhone-Poulenc at 17.5 billion (dlrs 11 billion).
(GERMANY-HOECHST-RHONE POULENC)
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Representatives of the European Union
governments and the European Parliament have agreed to fix the EU's
1999 budget at 96.9 billion European currency units (dlrs 113
billion) _ up 7.7 percent from this year. The deal with the EU
assembly's budget committee was reached late Tuesday. It is
expected to be approved by the full parliament next month. As
always, the biggest slice of spending _ 40.4 billion ecus (dlrs
47.8 billion) - will go to farm spending, mostly subsidies to
guarantee prices for farmers. (EU-BUDGET)
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ The International Monetary Fund
agreed Wednesday to rescue Pakistan's shattered economy from
default, granting a dlrs 5.5 billion bailout package, finance
officials said. Pakistan's economy has been reeling from
international sanctions that followed nuclear tests in May, and

	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ European Union regulators will launch a
four-month probe into the proposed dlrs 10 billion alliance between
British Telecommunications PLC and AT and T Corp., the EU's top
antitrust official said Wednesday. In a news conference, EU
Competition Commissioner Karel Van Miert confirmed comments by EU
officials that the venture would face further scrutiny following
the conclusion next week of an initial four-week inquiry. BT, the
biggest British telephone company and AT and T, the largest U.S.
carrier, announced in July they will combine their international
telephone operations and create a telecommunications network
targeting large corporations across different countries.

	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Michel Camdessus, director-general of the
International Monetary Fund, said Wednesday that the worst of the
global financial crisis is over, a Spanish news agency reported.
Camdessus said it was possible to avoid a global recession,
although the risk hadn't completely disappeared because ``the
treatment has only just started,'' the state-owned news agency EFE
quoted him as saying.	   The IMF chief, addressing a Madrid meeting of Spanish business
leaders, reserved particular praise for what he called Brazil's
``courageous'' three-year economic and financial reform program.

Israel calls for opening of international Holocaust archives
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NICOLAS B. TATRO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel is calling for the opening of
international Holocaust-era archives and has published a list of
repositories that officials say have put obstacles in the way of
researchers.
	   In a letter released this week, Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu's adviser on Diaspora affairs named a dozen archives in
Europe and Russia that ``have refused or have been uncooperative in
sharing information,'' wrote Bobby Brown.
	   ``We appeal to each institution listed to open their files so
that we may learn why civilized society failed in its basic
commitment to ensure the safety, lives, liberty and property of our
people,'' said the Nov. 22 letter addressed to the head of Israel's
delegation to an upcoming Washington conference on Holocaust
assets.
	   The publication of the letter, which did not give details of
non-cooperation, drew fire from a number of the institutions named.
It also attracted critics who questioned whether Israel, itself the
victim of boycotts, should be engaging in issuing black lists.
	   ``Black lists are something that we as a people should shy away
from,'' said Abe Foxman, director of the Anti-Defamation League,
who told The Associated Press the singling out of archives was
``irresponsible and counter-productive.''
	   Officials at some of the archives listed expressed dismay.
	   ``We had an impression that our cooperation with institutions
representing Jewish communities was going on with the satisfaction
of both sides,'' said Daria Nalecz, head of the Polish State
Archives, which was on the list.
	   The controversy arose in advance of a four-day conference on
Holocaust-era assets that will open Monday in Washington, D.C. Some
57 delegations from 44 nations will convene to discuss looted art,
insurance, communal property and the opening of files belonging to
private companies and public agencies.
	   The state institutions named in the letter included the Vatican
archives, the French National Archives, the files of the British
Custodian of Enemy Property, the MI5 intelligence agency and the
central state archives and Prague Jewish Museum in the Czech
Republic.
	   ``We've given them everything they wanted, every single
document,'' Czech Interior Ministry spokesman Jan Decker said,
adding Israel's Yad Vashem Holocaust museum still owed dlrs 4,600
for microfilmed documents that were provided by the Jewish Museum.
	   Brown said the British custodian had allowed historians to look
at World War II-era bank accounts but not records of safe deposit
boxes and that MI5 had not provided all the material from secret
British agencies from that period.
	   In London, a Home Office spokesman said on condition of
anonymity that MI5 was ``currently reviewing its World War II
archive, but to the best of our knowledge there is nothing on MI5
files that is relevant to the Holocaust.''
	   Philippe Delaval, head of the French National Archives, said he
was ``astonished'' the the archives were accused of restricting
access. He said the archive recently welcomed a delegation from the
Holocaust Museum in Washington. Israeli officials said, however,
that the archive would not allow documents to be copied or taken
out of the country.
	   The Vatican, which offered no immediate comment, has been
involved in a long-running dispute with scholars over access to all
its archives. Israeli officials said interest focused in particular
on the documents of Pope Pius XII whose silence during World War II
has been questioned by Jews.
	   ``Jews were not only the victims of murder and robbery, but lost
most of our history, and we need it back,'' Brown said in an
interview. ``All the archives should be open to scholars and
individuals who want to now what happened.''
	   He said the problems were varied and that files were not
available for a variety of reasons: ``some by design, some because
of bureaucracy and some because they do not have enough funding.''
	   Brown said the archives of the former Soviet KGB intelligence
agency and the military archives in Podolsk were effectively closed
while the Federal Archives in Russia charged exorbitant rates to
foreign researchers.
	   Yelena Palshina, who oversees use of documents at the archive in
Moscow said access to documents was free. The archive was forced to
charge one dollar to copy a page however ``because we are very
poor,'' adding the institution got only 40 percent of its budget
from the state.
	   Roni Stauber, an expert on the Holocaust at Tel Aviv University,
said pressure needed to be applied to free up documents but that
the government should not compile black lists or criticize
publicly.
	   ``It's possible that government pressure will not be productive
because it could become a political matter instead of a research
matter,'' he said.

Yeltsin ally calls for early presidential elections

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The call for early presidential elections has now
spread to President Boris Yeltsin's closest parliamentary allies, a
symptom of his increasing political weakness.
	   Alexander Shokhin, leader of the pro-government Our Home is
Russia faction, said Wednesday that presidential and parliamentary
elections should be held simultaneously next September.
	   The next presidential election is not scheduled until the middle
of 2000. The ailing Yeltsin is constitutionally barred from running
for a third term, but has insisted that he will serve out his
current term.
	   Russia's opposition, especially the Communist Party, has long
called for Yeltsin to step down. In recent months, as the economy
has worsened and Yeltsin has fallen ill three times, some prominent
allies or former allies of the president have called for early
elections.
	   ``This is an idea that might assist with constructive reforms in
the country and save money ... simultaneously,'' Shokhin said,
according to the Interfax news agency.
	   In October, the upper house of parliament, which has
consistently supported Yeltsin, voted 79-18 in favor of a
resolution demanding the president's resignation.
	   Yeltsin remained in a Kremlin hospital Wednesday, recuperating
from pneumonia, the latest in a series of illnesses that have
reduced him to a part-time president.
	   His press service said Yeltsin's condition was ``stable.''
	   Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, meanwhile, barreled ahead with
his efforts at tackling Russia's worst economic crisis since the
1991 Soviet collapse, urging ``emergency measures'' Wednesday to
save Russians from the ravages of economic collapse.
	   Primakov, one of the most popular figures in Russian politics
since his appointment in September, insisted again Wednesday that
he would not run for president, even considering the ``latest
developments'' _ presumably referring to Yeltsin's sickness.
	   Primakov spent most of Wednesday talking about the economy. He
said the 1999 budget _ which the Cabinet is due to debate over the
next few days _ would have to include unspecified emergency
measures to cushion economic blows.
	   However, he said the economy had no problems that couldn't be
fixed with help from the state.
	   ``We can't go on waiting for the market environment to solve our
problems,'' the prime minister said. ``In such a difficult
transition, development must progress along a mechanism worked out
in advance.''
	   Later Wednesday, Primakov chaired a meeting of prime ministers
from 12 former Soviet republics seeking to bolster mutual
cooperation at a time when many face deep economic problems _ most
of which stem from Russia's meltdown.
	   Russia's economy, which had begun to grow last year for the
first time since the Soviet collapse, succumbed this year to the
global economic crisis that started in Asia. It crashed in August,
when the Russian government devalued the ruble and effectively
defaulted on its foreign loans.
	   So far, Primakov's Cabinet has been unable to settle on a
budget, and was reportedly divided last week among three rival
versions of the plan. The Finance Ministry submitted a new plan
Wednesday that is intended to address all the Cabinet's concerns,
Interfax said.
	   Also Wednesday, Deputy Finance Minister Mikhail Kasyanov was
quoted as saying that foreign banks had agreed to reschedule dlrs
22.5 billion in Russia's debt to the London Club of creditors. The
two sides began talks Monday in London.

OPEC struggles with oil output cuts
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS &QL; 
 &UR; By DIDI KIRSTEN TATLOW &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ OPEC nations are struggling to find ways
to boost oil prices after hitting snags about extending production
cuts and meeting compliance levels.
	   Ministers of the 11-nation Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries on Wednesday delayed the start of their winter conference
to hold private discussions about price woes.
	   The ministers, after meeting informally for some six hours,
declined comment on whether they had reached an accord. They agreed
to open their formal meeting Thursday morning.
	   Earlier in the day, Venezuelan officials told other OPEC
delegates that they were unable to pledge to extend output cutbacks
introduced in June because of upcoming presidential elections. The
June reductions were put in place in an effort to soak up the oil
glut on the world market and drive crude prices higher.
	   Iran also was a sticking point, delegates said.
	   Iran says it deserves a review of its base production level and
that any further cuts should be made mostly by Saudi Arabia, the
group's biggest producer.
	   Saudi Arabia has drawn ire at the meeting, with some members
complaining the kingdom seized market share after Iraq's departure
from the oil market in 1990 and now won't let go. Iraq has been
barred from exporting crude since its 1990 invasion of fellow OPEC
member, Kuwait.
	   Under a special United Nations program, Iraq is able to sell
limited amounts of oil to earn money for food and other
humanitarian goods.
	   Traders in oil futures markets apparently don't expect much to
result from the meeting.
	   In afternoon trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange, prices
of sweet crude for delivery in January reached a low of dlrs 11.63
a barrel, nearing its 12-year low of dlrs 11.42 set in June.
	   OPEC's average oil price has been cut nearly in half over the
past year because of a global oil glut brought on by its ill-timed
decision last winter to boost production, coinciding with Asia's
economic crisis and falling demand.
	   Analysts said only fresh production cuts would raise the low
prices that are making gasoline cheap for consumers, but are
hurting economies in OPEC countries.
	   Kuwait, which says its 1998 oil revenue will sink by 45 percent,
favors new output reductions as do Algeria and Libya.
	   That probably won't happen, however.
	   Saudi Arabia believes further trims _ in addition to reductions
agreed to in June _ would be premature. It wants OPEC members to
comply with the overall 2.6 million barrels-a-day cut in June.
	   Saudi Arabia fears additional cuts would reduce the kingdom's
market share if other nations don't stop overproducing. Analysts
say Venezuela, Iran and Indonesia are not in compliance with the
earlier agreement.
	   A possible outcome of the OPEC meeting is a decision to extend
June's cuts beyond the initial one year, to the end of 1999.
	   Analysts said that's the bare minimum the group could do to
prevent a price rout.
	   But Saudi Arabia's fear of losing market share to overproducers
in the group may immobilize the organization, they said.
	   ``It's a mess, as ever,'' said Leo Drollas, chief economist at
London's Center for Global Energy Studies.
	   OPEC's average price has crashed dlrs 8.22 per barrel from dlrs
18.81 last November to dlrs 10.59, according to the last available
average price.
	   Reflecting the sense of crisis, Algeria's oil minister Youcef
Yousfi called this week for a special meeting of heads of state of
OPEC members, saying the ``price crisis'' must be addressed at the
very top.
	   OPEC members are: Algeria, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya,
Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and
Venezuela.

With Ocalan case, debate over Turkish death penalty renews
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SUZAN FRASER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Turkish judges traditionally snap their
pencils in two after issuing a death sentence, symbolizing the
severity of the ruling and the hope for a more peaceful society.
	   But no inmate has been put to death in Turkey since 1984,
although prosecutors routinely demand the death penalty and judges
continue to order executions.
	   Now, an increasingly bitter fight with Italy over the failure to
extradite Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan _ who could face the
gallows in Turkey _ has sparked a debate over whether to kill off
capital punishment entirely.
	   Italy refuses to extradite anyone to a country where they could
face the death penalty. Ocalan, who is being tried in absentia for
capital crimes, was arrested in Rome on Nov 12 and later asked for
political asylum.
	   Some have suggested Turkey agree not to apply the death penalty
in his case, to clear the way for his extradition.
	   Others want it abolished outright.
	   ``The death penalty has to be removed from our legal system.
Then, we can easily press for (Ocalan's) return,'' said Deputy
Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit, a strong opponent of the death
penalty. ``Those who oppose it, will have to bear the
responsibility of allowing such criminals to walk free.''
	   The government rushed out a draft bill to lift the death penalty
in a bid to have Ocalan extradited, but the effort foundered after
failing to get support even within the cabinet.
	   President Suleyman Demirel said there was no public consensus to
lift the death penalty _ which covers murder, starting a forest
fire and crimes relating to terrorism and separatism.
	   ``We cannot make changes to our laws without thinking it
through, just for one person,'' said former Prime Minister Tansu
Ciller who leads the opposition True Path Party.
	   Some even suggested lifting the death penalty long enough to get
Ocalan back _ and then reintroducing it to hang him.
	   ``They won't give us back Apo anyway,'' said Sahin Gurgin, a
taxi driver in referring to Ocalan by his nickname. ``So why should
we lift the death penalty and make terrorists believe its okay to
kill people?''
	   Some critics claim keeping the death penalty only serves to hurt
Turkey's relations with the European Union, where opposition to
capital punishment is nearly universal. Turkey, which aspires to
join the EU one day, also faces accusations of widespread human
rights violations.
	   Parliament has to approve death sentences before they are
executed. There are currently 35 inmates on death row: three
convicted of Kurdish separatism and five on charges of plotting a
communist overthrow of the state.
	   Widespread revulsion over some executions _ especially of young
men _ carried out after a military coup in 1980 has led to a de
facto freeze on the death penalty.
	   ``We haven't looked at any death penalty cases for such a long
time that we have forgotten what the procedure is,'' said Emin
Karaag, who heads the parliamentary justice commission that must
approve the sentences before sending them for to the general
assembly.
	   Turkish public opinion has never welcomed the idea of lifting
the death penalty entirely.
	   Three separate initiatives by the independent Human Rights
Association to launch an anti-death penalty campaign failed in
their early stages.

More riots in Indonesia? Church burnings? Serial murders? Blame

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ In one popular student poster, an
image of former President Suharto in a black ski mask glares
menacingly. A tabloid newspaper shows an old snapshot of him posing
with a rifle. ``Suharto plays sniper,'' the caption reads.
	   These days, the 77-year-old former army general is a handy
villain for many Indonesians. They blame Suharto for any or all of
their woes: murders of Muslim preachers, attacks on Christian
churches, looting in the capital, Jakarta.
	   The longtime authoritarian leader was ousted by riots and
protests in May, but his shadow still looms over this turbulent
Southeast Asian nation of 202 million people.
	   By most accounts, he is holed up in a heavily guarded two-story
home in a leafy Jakarta neighborhood. Ties with his successor and
former protege, President B.J. Habibie, are said to be strained.
	   Security forces on Wednesday again blocked hundreds of
Indonesian students from marching on Suharto's home to press
demands that be tried for corruption and human rights abuses. There
were no reports of arrests or injuries.
	   No one has proof, but many critics speculate that Suharto is
orchestrating unrest with the aid of military allies to distract
attention from a corruption investigation of his family.
	   ``He's got unlimited economic resources. He can buy power even
though he's not in power,'' said Hendrajit, a researcher at the
Institute for Strategic Studies of Indonesia, a private think-tank.
	   Habibie has promised to dismantle Suharto's rigid political
system, but students dismiss him as a stooge from the old days. His
government is filled with Suharto holdovers.
	   Public eagerness to point a finger at Suharto escalated several
months ago, after as many as 200 mysterious killings at the eastern
end of the main island of Java.
	   Many victims were Muslim preachers and people said to be black
magic sorcerers. Villagers said the assassins, labeled ``ninjas,''
dressed in black clothing. Fear spread through town after town, and
vigilantes lynched dozens of suspected killers.
	   ``I think I am not far from the truth in saying that Suharto's
hands are behind the killings,'' opposition leader Amien Rais told
foreign reporters earlier this month. He offered no evidence.
	   Pasted on a wall during a student protest, a poster depicting
Suharto in a ski mask implies he is a murderer. ``Is Suharto a
ninja?'' reads a scrawled slogan.
	   Suharto rarely appears in public, and has yet to comment on the
accusations against him.
	   Conspiracy theories flourish about recent violence in Jakarta,
including deadly clashes Nov. 13 between anti-government students
and soldiers, and attacks by Muslim mobs on Christian churches on
Sunday. A total of 31 people died.
	   Popular conjecture holds that the tainted military, possibly
with backing from Suharto, engineered much of the unrest to show it
is an indispensable guardian of order.
	   ``One objective is to show that people still need'' the
military, said Hotasi Nababan of the civic Indonesian Professional
Society for Reform.
	   The accusations are not without some official foundation. A
government fact-finding team concluded members of the military
instigated deadly riots in May that led to Suharto's downfall. One
suspect mentioned was former Lt. Gen Prabowo Subianto, a son-in-law
of Suharto.
	   Critics speculated then that military hard-liners provoked the
riots because they wanted an excuse to crack down on dissidents, a
charge that the military has vehemently denied.
	   While unrest rumors fly, one political scientist noted that
Suharto himself was not averse to scapegoating. Long after crushing
leftist foes in the 1960s, he tried to discredit opponents by
declaring them communist masterminds.

Sampras impressive again as he beats Moya

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HANOVER, Germany (AP) _ Although he is getting some friendly
help, the way Pete Sampras is playing he doesn't need it.
	   Two quick and impressive victories have put Sampras into the
semifinals of the ATP World Championship, the elite season-ending
tournament that brings together the top eight players of the year.
	   Sampras is now closer to establishing a tennis landmark by
becoming he first man to finish as No. 1 in final season standings
for six years in a row.
	   ``It's certainly a good feeling to be here over the weekend,''
Sampras said after crushing Carlos Moya 6-3, 6-3 on Wednesday.
	   Marcelo Rios, the only player who can threaten Sampras for the
No. 1 spot, is nursing a back injury and lost his first round-robin
match, to Tim Henman. Rios had a day off Wednesday and will play
Greg Rusedski on Thursday.
	   Rusedski replaced Andre Agassi, who dropped out with a back
injury.
	   Agassi retired in his match against Alex Corretja, who was ahead
5-7, 6-3, 2-1.
	   Yevgeny Kafelnikov remained in the running for a place in the
semifinals with a 6-7 (3-7), 6-3, 6-2 victory over Karol Kucera.
	   Rios trails Sampras by 33 points in the computer rankings and
has to do better than the American in the tournament to have a shot
at No. 1. He must win his next two round-robin matches.
	   ``I'm also helping myself by winning. I can't really be too
concerned about what Marcelo is doing,'' Sampras said.
	   ``I have to concentrate on my matches. If I take care of things
myself and go out and win, then it should be hopefully good enough.
But I must admit I was rooting for the Englishman (Henman)
yesterday,'' Sampras said.
	   Last year, Moya had upset Sampras in a group match, but Sampras
went on to capture the dlrs 3.5 million event for the fourth time.
	   ``Last year I must admit I felt a little flat. This year, with
the ranking up for grabs, I just made a concerted effort to come
here a little bit early and prepare as best as I can.
	   ``It's obviously a very big week for Marcelo and I. I just
wanted to give myself the best chance possible to play well here,''
said Sampras, who fired 13 aces.
	   Sampras was not even aware that he had clinched a place in the
semis and had to be convinced by reporters and ATP officials that
he had made it.
	   The way he is playing, he should not have any worries anyway.
	   ``It's not easy to play well like I have been today and
yesterday. I was coming into today's match pretty confident,''
Sampras said. ``I wanted to make sure I was coming in a little bit
more than last year, chipping and charging, trying to put as much
pressure on him as possible.''
	   The eight players are split into two groups and Sampras and Rios
cannot meet before the semifinals.
	   Also Thursday, Corretja played Henman and Sampras battled
Kucera.

Vaughn gets dlrs 80 million, six-year deal from Angels
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with announcement &QL; 
 &UR; By RONALD BLUM &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Mo Vaughn is leapfrogging Mike Piazza to become
the highest-paid player in U.S. Major League Baseball.
	   Vaughn, one of the most powerful left-handed hitters, agreed
Wednesday to an dlrs 80 million, six-year contract with the Anaheim
Angels.
	   Vaughn's new deal, which includes a club option for 2005, has an
average annual value of dlrs 13.33 million, topping the dlrs 13
million Piazza will average under his new dlrs 91 million,
seven-year contract with the New York Mets. Piazza, however, still
has the contract with the most total guaranteed dollars.
	   If the option is exercised, Vaughn's deal would be worth dlrs 92
million over seven seasons.
	   ``The signing of Mo Vaughn is an extraordinary event for our
ballclub,'' Angels manager Terry Collins said. ``Mo is one of those
rare individuals whose presence will have a profound effect on the
players, the organizations and this community. Our ownership has
established its desire to take this team to the next level, and Mo
is the type of individual who relishes that challenge.''
	   The first baseman, who turns 31 next month, hit .337 this year
with 40 homers and 115 RBIs, making dlrs 6.6 million. He had been
negotiating off and on with the Red Sox for the past year, but
Boston ended talks Nov. 11 after Vaughn rejected a dlrs 62.5
million, five-year offer.
	   Vaughn, who lives outside Boston in Easton, Mass., had been with
the Red Sox organization since he started his professional career
in 1989.
	   With the addition of Vaughn, Anaheim anticipates moving Darin
Erstad from first base to the outfield. It's unlikely Erstad or Tim
Salmon will be traded, leaving center fielder Jim Edmonds or right
fielder Garret Anderson likely to be swapped for a pitcher. Edmonds
has been the subject of trade rumors for some time.

Vajpayee calls allies to discuss possible defeat in state
</HEADLINE>
elections &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ With exit polls predicting a humiliating
defeat for his Hindu nationalist party in provincial elections,
Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee has called a meeting of his
political allies.
	   Asked if the forecast result to Wednesday's elections would
prompt national midterm elections, the prime minister said state
results should not affect his government _ but acknowledged calling
the political summit.
	   ``The present political situation is pregnant with many
possibilities and the coordination committee of the Bharatiya
Janata Party and its allies will meet immediately after the results
of the assembly elections are announced,'' Vajpayee told reporters
in Lucknow, the capital of Uttar Pradesh state.
	   The elections were the first political test since Vajpayee's
shaky 19-party coalition government took office eight months ago.
	   Millions of people voted in elections held in four states, New
Delhi, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Mizoram. Counting of votes
will begin Saturday and final results are expected Sunday.
	   Exit polls at the end of of 10-hour voting on Wednesday
predicted that the BJP would lose its strongholds of New Delhi and
Rajasthan states to a resurgent Congress Party led by Sonia Gandhi.
The Congress Party is expected to lose power in Madhya Pradesh to
the BJP and Mizoram state to regional parties.
	   The BJP was dismissive of exit polls.
	   ``Sometimes these have gone completely wrong, sometimes they
have proved correct,'' said spokesman Venkaiah Naidu in New Delhi.
	   But the Congress Party was delighted at the predictions. ``It is
more or less in line with our expectations,'' said Anil Shastri,
the party spokesman.
	   Violence marred voting in at least one state. Three people were
killed and 16 wounded in a gun fight between political rivals in a
rural area of Madhya Pradesh in central India, Press Trust of India
reported. Voting was peaceful in the other three states.
	   Nearly 58 percent of more than 80 million electorates voted in
four of India's 26 states where elections were held Wednesday. The
key issues during the election campaign turned out to be shortages
of onion, edible oil, electricity and water.
	   A massive shortage of onion and 700 percent rise in its price
since September because of heavy monsoon floods became a powerful
symbol of protest for opposition ranks.
	   The exit polls were conducted by the private Center for Media
Studies and the state television, Doordarshan.

Busload of German tourists robbed in Jamaica
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) _ Muggers robbed a busload of 18 German
tourists as they stopped to take pictures in the northeast Jamaican
town of Port Maria, police said.
	   The chartered bus was carrying the visitors from the town of
Port Antonio to the Ocho Rios resort area Wednesday and had stopped
on a quiet road.
	   Two men armed with knives and another with a gun burst into the
bus, forced the driver to leave his seat, then drove the bus a
short distance away and forced the tourists to hand over their
valuables.
	   Police said the 18 visitors lost dlrs 5,000, an undetermined
amount of Jamaican currency, 10 cameras, eight watches, ten
bracelets and six necklaces. The robbers then fled with the loot.
Nobody was hurt, police said.

Pricey, unproven drug is latest elixir to thwart aging
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo NY346 &QL; 
 &UR; By LISI de BOURBON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Adrienne Denese, a doctor on New York's's
wealthy Upper East Side, has skin as flawless as porcelain and a
body as tight as a drum. In fact, the forty-something blonde could
easily pass for someone in her 20s.
	   Her secret? Regular doses of human growth hormone, she says,
along with exercise and a good diet. She started taking the drug
more than a year ago and now prescribes it for about 100 patients.
	   ``I don't have to talk anybody into it,'' says Denese, a
specialist in rehabilitative therapy, whose patients pay hundreds
of dollars a week for the treatment.
	   For those with a disposable income, human growth hormone, or
hGH, is the latest weapon in a growing arsenal to combat aging. But
while some doctors such as Denese promote it as the latest youth
elixir, others warn that there's been too little research and the
drug could be a risky, high-priced fraud.
	   The National Institute on Aging, an arm of the federal National
Institutes of Health, said in a report on hormone therapy last year
that too much hGH can result in diabetes, joint pain, high blood
pressure, swelling and carpal tunnel syndrome. There was no proof
that any supplement worked as an anti-aging remedy, it said.
	   The institute is running clinical trials of hGH, with results
expected in January.
	   Until recently, hGH was taken mainly for developmental disorders
such as dwarfism. Now, however, an estimated 5,000 Americans have
begun taking it to look and feel younger, says Dr. Ronald Klatz,
president of the American Academy of Anti-Aging Medicine in
Chicago.
	   Made naturally by the pituitary gland, human growth hormone
helps regulate development and maintain tissues and organs. The
body produces more of it during adolescence, and less with age.
	   ``It's extremely seductive to conclude that ... restoring those
levels to back to what you had when you were young would make you
younger,'' says Dr. Huber Warner, acting associate director of the
National Institute on Aging's biology of aging program in Bethesda,
Maryland. ``There's no evidence to logically support that
conclusion.''
	   Warner says he knows of only one small study that showed
potential benefits of hGH. Conducted in 1990 by Dr. Daniel Rudman,
the study of 12 men aged 61 to 81 who took hGH for six months saw
an increase in muscle mass, a decrease in flab and tighter skin.
	   It also showed, however, enlargement of the breasts in some of
the men.
	   But proponents say moderate doses of hGH are safe.
	   ``All these horrible side effects are dose dependent. They don't
exist in the anti-aging arena,'' Klatz says. His academy, whose
motto is ``aging is not inevitable,'' was founded by a dozen
doctors in 1993 and now has more than 4,000 member physicians in 37
countries.
	   Among anti-aging therapies, Klatz says, human growth hormone has
``the most visible effects of not just slowing but actually
reversing the outward signs of aging. It will definitely have
profound effects in our society.''
	   But it also is probably the least used anti-aging therapy
because of its high cost and the difficulty of administering it,
Klatz says. Patients must inject themselves almost daily with a
half-inch needle.
	   That hardly stops hGH's fans.
	   ``My 10-year-old loves to give me the injections,'' says Jan
Griscom, a 43-year-old trainer in Las Vegas who has taken the drug
for about three months. She pays about dlrs 1,600 a month for hGH
treatments at Cenegenics, an anti-aging clinic.
	   Griscom says her wrinkles have diminished, she can lift heavier
weights, and she needs less sleep since she started taking hGH.
	   She reports no negative side effects. Neither does one of
Denese's patients, a 41-year-old New York jury consultant who
declined to give her name. They view hGH as a sound investment in
good health.
	   ``It costs more to have a chronic, long-term illness,'' says the
jury consultant, who has been happily shelling out dlrs 700 a month
for a year for twice-daily injections. She says her skin glows, her
derriere no longer droops, and her energy level has lifted.
	   Younger men are propositioning her again. ``That hasn't happened
to me since I was 25,'' she says. As for her sex drive, ``I've
noticed a return to an almost teen-age-like state.''
	   Judith Waters, a professor of psychology at Farleigh Dickinson
University in Madison, New Jersey, said the use of an unproven drug
as an anti-aging remedy shows how reluctant baby boomers are to
grow old.
	   ``The kinds of risks people will take are absolutely
monumental,'' she says.
	   But she said cultural messages against aging are more than skin
deep. Some people may even fear losing their livelihood as they
age.
	   Denese predicts that human growth hormone, which is not approved
as an anti-aging remedy by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration,
would become cheaper and more accessible when its patent expires in
2002.
	   ``Everyone loves it,'' she says of her Park Avenue patients.

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ In a stunning signing, Bernie Williams returned
to the New York Yankees on Wednesday, agreeing to an dlrs 87.5
million, seven-year contract.
	   Williams, who had threatened to sign with the Boston Red Sox or
Arizona Diamondbacks, gets a dlrs 2.5 million signing bonus, dlrs
9.5 million next year and dlrs 12 million in each of the following
six seasons.
	   The Yankees have a dlrs 15 million option for 2006 with a dlrs
3.5 million buyout. If the option is exercised, the deal would be
worth dlrs 99 million over eight years.
	   ``I'm very happy the whole thing is over with,'' Williams, who
was in Puerto Rico, said during a telephone conference call. ``Now
I can concentrate on my team defending the title.''
	   Williams' agent, Scott Boras, was pulled out of a meeting with
Rockies owner Jerry McMorris at Coors Field in Denver, taking a
telephone call from Yankees owner George Steinbrenner to finalize
the deal.
	   ``The Red Sox obviously jumping in like they did certainly sped
the process up to get us a lot higher than we were before,''
Yankees general manager Brian Cashman said.

	   NORTH SHORES, California (AP) _ Through the millennia, nature
created its version of the Salton Sea at least three times, and it
disappeared every time.
	   People made the current version by accident in 1905, and now an
act of the U.S. Congress has given new hope to a handful of
activists who are working against time to save California's largest
lake _ and the millions of birds that depend on it.
	   To succeed, the effort must defy the laws of politics and
business, not to mention gravity. It would make not only history,
but prehistory.
	   At 227 feet (69 meters) below sea level, the lake is about 35
miles (56 kilometers) long and 15 miles (24 kilometers) wide: a
puddle compared with ancient Lake Cauhilla, the Salton Sea's
natural predecessor.
	   A result of shifting rivers and mountains, Lake Cauhilla
measured 50 by 100 miles (80 to 160 kilometers) and covered much of
southeastern California until it began evaporating about 500 years
ago.
	   In 1905, as farmers began channeling water west from the
Colorado River, a dike overflowed. The leak wasn't stopped until
1907. The Salton Sea had begun its career as an agricultural sump.
	   With no natural outlet, the lake is 25 percent saltier than the
Pacific Ocean and saturated with decades worth of fertilizer _
actually nutrients, as State Recreation Area Superintendent Steve
Horvitz points out.
	   The problem, he says, isn't that the Salton is a dead sea but
that it fosters so much life, from algae to fish to birds. And, one
season or another, 380 species of birds can be found here, about
half the species in the United States.
	   Tilapia, imported African perch, thrive in the salty water.
Fishermen also catch Corvina and Sargo. But when the algae
``blooms'' and sucks up oxygen, the fish die en masse.
	   On a recent visit, Tilapia carcasses lay thick along the
shoreline. Flocks of shorebirds picked their way across beaches
made crunchy by fish bones and barnacles.
	   Herons don't mind the smell of rot, and neither do a growing
number of fishermen who reel in the live fish before they
suffocate.
	   ``They're all good eatin','' says Jean Hungerford, volunteer
caretaker at Mecca Beach. Hungerford's neighbor at the near-empty
campground caught 20 or 21 ``right off the bat,'' he says, and was
cooking some for supper.
	   Mary Bono, who represents the sprawling desert district in
Congress, defied political tradition as a freshman by bringing home
about dlrs 13.4 million in appropriations to lay the groundwork for
a cleanup.
	   She is the widow of 1960s pop singer Sonny Bono, who died in a
skiing accident last January. He, too, was a congressional champion
of the sea.
	   ``It's a real step forward,'' says Tom Kirk, who has been
working on cleanup studies as part of the Salton Sea Authority. The
task force started with 75 possible projects, eliminated all but 35
and is now whittling the list to six, he said.
	   A preliminary draft is expected in June, with the final document
ready in 2000, says Bill Steele, project manager for the Bureau of
Reclamation.
	   When the studies are completed, Mary Bono plans to put Sonny's
name on a bill that will implement them. There's no time to lose,
she adds.
	   ``We understand that we're working against a time limit,'' she
says, ``and it could be 12 to 15 years before it becomes a dead
sea.''
	   Restoration costs remain uncertain because no one knows what
form cleanup will take.
	   Ideas include:
	   _ Diking off part of the lake. Kirk likens that solution to
``cutting off an arm to save the rest of the body.'' But Horvitz
worries that many birds would end up on the wrong side of the dike
and die;
	   _ Pumping fresher water in and saline water out. ``The
billion-dollar question,'' says Kirk, ``is where you pump water to
and where you pump it from.''
	   The pumping question moves into water politics, which can be
tough.
	   Horvitz figures water diversions _ like a major 30-year
diversion to San Diego _ will eventually lower the lake level from
about 6 feet (two meters) and further concentrate the killing mix
of nutrients.
	   ``The purpose of the sea is farm runoff,'' counters Paul
Cunningham, spokesman for the Imperial Irrigation District, which
owns rights to Colorado River water. Not all farmers are behind the
cleanup, he says; but most are, and so is the district, which has
law and precedent on its side.
	   But diverting water means less fresh water for the lake.
	   ``We've consumed the wetlands in California,'' Horvitz says.
``It's roads and houses now. We live there, not the birds. There's
nowhere else for the birds to go.''
	   Besides, economics isn't just farming and water deals, Horvitz
says. It's tourism, too.
	   Hungerford, 75, recalled the days when celebrities came from
Palm Springs to water ski and you couldn't find a spot to fish from
shore.
	   ``More people used to come to the sea than went to Yosemite
National Park,'' says Horvitz. A million people a year visited in
the 1960s. When the mid-1990s drought caused mass fish and bird
die-offs, visitors at the state park dropped to 80,000, the
all-time low.
	   Numbers have risen back to 250,000, but Horvitz believes a
million or more should visit annually. Health authorities have
cleared the lake as safe for swimming.
	   ``This isn't a dead sea. There's beautiful sunsets, trails along
the lake,'' he says. ``Yeah, the sea is an ugly duckling at times,
but it needs our help.''

<TEXT>
	   PASADENA, California (AP) _ NASA's latest plan to seek signs of
life on Mars revives a 40-year-old rocket that would vault martian
rock samples into space for an eventual ride to Earth _ the first
time pieces of any planet will have landed here.
	   When robotics expert Brian H. Wilcox was asked what it would
take to launch a light spacecraft from the surface of Mars, he
turned to declassified plans for the solid-fuel rocket his father,
Howard A. Wilcox, worked on during the Cold War.
	   Father and son often discussed the rocket, which was developed
in 1958 at the China Lake Naval Weapons Station in the shadow of
the southern Sierra Nevada near Ridgecrest.
	   After some tweaking, that concept has now become the basis for
the mini-Mars Ascent Vehicle _ part of NASA's dlrs 3 billion plan
to reorganize Mars exploration for the first decade of the new
millennium.
	   At a relatively inexpensive dlrs 30 million, the so-called
mini-MAV is consistent with NASA's ``faster, cheaper, better'' era
of space exploration.
	   A draft of the Mars program overhaul, including the mini-MAV,
was reviewed this month. In February, NASA's Jet Propulsion
Laboratory in Pasadena will announce whether it can carry out the
program within a strict dlrs 300 million annual budget.
	   NASA wants to mount the mini-MAV _ at about 3 feet (90
centimeters) and 200 pounds (90 kilograms), smaller than comparable
liquid-fuel rockets _ on rover-lander missions flown every two
years. Each rover would place rock cores in canisters that the
rocket would shoot into low orbit. The canisters later would be
retrieved by Mars orbiters for return to Earth.
	   NASA's revised blueprint for Mars exploration also incorporates
low-cost ``micromissions'' _ balloons, airplanes, or little devices
that dig into the surface _ that could act as scouts for larger
missions.
	   ``Conceptually it appears doable, but you've got to look at this
very closely, make sure you've got your (financial) commitments,''
said Carl Pilcher, NASA science director for solar system
exploration in Washington.
	   With the international space station project sucking up federal
dollars, NASA's new Mars plan relies on participation of the
French, European and Italian space agencies, as well as private
industry.
	   At this point, the French have the largest foreign role. They'll
supply the Ariane 5 rocket and 2005 orbiter to rendezvous with the
martian samples and haul them home in a U.S.-built capsule.
	   The first Mars samples could touch ground in the Utah desert in
2008.
	   ``What we're really after here ... is bringing back samples to
terrestrial laboratories that will enable us to determine what the
martian environment was like long ago, whether it might have been
the kind of environment that could support life and whether or not
there is any evidence of life in those samples,'' said Steve
Squyres, a Mars program investigator at Cornell University.
	   If life never arose there, scientists also want to understand
why not, how far the chemistry got, how the climate changed and
whether it influenced formation of life.
	   The Mars program will eventually help NASA decide whether to put
humans on martian soil. There has been talk of a July 2019 manned
touchdown to mark the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 moon
landing.
	   ``Ultimately the nature of our questions will reach a level that
we will need human explorers to obtain answers,'' Pilcher said.
	   Louis Friedman, executive director of The Planetary Society,
compares the coming decade of Mars travel to the 16th and 17th
centuries when England and Portugal sent explorers across the seas
every few years. ``We're going to hear about new discoveries all
the time,'' he said.
	   NASA's martian blueprint imposes order on plans that until
months ago were in disarray and shadowed by international failures.
The dlrs 1 billion Mars Observer disappeared in space in 1993 and
Russia's Mars 96 exploded, leaving NASA's modest Mars Pathfinder as
the sole recent red planet success. Mars Global Surveyor has yet to
begin its mapping.
	   On the more immediate horizon, NASA plans a Dec. 10 launch for
the Mars Climate Orbiter _ part of the Mars Surveyor 1998 project,
which should begin orbiting in September 1999. Next up will be the
Mars Polar Lander, which is set for a Jan. 3, 1999, liftoff and
should land at the planet's south pole on Dec. 3, 1999.
	   Last spring, scientists realized that the elaborate Athena
rover, which was to be sent in 2001, was becoming too expensive and
unwieldy to launch until 2003.
	   The decision to replace Athena in 2001 with Marie Curie, a spare
copy of the Sojourner rover that roamed Mars last year, meant
scientists would have to put hopes on hold.
	   However, Congress appropriated enough money to have the 2001
mission at least conduct experiments for NASA researchers
contemplating human Mars travel, such as measuring radiation and
soil toxicity and exploring on-site fuel production to power the
flight home.
	   A silver lining emerged after NASA tapped Charles Elachi,
director for Space and Earth Sciences at JPL, to bring together
experts and restructure the Mars program. Their roadmap relies on
robotic missions of increasing complexity as precursors to human
travel.
	   Under the old concept, rovers would collect and stash samples
and later vehicles would scoop up the best samples for study.
	   Under the new proposal, mini-MAVs would shoot rocks into Mars
orbit as they're being collected. They would linger in space until
the French orbiter can rendezvous with them.
	   ``It's fantastic. By returning the samples from the live rover
to the live ascent vehicle, the chances of success have gone up
markedly,'' said Squyres, principal investigator on the Athena
rover. ``This ascent vehicle really saves the program.''

Study: Prozac can reduce symptoms of panic disorder
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) _ The antidepressant drug Prozac can
significantly reduce symptoms associated with panic disorder,
according to a study.
	   The study, published in the November issue of The American
Journal of Psychiatry, shows that the drug can significantly reduce
symptoms associated with panic disorder.
	   Panic disorder includes recurrent, unexpected panic attacks. It
can also cause behavioral changes and excessive worry.
	   At least 3 million people in the United States _ about 1.6
percent of adults _ will suffer from panic disorder at some point
in their lives, according to the National Institute of Mental
Health. The National Mental Health Association said about half of
people who suffer from panic disorder develop the condition prior
to age 24.
	   Prozac has U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval for
depression, obsessive compulsive disorder and bulimia nervosa. This
is the first study to examine Prozac's role in fighting panic
disorder.
	   The study was funded by a grant from Lilly Research
Laboratories, a division of Eli Lilly and Co., maker of the drug.

 &UR; Rare stegosaurus skeleton to be exhibited next year in Denver
	   DENVER (AP) _ After 145 million years, a stegosaurus nicknamed
``Spike'' has been reunited with his skull and tail.
	   The full stegosaurus skeleton, unearthed six years ago and
described as the most complete such specimen ever found, is being
reassembled at the Denver Museum of Natural History for an exhibit
early next year.
	   Paleontologist Bryan Small discovered the stegosaurus in June
1992 about 50 miles (80 kilometers) southwest of Colorado Springs.
It is one of only three full stegosaurus skeletons ever unearthed,
all of them found in Garden Park since 1886.
	   Small's stegosaurus will join the museum's other complete
stegosaurus fossil, which was discovered in 1937. The one found in
1886 is displayed at the Smithsonian Institution.
	   Since Small's discovery, the fossil's head and tail sections
have been displayed at the Denver museum, while preparation work on
the body continued at Dinosaur Depot in Canon City.
	   On Nov. 17, the body parts, encased in plaster, were brought by
flatbed truck to the museum where they will be reunited with the
tail and head.

 &UR; Health experts tell Americans to forget cars, get more exercise
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Government health experts, concerned about the
United States' love affair with the car, are trying to cool the
romance. It's for their own good, they say.
	   Americans are not getting enough healthy physical activity, and
would be better off if walking or biking were a bigger part of
daily life, the experts say.
	   One way to get Americans on their feet is to get them out from
behind the wheel.
	   ``Nationally, 7 percent of all trips are nonmotorized,'' said
health scientist Rich Killingsworth of the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention in Atlanta. ``We'd like to see that double
to 14 percent over 10 years.'' The percentage of motorized trips
would have to drop commensurately, he said.
	   Think it can't be done? The CDC scientists are more optimistic.
They note that many Americans have learned to quit smoking and curb
their tastes for fatty foods, thereby reducing their risks of lung
cancer and heart disease.
	   The experts figure that, if government nagging can help
Americans to control addiction and appetite, then encouraging them
to go for a nice walk or a bike ride isn't too much to expect.
	   The research groundwork has been laid. Exercise scientists have
found that moderate activity _ the energy equivalent of brisk
30-minute walks five days a week _ can lift adults out of the
sedentary category that carries the highest risk for premature
death. The agency believes sedentary living is a primary factor in
at least 200,000 deaths a year from heart disease, cancer and
diabetes.
	   Those findings underlie CDC's exercise guidelines, which call on
Americans to do at least that much activity by walking, biking,
gardening, housework or whatever else fits their lives. If one half
hour is inconvenient, the activity can be split into blocks of
roughly 10 minutes each, the guidelines say.
	   Americans don't seem to be listening. Eighty percent of American
adults don't get their 30 minutes, CDC figures show.

Blair making first speech by British leader to Irish parliament
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Will be led by speech expected 1100gmt

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) _ Heralding an era of unprecedented harmony
in Anglo-Irish relations, Tony Blair prepared Thursday to address
Dublin's parliament _ the first British prime minister to do so
since the Irish Republic won independence 76 years ago.
	   Blair arrived in Dublin late Wednesday fresh from daylong
discussions in Belfast with Protestant and Catholic politicians,
who are struggling to form the coalition government envisioned in
the Good Friday agreement, April's peace accord on British-ruled
Northern Ireland.
	   Advance copies of Blair's speech, released by his Downing Street
office in London, emphasize his desire to build ever-closer
cooperation between Ireland and Britain, countries that ``have
inflicted too much pain, each on the other.''
	   Blair's prepared remarks include a lengthy appeal to his
audience _ mostly lawmakers committed to achieving the peaceful
unification of Ireland _ to appreciate the values and fears of the
north's British Protestant majority.
	   ``Just as we must understand your yearning for a united Ireland,
so too must you understand what the best of (Protestant) unionism
is about,'' Blair's speech reads.
	   ``The overwhelming majority of good and decent people _ just
like you _ are all yearning. They want to remain part of the United
Kingdom.
	   ``They feel threatened by terrorism with which they have had to
live for too long, threatened _ until the Good Friday agreement _
that they would be forced into a united Ireland against the will of
the people of Northern Ireland.''
	   Blair began his visit to Dublin at the official residence of
Irish President Mary McAleese, where about 200 survivors of the
Aug. 15 car bombing of the Northern Irish town of Omagh had been
specially invited.
	   That attack, committed by Irish Republican Army dissidents
opposed to the outlawed group's July 1997 cease-fire, killed 29
people and wounded 370, the worst single atrocity in three decades
of conflict over Northern Ireland.
	   Also in attendance was the mother of three young Catholic boys
who were burned to death by Protestant arsonists in July.
	   Later, Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern toasted Blair as ``a
true friend of Ireland'' at a dinner in Dublin Castle, the former
headquarters of British administration in Ireland.
	   ``I think it is fair for me to say that Tony Blair's efforts
have been second to none in seeing that we get over the hurdles and
obstacles that have bedeviled us for centuries,'' Ahern said.

 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ In a stunning reversal, Bernie Williams turned
down the Boston Red Sox and stayed with the New York Yankees,
agreeing Wednesday night to an dlrs 87.5 million, seven-year
contract.
	   Williams' agent, Scott Boras, was pulled out of a meeting with
Rockies owner Jerry McMorris at Coors Field in Denver, taking a
telephone call from Yankees owner George Steinbrenner to finalize
the deal.
	   ``I'm very happy the whole thing is over with,'' Williams, who
was in Puerto Rico, said during a telephone conference call. ``Now
I can concentrate on my team defending the title.''
	   Williams, who also had been courted by the Arizona Diamondbacks,
gets a dlrs 2.5 million signing bonus, dlrs 9.5 million next year
and dlrs 12 million in each of the following six seasons.
	   The Yankees have a dlrs 15 million option for 2006 with a dlrs
3.5 million buyout. If the option is exercised, the deal would be
worth dlrs 99 million over eight years.
	   ``The Red Sox obviously jumping in like they did certainly sped
the process up to get us a lot higher than we were before,''
Yankees general manager Brian Cashman said from the team's spring
training complex in Florida.
	   In re-signing with the Yankees, New York ended negotiations with
Albert Belle, whose only visible suitor is the Boston Red Sox.
There also are rumors Baltimore might be making an offer.
	   Williams, New York's center fielder and cleanup hitter, won the
American League batting title this year and was a key personality
on a team that went 114-48 during the regular season and 11-2 in
the postseason, sweeping San Diego in the World Series.
	   ``It came down to the fact that I wanted to be a Yankee, I
wanted to remain a Yankee for the rest of my career,'' Williams
said.

Dollar, Japanese stocks higher in early trading
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar edged higher against the yen early
Thursday in thin trading due to the Thanksgiving holiday in the
United States. Japanese stock prices rose slightly.
	   The dollar bought 121.76 yen in early trading, up 0.92 yen from
late Wednesday in Tokyo and also above its late New York level of
121.73 yen overnight.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 45.26
points, or 0.30 percent, to 15,118.73 in the first 30 minutes of
trading. On Wednesday, the Nikkei closed down 91.17 points, or 0.60
percent.
	   Currency trading slacked off Wednesday as some investors and
dealers in the United States took to the sidelines in advance of
the Thursday holiday.
	   Traders said the dollar held steady as the yen ran into selling
in overseas markets amid speculation that Japan could face a
shortfall in tax revenues this year amid a continuing economic
slowdown.
	   On the stock market, share prices started slightly higher as
investors were encouraged by optimism regarding domestic political
developments and hopes for greater world economic stability.
	   A sense that the U.S. economy is strong was among positive
factors, traders said.
	   The political alliance between Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic
Party and the opposition Liberal Party is also contributing to
market optimism, despite some signs that the alliance may face
problems from within the LDP, traders said.
	   The Liberal Party's support for tax cuts has fueled speculation
about a possible cut in the 5 percent national consumption tax and

Report: Malaysian Airlines takes loan to buy new Boeing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia's national airline has
secured a 200 million ringgit (dlrs 52.6 million) loan from
domestic banks to help it buy a new Boeing aircraft, the national
news agency reported.
	   The loan from Perwira Affin and Bank of Commerce, announced on
Wednesday, will help Malaysian Airline System to finance the
delivery of its ninth Boeing 777-200 aircraft, Bernama news agency
said.
	   Despite posting a loss of dlrs 68 million this year, the airline
has stuck to its purchase commitments made in 1996, one year before
the region was hit by debilitating regional currency and stock
market turmoil.
	   The delivery of the aircraft is part of an order involving 10
Boeing 747-400 aircraft and 15 Boeing 777-200 aircraft, Bernama
said.
	   The loan to the ailing airline demonstrated the banks'
commitment to Malaysia's corporate recovery, Malaysia Airlines
chairman Tajuddin Ramli was quoted as saying.

New U.N. teams will test Iraq's cooperation with weapons

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ With renewed backing from the Security
Council, U.N. weapons experts arrive this week for new inspections
that could provide a major test of Baghdad's cooperation with the
teams charged with destroying Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
	   U.N. teams have carried out more than a week of visits since
Iraq relented Nov. 14 and allowed them to resume their work after a
two-week hiatus. So far, Iraq has cooperated with the searches.
	   But most of those visits were to sites that monitors had already
checked and usually involved maintenance work on long-term
monitoring equipment. The real test will likely come during
searches of new sites by the visiting teams of weapons experts.
	   The new teams should arrive this week, Caroline Cross, a U.N.
spokeswoman for the weapons inspectors in Baghdad, said Wednesday.
	   Iraq's U.N. ambassador said in a CNN interview that Iraq would
cooperate when inspections of the new sites begin. ``We'll be
providing full access to the sites that they want to investigate or
to inspect,'' Nizar Hamdoon said.
	   Over the past week, a new dispute emerged over the demand by
Richard Butler, the chief weapons inspector, for documents on
Iraq's weapons program. Iraq refused the request, saying many were
already destroyed. Other documents, like personal diaries, were
either irrelevant or had already been viewed by inspectors, it
said.
	   The U.N. Security Council responded to the dispute by issuing a
one-sentence statement reaffirming its support of the inspectors'
mission, but the council did not publicly address whether Iraq has
reneged on its pledge to fully cooperate with the arms experts.
	   Although the United States and Britain have said their forces in
the Persian Gulf could still attack Iraq over the dispute, they
seem willing to wait to see how much help Iraq provides in the
coming weeks.
	   Still, Hamdoon said he anticipates that Iraq will be hit by U.S.
and British airstrikes as early as next month.
	   He said he anticipates an attack ``given the reluctance of the
United States to reconsider its policy (and) to find a way out of
this deadlock and to try to give Iraq an incentive to cooperate.''
	   ``I do expect some crisis probably also within December,'' he
said in the CNN interview.
	   The U.N. inspectors must certify that Iraq has destroyed its
long-range missiles, chemical, biological and nuclear weapons and
programs to build them before the Security Council will lift
crippling sanctions imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990.
	   Inspectors blame Iraq's lack of cooperation for the long tenure
of their work. But Iraq believes the inspections are used as an
excuse to prolong the sanctions, which have impoverished the
country.
	   The Security Council agreed to ease the sanctions in 1996 to
allow Iraq to sell oil in order to buy basic necessities for Iraq's
22 million people. The council renewed that program Tuesday and
Hamdoon on Wednesday approved terms allowing the sale of dlrs 5.2
billion in oil over six months.
	   The official Iraqi media often blame Butler personally for the
prolonged conflict.
	   Butler looks for ``a new excuse to be used by the United States
and Britain in order to trigger a new aggression against Iraq,''
said Al-Thawra, the newspaper of the ruling Baath Party.
	   ``It seems that his part is confined to creating a new crisis,
no more,'' Al-Thawra said in an editorial Wednesday.
	   But the crisis atmosphere in Iraq along with the angry rhetoric
from Iraqi officials has largely subsided in recent days.
	   Vilification of the Iraqi opposition, however, continued
Wednesday. A government spokesman accused Iraqi dissidents of
``selling their national honor to U.S. and British intelligence.
	   Iraqi opposition groups, riven by ethnic, religious and
political differences, have sought to close their ranks in meetings
with the support of the United States and Britain.
	   Opposition figures interviewed by reporters in Cairo said the
United States was pushing Adnan al-Pachachi, a former foreign
minister, as a new dissident leader because of lukewarm support
among dissidents for Ahmed Chalabi, head of the U.S.-backed Iraqi
National Congress.
	   But a U.S. State Department official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, told a reporter in Washington that the United States was
not trying to annoint a new Iraqi opposition leader.
	   The Iraqi government spokesman said the United States and
Britain are ``under wishful thinking and pursuing the impossible''
if they try to topple Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein.

Court turns down Allied POWs compensation suit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A Tokyo court on Thursday ruled against a demand
for compensation by a group of soldiers and civilians from several
countries held prisoner in Japan during World War II.
	   The lawsuit was filed three years ago on behalf of 25,000
members of veterans organizations from Britain, the United States,
Australia and New Zealand.
	   The decision was the first handed down in Japan in a legal suit
brought by former World War II POWs' from Allied countries.
	   They demanded dlrs 22,000 each in compensation for what they
claimed were violations of their rights under international
treaties and conventions on the treatment of war prisoners.
	   The court ruled that the issue was resolved in 1951 with the
signing of the San Francisco peace treaty.
	   Presiding judge Shigeki Inoue said in his verdict that because
of the 1951 treaty, individuals or groups could not seek
compensation from the government. He said compensation issues must
be dealt with on the government-to-government level.
	   Japan forced POWs to work in shipyards, mines and jungles in
violation of international law. They were also beaten and some were
executed.
	   The POWs' death rate at the Japanese camps was 27 percent,
compared to a 4-percent rate at allied camps.
	   It was not immediately clear if the former POWs would appeal
Thursday's ruling.

	   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) _ Heralding an era of unprecedented harmony
in Anglo-Irish relations, Tony Blair prepared Thursday to address
Dublin's parliament _ the first British prime minister to do so
since the Irish Republic won independence 76 years ago.
	   Blair arrived in Dublin late Wednesday fresh from daylong
discussions in Belfast with Protestant and Catholic politicians,
who are struggling to form the coalition government envisioned in
April's peace accord on British-ruled Northern Ireland.
	   Advance copies of Blair's speech, released by his Downing Street
office in London, emphasize his desire to build ever-closer
cooperation between Ireland and Britain, countries that ``have
inflicted too much pain, each on the other.''
	   Blair's prepared remarks include a lengthy appeal to his
audience _ mostly lawmakers committed to achieving the peaceful
unification of Ireland _ to appreciate the values and fears of the
north's British Protestant majority.
	   ``Just as we must understand your yearning for a united Ireland,
so too must you understand what the best of (Protestant) unionism
is about,'' Blair's speech reads.
	   ``The overwhelming majority of good and decent people _ just
like you _ are all yearning. They want to remain part of the United
Kingdom.
	   ``They feel threatened by terrorism with which they have had to
live for too long, threatened _ until the Good Friday agreement _
that they would be forced into a united Ireland against the will of
the people of Northern Ireland.''
	   Blair began his visit to Dublin at the official residence of
Irish President Mary McAleese, where about 200 survivors of an Aug.
15 car bombing in the Northern Irish town of Omagh had been
specially invited.
	   That attack, committed by Irish Republican Army dissidents
opposed to the outlawed group's July 1997 cease-fire, killed 29
people and wounded 370, the worst single atrocity in three decades
of conflict over Northern Ireland.
	   Also in attendance was the mother of three young Catholic boys
who were burned to death by Protestant arsonists in July.
	   Later, Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern toasted Blair as ``a
true friend of Ireland'' at a dinner in Dublin Castle, the former
headquarters of British administration in Ireland.
	   ``I think it is fair for me to say that Tony Blair's efforts
have been second to none in seeing that we get over the hurdles and
obstacles that have bedeviled us for centuries,'' Ahern said.

Williams gets dlrs 87.5 million, seven-year contract with Yankees

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ In a stunning move, the New York Yankees outbid
the Boston Red Sox at the last moment and kept American League
batting champion Bernie Williams, agreeing Wednesday night to an
dlrs 87.5 million, seven-year contract.
	   Williams' agent, Scott Boras, was pulled out of a meeting with
Rockies chairman Jerry McMorris at Coors Field in Denver, taking a
telephone call from Yankees owner George Steinbrenner to finalize
the deal.
	   Hours earlier, it appeared the World Series champions were on
the verge of losing their Gold Glove center fielder and cleanup
hitter, who had a seven-year offer from Boston.
	   ``They were very aggressive,'' Williams said. ``Obviously they
showed I was the type of player they wanted to have on their
team.''
	   Preparing for life after Williams, New York was negotiating with
Albert Belle, who would have replaced Williams' offense but brought
his tempestuous personality to the tranquil clubhouse of the
Yankees, who finished a combined 125-50 in the regular season and
postseason, the most wins ever for a team in one year.
	   ``I'm very happy the whole thing is over with,'' Williams said.
``Now I can concentrate on my team defending the title. ... It came
down to the fact that I wanted to be a Yankee, I wanted to remain a
Yankee for the rest of my career.''
	   Williams also had been courted by the Arizona Diamondbacks and
two other teams, which Boras wouldn't identify. Williams instructed
Boras to give the Yankees one last chance to re-sign him, and the
pair traveled Tuesday to Tampa, Florida to meet with the Yankees.
	   After the meeting, general manager Brian Cashman said the team
would get back to them after Steinbrenner consulted with all his
baseball people. Williams, staying in the same hotel as Cashman,
spoke by telephone with teammate Derek Jeter during the evening,
then reached out to the general manager with a telephone call at 1
a.m. EST.
	   ``They said they were going to get back to us at sometime during
the night,'' Williams said. ``I was just trying to find out what
happened.''
	   Cashman said that was the first time he became convinced
Williams wanted to stay. But even as late as Wednesday morning,
when Williams left for his home in Puerto Rico and Boras headed to
Colorado to meet with the Rockies on Kevin Brown, Cashman thought
it wouldn't happen.
	   ``We thought it was dead and buried when they left here this
morning,'' Cashman said.
	   Before Tuesday, New York's only offer was a dlrs 60 million,
five-year contract. Last winter, Williams rejected a dlrs 37.5
million, five-year offer and agreed to an dlrs 8.25 million,
one-year contract.
	   ``The bottom line is the Red Sox drove the price up,'' Cashman
said. ``It was a risk Mr. Steinbrenner was willing to take for the
fans of New York to have an opportunity to witness what some say
was one of the best teams ever to come back and try to do it
again.''
	   Williams' deal, which averages dlrs 12.5 million per season,
ties him for third with Boston's Pedro Martinez on the average
salary list, trailing only Mo Vaughn (dlrs 13,333,333), who agreed
to an dlrs 80 million, six-year contract with Anaheim on Wednesday,
and Mike Piazza (dlrs 13 million).
	   Williams has the second-most guaranteed dollars, trailing only
Piazza, who has a dlrs 91 million, seven-year contract with the New
York Mets. The deal breaks down to a dlrs 2.5 million signing
bonus, a dlrs 9.5 million salary next year and dlrs 12 million in
each of the following six seasons.
	   The Yankees have a dlrs 15 million option for 2006 with a dlrs
3.5 million buyout. If the option is exercised, the deal would be
worth dlrs 99 million over eight years.
	   In re-signing with the Yankees, New York ended negotiations with
Belle, whose only visible suitor is Boston. The Yankees offered him
a four-year deal worth about dlrs 12 million per year, and there
also are rumors Baltimore might be making an offer.
	   Williams was a key personality on a team that went 114-48 during
the regular season and 11-2 in the postseason, sweeping San Diego
to win the World Series for the second time in three seasons.

World coral reefs take a pounding from global warming
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOWNSVILLE, Australia (AP) _ Global warming has devastated many
of the world's coral reefs, with Australia's Great Barrier Reef
also suffering damage, a conference of international coral reef
experts said Thursday.
	   The International Tropical Marine Ecosystems Management
Symposium said in a statement that reefs in many parts of the
world, some with coral more than 1,000 years old, had suffered this
year from the bleaching brought on by high sea-surface
temperatures.
	   ``Global coral bleaching and die-off was unprecedented in 1998
in geographic extent, depth and severity,'' the symposium said.
``Current projections of global warming suggest there will be
increased frequency of coral bleaching and coral mortality.''
	   Corals lived on the upper edge of their temperature tolerance
and any rise in temperatures would damage them, it said.
	   The symposium said that countries with the worst-hit reefs were
Japan, Taiwan, the Philippines, Vietnam, Thailand, Singapore,
Indonesia and the islands of Palau.
	   ``Reefs in the Maldives, Sri Lanka, Kenya and Tanzania were
devastated with shallow reefs looking like graveyards,'' it added.
	   The effects of the bleaching were patchy, with only the central
Pacific Ocean spared from the die-off. In some parts of the Indian
Ocean, coral mortality was as high as 90 percent.
	   On Tuesday, Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority chairman
Dr. Ian McPhail said the reef was in good shape despite the
worldwide decline.

 &UR; Vaughn gets dlrs 80 million, six-year deal from Angels &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with quotes; CHANGES byline &QL; 
 &UR; By JOHN NADEL &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ANAHEIM, California _ Mo Vaughn leapfrogged Mike Piazza to
become the highest-paid player in U.S. Major League Baseball.
	   Vaughn, one of the most powerful left-handed hitters, agreed
Wednesday to an dlrs 80 million, six-year contract with the Anaheim
Angels.
	   Vaughn's new deal, which includes a club option for 2005, has an
average annual value of dlrs 13.33 million, topping the dlrs 13
million Piazza will average under his new dlrs 91 million,
seven-year contract with the New York Mets. Piazza, however, still
has the contract with the most total guaranteed dollars.
	   If the option is exercised, Vaughn's deal would be worth dlrs 92
million over seven seasons.
	   ``The signing of Mo Vaughn is an extraordinary event for our
ballclub,'' Angels manager Terry Collins said. ``Mo is one of those
rare individuals whose presence will have a profound effect on the
players, the organizations and this community. Our ownership has
established its desire to take this team to the next level, and Mo
is the type of individual who relishes that challenge.''
	   The first baseman, who turns 31 next month, hit .337 this year
with 40 homers and 115 RBIs, making dlrs 6.6 million. He had been
negotiating off and on with the Red Sox for the past year, but
Boston ended talks Nov. 11 after Vaughn rejected a dlrs 62.5
million, five-year offer.
	   ``Anaheim was clearly Mo's preference from the beginning. Mo
clearly was Anaheim's preference from the beginning,'' agent Adam
Katz said. ``We we worked hard the last two weeks and found an
intersection mutually satisfactory.''
	   Vaughn, who lives outside Boston in Easton, Massachusetts, had
been with the Red Sox organization since he started his
professional career in 1989.
	   ``The Red Sox thank Mo for his time with us,'' Boston spokesman
Kevin Shea said. ``During his time with Boston, he was a productive
member of our club and we wish him the best of luck in the
future.''
	   Boston had sought to replace Vaughn's offense with Bernie
Williams, but the AL batting champion _ he beat out Vaughn on the
final day of the season _ went back to the New York Yankees on
Wednesday night for an dlrs 87.5 million, seven-year contract.
	   That leaves Albert Belle as Boston's best alternative. Belle
must decide by Dec. 2 whether to remain a free agent or go back to
a Chicago White Sox contract that guarantees him dlrs 35 million
for the next three seasons.
	   With the addition of Vaughn, Anaheim anticipates moving Darin
Erstad from first base to the outfield. It's unlikely Erstad or Tim
Salmon will be traded, leaving center fielder Jim Edmonds or right
fielder Garret Anderson likely to be swapped for a pitcher. Edmonds
has been the subject of trade rumors for some time.

In Chile, anger, joy and concern after ruling against Pinochet

	   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) _ Police used tear gas and water cannons to
disperse separate demonstrations by supporters and foes of Gen.
Augusto Pinochet, whose bid for immunity from arrest was rejected
in Britain in a case that has further polarized Chile.
	   More than 40 demonstrators were detained late Wednesday in
Santiago and at least two provincial cities, police said.
	   Chilean supporters of Pinochet who watched Wednesday's
announcement live on television reacted with disbelief, frustration
and anger upon hearing the news. His foes broke out in loud cheers
and joyful applause.
	   Shortly after the ruling was known, small groups of
demonstrators on both sides took to the streets in mostly peaceful
marches. A few scattered clashes were broken up by police using
water cannons.
	   But by night, the demonstrations grew larger, and police
repeatedly moved in to disperse them.
	   In Santiago's upper class Las Condes neighborhood, some 300
angry pro-Pinochet demonstrators blocked traffic. Police dispersed
them with water and tear gas. Similar clashes were reported in the
southern city of Concepcion and in the neighboring port city of
Valparaiso. There were no reports of injuries.
	   In a brief nationwide address, President Eduardo Frei vowed to
renew efforts to secure the release of the 83-year-old former
dictator and ordered Foreign Minister Jose Miguel Insulza to fly to
both London and Madrid to represent his government's position ``at
all levels.''
	   ``This is not the end of the process,'' Frei said.
	   Frei said he was concerned by the ruling's effects, and urged
calm.
	   ``The government knows that this ruling may bring abrupt
reactions from some sectors,'' he said. ``But it is necessary to
warn that one condition for the success of the government's efforts
is a responsible and serene behavior by our institutions and our
citizens.''
	   The term ``institutions'' is generally used here to refer to the
military.
	   The army, calling the ruling unfair and unacceptable, criticized
several socialist legislators who went to London to support the
detention of Pinochet. It also urged the government to step up
efforts on behalf of its former commander.
	   Pinochet's son, also named Augusto, said it was ``especially
cruel and sadistic'' that the ruling was issued on his father's
83rd birthday.
	   The decision was a relief for Viviana Diaz, an official with an
organization of relatives of more than 1,000 dissidents who remain
unaccounted for after being detained by Pinochet's security
services.
	   ``We now want him extradited to Spain, so we can finally have
justice for our loved ones. We want justice, not revenge,'' she
said.
	   At her organization's downtown headquarters, the ruling by the
House of Lords was met with cheers, applause, tears and the chant,
``Justice! Justice!''
	   According to a Chilean government report, 3,197 people were
killed or disappeared during Pinochet's 17-year rule.
	   Supporters of the former dictator, including many retired
members of the military, gathered at the Pinochet Foundation, an
organization that promotes the legacy of his regime. Some
supporters, especially women, insulted and spat at journalists and
even struck several of them.
	   British Broadcasting Corp. television showed footage of Pinochet
supporters yelling expletives at a BBC camera crew, pushing and
shoving a cameraman and reporters, and forcing them out of the
foundation building.
	   ``This is the result of a job well done by the ... communists.
They have so much money and support in Europe,'' said a crying
woman who identified herself Monica. ``It is so sad. The general
gave everything for Chile. All he did was for Chile.''
	   The foundation president, retired Gen. Luis Cortes, made an
appeal for calm but warned ``this will, unfortunately, deepen
polarization among Chileans.''
	   The navy issued a statement echoing the warning.
	   Right-wing politicians angrily denounced the ruling as a
violation of Chile's sovereignty.
	   ``This is the most serious aggression on Chile's sovereignty in
decades,'' said Alberto Espina, president of the right-wing
National Renewal party.

Reports: Saudi Arabia pulls out of Asian Games
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Its relations with Thailand strained by
theft and killings, Saudi Arabia has pulled out of next month's
Asian Games, newspapers said Thursday.
	   The reported sudden withdrawal of the 105-strong team throws
schedules for the Dec. 6-20 games into disarray and will prove
embarrassing for the hosts.
	   The English-language Bangkok Post said a letter from Saudi
Arabian sports authorities Thursday cited national centenary
celebrations and the Moslem holy month of Ramadan as reasons for
the pullout.
	   But relations between the two countries turned sour because Thai
authorities have failed to solve a 1989 case in which a Thai
janitor stole precious jewelry from the palace of a Saudi prince,
and the murders of three Saudi diplomats in 1990-91.
	   The theft case is believed to involve members of Thailand's
power elite who are largely immune from investigation and legal
punishment.
	   Saudi Arabia has said relations would only be normalized when
the two cases were solved.
	   Preparations for the games have been plagued by chaotic
organization and financial problems but organizers have vowed to
stage a top-notch event.

Reports: Four more to be tried over anti-government protest
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Four people, including a lawyer,
are to face trial for participating in an anti-government rally
during a Pacific Rim summit meeting last week, news reports said
Thursday.
	   The trial of the four, who were led handcuffed by police to a
magistrate's court Wednesday for their arraignment, will be the
second related to a wave of protests triggered by the arrest of
former deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim.
	   The trial of 127 people arrested during a demonstration on Oct.
17 has been set for Feb. 2.
	   The four, arrested during a Nov. 15 protest in downtown Kuala
Lumpur, pleaded innocent to charges of being in an illegal assembly
and ignoring police orders, The Star daily said. Their trial was
set for Feb. 22.
	   Conviction for disobeying police carries a maximum penalty of
one year in jail and a fine of 10,000 ringgit (dlrs 2,600).
	   Anwar's Sept. 20 arrest sparked angry protests in Malaysia. It
also triggered international outrage when he appeared in court with
a black eye and body bruises. Anwar said he was blindfolded by
police and beaten until unconscious while in jail.
	   His trial resumed this week after a recess during the summit of
the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum which ended on Nov. 18.
	   Police have arrested people each time groups sympathetic to
Anwar have organized protests.
	   During the latest one on Saturday, police arrested at least four
Anwar supporters, including opposition leader Tian Chua, a human
rights activist who heads an opposition coalition founded after
Anwar's arrest.
	   No charges have yet been pressed against Chua or the other
three.

Portugal and Indonesia put final touches on East Timor autonomy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous to CORRECT spelling of Indonesian minister's
name in graf 2 &QL;

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The U.N. envoy for East Timor resumed
talks with representatives from Indonesia and Portugal to put the
final touches on an agreement that would give East Timor
wide-ranging autonomy, a U.N. official said.
	   Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas and his Portuguese
counterpart Jaime Gama agreed in August to hold in-depth
discussions on Indonesia's proposals for a special status for East
Timor based on wide-ranging autonomy.
	   The ministers said they hoped that an agreement could be reached
before the end of the year. A U.N. official said the three-way
talks on Wednesday and Friday were aimed at reaching a final
agreement.
	   Indonesia invaded the former Portuguese colony in 1975 and
annexed it early the next year. The United Nations and Portugal do
not recognize Indonesia's claim.
	   The U.N. talks were clouded by reports of a massacre of dozens
of East Timorese rebels in a series of clashes with Indonesian
troops. The Indonesian government denied Tuesday that it had killed
more than 40 East Timorese.
	   Portugal suspended talks with Indonesia on Saturday following
reports of the massacre and accused Jakarta of breaking promises to
reduce its military presence in East Timor.
	   U.N. envoy Jamsheed Marker met separately Tuesday with
Indonesian representative Nugroho Wisnumurti and Portugal's
delegate to the talks, Fernando Neves. The three met together on
Wednesday afternoon, U.N. officials said.
	   Before the meeting began, Marker met U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan, who has been personally involved in trying to forge an
agreement on East Timor.
	   Annan is also trying to ascertain the veracity of the massacre
reports and welcomed the announcement that the Indonesian National
Commission on Human Rights will conduct an investigation, U.N.
spokesman Fred Eckhard said.
	   ``We're trying to establish what has happened,'' he said.
``We'll rely on whatever sources we can to determine whether these
allegations are true or not.''
	   Eckhard said Marker will travel to Indonesia and East Timor in
mid-December. Other U.N. officials will visit East Timor shortly,
he said.
	   Portugal's Foreign Ministry has called for a permanent U.N.
mission in East Timor. Eckhard said he was aware of the request but
had no comment on it.
	   The August communique said the in-depth discussions were being
held without either side giving up or changing its basic
principles.
	   Indonesia wants to give East Timor autonomy in return for
international recognition of Indonesian sovereignty. East Timorese
pro-independence groups have insisted that a referendum be held in
the territory to decide its future.
	   No details were released on the autonomy agreement now being
finalized.
	   Alatas said in August that the outline of Indonesia's proposal
was for ``a special province, a special autonomous region based on
wide-ranging autonomy.'' He said this meant that the East Timorese
would control all areas except foreign policy, external defense and
some aspects of monetary and fiscal policy.
	   He also said Indonesia foresees the release of jailed East Timor
rebel leader Xanana Gusmao ``as part and parcel of an overall
solution to the East Timor question.'' Gusmao was arrested in 1991
and is serving a 20-year term for fighting Indonesian troops in the
former Portuguese colony.

Opponents of war crimes tribunal can help determine its rules
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ A U.N. committee unanimously agreed that
the United States and other opponents of the world's first
permanent war crimes tribunal can participate in the commission
that will determine its rules of procedure and evidence.
	   The General Assembly's legal committee adopted a resolution that
will enable all states to take part in the work of the commission
which will draft the texts establishing the court, committee
chairman Jargalsaikhany Enkhsaikhan said Wednesday.
	   The resolution is expected to be adopted by the General Assembly
by the end of the year.
	   ``We want to have all the countries big and small to be involved
in this drafting because we want it to be as universal as
possible,'' said Enkhsaikhan, who is Mongolia's U.N. ambassador.
``And in order to do that we have agreed that the Preparatory
Commission would be open for participation by all the states.''
	   In July, 120 countries approved the establishment of a permanent
war crimes tribunal but more than 20 countries abstained and seven
countries voted against it _ the United States, Iraq, China, Libya,
Qatar, Yemen and Israel.
	   The United States, which had promoted creation of a court for
years, refused to sign the draft treaty in Rome because American
officials felt the final accord yielded too much prosecutorial
power to the court.
	   Enkhsaikhan told a news conference it will be very difficult to
renegotiate the statute since it has already been signed by so many
countries, ``but there is still room, I think, for improvement, for
enrichment and that's where I think most negotiations will be.''
	   The commission, for example, will determine what constitutes war
crimes, including the definition of aggression, he said.
	   The Preparatory Commission is expected to begin work in February
and meet for eight weeks during the year to finalize proposals for
the court, he said.

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ In a bid to improve ties between Asia's two largest
powers, Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi on Thursday was
expected to offer visiting Chinese President Jiang Zemin an apology
for Japan's invasion and brutal occupation of China earlier this
century.
	   The summit meeting comes during the first visit by a Chinese
head of state to Japan since World War II. Relations have been
strained for decades by Cold War tensions and disputes over Japan's
imperialist legacy.
	   But the two nation's leaders hope to lay the foundation for
friendlier interaction in the 21st century by pledging increased
cooperation both in the political and economic arenas.
	   Jiang was scheduled to exchange greetings later Thursday with
Emperor Akihito at the Imperial Palace in central Tokyo before
holding summit talks with Prime Minister Obuchi at the ornate
Akasaka State Guesthouse where he is staying for part of his
six-day trip.
	   Earlier, he held a breakfast meeting with six former Japanese
leaders, including Obuchi's immediate predecessor, ex-premier
Ryutaro Hashimoto. Jiang arrived late Wednesday on a flight from
Beijing.
	   The Chinese president had hoped to return home with an
unequivocal expression of remorse from Tokyo for the murder and
carnage by Japanese troops that invaded China in the 1930s.
	   Local news reports say Obuchi will offer a spoken apology
accompanied by a more indirectly worded expression of regret in a
formal joint statement. Yet neither leader will actually sign the
statement, something which the Japanese press reported as a highly
irregular move.
	   A spokesperson for Japan's Foreign Ministry said a signing
ceremony was an option which both sides decided to forgo because,
unlike a formal treaty, the statement is simply a political
declaration by the two heads of state.
	   Japanese officials remain wary that too explicit an apology
could open the floodgates to limitless demands for compensation
from victims of atrocities. Still, Obuchi's oral remarks will be
the fullest expression of sorrow to date.
	   Last month, Obuchi offered visiting South Korean President Kim
Dae-jung a similarly-worded expression of remorse for Japan's
1910-1945 colonial rule over the Korean Peninsula. But Obuchi and
Kim also signed a joint statement.
	   In their meeting Thursday, Chinese President Jiang and Obuchi
were also expected to discuss expanding economic ties. China is
Japan's second-largest trading partner and Japan is China's
largest, with annual trade volume of more than dlrs 60 billion.
	   For Japan, a stronger Chinese economy and closer ties to Beijing
can anchor stability in a region where North Korea is still a wild
card and Southeast Asia is caught in financial and political
turmoil.
	   Another major issue is Taiwan, which China claims is a renegade
province. Japan recognizes Beijing as the sole government of China,
but has flourishing trade ties with Taiwan.
	   Jiang plans to meet with business leaders, civic groups and
students at a major university before departing Tokyo on Saturday
for visits to two northern Japanese cities, Sendai and Sapporo.

Singapore bomb squad investigating explosion that killed one
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore's bomb squad was investigating an
explosion at a bus stop early Thursday that left one man dead,
police said.
	   ``We are still trying to establish what caused the blast,''
police spokesman John Chang told The Associated Press.
	   He said residents near the bus stop in eastern Singapore heard
an explosion at about 12:55 a.m. (1655 GMT Wednesday). A 50-year
old rag and bone man suffered facial injuries and was pronounced
dead on the scene.
	   Chang added that there were no witnesses, and the police were
continuing to investigate. He said the victim was thought to have
been alone at the site, and could have been collecting trash at the
bus stop.
	   He confirmed that explosion ordinance experts from the Singapore
Armed Forces were called to the scene, and are continuing to assist
in the investigation.
	   The area was cordoned off for several hours, but has now been
open to traffic, according to Singapore radio.

<TEXT>
	   GREENSBORO, North Carolina (AP) _ Keith Primeau scored twice and
goaltender Trevor Kidd returned to last year's form as the Carolina
Hurricanes defeated the San Jose Sharks 3-0 Wednesday night.
	   The victory snapped a three-game losing streak for the Southeast
Division-leading Hurricanes, while the Sharks remained the NHL's
only winless team on the road, falling to 0-5-3 away from home.
	   Kidd finished second in the National Hockey League last season
in save percentage and fifth in goals-against average, but was
relegated to a backup role after a slow start and the excellent
play of Arturs Irbe.
	   But Kidd shined in his first action since Nov. 11 _ a span of
six games. He was razor-sharp with his glove in making 36 saves to
record his 14th career shutout.
 &UR; Sabres 4, Rangers 2
	   In Buffalo, New York, Petr Nedved returned to the New York
Rangers in a five-player trade with Pittsburgh, but Dixon Ward and
the Sabres spoiled the moment.
	   Ward had his first career hat trick with two goals in the first
period and another in the second. It was Ward's first multi-goal
game in his third season as a Sabre and his first since he scored
two goals for Vancouver on Jan. 4, 1993, when he and Nedved were
Canucks teammates.
	   Darryl Shannon scored a power-play goal in the third period for
the Sabres, unbeaten in their last six games at home (5-0-1) and
unbeaten in their last eight games against the Rangers (5-0-3).
	   Nedved, who held out on Pittsburgh for a year and a half,
returned to the Rangers in a multi-player deal that sent Alexei
Kovalev to the Penguins.

Dollar higher in Tokyo, Japanese stocks advance
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES thruout with midday stock, bond and currency prices &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar rose against the yen in early
trading Thursday, buoyed by purchasing from Japanese mutual funds
which plan to invest money overseas. Tokyo stocks rose moderately.
	   At midday, the dollar bought 121.48 yen, up 0.64 yen from late
Wednesday in Tokyo but below its late New York level of 121.73 yen
overnight.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 60.18
points, or 0.40 percent, ending the morning session at 15,133.65.
On Wednesday, the Nikkei closed down 91.17 points, or 0.60 percent.
	   The dollar climbed against the yen in thin trading ahead of the
Thanksgiving holiday in the U.S., propped up by regular month-end
purchases from Japanese mutual funds anxious to invest new money in
foreign markets, traders said.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, share prices rose amid optimism
that recent moves to stabilize Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi's
government will prove beneficial to the ailing Japanese economy.
	   The main stock index has rallied about 800 points over the past
two trading days, closing above 15,000 points on Tuesday for first
time since Aug. 25.
	   ``The market has broken out of its old trading range,'' said
Kunihiro Hatae, general manger of the stock division at Tokyo
Securities Co.
	   Investors have been encouraged by an alliance between Obuchi's
ruling party and the minority Liberal Party, which has called for
suspending an unpopular sales tax and trimming the government
bureaucracy, traders said.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was up 2.05 points, or 0.18 percent, to 1,155.73. The
TOPIX closed down 1.93 points, or 0.17 percent, the day before.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government
bond rose to 0.995 percent from Wednesday's finish of 0.970
percent, driving its price down to 107.02 yen from 107.25 yen.

	   The accident occurred at 3:35 a.m. (2200 GMT Wednesday) and the
area was dark, Mirza said in a telephone interview. The area is 228
kilometers (140 miles) southeast of Amritsar.
	   The express train also jumped the tracks and four of its cars
fell on their sides, another police officer at Khanna said. Rescue
workers used acetylene torches to cut through the cars and pull out
bodies, the officer said.
	   Workers recovered at least 55 bodies from the train. Dozens of
people were taken to a nearby government hospital. More than 100
people were injured and doctors reported that at least 36 people
were in critical condition, Mirza said.
	   A passenger ran a few kilometers (miles) along the tracks to
alert a railroad watchman, who called authorities and stopped all
other trains in the area.
	   Traffic along the northern routes in Punjab were suspended to
allow workers to rescue the passengers and remove the train cars.

	   ``All I know is I'm just going to try and bring a winning
attitude to this club,'' Vaughn said from his home outside Boston
in Easton, Massachusetts. ``They've got a great bunch of guys. I
kind of just want to fit in and help their team.''
	   Vaughn's contract, which includes a club option for 2005, has an
average annual value of dlrs 13.33 million, topping the dlrs 13
million Piazza will average under his new dlrs 91 million,
seven-year contract with the New York Mets. Piazza, however, still
has most total guaranteed dollars.
	   If the option is exercised, Vaughn's deal would be worth dlrs 92
million over seven seasons.
	   ``This is obviously a huge day for the organization,'' general
manager Bill Bavasi said in announcing the team's most significant
free-agent signing since Reggie Jackson came to Anaheim after the
1981 season.
	   ``We've never been afraid to get into the market,'' Bavasi said.
``We've always been careful about what we do. There's a change in
action. I don't believe we've seen the players who were the right
fit. Guys like this don't come around very often. We are not here
to spend money foolishly. We feel like we made a great deal
today.''
	   The Angels probably aren't finished in the free-agent market.
They're among the contenders for pitcher Randy Johnson _ an area
where they really need help.
	   ``He's a tremendous addition to any ballclub,'' Vaughn said. ``I
think the way the Angels go about their business, they have a
pretty good chance.''
	   The first baseman who turns 31 next month, hit .337 this year
with 40 homers and 115 RBIs for the Boston Red Sox while earning
dlrs 6.6 million. He has a .304 career average with 230 homers and
752 RBIs in eight seasons and in the last five, he's averaged
nearly 37 homers and over 116 RBIs.
	   Vaughn had been negotiating off and on with the Red Sox for the
past year, but the team ended talks Nov. 11 after he rejected a
dlrs 62.5 million, five-year offer.
	   On the first day teams could make offers, the Angels gave Vaughn
a dlrs 72 million, six-year proposal, starting a three-week
negotiation.
	   ``The signing of Mo Vaughn is an extraordinary event for our
ballclub,'' Angels manager Terry Collins said. ``Mo is one of those
rare individuals whose presence will have a profound effect on the
players, the organizations and this community. Our ownership has
established its desire to take this team to the next level, and Mo
is the type of individual who relishes that challenge.''
	   Vaughn had been with the Red Sox organization since he started
his professional career in 1989.
	   Boston had sought to replace Vaughn's offense with Bernie
Williams, but the AL batting champion _ he beat out Vaughn on the
final day of the season _ went back to the New York Yankees on
Wednesday night for an dlrs 87.5 million, seven-year contract.
	   That leaves Albert Belle as Boston's best alternative. Belle
must decide by Dec. 2 whether to remain a free agent or go back to
a Chicago White Sox contract that guarantees him dlrs 35 million
for the next three seasons.

	   AMRITSAR, India (AP) _ A derailed train was struck by an express
passenger train in northwestern India Thursday, killing at least 55
people and injuring more than 100 others, police said.
	   The Amritsar-bound Frontier Mail from New Delhi derailed near
Khanna and seven cars left the tracks. The Sealdah Express,
traveling from Jammu to Sealdah in Punjab state on another track,
collided with the derailed cars, according to S.K. Mirza, police
superintendent at the state police control room.
	   The accident occurred at 3:35 a.m. (2200 GMT Wednesday) and the
area was dark, Mirza said in a telephone interview. The area is 228
kilometers (140 miles) southeast of Amritsar.
	   The express train also jumped the tracks and four of its cars
fell on their sides, another police officer at Khanna said. Rescue
workers used acetylene torches to cut through the cars and pull out
bodies, the officer said.
	   Workers recovered at least 55 bodies from the train. Dozens of
people were taken to a nearby government hospital. More than 100
people were injured and doctors reported that at least 36 people
were in critical condition, Mirza said.
	   A passenger ran a few kilometers (miles) along the tracks to
alert a railroad watchman, who called authorities and stopped all
other trains in the area.
	   Traffic along the northern routes in Punjab were suspended to
allow workers to rescue the passengers and remove the train cars.

Williams stays with Yanks, Vaughn agrees with Angels
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BEN WALKER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Baseball Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Even by U.S. Major League Baseball's megabucks
standards, this was a big deal: Bernie Williams stayed with the New
York Yankees for dlrs 87.5 million, Mo Vaughn moved to the Anaheim
Angels for dlrs 80 million.
	   It all came in a flurry Wednesday.
	   Vaughn, coming off a huge season for the Boston Red Sox, became
the highest-paid player in the game when he agreed to a six-year
contract with the Angels that averages dlrs 13.33 million per
season.
	   ``All I know is I'm just going to try and bring a winning
attitude to this club,'' Vaughn said at his home outside Boston in
Easton, Massachusetts. ``They've got a great bunch of guys. I kind
of just want to fit in and help their team.''
	   Only 45 minutes later, the World Series champion Yankees again
won big. They outbid Boston at the last moment and agreed with
Williams on a seven-year deal.
	   ``I'm very happy the whole thing is over with,'' said Williams,
who beat out Vaughn on the final day for the American League
batting championship.
	   ``It came down to the fact that I wanted to be a Yankee, I
wanted to remain a Yankee for the rest of my career,'' he said.
	   And the free-agent frenzy isn't finished, either.
	   Next up is pitcher Randy Johnson, expected to decide by the end
of the week between Texas, Arizona, Los Angeles or the Angels.
	   On deck behind the Big Unit are Albert Belle, with Boston and
Baltimore are in the running, and Kevin Brown, who spent the day
meeting with Colorado.
	   In another move Wednesday, Arizona agreed to a dlrs 5.25
million, two-year contract with pitcher Armando Reynoso. The
Diamondbacks recently signed Todd Stottlemyre.
	   Vaughn's deal, which includes a club option for 2005, has an
average annual value that tops the dlrs 13 million that Mike Piazza
will average under his new dlrs 91 million, seven-year contract
with the New York Mets.
	   If the option is exercised, Vaughn's deal would be worth dlrs 92
million for seven seasons.
	   Vaughn, 31 next month, hit .337 this year with 40 homers and 115
RBIs. Boston broke off contract talks Nov. 11 after the popular
first baseman rejected a dlrs 62.5 million, five-year offer.
	   With Vaughn, the Angels are expected to shift Darin Erstad from
first base to the outfield. That could prompt Anaheim to trade
either center fielder Jim Edmonds or right fielder Garret Anderson.
	   ``The signing of Mo Vaughn is an extraordinary event for our
ballclub,'' Anaheim manager Terry Collins said.
	   Having missed out on Williams, Boston's best option for offense
is Belle. He must decide by Dec. 2 whether to remain a free agent
or go back to his contract with the Chicago White Sox, which
guarantees him dlrs 35 million for the next three seasons.
	   The Red Sox seemed on the verge of signing Williams until the
Yankees overwhelmed their Gold Glove center fielder and cleanup
hitter with a late offer. Williams hit .339 with 26 home runs and
97 RBIs.
	   ``They were very aggressive,'' Williams said. ``Obviously they
showed I was the type of player they wanted to have on their
team.''
	   Williams' agent, Scott Boras, was pulled out of a meeting with
Rockies chairman Jerry McMorris at Coors Field in Denver to take a
telephone call from Yankees owner George Steinbrenner to finalize
the deal.
	   On Wednesday morning, when Williams left for his home in Puerto
Rico and Boras headed to Colorado to meet with the Rockies on
Brown, Yankees general manager Brian Cashman thought there would be
no deal.
	   ``We thought it was dead and buried when they left here this
morning,'' Cashman said.
	   Boston had made a seven-year offer to Williams, who also drew
interest from Arizona and Baltimore. All along, the Yankees were
speaking to Belle, just in case.
	   The Rockies spent the day in a get-acquainted session with
Brown. General manager Bob Gebhard and new Rockies manager Jim
Leyland also attended the session. Brown was 18-7 with a 2.38 ERA
last season in helping pitch the San Diego Padres into the World
Series. He won a World Series ring in 1997 while with the Florida
Marlins, then managed by Leyland.

Chile puts pressure on British government after Pinochet loses

immunity bid &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Fearful for its fledgling democracy, Chile is
stepping up pressure on Britain to release Gen. Augusto Pinochet
following a ruling by this nation's highest court that the former
Chilean dictator cannot claim immunity from prosecution.
	   A Chilean delegation was to visit Home Secretary Jack Straw on
Thursday to urge him to use his discretion to block Spanish
extradition proceedings against Pinochet.
	   Straw has until Wednesday to decide whether to follow up the
House of Lords ruling by allowing Spain's extradition bid to go
before the courts _ or to let Pinochet return home.
	   A backlash is sure to follow a decision either way, and the
pressure was already mounting from human rights organizations,
Chilean groups and Spanish prosecutors. Chilean President Eduardo
Frei ordered Foreign Minister Jose Miguel Insulza to fly to London
and Madrid to represent his government's position ``at all
levels.''
	   ``We would like a quick decision,'' said Chilean Ambassador
Mario Artaza, who was organizing the visit to the Home Office. ``It
will be like an open wound festering, so we have to close it
quickly.''
	   Pinochet, recovering from back surgery in Britain, was arrested
Oct. 16 on a Spanish warrant listing charges of genocide, terrorism
and torture. A Chilean government report says some 3,000 people
were murdered or disappeared at the hands of the secret police
during Pinochet's 1973-90 rule after he overthrew Salvadore
Allende, an elected Marxist.
	   In a 3-2 vote Wednesday which Pinochet watched delivered live on
television, the panel of five senior judges overturned an earlier
decision giving the former dictator immunity from arrest. The
ruling brought a mix of celebration and anger in Chile and
worldwide, and dashed Pinochet's hopes of leaving for home
Wednesday on his 83rd birthday.
	   Now if Straw gives the go-ahead, British magistrates will begin
acting on the Spanish extradition request. Under British law,
Pinochet can appeal at each stage _ potentially dragging the case
out for months
	   If Straw allows Pinochet to return home on ``compassionate''
grounds, he would be overturning what human rights groups see as a
great international precedent.
	   Straw said he will act in a quasi-judicial manner _ not
politically _ and has refused to comment. This spring, Straw
blocked the extradition of an IRA suspect to Germany citing the
woman's frail medical condition which he contended would make it
``unjust and oppressive'' to extradite her.
	   On the same day that Straw is to make his decision, Pinochet is
due to appear in Bow Street Magistrate's Court, a formality
required of anyone facing an extradition order.

	   AMRITSAR, India (AP) _ A derailed train was struck by an express
passenger train in northwestern India Thursday, killing at least 55
people and injuring more than 230 others, police said.
	   The Amritsar-bound Frontier Mail from New Delhi derailed between
Khanna and Payal villages and seven cars fell on the tracks.
Minutes later, the Calcutta-bound Sealdah Express coming from Jammu
on another track collided with the derailed cars, according to
Amrit Lal, a police officer at Khanna.
	   The accident occurred at 3:35 a.m. (2200 GMT Wednesday), Lal
said in a telephone interview. The area is 228 kilometers (140
miles) southeast of Amritsar.
	   The engine and at least four cars of the express train were
crumpled like paper in the impact, Lal said. Rescue workers cut the
cars with acetylene torches to recover 55 bodies. More bodies were
still lying in the cars and authorities have called for more
equipment, he said.
	   Workers took 230 people to local government hospitals and
private doctors. Doctors said the condition of 36 people was
serious, according to S.K. Mirza, an officer at the state police
control room.
	   A passenger ran a few kilometers (miles) along the tracks to
alert a railroad watchman, who called authorities and stopped all
other trains in the area.
	   Traffic along the northern routes in Punjab were suspended to
allow workers to rescue the passengers and remove the train cars.

U.S. clergymen arrive with aid for Chiapas
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAN CRISTOBAL DE LAS CASAS, Mexico (AP) _ Thirty American
clergymen arrived Wednesday in the southern state of Chiapas, where
they will deliver supplies and medicine to sympathizers of leftist
Zapatista rebels.
	   Lucius Walker, spokesman for Chicago-based Pastors for Peace,
said some 12 tons of aid will be distributed in towns where support
for the rebels runs high, such as in Chenalho, Altamirano, Las
Margaritas and San Andres Larrainzar.
	   While the Mexican government has imposed travel restrictions on
foreigners in Chiapas, Walker said his group had permission to
speak to Indian leaders and government officials.
	   ``We are not categorized as observers, but as pastors we are not
deaf nor blind and we will try to see and listen to what is
happening,'' he said.
	   The Zapatista National Liberation Army staged a weeklong
uprising in January 1994 to seek greater rights for the state's
impoverished Indians. The Zapatistas since have remained hidden in
Chiapas' Lacandon jungle.
	   In February, Mexico deported the former director of Pastors for
Peace, Tom Hansen, saying that he had violated terms of his visa.
	   Mexican law bans foreigners from participating in domestic
politics. Dozens of foreign political activists and observers were
expelled earlier this year under allegations that they had
interfered in the rebel conflict.

<TEXT>
	   GREENSBORO, North Carolina (AP) _ Keith Primeau scored twice and
goaltender Trevor Kidd returned to last year's form as the Carolina
Hurricanes defeated the San Jose Sharks 3-0 Wednesday night.
	   The victory snapped a three-game losing streak for the Southeast
Division-leading Hurricanes, while the Sharks remained the NHL's
only winless team on the road, falling to 0-5-3 away from home.
	   Kidd finished second in the National Hockey League last season
in save percentage and fifth in goals-against average, but was
relegated to a backup role after a slow start and the excellent
play of Arturs Irbe.
	   But Kidd shined in his first action since Nov. 11 _ a span of
six games. He was razor-sharp with his glove in making 36 saves to
record his 14th career shutout.
 &UR; Sabres 4, Rangers 2
	   In Buffalo, New York, Petr Nedved returned to the New York
Rangers in a five-player trade with Pittsburgh, but Dixon Ward and
the Sabres spoiled the moment.
	   Ward had his first career hat trick with two goals in the first
period and another in the second. It was Ward's first multi-goal
game in his third season as a Sabre and his first since he scored
two goals for Vancouver on Jan. 4, 1993, when he and Nedved were
Canucks teammates.
	   Darryl Shannon scored a power-play goal in the third period for
the Sabres, unbeaten in their last six games at home (5-0-1) and
unbeaten in their last eight games against the Rangers (5-0-3).
	   Nedved, who held out on Pittsburgh for a year and a half,
returned to the Rangers in a multi-player deal that sent Alexei
Kovalev to the Penguins.
 &UR; Capitals 5, Penguins 4
	   In Washington, Peter Bondra, who earlier reached the 500-point
level, scored on a powerful slap shot from the top of the right
circle with 3:48 remaining to give the Washington Capitals a 5-4
victory over the Pittsburgh Penguins.
	   Bondra had two goals and an assist for 502 career points and
Chris Simon had a goal and two assists for the Capitals, who broke
a two-game losing streak.
	   Stu Barnes scored three goals and Jaromir Jagr had three assists
for the Penguins, who were trying to win three in a row for the
first time this season.
 &UR; Bruins 1, Panthers 0
	   In Sunrise, Florida, Sergei Samsonov scored a power-play goal
late in the second period and goaltender Byron Dafoe made 26 saves
as the Boston Bruins defeated the Florida Panthers to extend their
road unbeaten streak to five games.
	   Dafoe notched his fourth shutout of the season to tie for the
league lead and the 11th of his eight-year career.
	   Boston is 5-1-3 in its last nine games and 4-0-1 in its last
five road games, while Florida is winless in its last five games
(0-3-2).
 &UR; Red Wings 5, Mighty Ducks 2
	   In Detroit, Sergei Fedorov had a goal and an assist in a
three-goal first period, leading the Detroit Red Wings over the
Mighty Ducks of Anaheim.
	   Darren McCarty, Tomas Holmstrom, Brendan Shanahan and Igor
Larionov also scored goals and Larry Murphy added two assists for
the Red Wings, who have won three straight after losing six of
eight.
	   Paul Kariya scored both goals for Anaheim, which lost the opener
of a six-game road trip after winning five of its previous seven
games.

Sales of personal computers in Japan seen rising 8 percent next
</HEADLINE>
year &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Sales of personal computers in Japan will likely
rise 8 percent next year, thanks in part to increased corporate
spending on information technology, an industry group said
Thursday.
	   The Japan Electronic Industry Development Association forecast
that PC shipments will climb to 7.8 million units in the fiscal
year starting in April, up from 7.2 million this year.
	   That follows an estimated 5 percent increase during the current
fiscal year, which ends in March.
	   The industry group attributed the higher demand to Japanese
companies' desire to upgrade their computer hardware following
government pledges to cut corporate taxes and implement other
measures to jump start the economy.
	   But demand for computer peripheral equipment such as printers
and scanners was expected to grow more slowly, it said.
	   Total sales of both PCs and peripheral devices were expected to
rise just 2 percent in the coming fiscal year to 6.12 trillion yen
(dlrs 50.61 billion).

	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore's bomb squad was investigating an
explosion at a bus stop early Thursday that left one man dead,
police said.
	   ``We are still trying to establish what caused the blast,''
police spokesman John Chang told The Associated Press.
	   He said residents near the bus stop in western Singapore heard
an explosion at about 12:55 a.m. (1655 GMT Wednesday). A 50-year
old rag and bone man _ someone who collects discarded items for
recycling _ suffered facial injuries and was pronounced dead on the
scene.
	   Chang added that there were no witnesses, and police were
continuing to investigate. He said the victim was alone at the
site, and could have been collecting trash at the bus stop.
	   Chang confirmed that ordinance disposal experts from the
Singapore Armed Forces were called to the scene and were assisting
in the investigation.
	   The area was cordoned off for several hours, but was opened to
traffic in the late morning, according to Singapore radio.
	   The explosion caused no damage to the bus stop complex or the
local train line located directly above it, said The New Paper.
	   Nearby residents told the afternoon newspaper that the explosion
was extremely loud and that they feared it had been a bomb.
	   The victim's ``body was black and smoke was coming out of his
chest,'' a storekeeper, who identified himself only as Chris, was
quoted as saying.

Budget ignored as Olympic egos rage
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TONY HARPER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Rod McGeoch was ``Mr. Olympics'' to his
friends and ``McGod'' to his enemies. Like all of his former
colleagues on the Sydney Olympic organizing committee, he has
plenty of both.
	   McGeoch, a well-connected lawyer who headed the 1993 bid team
that won Sydney the 2000 Olympics, quit the SOCOG board this week
after allegations that he sought a fee to talk about the Olympics
to a United States business delegation.
	   He denied knowledge of a request from his staff for money and
stepped down citing ``personal vilification'' after information was
leaked to media by a fellow board member.
	   McGeoch lost a battle of sizable egos in a SOCOG board that has
demonstrated it no longer is as bipartisan as it aims to be
portrayed. The rifts may get worse.
	   Australian Olympic Committee president John Coates, whose panel
can veto most SOCOG decisions, says politics will play an
increasing role in the next few months as Sydney prepares for an
Olympics less than two years away.
	   And the 2000 Games already are wrapped in politics aplenty.
	   McGeoch was part of the ruling conservative group when the
Sydney bid won. Now Labor rules in New South Wales and its Olympics
minister, Michael Knight, is also president of the Sydney
Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games, under an agreement
promoted by the International Olympic Committee.
	   Another SOCOG board member is Ian Armstrong, an archrival of
Knight and a member of the minority party in the opposition
conservative coalition.
	   Nick Greiner, a former conservative premier of the state, also
is on the board. So is Sandy Hollway, who has links to Labor. And
McGeoch had been promoted as a possible replacement for Knight,
should the conservatives regain control of state government in
elections next March.
	   ``There's no doubt to me that the Olympics will be a political
football in the next 4-5 months,'' Coates said Wednesday. ``I would
think it would be very tempting for the opposition (Liberal Party)
to seize on anything wrong in SOCOG.''
	   In this game, Knight is on defense and opposition leader Peter
Collins is attacking.
	   Collins called McGeoch's resignation ``a clear political
assassination'' by the Labor Party.
	   ``Over the last week the Labor Party have set out to destroy the
reputation of one of the architects of Sydney's victory in the
first place,'' Collins said.
	   McGeoch was subjected to several leaks from colleagues, but they
were not the first, just the latest. Knight has been on the
receiving end of many leaks and some may have wounded him in the
eyes of the electorate.
	   ``Our international image in the Olympic community and elsewhere
must be suffering as a result of what's gone on in the last
fortnight and I'm doing my part to make it stop,'' McGeoch said.
	   But McGeoch's resignation may do much more to alarm the Olympic
community than the leaks blamed for his decision.
	   SOCOG is faced with real problems in meeting its dlrs 1.64
billion budget. Its marketing boss, John Moore, says SOCOG is
almost dlrs 124 million short of its corporate-sponsorship goal of
dlrs 542 million.
	   ``I think we are obliged to look at every acceptable way of
raising revenue, because it is a stretch target,'' Hollway said
recently. ``It's doable but we have got to be very, very assertive
and innovative to get the money.''
	   The IOC's observation that the budget is ``ambitious but
feasible'' was hardly a vote of confidence.
	   So McGeoch's departure casts a publicity pall over SOCOG at a
time when it needs to generate public goodwill for vital
sponsorship.
	   ``Obviously, nobody can be happy with the public slanging that's
gone on in the past few days,'' Knight said. ``I personally wish
Rod McGeoch had stayed on the board.''
	   That, at least, would have spared an organizing committee
already faced with worrisome financial troubles from headlines like
``Javelin in the back for Mr. Olympics'' in Wednesday's edition of
The Australian, a national newspaper.
	   Most members of the Olympic community rallied around their
institution rather than McGeoch.
	   ``Sure he's had a tough week but don't we all _ I'm surprised
and disappointed and I would have thought his decision was
unnecessary,'' said Kevan Gosper, an IOC executive board member
from Australia.
	   ``I spoke to the IOC last night and they said the resignation
was unfortunate,'' said Phil Coles, the country's other IOC member.
``But you fill the position, you get on with the job, and that's
what we're doing.''

Report: Students clash with security forces in provincial capital
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Police in a provincial capital beat
student protesters who were demanding a trial for former President
Suharto, the official Antara news agency reported Thursday. At
least 54 students were injured.
	   The clash in Semarang on Wednesday came as students in Jakarta
tried to march on the home of Suharto, who quit in May after riots
and protests against his 32-year authoritarian rule.
	   Riot police blocked the students, who say 77-year-old Suharto
should be charged with corruption and human rights abuses.
	   President B.J. Habibie has ordered a new inquiry into Suharto's
wealth after an earlier probe failed to turn up evidence of
wrongdoing and was dismissed by critics as a whitewash.
	   In Semarang, students who gathered at the regional military
headquarters scuffled with security forces. Many of the injured
were hit with sticks or kicked, and three remained in a hospital on
Thursday.
	   Violence broke out after students pushed a military truck,
angering soldiers on the scene, Antara reported.
	   Semarang, the capital of Central Java province, is 400
kilometers (250 miles) east of Jakarta.
	   The government said Wednesday that Suharto had allowed the state
to take over seven charitable foundations that he established.
	   Critics have alleged that the foundations, worth dlrs 530
million, siphoned off state wealth to benefit business empires
built by the Suharto clan.

Former athlete appointed to SOCOG board
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Former Australian sprinter Marjorie
Jackson-Nelson was Thursday appointed to the board of the committee
in charge
	   of organizing the 2000 Sydney Olympics (SOCOG) following the
resignation of Rod McGeoch.
	   McGeoch, dubbed ``Mr. Olympics'' by the media after heading the
successful bid team, resigned Tuesday after days of infighting over
claims he sought a fee to speak on the Olympics to a United States
business delegation.
	   Jackson-Nelson is a popular figure in Australian sporting
circles and has done much work for charity, raising millions of
dollars for a leukemia research foundation she established
following her husband Peter's death from the disease in 1977.
	   She burst onto the world athletics scene at the 1952 Helsinki
Olympics, where she won gold medals in the 100 and 200 meters,
equaling the 100 meters and breaking the 200 meters world records
in the process.
	   Jackson-Nelson warned that recent media attention was damaging
Sydney's image throughout Australia and the rest of the world.
	   ``We shouldn't put up with what's been happening,''
Jackson-Nelson said. ``We should be united, not fighting. These are
the sort of headlines we are making overseas which we don't
deserve.''
	   Ironically, the appointment of the non-controversial
Jackson-Nelson has created a storm, with a prominent Aboriginal
leader accusing the New South Wales government of ignoring
indigenous Australians in the lead-up to the games.
	   Lois O'Donoghue, the chairwoman of SOCOG's indigenous advisory
committee formed by the organizers to ensure Aborigines are happy
with the running of the 2000 Games, very publicly pitched for the
vacant position after McGeoch's resignation.
	   ``I wouldn't say anything adverse against Marjorie Jackson and
her appointment,'' O'Donoghue said. ``She's worthy of
consideration, but on the other hand it's very disappointing from
an indigenous perspective.''
	   ``They (the government) deserve, in fact, to have the world
community criticize them.''

Asian Games promise closer-than-ever scrutiny for drugs
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By GRANT PECK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ High technology and greater awareness
may make next month's Asian Games a watershed in the war against
the use of performance-enhancing drugs in sports.
	   All drug tests for the two-week games, which open Dec. 6, will
be carried out with the most sophisticated tool available, a
half-million-dollar piece of equipment called a carbon isotope
ratio mass spectrometer.
	   The technology was first used at the Winter Olympics in Nagano,
Japan, earlier this year but for only one in every five drug tests.
	   There are at least two specific reasons for doing more sensitive
testing. The maximum acceptable trace levels for five types of
anabolic steroids, which are used to build muscle mass, have been
sharply reduced.
	   New techniques will also allow the laboratory to differentiate
between testosterone naturally produced by the body and that
illicitly ingested to boost muscle mass, said Dr. Thongtavat
Anukarahanonpa, a member of Thailand's National Doping Control
Center.
	   The list of banned substances includes stimulants, steroids,
hormones and diuretics, which are commonly used to mask the use of
other banned substances.
	   About 10 percent of the 8,000 to 10,000 athletes expected at the
games will face drug tests, Thongtavat said.
	   Abdul-Muttaleb al-Ahmed, the director general of the Olympic
Committee of Asia, the governing sports body for the region, said
Monday he was ``very much satisfied with the arrangements.''
	   Asked about potential doping problems, he said he was ``not
worried it will be a phenomenon _ awareness is increasing.''
	   ``There might be individual cases who use a certain substance,
either because of sheer ignorance or because they are not aware
they will be checked ... we expect very few cases,'' said al-Ahmed,
adding that he hoped the 13th Asian Games ``will be drug free.''
	   Several nations, including host Thailand, South Korea and China,
implemented random testing of their athletes ahead of the games.
	   Thailand last month announced plans to test 50 athletes in 10
sports. The results have not been announced.
	   Last week, South Korea's women's artistic gymnastics team
withdrew from competition after four of its six members failed
doping tests. One female swimmer was dropped from the national team
earlier this month after testing positive for the diuretic
furosemide, the same substance found in the gymnasts.
	   A billiards player was dropped from Japan's contingent after he
tested positive for methyltestosterone, a muscle-building male
hormone.
	   China's team has been most closely watched, since it has been
associated with the greatest number of doping scandals in recent
years.
	   Chinese sports officials said their athletes would be subject to
random tests in the run-up to the games, and this week a Chinese
sports newspaper quoted the swimming team coach as saying these
could include blood tests, which are considerably more rigorous
than the standard urine tests.
	   China was the top medal winner at the last Asian Games four
years ago in Hiroshima, Japan, but 11 of its athletes there,
including seven swimmers, failed drug tests.
	   Hopes of restoring its reputation for clean competition were set
back in January this year when four of its swimmers were suspended
from the championships in Perth, Australia, after they tested
positive for the diuretic triamterene.
	   Another Chinese swimmer and her coach were suspended after
Australian customs official found 13 vials of human growth hormone
in her luggage.
