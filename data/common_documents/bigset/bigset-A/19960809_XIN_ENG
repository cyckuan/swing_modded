<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Program for Drought-prone Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 8 (Xinhua) -- The National Economic Planning
Commission of Zimbabwe (NEPC) is designing a program aimed at
championing the transition from poverty to sustainable livelihood
for people in drought affected areas.
</P>
<P>
NEPC Director Ozias Hove today told participants at a one-day
seminar the program would be called the national policy and
program on drought management in Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
Hove said the program would achieve its goal through
empowering communities to mobilize their options for making the
transition from poverty to sustainable livelihood.
</P>
<P>
''The project will contribute to this result through model
efforts with communities to articulate and share relevant
information on successful community-based and owned adoptive
strategies,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Hove said the program would be designed bearing in mind that
emergency preparedness should be bridged between prevention and
development.
</P>
<P>
He said the program would provide policy information which
would enable policy makers, civil society institutions and
leaders to identify the institutional gaps and resource
constraints that impeded popular participation.
</P>
<P>
The one-day seminar was attended by about 20 participants from
various government ministries and non-governmental organizations.

<HEADLINE> ICRC Concerned About Situation in Grozny </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, August 8 (Xinhua) -- The International Committee of the
Red Cross (ICRC) said on Thursday that it is extremely worried
about the situation of the civilian population in the town of
Grozny, Chechenya, where fresh fighting broke out three days ago.
</P>
<P>
The town is now completely out of running water, and medical
supplies were urgently needed for the treatment of hundreds of
wounded, says the latest ICRC report.
</P>
<P>
The ICRC team in Grozny reported that fighting persisted very
close to its office building, where up to 100 civilians were
taking refuge, including 10 wounded.
</P>
<P>
The first priority was to evacuate the wounded and to bring
emergency medical assistance to the two hospitals the ICRC had
been assisting, said Fery Alaam, the head of the 11-member ICRC
team.
</P>
<P>
"However,..., we have no guarantees of security to carry out
this pressing task," he added.
</P>
<P>
Another priority was to provide water to the population as well
as to the hospitals. The ICRC said that it would send 15 water
cisterns and one truck load of medicines from its logistic base in
Nalchik to Grozny as soon as the situation allowed.
</P>
<P>
The committee called for a cease-fire to allow it to carry out
its humanitarian tasks. It added that until now its clearly-marked
office has been respected by all the warring parties.

<HEADLINE> Yunnan Township Enterprises Open Fair </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, August 8 (Xinhua) -- A fair featuring products of
rural township enterprises in southwest China's Yunnan province
opened here today.
</P>
<P>
To coincide with the Kunming export goods fair, it attracts 680
enterprises which display some 1,200 products.
</P>
<P>
More than 350 projects, in metallurgy, chemical industry,
machinery, electronics, building materials, light industry, and
foodstuff are being publicised at the fair to attract investors.
</P>
<P>
The past five years have been a boom period for the province's
township enterprises, which are playing a key part in the local
economy.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, total output value of township
enterprises reached 50.9 billion yuan (6.1 billion US dollars) in
1995, 6.7 times the 1990 figure.
</P>
<P>
Sales went up from 8.1 billion yuan in 1990 to 63.1 billion
yuan in 1995, increasing by a whopping annual rate of 51 percent,
and above 60 percent over the past three years.
</P>
<P>
Figures show that in 1995 total output value of township
enterprises accounted for 50.5 percent of the gross value of all
goods and services in the province's rural areas. Their industrial
output accounted for one-quarter of overall industrial output in
Yunnan.
</P>
<P>
The province has five pillar industries in building materials,
metallurgy, the "green" business, cigarettes, and service trades,
and plans to have sales of township enterprises reach 250 billion
yuan by the end of the century, with an annual growth rate of over
30 percent, and about half of farmers' per capita income coming
from them.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 8 (Xinhua) -- France today welcomed the
decision by the United States to lift its objection to the "Oil
for Food" plan for Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The plan, which in principle is in line with a U.N. Security
Council resolution, would allow Iraq to sell some of its oil to
buy food. It was not applied due to U.S. reservations over the
method of its application.
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Minister Herve de Charette said in a written
statement that the application of the resolution would "allow
alleviation of the sufferings of the people of Iraq."
</P>
<P>
"It is also a step in the direction of reintegration of Iraq
into the international community, which France wishes and
encourages," said de Charette.

<HEADLINE> Hubei To Increase Machinery, Electronics Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Central China's Hubei Province,
which exported 350 million US dollars' worth of machinery and
electronic products in 1995, plans to export a total of one
billion US dollars' worth by the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
One move the province will make is to put greater effort into
improving its mix of goods for export to increase the volume of
exports.
</P>
<P>
During the 1991-1995 period, the country granted 110 million
yuan in loans for provincial technology-upgrading projects for the
machinery industry.
</P>
<P>
While continuing with its traditional commodities, the province
will give priority to automobile, auto parts, motorcycle,
numerically-controlled machine tools, audio and video equipment,
and pharmaceutical equipment exports.
</P>
<P>
To do this, one-fourth of the province's development funds will
be committed to developing machinery products.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, provincial banks will give priority to local
machinery and electronics companies that have annual exports
surpassing five million US dollars each, to help them increase
their share of overseas markets.
</P>
<P>
The province will also develop some preferential policies for
local machinery and electronic companies that are foreign-funded
to help them with capital for energy, transportation, and
distribution of goods.

<HEADLINE> Afghan President Asks UN Envoy to Move to Kabul </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Afghan President Burhanuddin
Rabbani has asked the United Nations' special envoy to Afghanistan
to move his office to Kabul, said reports from the besieged
capital today.
</P>
<P>
"Special Ambassador Norbert Holl should move into Kabul for the
effectiveness of his mission," Rabbani was quoted as saying by
Radio Kabul, a state-run radio station.
</P>
<P>
Holl, who took over the job as the UN secretary-general's
special envoy to Afghanistan last month, has just moved his base
to the eastern Afghan city of Jalalabad from the Pakistani capital
of Islamabad.
</P>
<P>
He is coming under increasing pressure from Kabul's newly
formed coalition government to set up a base in Kabul for the
first time.
</P>
<P>
Holl said during his first visit to Kabul last week as UN
ambassador that the world body wanted to transfer its office to
Kabul but the almost daily rocket and shell attacks on the city
made the move impossible for the moment.
</P>
<P>
"It's obvious that the security situation must change a little
here before we can move to Kabul," he said during his visit to
Kabul.

<HEADLINE> Stock-Fund Flows Off Sharply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, August 8 (Xinhua) -- The money flowing into stock
mutual funds in the U.S. fell sharply in July to its lowest level
in almost two years, the New York Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
An industry group said it might be an ominous sign for the
stock market and perhaps a signal of the end of a period of record
growth in the mutual fund industry.
</P>
<P>
Some of the mutual fund companies now declined to provide
specific public information about how much money is flowing into
or out of their funds and which categories of funds have been in
or out of favor. That stands in contrast to recent months, when
the money was rolling in and the fund companies talked freely
about how popular their own funds were, according to the paper.
</P>
<P>
The Investment Company Institute, a trade group, estimated that
investors put 3.5 billion U.S. dollars into equity mutual funds
last month, down from 14.5 billion U.S. dollars in June. That is
the lowest monthly total since November 1994, when 3 billion U.S.
dollars flowed in, and a 20 percent drop from the average monthly
flow of 18 billion U.S. dollars over the last year.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, it said, many investors have stepped away
from the stock market, and it raised questions about whether the
fund companies view the cash flow data as more of a marketing tool
than as an industry statistic.

<P>
HARARE, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Sixty percent of small-to-medium
scale enterprises in Zimbabwe are facing serious viability
problems because their owners ventured into fields in which they
are not skilled, a business consultant said here today.
</P>
<P>
"A number of people go into fields they do not fully
understand because they are forced by circumstances," said
Ndumiso Mpofu, regional manager of the business extension
advisory services.
</P>
<P>
As a result, he said, the failure rate of small enterprises
was high.
</P>
<P>
Most local small-scale enterprises were started either by
retired, retrenched or frustrated people sometimes driven by
harsh circumstances, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Training programs should also target those people who are
successfully employed and may want to start businesses in fields
they already know and enjoy," he said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Envoy Preparing Ground for Balkan Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 8 (Xinhua) - U.S. Assistant Secretary of
State and Bosnia peace envoy John Kornblum today began a tour of
former Yugoslavia to prepare groundwork for a summit of Balkan
leaders on post-war elections in war-torn Bosnia, U.S. officials
said.
</P>
<P>
Kornblum, who had visited the Balkans for several times since
he took the position earlier this year, landed at Sarajevo airport
in the first leg of his trip which will also take him to the
Serbian capital Belgrade and the Croatian capital Zagreb.
</P>
<P>
Kornblum's trip was specially designed to prepare for a visit
to the region next week by U.S. Secretary of State Warren
Christopher. The U.S. Secretary plans to get a first-hand look at
preparations for Bosnian general elections scheduled for September
14.
</P>
<P>
Christopher was due to hold talks with NATO officials in
Brussels on Monday before hosting a meeting of the presidents of
Bosnia, Croatia and Serbia in Geneva on Wednesday, a spokesman for
the U.S. State Department told reporters on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Geneva conference will be focused on Bosnia's national
election which is supposed to help reunify the divided country.
Voters will elect joint governing bodies charged with ruling over
a loose Bosnian union.
</P>
<P>
U.S. State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said that
Christopher will also discuss with leaders of three former
Yugoslav republics "what advances need to be made to create the
conditions for free and fair elections".
</P>
<P>
As a main broker of the Bosnian peace agreement signed in last
December, the United States strongly hopes that the accord will be

<HEADLINE> Daewoo Group of South Korea to Sell Cars in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Daewoo Group, one of the two
leading auto makers of the Republic of Korea, plans to enter the
U.S. light-vehicle market for the first time in late 1997 or early
1998.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal reported today that the company has
been preparing for its American debut for five years and hopes to
sell 100,000 vehicles a year by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Daewoo, which is known for its inexpensive small cars sold in
Asia and Europe, is taking a risk with its new U.S. strategy. It
is entering a crowded light-vehicle market that is unlikely to
show substantial growth in coming years, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
However, Caewoo's chairman, Kim Woo-Choong, said that his
company would follow its successful strategy in Western Europe by
selling its cars directly to consumers, instead of through
traditional dealerships.
</P>
<P>
The "no-dealer distribution" is expected to eliminate the cost
of developing and maintaining a dealership network. But market
analysts said that 100,000 vehicles -- Daewoo's goal for 2000 --
would amount to only about 0.7 percent of the current U.S.
light-vehicle market.
</P>
<P>
Daewoo currently produces nearly one million units a year in
South Korea and predicts it will produce another million overseas
by 1998, the paper said. Investments have been centered in Poland,
Romania, the Czech Republic, Uzbekstan, China, India and Vietnam.
The company has been able to develop an average of three new
models a year for each of its platforms, according to Kim.

KUWAIT CITY, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak arrived in Jeddah, western Saudi Arabia, today on a short
visit for talks with Saudi King Fahd on the Middle East peace
process in light of the latest Israeli stances on the issue.
</P>
<P>
The local Kuwait News Agency KUNA quoted Egyptian diplomatic

leaders on the results of his Washington visit last week and his
talks with U.S. President Bill Clinton.

after the conclusion of the summit talks between the Egyptian

future of the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
They said President Mubarak and King Fahd would review the

which reiterated the Arab stand on the land-for-peace principle.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 7 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
today warned the United States of "immediate retaliation measures"
if French enterprises are touched by the d'Amato-Kennedy law.
</P>
<P>
Chirac's warning came as he was joining a meeting of the
cabinet, said government spokesman Alain Lamassoure.
</P>
<P>
"If it appears that French enterprises are directly touched by
this kind of measure, France should then take immediate
retaliatory measures," the president was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Chirac said that under these circumstances, France and Europe
would "be endowed" with an adapted legislation, a mirror image of
the American, and would be able to summon an equally strong stand.
</P>
<P>
He said the French government was "particularly firm, in
liaison with our European partners, in respect of this unilateral
initiative of the United States."
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton signed the d'Amato-Kennedy law on
Monday to reinforce embargoes against Iran and Libya by dissuading
foreign companies and individuals from investing heavily in the
oil industries of the two countries.

<HEADLINE> South Lebanon Ceasefire Committee Convenes First </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 8 (Xinhua) -- The five-nation committee
monitoring the cease-fire in south Lebanon between Israel and the
Lebanese pro-Iranian Hezbollah held its first meeting today, which
was overshadowed by Israel's renewed air raids on eastern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from the U.S., Israel, France, Syria and
Lebanon convened at the U.N. base in Naqura, south Lebanon, to
discuss details on how to cooperate on observing the truce.
</P>
<P>
The focus of the first meeting was on getting acqainted for
the participants and setting up a working schedule, but there was
no direct contact between officials from Israel and Syria, the
two feuding rivals.
</P>
<P>
The committee, formed under the U.S.-brokered cease-fire
agreement ending the 17-day Operation Grapes of Wrath launched by
Israel in April, is to deal with violations of the cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
Under the April understanding, both Israeli forces and
Hezbollah guerrillas are banned from using or attacking civilian
areas on either side of the border.
</P>
<P>
However, the agreement did not rule out Hezbollah guerrilla
attacks against Israeli military targets in the Israeli
self-declared "security zone." Israel also failed to obtain
guarantees from Syria to rein in Hezbollah, which vowed never to
lay down their arms before liberating south Lebanon from the
Israeli occupation.
</P>
<P>
Today's meeting was held only hours after Israeli fighter
planes bombed suspected Hezbollah targets in Baalbek in the
Syria-controlled Bekaa Valley in eastern Lebanon. A radio
transmission station was reportedly hit, but no casualties were
reported.
</P>
<P>
The air raid was apparently launched in retaliation for the
two Hezbollah attacks near Barrachit, central sector of the
"security zone" on Monday and Tuesday, in which one Israeli
soldier was killed and four others wounded.

JOHANNESBURG, August 7 (Xinhua) --South African President

<HEADLINE> France Marks Great Teacher's 100th Birthday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 7 (Xinhua) -- France will mark on October 15 the
100th birthday of the founder of modern pedagogy, Celestin Freinet
(1896-1966).
</P>
<P>
Freinet is the man who first introduced the ideas of
free-thinking for school children, progressive training, training
of expression, full individual development for children and
teamwork.
</P>
<P>
The celebration, initiated by the Cooperative Institute of
Modern School of France (ICEM) which he founded, will include a
conference to be attended by children, exhibitions, seminars,
video-shows, sales and book publishings.
</P>
<P>
Born at a small village called Gars in the Alpes-Maritimes near
Grasse, Freinet graduated from a normal school in Nice, and joined
World War I during which he was wounded in the Battle of Verdun.
</P>
<P>
Freinet joined pacifist and communist movements after the war
and took a teaching job in a school near his hometown, where he
introduced the ideas of free-thinking and proletarianism in
teaching, while initiating many teaching techniques such as using
printing in school and publishing children's writings.
</P>
<P>
He set up a private school Vence with his wife Elise in 1935
and set up the Children's Front together with the famous writer
Roman Rolland in the same year.
</P>
<P>
Arrested in 1940 for spreading the ideas of the leftwing
People's Front, he joined the resistance to the Nazi occupation
after being released. He bought back his school Vence in 1947 and
founded the ICEM in 1948.
</P>
<P>
Today, some 20,000 teachers around France claim to be followers
of Freinet, 100 public schools use his pedagogy and some 500
schools are heavily influenced by him.
</P>
<P>
Activities will also be held in Mexico, Germany, Switzerland,
Brazil, Canada, Spain and Belgium to mark the great teacher's
birthday.

<HEADLINE> Non-aligned Group Suggests Action Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, August 8 (xinhua) -- Twenty nine countries of the
non-aligned group announced here on Thursday a program of action
calling for active multilateral efforts to identify, negotiate and
implement step-by-step measures for the complete elimination of
nuclear weapons by the year 2020.
</P>
<P>
Presenting the program to the Geneva-based Conference on
Disarmament on behalf of 29 non-aligned countries, Egyptian
Ambassador Mounir Zahran said "the issue of nuclear disarmament is
one which must retain at the forefront of the international
disarmament agenda until we are able to rid our planet of the
nuclear threat...."
</P>
<P>
On March 14, the non-aligned countries first suggested the
disarmament Conference to establish an ad hoc committee to start
negotiations on nuclear disarmament. The program of action
suggested on Thursday was intended to be carried out by the
proposed ad hoc committee.
</P>
<P>
The program is a three phase one, the last phase of which
continues until the year 2020.
</P>
<P>
For the first phase from 1996 to 2000, they called on countries
to immediately and concurrently start negotiations on a convention
banning the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons, on a treaty
to eliminate nuclear weapons, and on a treaty banning the
production of fissile material for nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
They also called on countries to conclude agreements on
stopping all nuclear weapon tests and closure of all nuclear
weapon test sites, and on measures to prevent the use of new
technologies for the upgrading of existing nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
Measures suggested for this phase also include moratorium and
prohibition on testing of outer space weapons systems, and
commencement and conclusion of negotiations on further reductions
of nuclear arsenals -- START III.
</P>
<P>
During the second phase, from 2000 to 2010, countries are
called upon to take measures to reduce the nuclear arsenals and to
promote confidence between states.
</P>
<P>
The third phase, from 2010 to 2020 is suggested for full
implementation of the treaty to eliminate nuclear weapons and
consolidation of a nuclear weapon free world.

PYONGYANG, August 8 (Xinhua) -- The relationship between the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) and Japan would only
be decided by Japan's attitude over its historic crimes against
the Korean people, says a DPRK writer.
</P>
<P>
An article carried in the Rodong Sinmun newspaper said the DPRK
and Japan had not normalized their diplomatic ties after Japan's
colonization over the Korean Peninsula ended half a century ago
because Japan had not shown enough serious contrition.

It said Japan should apologize and pay compensation to the
Korean people.

<HEADLINE> Cease-fire Monitoring Committee Meet in South </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Military officers and diplomats
from the U.S., France, Syria, Lebanon and Israel, who make up a
committee overseeing a limited truce on the Lebanese-Israeli
border, held their meeting today in a southern Lebanese border
town.
</P>
<P>
The state-run Lebanese National News Agency said that the
cease-fire monitoring committee, which was established under the
April 26 understanding brokered by the U.S. between Lebanon and
Israel, held its first meeting in Naqura and the meeting was
"blacked out from the press."
</P>
<P>
The agency said that the meeting was held in the headquarters
of the U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) and lasted less than
three hours.
</P>
<P>
This was the first time for Syrian, Lebanese and Israeli
officers to sit on a single negotiating table on the Lebanese land
since 1978 when the Jewish state launched an invasion into this
country.
</P>
<P>
Syria and Lebanon had asked to set the committee's
headquarters in Cyprus, but the demand was refused by the United
States and Israel.
</P>
<P>
The news agency said that the American team led by David
Greenlee, a diplomat and the present chairman of the five-nation
committee, arrived first at Naqura by helicopters rented from
Israel.
</P>
<P>
The chairmanship is to rotate between the U.S. and France with
a five-month mandate for each.
</P>
<P>
The American team was followed by representatives from France,
Syria and Lebanon who "arrived there by helicopters of the
multinational peacekeeping forces," the report added.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli delegation, led by General David Tasour, an
officer responsible for foreign relations in the Israeli army,
arrived at Naqura "at the previously defined time," the official
news agency noted.
</P>
<P>
Upon their arrival, the delegates "entered a special room and
sit behind a round table, meanwhile the French contingent in
UNIFIL which was in charge of the security of the meeting had
taken strict measures around the center," the agency said.
</P>
<P>
The meeting started at 11:00 a.m. (08:00 GMT) and lasted until
1:45 p.m. (10:45 GMT) and then the delegates left for the places
where they came from without making any statements.
</P>
<P>
Israel's army spokesman had said that today's meeting was a
preparative one aimed at mapping out regulations organizing the
committee's work.
</P>
<P>
The committee will deal with violations of the cease-fire
understanding reached between Lebanon and Israel on April 26,
which put an end to a 17-day Israeli blitz against the pro-Iranian
Hezbollah guerrillas in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Under the understanding, Israeli forces and the Lebanese
Hezbollah guerrillas are banned from firing at civilian areas on
either side of the border or launch attacks from those areas.
</P>
<P>
But it does not bar guerrilla attacks on the Israeli forces in
the Israeli-occupied border strip in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
A number of bloody clashes have sporadically occurred between the
Israeli forces and Hezbollah guerrillas since the enforcement of
the cease-fire in which 17 Israeli soldiers were killed and dozens
of others wounded.

UNITED NATIONS, August 8 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Security Council today expressed its support for the coming
elections in Bosnia and called upon the parties to ensure the
prompt functioning of these institutions after the elections.

<P>
A statement of the council president Tono Eitel of Germany said
that the Security Council expected the parties in Bosnia to
increase their efforts towards the maintenance and further
enhancement of conditions necessary to ensure democratic elections
and to abide fully by the results of those elections.
</P>
<P>
The council stressed the importance of the agreement reached by
the Bosnia and Bosnian Croat leaderships in Mostar and
facilitated by the European Union Administration of Mostar that
had secured Bosnian Croat participation in a unified city
administration in Mostar on the basis of the election results of
June 30, 1996, according to the statement.

MAPUTO, August 8 (Xinhua) -- The General Union of Cooperatives
(UGC), one of leading meat chicken producers in the capital of

chickens from South Africa which have dominated the Maputo
market.
</P>
<P>
The criticism was made when Mozambican Prime Minister Pascoal
Mocumbi was visiting UGC's chicken farms.

UGC chairman Cilina Cossa complained that the union, which had

Africa in recent six months.
</P>

He added that as 200 tons of meat chicken from South Africa
have been poured into the market in Maputo at a cheaper price in
recent six months, the union still has 1,300 tons of meat chicken
in stock for sale.

A trade official said that a technical group is investigating
the matter and he expected responding measures will be taken.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak: Egypt, Saudi Arabia Hold Identical Views </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
said today that Egypt and Saudi Arabia hold identical views on the
importance of establishing a just and comprehensive peace in the
Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak, who held a two-hour meeting with King Fahd today in
Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, told reporters accompanying him on the
previously unannounced visit that he and the Saudi monarch
"completely agree on the importance that just and comprehensive
peace is achieved in the Middle East."
</P>
<P>
He was quoted by the Egyptian Middle East News Agency (MENA) as
saying that his talks with King Fahd dealt with means of resuming
the Syrian-Israeli and Lebanese-Israeli peace talks.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that all agreements signed in the peace process
must be implemented, MENA said.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian diplomatic sources said that Mubarak briefed King Fahd
on the results of his visit to Washington last week and his talks
with U.S. President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
The lightning visit came just one day after Mubarak met with
Syrian President Hafez al-Assad in the Egyptian Mediterranean port
city of Alexandria Wednesday to explore ways to revive the stalled
Arab-Israeli peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The meeting between Mubarak and King Fahd today was the latest
of a flurry of contacts between Arab leaders for consultations
aimed at pushing forward the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak is also due to meet with Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat in Cairo Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Later, Arafat will preside over a two-day meeting of the
Central Committee of the Palestinian Fatah Movement in Cairo.

<HEADLINE> French Government to Pursue Inquiry into Bank Leaders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 8 (Xinhua) -- The French government will pursue
judicial inquiry into the former leaders of the Paris-based bank
of Credit Lyonnais (CL) over a financial disarray suffered by the
bank for several years.
</P>
<P>
The Minister of Economy and Finances Jean Arthuis said today
that he has asked Justice Minister Jacques Toubon to enlarge
judicial inquiry from affiliate departments of the CL into its
headquarters, according to local daily Le Monde.
</P>
<P>
"I mean to have the responsibilities sought and that the
leaders give their accounts," he said.
</P>
<P>
Arthuis said that this decision was motivated by a report by
the Audit Office on one of the affiliate department of the CL,
which made him think that "the accounts of the years 1991, 1992
and 1993 do not give an image loyal" to the truth.
</P>
<P>
When Jean-Yves Haberer was president of CL from 1988 to 1993,
the bank developed a policy of "headlong rush," which resulted
in a loss of 20 billion francs (4 billion U.S. dollars) between
1992 and 1994. Haberer was replaced by Jean Peyrelevade for the
financial disarray.
</P>
<P>
Despite two government salvage plans and the "unballasting"
of 135 billion francs (27 billion U.S. dollars) of doubtful funds
from the bank, the CL has always remained in difficulty since.
</P>
<P>
According to Le Monde, the inquiry may attain the present
president of the central Bank of France Jean-Claude Trichet, who
was the Director of Treasury at the time and was in charge of
controlling public banks like the CL.
</P>
<P>
President Jacques Chirac indirectly attacked Trichet on the
July 14 National Day by accusing the state department in charge of
banks of failing to exercise their functions and thus leading to
"financial catastrophes" like the one of CL.
</P>
<P>
Agence France Presse today quoted the American magazine
"Fortune" as saying in its July edition that the Italian
financial swindler Giancarlo Parretti obtained large sums of loans
from the CL in early 1990s through offering "several jugs of
wine"to the leaders of CL.
</P>
<P>
Describing the affair as the "biggest financial swindle in
history," Fortune said that a bunch of leaders of CL were
corrupted by Parretti, who gave out many gifts to them to let them
pay for his acquisitions in Hollywood, including Cannon, Pathe and
MGM movie workshops.

<HEADLINE> IFAW Condemns Namibia's Seal Culling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 8 (Xinhua) -- The International Fund for
Animal Welfare (IFAW) today condemned the resumption of seal
culling by the Namibian government as irresponsible,
short-sighted and cruel, reported the South African Press
Association.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued in Windhoek, IFAW's African Director
David Barrit said Namibia seems hell-bent on destroying its seals
population because of a misguided belief by fishermen that seals
are a threat to their catch.
</P>
<P>
The Namibian cabinet on Wednesday approved a quota of 17,000
seals pups and 3,500 bull seals for the 1996 harvesting season,
which started on August 6 to November 20.
</P>
<P>
The Information and Broadcasting Ministry said in a statement
that the number of pups recommended for harvesting "represents
30.8 percent of the pups estimated to be alive" and was in line
with the number presented in previous years.
</P>
<P>
Namibia said the approval of the seal harvest reiterated the
government's position that seals are a renewable resource, and
therefore, should be managed on a sustainable basis and should be
harvested accordingly.
</P>
<P>
However, Barrit said there is increasing worldwide revulsion
about the Namibian seal slaughter.
</P>
<P>
The plight of Namibia's seals is becoming an "international
scandal and inevitably there will be increasing pressure on the
Namibian government to stop the slaughter, or face sanctions and
aid-cut-offs", said Barrit.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Forces Vow to Defend National Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Iran today warned that its
military forces will deal the severest possible blow to the
U.S. forces if Iran is attacked by them.
</P>
<P>
Mohsen Rezaee, Commander of the Islamic Revolution Guard Corp
(IRGC), said "the United States of America should realize that
the Persian Gulf waterway should be safe and secure for all the
regional people."
</P>
<P>
"If such a safety and security is impaired, those involved in
such designs will be the real losers and receive the severest
possible blow," he added.
</P>
<P>
General Rezaee underlined that Iran will defend all the
reconstructed areas, its sea and air gates, its airspace and land
entries with all its power.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted the statement by the Iranian commander is
the strongest response to the remarks by U.S. Defense Secretary
William Perry who threatened to launch military attack on Iran on
charge of "possible involvement" in June 25 bombing of a
U.S. military housing complex in Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
The situation in the Gulf is rather tense since both the
American forces and the Iranian forces are in the state of the
highest alert for any possible military confrontation.
</P>
<P>
Iran Wednesday lodged a protest against U.S. fighters'
violation of its airspace, particularly in Bushehr where Iran is
building a nuclear power plant with Russian help.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian authorities said that American fighters violated
Iran's airspace for three times in a single day on August 3.
</P>
<P>
Rezaee said, "The Basij (Volunteer) forces and IRGC forces have
been fully behind Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei and have
ardently followed his commands and have actively been present in
all the scenes."
</P>
<P>
He said that these forces are fully alert, prepared and "will
defend the interest of Iran without a speck of doubt."
</P>
<P>
He focused on the agenda of the coordination of strategic move
against the conspiratorial acts of the enemies in order to
counteract their designs against Iran's sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
Presenting his analysis of the volatile development in the
Middle East and the Gulf, he stressed the need for IRGC forces to
be vigilant and fully alert of "surreptitious designs of the
enemies."
</P>
<P>
Rezaee stated that with the repeated military, political and
economic defeat over its policies against Iran, the United States
is now fomenting new covert operations against the Iranian
nation.

<HEADLINE> Rwanda Closes Border With Burundi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Rwanda announced today that it will
close from Friday its border with neighboring Burundi, according
to local press reports.
</P>
<P>
The announcement was made by the Rwandan Foreign Ministry on
Radio Rwanda, said the reports.
</P>
<P>
The decision contradicts with a declaration by the Rwandan
strongman Paul Kagame, who said lately that he was thinking about
supporting his Tutsi brothers across the border.
</P>
<P>
Rwanda is the only country whose border remains open with
Burundi until now, after Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda and Ethiopia
closed their borders to impose sanctions against the military
government of Burundi.
</P>
<P>
Zaire closed its border at the request of the Burundi army, who
accused Kinshasa of providing shelter for Hutu rebels.
</P>
<P>
Rwanda is ruled by the Tutsi-dominated National Patriotic
Front, which defeated the country's Hutu army in 1994 after a
genocide against the Tutsis and Hutu moderates took place in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Burundi's Tutsi-dominated army staged a putsch last month
ousting a Hutu president.

<HEADLINE> Confidence Surges in UK Manufacturing Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Manufacturers in all regions in
Britain are expecting to raise output over the next four months as
confidence rises and the economy picks up, according to a latest
quarterly industrial trends survey.
</P>
<P>
The survey, jointly conducted by the Confederation of British
Industry (CBI) and the Business Strategies, the economic
consultancy, showed that six out of the 11 regions covered saw
growth in orders in the last four months, a clear improvement on
the previous survey published in May when five out of those six
had seen flat, or falling new orders.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in those regions reporting falling orders in the
latest survey, the rate of decline was slower than in the four
months to April.
</P>
<P>
The CBI said that orders are expected to rise in all regions
except the East Midlands, with manufacturers in Northern Ireland
and Wales the most optimistic about the orders outlook over the
next four months.
</P>
<P>
The survey showed that the growth in orders was primarily
concentrated in those regions where exports have increased,
hinting that export demand, rather than domestic demand, is still
providing a key motor for manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
The survey also confirmed that price inflation remained under
control. Domestic prices fell or were stable in nine out of the 11
regions over the last four months and manufacturers in most areas
expect price cuts over the next four months.

<HEADLINE> North China City Trying to Join The Opening Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Beijing, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Visitors to Zhangjiakou, a city
100 km to the northwest of Beijing can't help remarking on how
much the vast wasteland looks like a movie setting for a World War
II tank battle.
</P>
<P>
The city is located in the northwestern part of Hebei Province,
near Shanxi Province and the Inner Mongolian Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
For centuries, Zhangjiakou has been cited as the northwestern
gate of Beijing and therefore of great strategic importance to the
Chinese capital.
</P>
<P>
As a result, it was not open up to the outside world until
recently, even though many parts of China, especially coastal
areas in the south and east, had seen rapid economic growth since
the country launched its reform and opening drive in the late
1970s.
</P>
<P>
The delay caused problems at Zhangjiakou, a poor area where
half its rural population were living below the poverty line, with
an annual per-capita income of 400 yuan, according to a 1992
statistics.
</P>
<P>
So, the central government put 10 counties and one district
attached to Zhangjiakou in a national seven-year program to
provide special poverty aid.
</P>
<P>
Under mounting pressure to get the former "forbidden zone" out
of poverty, approval was finally given by central officials to
start opening the door to outside investors on May 9, 1995, an
important day for local people, because they wanted to cash in on
the national and international economic development.
</P>
<P>
The city government, with support from central and provincial
authorities, formulated policies to attract investment. A new
slogan is: "Everyone is held responsible for attracting
investment. Everything is related to attracting investment."
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of local businesspeople and officials have been sent
abroad to explore markets, and a large number of overseas
entrepreneurs, many from multinationals, have been invited to take
a look at local investment environment.
</P>
<P>
Two development zones have opened and local products have been
on display in many trade fairs, either held by the city itself or
by other localities. To further publicize Zhangjiakou, various
media have been asked to help spread word of the city and its
preferential policies for investors.
</P>
<P>
"Zhangjiakou used to be a very conservative and closed place
and people in other areas knew little about us. We want to change
that," said Li Hongchang, a municipal official in charge of
publicity.
</P>
<P>
The efforts have paid off. By the end of June, Zhangjiakou had
116.26 million US dollars in overseas investment and 179
foreign-funded enterprises with a total capital of 436.36 million
US dollars, 87 of which are operational. Investors from 17
countries and regions, including Hong Kong, Taiwan, the United
States, Australia, and South Korea have invested in the city.
</P>
<P>
France has also agreed to provide Zhangjiakou with 48 million
US dollars in government credits for a local fertilizer project
and talks are under way between the municipal government and the
Danish government on 2.6 million US dollars in loans for setting
up a wind-powered generator station. And the Asian Development
Bank is ready to provide 1.18 million US dollars in loans for a
project for producing 2,400 tons of grape juice a year.
</P>
<P>
"This is only the beginning," said Liu Ru, a municipal official
at the level of vice-mayor. Local officials are optimistic about
the future of Zhangjiakou.
</P>
<P>
With vast tracts of land for cultivation and grasslands waiting
to be used, he said, the city boasts abundant mineral and tourist
resources which a major attraction for domestic and foreign
investors.
</P>
<P>
And last, but not least, its generous and hospitable people are
most impressive and attractive to outsiders, Liu said.

<HEADLINE> Tibet Stands Its Ground in Recent Earthquakes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, August 9 (Xinhua) -- No casualties were reported during
several moderately-strong earthquakes that hit southwest China's
Tibet Autonomous Region recently, Xinhua has learned.
</P>
<P>
On July 31, a quake measuring 5.7 on the Richter Scale and an
aftershock with a magnitude of 5 struck Xaitongmoin County, 100
kilometers from Xigaze, second largest city in the region.
</P>
<P>
The same place was hit by a quake that measured 6 and
aftershocks measuring 5.1 on July 3, and a quake measuring 5.1 on
May 10.
</P>
<P>
Although the quakes caused landslides and damaged ditches, no
people or livestock were killed. During the latest quake, only
five houses collapsed.
</P>
<P>
Local seismologists attribute this to the small population in
the region, and the fact that epicenters were mainly in remote
mountainous and pasture areas, and most occurred in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Forecasts and quake-prevention measures have also helped, as
well as quick rescue efforts.
</P>
<P>
Tibet is located where the earth's Indian Plate and the
Eurasian Plate meet, a place that is active seismically. Forecasts
in June said that several quakes were likely.

<HEADLINE> International Symposium On Education for The Blind Ends </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, August 9 (Xinhua) -- A five-day international symposium
on education for the blind and people with poor eye-sight ended
here today.
</P>
<P>
It was attended by heads of more than 20 schools for the blind
in China and representatives from the United States, Thailand,
Hong Kong, Taiwan, and other countries and regions, and focused on
the spread of education for people with poor eye-sight in various
countries, teaching blind children in normal classes, and building
schools for the blind into study centers for educating the blind.
</P>
<P>
Early involvement on blind children's education and
modernization of education for the blind with electric equipment
were new topics for study at the symposium.
</P>
<P>
The United Nation's Educational Scientific and Cultural

<HEADLINE> Chinese Litchi Pass Japanese Quarantine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Some 1,700 kg of Chinese
litchis for export to Japan have passed inspection by the
Quarantine Bureau for Animals and Plants in Guangzhou, capital of
south China's Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
For a long time, litchis have been denied entry by the Japanese
government because of the possibility of disease. The first 900 kg
of litchis were exported to Japan in July last year and proved
popular with the Japanese.
</P>
<P>
With the support of the Chinese government, the quarantine
office started experimenting with disease protection for litchis
in 1987, a move that proved successful with Japanese quarantine
officials.
</P>
<P>
Japan is to continue its litchi imports from China and
businessmen plan to increase the import volume to 100,000 kg per
year.

<HEADLINE> Right to Subsistence and Development Above All for China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, August 9 (Xinhua) -- The achievement of a right to
subsistence and development is fundamental for an overall
improvement in the human rights situation in China, a developing
country of 1.2 billion people, a senior Chinese official said here
today.
</P>
<P>
"For without the basic guarantee for the livelihood of the
people, the enjoyment and protection of human rights would be
sheer empty talk," Wu Jianmin, Chinese permanent representative to
the United Nations Office at Geneva, said.
</P>
<P>
He was speaking at the 48th session of the United Nations
Sub-Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of
Minorities.
</P>
<P>
Fully aware of this point, the Chinese Government had long
devoted itself to developing the economy and raising people's
living standard, Wu said. He noted that between 1991 and 1995
China's annual growth rate averaged 12.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
China's economic development had led to a marked improvement in
its people's rights to subsistence and development, and an overall
enhancement of their collective enjoyment of human rights, Wu said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Chinese Government attached equal importance to
the protection of the civil and political rights of the people as
provided for by law.
</P>
<P>
China followed its national structures in doing so. For
example, there was direct election for Chinese legislators or
deputies to the people's congresses at the county level and below,
while there was indirect election for above the country level.
</P>
<P>
Equal efforts had been made to improve the legal system, Wu
said. In recent years, an amount of important legislation aimed
at protecting human rights in China had been adopted, such as laws
on the protection of the rights and interests of women, minors and
disabled persons, as well as State Compensation Law.
</P>
<P>
Importance had also been attached to international cooperation
in the human rights field, Wu said. China had committed itself to
15 international human rights conventions and took an active part
in the UN human rights activities.
</P>
<P>
He said that China's sincerity in developing international
cooperation on human rights issues was undisputed. In 1994, China
invited the Special Rapporteur on Religious Intolerance to visit,
and received just a few weeks ago the Chairman-Rapporteur of the
Working Group on Arbitrary Detention.
</P>
<P>
In addition, in the past few years, China held on a bilateral
basis many talks on human rights issues with Western countries
such as the United States, the European Union and Norway, and
exchanged views with human rights officials and experts from a
number of countries.
</P>
<P>
Wu stressed that it would be quite normal for different views
to exist on human rights issues, taking into account the diversity
of cultures and civilizations in the world.
</P>
<P>
In promoting the international cause of human rights, he called
for the Sub-Commission to increase understanding and find common
grounds, while preserving differences through friendly dialogue on
an equal footing.

<HEADLINE> China Checks 15,325 Imported Luxury Cars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 9 (Xinhua) -- China started a nationwide
campaign against official abusive use of luxury cars in May 1995
and has checked 15,325 imports by now.
</P>
<P>
According to the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection
of the Communist Party and the Ministry of Supervision, of these,
14,458 have been put to more proper use.
</P>
<P>
Most of these came from various provinces, autonomous regions
and municipalities, and 232 were found being used by the central
government and Party institutions, with 228 having been put to
better use.
</P>
<P>
The party commission and the ministry have required all
departments to step up the pace of inspection and put all cars to
proper use.
</P>
<P>
The campaign is part of a national drive against corruption
begun last year, one year after the promulgation of a regulation
that stipulates that imported luxury cars, such as
Mercedes-Benzes, Lincolns, and Cadillacs should be replaced by
Chinese for senior officials.
</P>
<P>
To see to this, 15 inspection teams have been sent to various
parts of the country to see whether senior officials have stopped
using such luxury cars.

<HEADLINE> Canada's Unemployment Edges Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Canada's unemployment rate edged
down 0.2 percent to 9.8 percent in July as the economy created new
jobs to lower the 10 percent jobless rate in June.
</P>
<P>
Another 19,000 jobs were added in July. They partly offset a
decline of 56,000 jobs the previous month, the Labour Force Survey
released by Statistics Canada said Friday.
</P>
<P>
However, Quebec's employment losses contrasted with gains in
most other provinces.
</P>
<P>
Employment in the province fell by 35,000 jobs, following a
drop of 41,000 in June, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
The consecutive falls wiped out gains made in the second half
of 1995 and early this year, leaving employment in Quebec 27,000
below its July 1995 level.
</P>
<P>
July's employment growth was largely concentrated in Ontario,
Alberta and British Columbia provinces.
</P>
<P>
In Ontario, employment emerged from lethargy in July, rising by
31,000 jobs, mostly in the manufacturing industries.
</P>
<P>
Employment in Alberta increased by 12,000, up 49,000 over last
year.
</P>
<P>
British Columbia gained 16,000 jobs after five consecutive
months of little change.

<HEADLINE> China to Develop Geothermal Energy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Southwest China's Yunnan Province
will use foreign funds to build a geothermal power station that
can produce 10 megawatts of geothermal energy by the year 2000,
and 50 megawatts by the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
This is regarded as a major step in increasing the country's
geothermal energy production from 28.2 megawatts to over 80
megawatts by the year 2000, according to local officials.
</P>
<P>
Most of China's geothermal resources are located in the Tibet
Autonomous Region, according to Pang Zhonghe, director of the
Geothermal Energy Department of the Geological Institute of the
Chinese Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
Pang says that Tibet has three large geothermal power stations,
including Yangbajing, which produces over 40 percent of the
electricity supply for Lhasa, the autonomous region's capital.
</P>
<P>
The three were built with support from the United Nations'
Development Program and under the guidance of Italian technicians.
</P>
<P>
Pang said China expects to introduce more foreign funds for
developing 1,450 megawatts of its proven geothermal energy supply,
and it hopes to introduce funds from overseas to develop
geothermal resources at lower temperature, which can be used for
central heating in urban areas and breeding rare species of fish.
</P>
<P>
Some firms in south China's Guangdong and Fujian provinces are
making big money with geothermal breeding of eels for export.
</P>
<P>
China has more than 4,000 hot springs, geothermal wells, and
mines, and some 49 geothermal utilization projects, including
printing and dyeing, dehydrating fruits and vegetables,
papermaking, and leather-processing have been built across the
country.
</P>
<P>
The country has used geothermal energy to provide heating for
1.3 million sq.m. of housing and for 1.16 million sq.m. of plastic
sheet-covered vegetable plots and 1.6 million sq.m. of fish ponds,
swimming pools, and bathing areas.

<HEADLINE> Korean Adventurers Rescued After Days At Sea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Four adventurers from the Republic
of Korea (ROK) reported missing during a trip between China and
the Korea Peninsula have been rescued by Chinese border police off
the coast of Shandong Province.
</P>
<P>
The adventurers temporarily suspended their plans and returned
to the ROK by plane today, according to the rescue team of the
Shidao Frontier Inspection Station in Rongcheng City.
</P>
<P>
The voyagers left Zhujiajian Island off the coast of Ningbo
Port in east China's Zhejiang Province on July 22 on a nine-meter
by four-m bamboo raft, named "96 East Asia-Mediterranean",
planning to take 15 days to drift the 1,100 kilometers northeast
towards Inchon City in ROK.
</P>
<P>
They lost contact with the headquarters, set up by an ROK
association, when they drifted off the course near Jiangsu
Province in late July.
</P>
<P>
On the afternoon of July 27, they approached an off-shore
island of ROK. But their drift was suddenly affected by Typhoon
Herb and had to drift northwestard. On the afternoon of August 6,
their raft was drifted to the sea area of Shidao Island off the
coast of east China's Shandong Province.
</P>
<P>
ROK has been sending helicopters to search for the expedition
since August 4, but to no avail.
</P>
<P>
The adventurers expressed the desire that they will resume the
expedition from the ROK, via Shidao island, to Yangzhou City of
Jiangsu Province after making further preparations.
</P>
<P>
They intended to prove the possibility that humans used bamboo
rafts to navigate between China and the Korean Peninsula more than
2,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Accidentally, these adventurers happened to discover the
off-course route that have been sailed by an ancient Korean
navigator, Chang Bo-ko, some 1,300 years ago at the time of
China's Tang dynasty (618-917).
</P>
<P>
The recent voyage was sponsored jointly by the Research
Institute of ROK Studies of Hangzhou University, the ROK Adventure
Association, and Tongguk University in ROK.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Iran today accused the United
States of playing into the hands of Israelis while vowing not to
succumb to the American pressure.
</P>
<P>
Influential clergyman Ayatollah Ahmad Jannati called on a large
group of worshippers at Friday prayers on Tehran University
campus to "stand against Washington's bullying at all price."
</P>
<P>
Amid slogans of "Allah is great" and "Down with America"
shouted by the prayers, Jannati said that the United States and
its allies would bear the brunt of U.S.-led sanctions against Iran.
</P>
<P>
He denounced U.S. President Bill Clinton for playing into the
hands of the Israeli government and raising an index finger to
Iran as "one of the major terrorist supporting countries" in a bid
to divert national attention from problems at home.
</P>
<P>
Jannati, a leading hardline clergyman and head of the
authoritative Guardians Council, also attacked the United States
for "establishing Zionist hegemony over the Middle East."
</P>
<P>
He said that the bomb in the TWA airplane had probably been
planted by "Americans opposed to the unjustifiably big influence
of the Zionist elements in the U.S. administration."
</P>
<P>
All 230 people aboard Paris-bound TWA Flight 800 were killed
when the plane exploded on July 17.
</P>
<P>
Jannati said that Israeli publicity and propaganda
machinery in the United States were trying to place the blame on
the so-called foreign elements in a bid to suppress the voice of
the opposition in the United States.
</P>
<P>
He condemned "all forms of terrorism," saying that Iran has
been "the victim of terrorism" itself.

<HEADLINE> Museveni on Industrial Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, August 9 (Xinhua) -- President Yoweri Museveni has
called on local entrepreneurs to float public limited liability
companies as a way of raising funds for industrial development,
reported Radio Uganda today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the proprietors of GBK milk processing plant and
others in Mbarara, southwestern Uganda yesterday, Museveni said
private entrepreneurs can easily solve the problem of the much
needed capital for industrial development by offering part
ownership of their enterprises to the public in form of shares
instead of waiting to get loans.
</P>
<P>
He explained that European entrepreneurs largely used this
method of public limited companies to raise funds for development
of industries in their countries.
</P>
<P>
On the occasion to commissioning the plant, Museveni said his
government will continue to improve the infrastructure to enhance
private investment and will also extend necessary assistance to
private local entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
The plant is a shareholder project worth 3.5 million U.S.
Dollars. It is expected to produce 30,000 liters per day and is
also expected to produce to full capacity within three months. It

<HEADLINE> Canadian Tightrope Walker Challeged in Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, August 9 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian-American "prince of
the air" Jay Cochrane has signed an agreement to walk across a
cable between two skyscrapers in the Pudong New Area in China's
largest metropolis on the evening of September 25, during the
Shanghai Tourism Festival.
</P>
<P>
The walk will be a world record at a height of 110-130 meters.
</P>
<P>
Cochrane, 57, has 40 years experience on the highwire, and says
that it will be the ninth time he has crossed between two
skyscrapers.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, Cochrane walked a 628-meter rope across the Three
Gorges of the Yangtze River with a 27-kilogram 12-meter aluminium
balancing pole, providing a new record.
</P>
<P>
When the news that he would perform in Shanghai was made
public, Feng Jiushan, a well-known Chinese acrobat with the Henan
Skywalk Troupe, asked Shanghai authorities to let him cross the
same highwire that evening after the Canadian.
</P>
<P>
Feng crossed a 50-meter cable in Shanghai on July 22 and did
some fascinating footwork on the cable, including standing on one
foot and sitting on the cable with legs crossed.
</P>
<P>
Feng says that he will challenge Cochrane's Guiness record, and
has crossed a 1,000-meter cable over Hukou Waterfalls on the
Yellow River in north China's Shanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
When he heard Feng's comment, Cochrane was quoted as saying
that the highwire is a dangerous thing and that he hopes no one
will have an accident in challenging him.
</P>
<P>
On July 12, another well-known Chinese acrobat, Zhong Yinguo,
41, died from a fall from a mountain cable in Jiangyou City in
southwest China's Sichuan Province.

<HEADLINE> Crude Oil Price Not to Fall Sharply: Ex-OPEC Head </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 9 (Xinhua) -- The price of crude oil will not
decrease drastically even if Iraq exports 700,000 barrels a day,
former OPEC secretary general Subroto said here today.
</P>
<P>
He said the re-entry of Iraq in the world oil market will not
affect the price of crude oil if all members of the Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) stick to their respective
production quotas, or if non-OPEC oil producers are able to
control their production.
</P>
<P>
The United States Wednesday agreed to a United Nations
resolution allowing Iraq to sell 2 billion US dollars worth of oil
to buy food and medicine for its people.
</P>
<P>
The UN imposed an embargo on Iraq following its invasion of
Kuwait in late 1990.
</P>
<P>
"If the OPEC production for the third and fourth quarter of
this year meets the oil production ceiling, the re-entry of Iraq
oil in the world market will not have any negative impact," he
added.
</P>
<P>
In a recent meeting in Vienna, the OPEC decided to increase its
production ceiling from 24.52 million barrels per day to 25.033
million barrels per day.
</P>
<P>
Subroto also expressed optimism that the price of oil will
remain stable as a number of gulf countries, including Saudi
Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Kuwait, Qatar and Iran
have been trying to meet their quotas.
</P>
<P>
Non-OPEC oil producing countries produce some 43 million
barrels per day while world demand for oil stands at 69 million
barrels per day.
</P>
<P>
However, Subroto noted that although the gulf countries and the
non-OPEC oil producers have tried hard to control their
production, some OPEC members, such as those in Africa and Latin
America, tend to go beyond their quotas.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopian Forces Attack Somalia's Border Towns: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, August 9 (Xinhua) -- The Ethiopian forces attacked
Somalia's border towns of Dolow, Luq, Bulohawo and Bohol Garas
last night, local press reports said here today.
</P>
<P>
They were fighting against the Islamic fundamentalist group of
Al-Itihad Al-Islam which has long been engaged in a hit-and-run
battle in Ethiopia's Eprdf area which was mainly inhabited by the
Somalis.
</P>
<P>
The report said two battalions of Ethiopian forces, supported
by tanks, armored vehicles and fighter planes, attacked two towns
and immediately took control of them.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a press release issued by Al-Itihad Al-Islam in
South Mogadishu claimed to have repulsed the Ethiopian forces,
inflicting on them heavy losses.
</P>
<P>
"The holy fighters have killed more than 100 men from the
Ethiopian forces and wounded many more others," said the
statement, adding that the Al-Itihad had lost 15 people in the
fighting which still continued.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic fundamentalist group also accused the Ethiopian
forces of killing innocent civilians in those towns and
destroying the public residences and water wells.
</P>
<P>
It said former military officers from the Somali National
Front (SNF) of the Marehan clan have been leading the Ethiopian
war against Somalia.
</P>
<P>
The new fighting followed an anti-Al-Itihad agreement adopted
by the Ethiopian government and the SNF faction in eliminating
Al-Itihads from the border towns of Somalia where the Islamic
faction maintains strong bases.
</P>
<P>
Al-Itihads have been ruling these towns since the downfall of
the late regime in 1991. They introduced and implemented the
Sharia Islamic laws. All narcotic drugs, alcoholic drinks and
smoking have been prohibited in those towns.

<P>
TAIYUAN, August 9 (Xinhua) -- forty-four coal miners trapped
underground near Taiyuan city in north China since August 4 have
been rescued.
</P>
<P>
The search for those remaining is continuing in the Xishan
mines of Taiyuan, which was hit by the worst flooding in its
history.
</P>
<P>
Torrential rain lasted for 24 hours. The city's thoroughfare,
Yinze Street, was flooded with sections as deep as one meter in
the water. Mountain torrents poured into two pits of the Xishan
mines, where dozens of miners were working.
</P>
<P>
The rescue work was led by Hu Fuguo, chief of the provincial
Communist Party committee, who was a miner when he was young. More
than 10,000 people, including miners, officials and soldiers, have
been working round-the-clock to save the miners trapped
underground.
</P>
<P>
Taiyuan, the capital of Shanxi province, is an inland city
plagued by persistent droughts, and residents are inexperienced in
battling high waters.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of soldiers, as well as local residents have joined
anti-flood efforts, which include transporting relief goods,
restoring the power supplies cut by the floods, and cleaning the
muddy streets.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Holds US Responsible for Delay in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, August 9 (Xinhua) -- The Iraqi news agency today
carried reports, accusing the United States of deliberately
delaying the approval of the implementation of the
Iraq-U.N. oil-for-food deal.
</P>
<P>
The agency reported that the U.N. Sanctions Committee has
approved the statutes on Iraqi import and export measures as well
as the mechanism for the implementation of the oil-for-food
formula in line with the memorandum of understanding signed by
Iraq and the United Nations last May 20.
</P>
<P>
The agency said that such approval had taken place after a
premeditated delay of several weeks by the U.S. administration,
arousing indignation of world public opinion and among the
diplomatic circles in and out the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, diplomatic sources in Baghdad told Xinhua today that
more than six months have elapsed since Iraq and the United
Nations embarked on a dialogue over this issue on February 6.
</P>
<P>
This period of time is equivalent to the scheduled period for
the implementation of the agreement that may benefit the Iraqi
people and allow the arrival of humanitarian material, they added.
</P>
<P>
The sources reiterated that this situation was caused by the
intransigent attitude of the U.S. delegation, its procrastination
procedures, and unjustified intentional delay.
</P>
<P>
The objective, they said, was to further damage the interests
of the Iraqi people and to achieve targets absolutely unrelated to
the U.N. Charter and resolutions and contrary to accepted
international norms and measures.
</P>
<P>
They asserted that the responsibility for the further
sufferings of the Iraqi people squarely falls on the shoulders of
the U.S. administration in view of its intransigent stances
regarding the implementation of the memorandum of understanding.
</P>
<P>
The oil-for-food deal allows Iraq to sell 2 billion
U.S. dollars worth of oil every six months to finance the purchase
of foodstuffs and medicine.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian International
Trade and Industry Minister Rafidah Aziz said today the
credibility of the World Trade Organization (WTO) hinged not on
whether new initiatives were launched but rather on how well the
Uruguay Round (UR) agreements had been implemented.
</P>
<P>
"It is only proper and prudent for the WTO to move in a manner
and at a pace that will facilitate the integration by recognizing
the constraints and challenges that developing countries face,"
she said in her presentation to the Singapore-U.S. Business
Council in Singapore, the text of which was made available here.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia views the WTO ministerial conference in Singapore in
December as an important event, she said, adding it is therefore
vital to look at preparations for the conference from the right
perspective.
</P>
<P>
Giving the Malaysian perspective on business opportunities
between the United States and the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN) beyond the year 2000, she said the active
participation of ASEAN and other developing countries in the UR
negotiations showed that "we are making serious efforts to fully
integrate into the multilateral trade system."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. seemed to favor unilateral trade remedies rather than
that of the WTO as it believed that would be more effective in
advancing its interests, the minister said.

TIRANA August 9, (Xinhua)--The new Albanian Minister of
Domestic Affairs, Halit Shamata, is calling on the Albanian
Government to "face up to the challenges of crime during the
transition period."
</P>
<P>
At a news conference today, Shamata told reporters that as a
result of Albania's opening up and changes in policies, many new
forms of crime had emerged, such as trafficking in drugs and
people, and organized crime.
</P>
<P>
However, these kinds of crimes were still new to Albania and
the law-breakers were fairly inexperienced, and inexpert.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to crack down on crime, Shamata called on various
departments in the ministry to step-up personnel training and
strengthen cooperation with international crime-fighting
organizations and with neighboring Greece and Italy.
</P>
<P>
The new Albanian government was established last month.Soon
after Shamata took office, a series of grievous crimes occurred,
most prominent being the murders of the Director of the National
Prison and the chief police officer in Pogradec.

medicines, mainly antibiotics to prevent the spread of infectious
diseases, were selected for specific use in dealing with the
aftermath of a natural disaster like flooding.

<HEADLINE> Re-elected Yeltsin Sworn in as Russian President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Looking weak yet firm, Boris
Yeltsin was sworn in as Russian President for the second time
today, promising to uphold the constitution and serve the people
loyally.
</P>
<P>
At 12:00 local time (0800 GMT), Yeltsin marched up to the stage
of the solemnly decorated Moscow State Kremlin Palace before an
audience of thousands. Chairman of the Russian Central Electoral
Committee, Nikolai Ryabov, announced the result of the election
and conferred the presidential certificate on Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
Putting his right hand on the Russian constitution, Yeltsin
said:"While carrying out my duties as president of the Russian
federation I pledge to uphold national security and independence,
and serve the people loyally."
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the Russian Federation Council, Yegor Semeonovich
Stroyev, presented Yeltsin with the presidential chain of office
while at the same time the presidential flag was raised above
Yeltsin's official residence.
</P>
<P>
The 20-minute ceremony drew to an end as Alexei II, the Russian
patriarch, said prayers and blessings for the President. A 30-gun
salute resounded through the skies of Moscow and the Russian flag
flew over the Kremlin Palace.
</P>
<P>
Applause echoed in the spacious Kremlin hall.
</P>
<P>
Since winning the re-election on July 3, Yeltsin has been in
deteriorating health. The president was planning a long vacation
after the ceremony, according to his spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Besides poor health, Yeltsin faces a greater ordeal in his
future presidential work. The strained economy of the country is,
according to most analysts, unlikely to improve as quickly as he
promised his increasingly impoverished voters. His hope to end
the war in Chechnya came to nothing as Rebel forces seized parts
of the Chechen capital of Grozny this week in a surprise offensive
that left Russian forces struggling.

The Chechen rebels had mounted fierce attacks on the buildings
where the pro-Russian Chechen administrations were located.

The rebel command claimed that heavy attacks had been launched
on the federal security service building which was "the only place
where the federal forces are still resisting" in the city center.

Shanghai, August 8 (Xinhua) -- The municipal government of
Shanghai has offered foreign developers 10 plots of land on which
to build inexpensive apartments for local residents.
</P>
<P>
This amount surpassed the total number of plots provided by

the commercialization of housing in China's largest city.
</P>
<P>
To encourage local buyers to take advantage of the low-priced
housing, the municipal government plans to issue favorable

<HEADLINE> Shanghai's Industrial Economy Expected to Pick up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, August 9 (Xinhua) -- A recent survey shows that
Shanghai's industrial economy will pick up marginally in the third
quarter of this year, while the per-capita income of enterprises
will take its first dive.
</P>
<P>
The survey, conducted between June 25 and July 15, studied 262
enterprises that yielded a gross industrial output exceeding 106
billion yuan (about 13 billion US dollars), which accounts for one
third of the city's total.
</P>
<P>
However, problems still exist, such as the shortage of energy
and raw materials, which threaten the industrial economy, experts
said.
</P>
<P>
Those surveyed suggested that government leaders should pay
attention to price rise and the drop in the per-capita income for
enterprise employees.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey, 43 percent of the enterprises listed
the shortage of circulating funds as the key factor that affects
the firms' operations, and 27 percent believed that insufficient
ordering of goods was the most important factor.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-six percent of the enterprises plan to make investments
in the next six months, of those, 84 percent intend to invest in
the manufacturing sector.
</P>
<P>
The remaining 64 percent will not invest because they are
cash-strapped, uncertain about investment fields and pessimistic
about the macro-economic situation.

MACAO, August 9 (Xinhua) -- A total of 62 people have applied
to run for eight seats of the Macao Legislative Assembly (LA) by
the deadline of application on Thursday, Macao Government
officials announced.
</P>
<P>
The Administration and Civil Service Department of the Macao
Government said that 62 people from 12 groups have submitted
applications for the September-22 general election of the Sixth
Macao LA, whose term will pass 1999 to end at the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The 12 groups, including several newly-emerging ones and those
formed by Macao-born Portuguese, will compete for the eight
directly-elected seats out of the total 23 seats at the LA. Eight
other seats will be indirectly elected and seven others appointed
by the governor of Macao.
</P>
<P>
Local experts say that the competition will become fiercer
this year comparing with the last general election in 1992, when
only 50 people of nine groups applied.

more Macao people have become politically active, and that they
are optimistic about their future in Macao.

In addition, they say that the participation of local
Macao-born Portuguese for the first time indicates that they have

<HEADLINE> Filipino "Sex Slaves" Split Over Payment from Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 9 (Xinhua) -- A group of Filipino women forced
into sexual slavery for Japanese soliders in World War II has
split over whether to accept compensation from a private Japanese
fund, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the 11 breakaway members complained
that the Lila Pilipina, a support group for former sex slaves, was
not pushing hard enough for official compensation from the
Japanese government.
</P>
<P>
Like former sex slaves in South Korea and China's Taiwan, they
are refusing to accept money from the private fund, and are
demanding direct compensation and an apology from Tokyo instead.
</P>
<P>
The private fund is an attempt by the Japanese government to
evade its war responsibility, they said.
</P>
<P>
The split came a day after officials of the private fund said
they are preparing to pay Filipino sex slaves first after several
of the 100 Filipino survivors agreed to accept the money and a
letter of apology from Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto,
by the August 15 anniversary of the end of the war.
</P>
<P>
Historians say about 200,000 Asian women were forced to work in
brothels run by Japanese troops. The Japanese government, which
denied any involvement with the wartime brothels until several
years ago, has refused to pay any compensation, saying that all
war-related claims were settled by postwar treaties.
</P>
<P>
Instead, it established the private Asian women's fund financed
by individual and corporate donations to make payments to the
women. The fund has announced plans to give 18,600 U.S. dollars
to each of the 300 surviving women in South Korea, China's Taiwan
and the Philippines.

DAR ES SALAAM, August 9 (Xinhua) -- President Benjamin Mkapa has
appealed to the nation for concerted efforts in developing agriculture
to enhance the national economy.
</P>
<P>
Addressing at the climax of the Fourth National Agricultural Show
at Themi Grounds, in the Town of Arusha, Northern Tanzania, President
Mkapa said that the sector which is the mainstay of the country's
economy was still weak.
</P>
<P>
"We have aboundant natural resources, fertile land, sufficient
river and lake waters. There is no reason for Tanzania to
continue to be a net importer of food," he said.
</P>
<P>
The president attributed low productivity to high farming
costs and farmers' failure to adopt modern farming techniques.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the president told the gathering that 7.393 million
tonnes of food crops are expected this season, some 300,000
tonnes more than the country's annual food demand of 7.084
million tonnes.

<P>
PHNOM PENH, August 9 (Xinhua) -- King Norodom Sihanouk was
reportedly frustrated with a plea of an opposition politician who
asked him to arbitrate a dispute between the co-prime ministers,
local press said today.
</P>
<P>
The Cambodian Daily reported that Sam Rainsy, president of the
Khmer Nation Party, said on Monday that the dispute between the
King's son, First Prime Minister Norodom Ranariddh and Second
Prime Minister Hun Sen could paralyze the government.
</P>
<P>
In response, the King said he had been "burned" too often by
politics.
</P>
<P>
"In 1993, I saved Cambodia from the civil war between the
Cambodian People's Party (CPP) and the Funcinpec from a deadly
partitioning," the King said in an interview on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Today, many politicians blame me of conceiving and applying
this solution of `two-headed government.' There again I got
burnt," the King added.
</P>
<P>
King Sihanouk said since becoming the constitutional monarch,
he has been "burnt" several times -- once for proposing the
remains of the victims of the Khmer Rouge be incinerated and
buried in line with the Buddhist tradition.

<HEADLINE> S. Korea, Japan Fail to Revise Fishery Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, August 9 (Xinhua) -- South Korea and Japan concluded
their two-day fishery talks here today, but failed to narrow
differences over whether the coastal state principle, which allows
coastal states to apprehend ships of any country operating
illegally in their waters, should be introduced.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, the second of its kind, South Korea put
forward three major principles which include the establishment of
a new fishing order in Northeast Asia, respect for existing
fishing patterns and impartiality in setting price standards and
the amount of fish caught and consideration of the special
historical relationship between the two countries in connection
with the fishing treaty.
</P>
<P>
Japan, meanwhile, proposed that the two sides come up with a
new fishery pact which guarantees the coastal state principle and
introduces a total allowable catch system, under which ships can
operate in waters of other countries on the condition that they
pay the necessary fees and catch only what their quota allows.
</P>
<P>
Lee Won-hyung, deputy director-general of the Asia-Pacific
Affairs Bureau of the South Korean Foreign Ministry, said after
the talks that the Seoul-Tokyo fishery talks should procced in
harmony with the talks for setting the boundaries of the Exclusive
Economic Zone (EEZ) of the two countries, adding that the fishery
zones cannot be separated from the EEZs.
</P>
<P>
"In that sense, the talks on fishery pact and the demarcation
of EEZs, now under way in separate talks, will have to get
together at some point in the future," Lee said.
</P>
<P>
South Korea and Japan will hold talks in Tokyo on August 13 to
discuss the EEZ demarcations for the two countries under the
United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.
</P>
<P>
Lee expected that the talks on fishery pact revisions and EEZ
demarcations will last up to two years, considering the
complicated matters involved, although Japan wants to conclude
them as soon as possible.

PARIS, August 9 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading French newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- The French government has decided to settle account with the
former leaders of the bank of Credit Lyonnais (CL), who caused
tens of billion francs of losses for the bank in the early 1990s
with a policy of "headlong rush."
</P>
<P>
Jean-Yves Haberer, former president of the CL, is expected to
be the first to be penalized. Jean-Claude Trichet, the current
president of Bank of France and former director of the Treasury,
could also be judicially prosecuted for failing to fulfil his duty
of controlling of the bank.
</P>
<P>
-- Two months after the death of Pol Pot was announced, Ieng
Sary, number two of the Khmer Rouge guerrillas and brother-in-law

3,000 soldiers. Radio Khmer Rouge condemned him as a "traitor."
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- By reducing the number of lay-offs of public employees to
7,000 from 20,000 as was originally planned, the French government

organization announced a demonstration of protest in Paris on
September 21, and the General Confederation of Labor warns the
government of a "cycle of aggravation."
</P>
<P>
-- The new KGB, the political police of Russia now called FSB,
has become a monster without teeth. Despite the upheavals that
have taken place in the Russian society, the FSB insists on
sticking to its old methods and risks to repeat fiascos like the
one it made in Chechnya. Since 1991, the FSB has changed its name
five times and changed its director six times.

The State Science and Technology Commission is organizing a
leading group to oversee the deep-ocean drilling. A team of
celebrated Chinese scientists is drawing up plans for the drilling
at the South China Sea and East China Sea, and in Okinawa, Japan,
before the end of this century.
</P>
<P>
The work will be a breakthrough in the study of
paleo-environment, the geodetic structure of the western Pacific
and the role of deep-sea geochemistry and metallography.
</P>
<P>
The Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) was a deep sea drilling
project initiated by the United States in late 1960s. It has
slowly transformed from a US program to one that is international,
with participation of Britain, France, Germany, Canada, Australia,
the former Soviet Union and Japan.
</P>
<P>
The internationally-supported program costs hundreds of
millions of US dollars, and will represent the world's greatest
achievements in earth science research.
</P>
<P>
The program has long been acknowledged as a plan at the
forefront of earth science, as it has verified the theory of
crustal plate structure and continental drift and created
paleo-oceanography.
</P>
<P>
China lies at the juncture of the world's largest continent and
its largest ocean. Over the past decade, the country has led the
world in the research of biological sediments and geo-environment
at the Western Pacific, and in the research of the prominence of
the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, said Wang Pinxian, an academician of
the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
Completion of the drilling project at and near Chinese sea
waters will greatly advance the understanding of mankind on the
evolution of global climate and biosphere, he said.
</P>
<P>
As China sits on an earthquake-active region, the legacy of
setting up an observatory station below the continental crust left
by deep sea drilling would make a breakthrough in forecasting
earthquakes, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
Scientists have found, in the deep sea, a type of gas hydrates
similar to natural gas. The amount of this gas is more than the
total energy used throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
If the gas is exploited through ocean drilling, it will become
a substitute energy source for China and the rest of the world, he
said.

<HEADLINE> SADC Urged to Assist Small Miners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 9 (Xinhua) -- The governments of the Southern
African Development Community (SADC) are being urged to assist
the small mining sector in the region.
</P>
<P>
The call was made on Thursday by Kirk Reitmann, a South
African investor Zambia's copperbelt province.
</P>
<P>
There is great potential in minerals such as copper, zinc,
diamonds, gold, precious and semi-precious stones in the region that
need tapping.
</P>
<P>
Most of the small-scale mining companies in the region,
however, lack financial and technical back up to improve
production of minerals such as gemstones.
</P>
<P>
The South African businessman challenged SADC member states to
put in place incentives to attract investment and improve the
regional economy.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Domestic Wholesale Price Index Up in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Japan's domestic wholesale price
index in July rose for the first time in three months by 0.2
percent from June, the Bank of Japan (BOJ) said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The domestic wholesale price index (WPI) in the month stood at
95.3 against the base 100 for 1990, down 0.8 percent from a year
earlier, the central bank said.
</P>
<P>
The was due mainly to substantially higher prices of electric
power brought about by the introduction of higher rates in the
summer, when consumption increases.
</P>
<P>
Wholesale prices in electrical machinery such as integrated
circuits and nonferrous metals including copper ingots, however,
declined, it said.
</P>
<P>
The overall WPI for July posted a rise of 0.2 percent from the
previous month, with its index at 92.8. It was up 1.4 percent
from a year earlier.

<HEADLINE> S. Korea Expresses Surprise over Japanese Minister's Remarks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, August 9 (Xinhua) -- South Korea expressed surprise
today over a senior Japanese official's remarks on the possibility
of street wars by pro-Seoul and pro-Pyongyang forces in Japan if
war breaks out on the Korean Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot but express our surprise over the remarks by a
Japanese cabinet minister which are unfriendly to the
reunification of the Korean Peninsula," said a statement issued
here by the Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
While delivering a speech at a meeting of business leaders in
Yamanashi Prefecture of Japan yesterday, Japanese Chief Cabinet
Secretary Seiroku Kajiyama said, "if war breaks out on the Korean
Peninsula, a mass of refugees are expected to come to Japan."
</P>
<P>
"Street or guerrilla wars are also expected when they, with
organizations in Japan, are internally divided and equipped with
arms," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese minister perceived a impoverished Korea after the
reunification of the Korean Peninsula, adding that "we can no
longer guarantee that Korea will not again raise the issue of
compensation for Japan's colonization of Korea."
</P>
<P>
The South Korean Foreign Ministry's statement also expressed
deep regret that Kajiyama's remarks "heightened alertness against
ethnic Koreans in Japan who have obeyed the national laws of Japan
and have played a constructive role in the Japanese society."
</P>
<P>
"We urge social leaders of Japan to make an effort to establish
a future-oriented relationship between the two countries based on
the right perception of history and the spirit of friendship," the
statement added.
</P>
<P>
Japan ruled the Korean Peninsula as a colony from 1910 until
Japan's World War II defeat in 1945.

<HEADLINE> Australian Deputy PM Slams U.S. Anti-Terrorism Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Australian Deputy Prime Minister
and Minister for Trade Tim Fischer today slammed the United
States' move to impose sanctions on non-American companies for
trading with Iran and Libya.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after launching a review of the Australia-U.S. trade
relationship, Fischer said the trend in the U.S. towards making
its legislation "extra-territorial" was a "sledgehammer heading in
the wrong direction."
</P>
<P>
"We consider this practice to be inconsistent with basic
principles of international law and sovereignty and dubious in
terms of the practical effect," said Fischer.
</P>
<P>
"The (Australian) government will be doing all it can to resist
this move by the U.S.," he warned.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, U.S. President Bill Clinton signed a bill
that imposes sanctions on foreign companies investing in the
energy sectors of Iran and Libya, which the U.S. believes foster
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
In an editorial under the headline of "America's Trading
Sanctions" today, the Australian daily said that "American
legislation that penalizes foreign companies investing in Iran and
Libya has rightly been condemned by Washington's closest allies
including Australia."
</P>
<P>
"This overbearing American behavior comes soon after the U.S.
provoked international outcry over its equally misconceived
Helms-Burton Bill, which punishes foreign investment in Cuba. If
it is serious about fighting terrorism , the U.S. should engage
rather than further isolate countries such as Iran, Libya and
Cuba," said the editorial.

<HEADLINE> Hunting Ethnic Group Spends More on Farming, Animal Husbandry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HUHHOT, August 9 (Xinhua) -- The Oroqens, an ethnic group of
hunters whose members live mainly in the Dahinggan Mountains area
in northeast China, are switching to farming and animal husbandry.
</P>
<P>
A regulation forbidding hunting was issued this year, prompting
members of the group to turn to agriculture and livestock breeding
as new sources of income.
</P>
<P>
The Oroqens now have more than 2,000 hectares of farmland, and
more than 40 collective and private farms, which produce more than
two million kilograms of grain annually.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that in the first quarter this year, per capita
cash expenses reached 762.49 yuan, 2.06 times the figure for the
same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
Of the per capita expenses, some 312 yuan were used to buy
oil-bearing materials, farming machines and livestock.
</P>
<P>
The ratio of living expenses to total expenditure dropped from
last year's 83.6 percent to this year's 42.58 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Oroqens are also skilled at handicrafts and are
knowledgeable in domestic animal breeding. In 1995, per capita
income from these businesses exceeded 500 yuan; per capita total
income reached 1,300 yuan.

<HEADLINE> Cambodian Co-Interior Minister Denies Drug Hiding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia's Co-Minister of
Interior You Hockry described on Thursday as "unfounded" an
allegation that the seized heroin in his possession had dwindled.
</P>
<P>
Today's Cambodia Daily quoted Hockry as saying that confusion
over the drug resulted from the type of scale used.
</P>
<P>
Municipal Anti-Drug Team Chief Heng Prambeur claimed Wednesday
that 3.25 kilograms of heroin seized in February had disappeared
while under protective custody at Hockry's home.
</P>
<P>
In response to the charge, You Hockry said he kept the
contraband in a safe at his office rather than home. He said an
official of the Interior Ministry weighed the heroin before he
sealed it.
</P>
<P>
"When he weighed it up, the scale showed number six," You
Hockry said, adding that the official then wrote on the
identification tag that there were six kilograms of heroin.
</P>
<P>
You Hockry said a mixed Commission of Municipal and Interior
Ministry Anti-drug Police weighed the sealed drugs on the same
scale on Tuesday and the result again was "six." He said, "I made
sure that everyone saw it and everyone agreed there was no
disturbance," You Hockry said.
</P>
<P>
Then the police group handed it over to court officials who
weighed the drugs on a different scale and registered 2.75
kilograms -- equal to six pounds, he explained.
</P>
<P>
First Deputy National Police Chief Yeng Marady later examined
the original scale, and discovered that scale measured in pounds,
the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Both Yeng Marady and King Samnang, another Deputy National
Police Director have backed up You Hockry's claims. But Heng
Prambeur has insisted the contraband was first weighed on a metric
scale.

<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, August 9 (Xinhua) -- A ceramic construction material
maker in Japan and a South Korean firm have reached an agreement
to form a joint venture near Seoul to produce brake shims, Kyodo
News Service quoted a Nichias spokesman as saying Friday.
</P>
<P>
The two firms, namely Nichias Corp. and JEONG-IL Industry Co.,
plan to start supplying the brake shims developed by Nichias to
South Korea's major carmakers such as Hyundai Motor Co. and Daewoo
Motor Co. by the end of the year, he said.
</P>
<P>
The two firms will set up the new company in Ansan with Nichias
and JEONG-IL each providing a 45.5 percent stake of its capital at
330 million won, he said.
</P>
<P>
The remainder will be shouldered by KIC International Ltd., the
Seoul-based local agent for Nichias, he said.
</P>
<P>
Brake shims are an intermediary part of the brake mechanism
that reduce noise upon contact between the brake's metal
components.

<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, August 9 (Xinhua) -- The First Automotive Works
(FAW) in this industrial city of northeast China's Jilin Province
has become a leader in both automobile production and sales.
</P>
<P>
General manager Geng Zhaojie said that FAW became successful
only after it had shaken off the restrictions by the rigid planned
economic system.
</P>
<P>
He said that most state-owned enterprises have a common weak
point -- a shortage of competitive products -- therefore, it is
imperative to adjust product mix.
</P>
<P>
After re-building the medium-duty truck base in 1980s, FAW
began construction in the 1990s on three new facilities, namely
for compact cars, high and medium-quality sedan cars and ordinary
sedans.
</P>
<P>
He said that FAW earned 140 million yuan (about 17 million US
dollars) in the January-June period of this year through a series
of reform initiatives.
</P>
<P>
With an annual production capacity of 360,000 motor vehicles,
FAW has so far exported more than 13,000 automobiles to 30
countries, including 2,400 units in the first half of this year.

BEIRUT, August 9 (Xinhua) -- The Lebanese government has vowed
to continue its programs to develop a destitute rural area in the
country's northeast part "at any cost and regardless any

</P>
<P>
Minister of Agriculture Shawki Fakhoury told a delegation of

<P>
The programs aimed to persuade the farmers in the
Baalbek-Harmel area to plant alternative crops instead of the
traditional opium poppy plantation.
</P>
<P>
"Our choice is to continue the programs at any cost and
regardless any sacrifices," he said, noting that the area, which
had suffered from a chronic dispossession, was in need of a
developing project.

<HEADLINE> Prawn Population Growing in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANTAI, August 9 (Xinhua) -- China's prawn population is
climbing after several years of decline, thanks to the
government's efforts to strengthen administration in the fishery
industry.
</P>
<P>
The prawn output in China has been low since 1990, according to
a recent conference in Yantai, a coastal city in east China's
Shandong Province and a leading prawn production base in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Chinese prawns mainly live in the Yellow and Bohai seas. They
swim south from the Bohai Sea in early winter to spend the season
in the southeast Yellow Sea, then return to the Bohai Sea in the
spring to lay eggs.
</P>
<P>
The prawn's routes are under strict government administration
and protection.
</P>
<P>
Unrestricted fishing and environmental pollution in the 1970s
and 1980s resulted in a sharp decrease of fishing resources,
according to sources. The annual output dropped from several
thousands of tons to 1,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
The fishery law set forth in 1986 provides legal foundation for
prawn protection. So far, China has set up a 30,000-strong
professional law enforcement force, equipped with some 1,000
vessels for maritime law enforcement and administration.
</P>
<P>
In 1988, China prohibited all trawlers from entering the Bohai
Sea area to protect prawn resources, according to Yang Jian,
director of the Fishery Bureau under the Ministry of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, China has increased efforts for the
artificial breeding of prawns. According to the conference in
Yantai, some 110 million young prawns have been released into the
Bohai Sea this year.

<P>
HEFEI, August 9 (Xinhua) -- East China's Anhui Province will
give priority to the establishment of 20 textile and garments
enterprise groups, as part of the province's effort to boost the
garment industry.
</P>
<P>
China's textile industry is plagued by problems such as weak
sales and a shortage of capital, and some industries and products
are being shifted from the coastal and open areas to inland
provinces.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the remote Anhui Province is set to seize the
opportunity to turn the province into a giant textile and garments
processor by adjusting the industrial structure and product mix.
</P>
<P>
According to a development blueprint, the province plans to
strengthen the administration of more than 50 key textile firms
and develop 50 brand-name garment products.
</P>
<P>
Anhui has made great progress in its garments industry during
the Eighth Five-Year Plan period (1991-1995), bringing up its
textile industrial output value, garments output and export
earnings to the top ten in the country.
</P>
<P>
The province is rich in textile raw materials as floss, flax
and silk, and is one of China's major garment production bases.
</P>
<P>
However, the provincial government plans to further develop the
industry in order to make Anhui a center for China's garment
industry.

<HEADLINE> Henan to Build Electronics a Leading Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Central China's Henan Province
intends to develop electronics into a leading local industry in a
few years, "China Machinery and Electronics Daily" reported.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the province ranked third in the country in its
comprehensive economic returns index.
</P>
<P>
By the turn of the century, the provincial electronics industry
aims to set up five large groups each with annual output value
surpassing one billion yuan, an additional five groups with 500
million to one billion yuan in output value each, and ten with
more than 100 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
During the 1991-1995 period, the annual growth rate of
industrial output value of the local electronics sector reached 27
percent. And the pre-tax profits the industry scored during the
five years were 13 times the figure from the previous five years.
</P>
<P>
The province has formed an electronics industrial
administration to speed up the development of the local sector.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, August 9 (Xinhua) -- An assistance program that
offers help to people below the poverty line will be established
in northeast China's Liaoning Province.
</P>
<P>
Under the new system, the per capita minimum monthly living
expenses will be calculated according to the population of poor
people, a price-hiking index, and other factors.
</P>
<P>
The local government will provide monthly financial assistance
to the province's impoverished people, based on levels of need
that are outlined in the system.
</P>
<P>
Residents who fall below the poverty line, or who have the
worst quality of life as defined by the system, will receive an
amount of aid needed to provide their basic necessities.
</P>
<P>
The program will be implemented in 14 cities across the
province by the the end of the year. It will spread gradually to
all the cities and townships by the year 2000, according to
provincial officials.
</P>
<P>
The system covers all urban residents, and is funded by the
local governments. The same system has already been carried out in
six cities, including Dalian, the province's major port city.

<TEXT>
<P>
Hohhot, August 9 (Xinhua) -- A complementary project to the
Yellow River Irrigation Project in the western part of Inner
Mongolia, which is backed by World Bank Loans, is showing good
results.
</P>
<P>
The project was completed six years ago to solve the old
problem of salinization of soil caused by discharge of salt and
underground water level dropping.
</P>
<P>
The project was designed to increase water capacity of the
irrigation network. It has lowered the cost of irrigation and
shortened the watering period, and a large amount of salinized
land has been cultivated, with 100,000 ha. of high-yield farmland
built.
</P>
<P>
World Bank officials who inspected the project recently praised
the achievements and suggested that the second phase of the
project be carried out as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
The project was part of the North China Irrigation Project and
the first phase of the project cost a total of about 650 million
yuan (about 78 million US dollars), of which 66 million US dollars
came from World Bank loans.

<HEADLINE> Dalai Lama Signs Telegram Supporting PLA's March into Tibet (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 9 (Xinhua) -- The 14th Dalai Lama should not
deny the fact that in 1951, he signed a telegram expressing his
support for the march of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) troops
into Tibet, according to a senior Tibetan official.
</P>
<P>
Ngapoi Ngawang Jime, who participated in the negotiations that
resulted in the peaceful liberation of Tibet 45 years ago, said in
Beijing that in 1951, China's central government signed the
Agreement on Peaceful Liberation of Tibet with the Tibetan local
government.
</P>
<P>
"The central government sent troops into Tibet in accordance
with the Agreement. So there does not exist the question of one
party forcing another to do anything," he said.
</P>
<P>
But in a recent speech to the British Parliament, the 14th
Dalai Lama, who lives in exile abroad, said that "China dispatched
troops to invade and occupy Tibet" and that "China exercises
colonial rule over Tibet."
</P>
<P>
Ngapoi, vice-chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese
People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), the top
advisory body in China, said that in view of this, he considered
it his duty to reveal all the facts he knows.
</P>
<P>
Ngapoi, then a senior official of the Tibetan local government,
was appointed by the Dalai Lama and the Tibetan local government
as the chief representative for negotiations with the central
government.
</P>
<P>
He recalled that on October 24, 1951, the Dalai Lama sent a
telegram to the late Chairman Mao Zedong, expressing his support
for the Agreement.

<HEADLINE> Dalai Lama Signs Telegram Supporting PLA's March into Tibet (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The telegram was made public by the media, and is often quoted
by scholars.
</P>
<P>
The telegram states that representatives of both parties signed
the Agreement on the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet.
</P>
<P>
The Tibetan local government, monks and people all support the
Agreement, it says, adding that led by Chairman Mao and the
central government, they will assist the troops of the PLA to be
stationed in Tibet to reinforce national defense, driving
imperialist forces out of Tibet and safeguarding the motherland's
sovereignty and territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
"The telegram was signed personally by the Dalai Lama. Nobody
forced him to do so." Ngapoi said.
</P>
<P>
The telegram is now kept in the Central Archives in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Ngapoi, 86, who is in good health and of sound mind, recalled
that soon after the establishment of the central government in
1949, the tenth Panchen Lama residing in Qinghai Province sent a
telegram to the central government expressing his whole-hearted
support for the action.
</P>
<P>
Among the Tibetan local government officials, those favoring
negotiations with the central government gained the upper hand, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The overwhelming majority of business people, urban and rural
residents, monks and nuns also expressed support for negotiations,
he added.
</P>
<P>
"It is an inevitable historical development that the central
government of New China liberated Tibet by carrying out the
historical convention since the Yuan Dynasty (1271-1368) in order
to continue exercising sovereignty in Tibet," he said.

<HEADLINE> Dalai Lama Signs Telegram Supporting PLA's March into Tibet (3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is under these circumstances that the Dalai Lama and the
Tibetan local government appointed Ngapoi and four other officials
as representatives to negotiate with those from the central
government, he said.
</P>
<P>
Early in the talks, representatives of both parties disagreed
over questions such as whether PLA troops should march into Tibet,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Then Li Weihan, chief representative of the central government,
explained to Tibetan representatives that Tibet had been invaded
repeatedly by imperialists.
</P>
<P>
Li added that since Tibet was located so far from other parts
of China and had very poor transport services, PLA troops would be
unable to get to Tibet promptly in the event of an emergency.
</P>
<P>
"You recognize Tibet as part of China's territory and yet you
do not welcome PLA troops to reinforce defence in Tibet. I think
this is not reasonable," he said.
</P>
<P>
The five Tibetan representatives finally agreed that since
major issues had been solved, such as the recognition of Tibet as
part of China's territory, all other issues were minor.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of both sides soon reached an agreement on the
march of PLA troops into Tibet.
</P>
<P>
On May 23, 1951, nine representatives of both parties signed
the Agreement. Later, the Dalai Lama sent a telegram expressing
his support for the Agreement.

<P>
Ngapoi said that he and four other Tibetan representatives were
appointed by the Dalai Lama, and that their certificates also were
signed by him.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, in accordance with the instructions of the Tibetan
local government, the representatives were authorized to act as
they deemed necessary and to deal independently with matters
related to negotiations.
</P>
<P>
"Negotiations proceeded in a friendly and open atmosphere," he
said. "Sometimes we had different views on some questions. But I
think this was quite normal. The Agreement signed is reasonable
and acceptable," he added.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the Agreement, known as the 17-article
Agreement, is a document that falls into the category of domestic
agreements, because it handles the relationship between the
central government and a local government. Its legal basis is the
"Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference," which was set forth in 1949.
</P>
<P>
Chinese scholars share the view that the central government
signed the Agreement with the Tibetan local government because it
took into consideration Tibet's particularities in political
affairs, its geographical location and its minority ethnic affairs.
</P>
<P>
By doing so, the central government considered several
issues: the consequences of an invasion of Tibet by colonialists;
the fact that Tibet lies in a remote, border area; and that
estrangements existed between the Han people and Tibetans,
resulting from erroneous policies pursued by central governments
before 1949.
</P>
<P>
This year marks the 45th anniversary of the signing of the
Agreement.
</P>
<P>
Ngapoi said said that in the years since the Agreement, Tibet
has embarked on the path of prosperity.
</P>
<P>
"As an old man, I am very happy about this," he said.

<HEADLINE> Former Nazi Officer Under House Arrest for Massacre </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, August 9 (Xinhua) -- A former Nazi SS officer believed to
be involved in the Ardeatine Caves massacre in 1944 was put under
house arrest today by the Italian authorities to prevent him from
leaving the country, according to Italian judicial sources.
</P>
<P>
Former Nazi Major Karl Hass, who was now overseen in a private
clinic south of this Italian capital, has confessed that he had
killed two people during the massacre of 335 Italian civilians at
Ardeatine Caves in World War II.
</P>
<P>
The 84-year-old man injured himself when he jumped off a
second-floor terrace of a Rome hotel the day before he was to
testify at the trial of former SS officer Eric Priebke, who was
found guilty by a military tribunal here last week of
participating in the same massacre.
</P>
<P>
Hass was then sent to a military hospital where he agreed to
testify, but later he partly took back his claims.
</P>
<P>
Hass also said that Priebke took part in another killing at La
Storta on the night of June 3, 1944, as the Allies were entering
the Italian capital. But the Italian prosecutors will check this
point.
</P>
<P>
Italy wants Hass to be sentenced for his part in the massacre,
while Germany is seeking to have him extradited over the
killings.

GUANGZHOU, August 9 (Xinhua) -- A woman in south China's
Guangdong Province survived an electric shock that caused her
heart and breathing to stop for 45 minutes.
</P>
<P>
Medical experts said it was miraculous that anyone in that
condition could be revived after such a long time.
</P>
<P>
On July 22, 32-year-old Peng Baoxing received an electric shock
when she plugged an electric fan into a faulty socket. Peng lives
in Shijing, in the Baiyun District of Guangzhou, Guangdong's
capital city.
</P>
<P>
Following the accident, Peng was unconscious, her blood
pressure dropped to zero, and her heart and breathing stopped for
45 minutes before she was rushed to Nanfang Hospital in the city.
</P>
<P>
She was revived by emergency physicians, who performed
cardio-pulminary resuscitation (CPR), and connected her to a
ventilator to restore her breathing.
</P>
<P>
Peng eventually regained consciousness, and was discharged
after a period of recovery.
</P>
<P>
Surgeons said that Peng's recovery was greatly due to her
family members, who performed CPR before taking her to the
hospital.
</P>
<P>
The hospital earned its fame in 1984 for rescuing an American
tourist whose heart stopped beating for 12 minutes.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Renews Call on Syria to Resume Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu has renewed his call on Syria to restart the
peace talks in the United States, offering again the "Lebanon
First" formula.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the graduation ceremony of the National Defense
College Thursday night, Netanyahu urged Syrian President Hafez
al-Assad to give a "positive answer" to his invitation to resume
the peace negotiations at the Wye Plantation, Maryland in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
Al-Assad has turned down Netanyahu's proposal on withdrawing
Israeli troops from south Lebanon first before making full peace
with Syria, while insisting Israel should conduct simultaneous
withdrawals from Lebanon and Syria's Golan Heights seized by
Israel during the 1967 Middle East war.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu urged again Syria to end "the bitter rhetoric
against Israel" and halt "the terrorism in Lebanon and from the
organizations based in Damascus."
</P>
<P>
"We called on the president of Syria to prove the sincerity of
his intention for peace and agree to our proposal to renew the
negotiations for peace at the Wye Plantation," he said.
</P>
<P>
He was referring to the last round of Israeli-Syrian talks
held in early March in the Wye Plantation under the sponsorship of
the U.S. government. The talks were suspended after a series of
suicide bombings launched by Islamic extremists killed 58 people
in Israel.
</P>
<P>
Repeating his "Lebanon First" proposal, Netanyahu said it would
help build mutual confidence and sincerity for peace.
</P>
<P>
"A positive answer will itself contribute to building a
relationship of trust and mutual respect, regarding the
seriousness and sincerity of each other toward peace," he added.
</P>
<P>
He warned that the situation in Lebanon, if unsolved, could
ignite a larger confrontation and lead to escalating conflict
between Israel and Syria.
</P>
<P>
Complaining about the "stagnant situation" regarding the peace
process he inherited from the former Israeli government, Netanyahu
said he would move quickly to "quash the attempts to isolate
Israel from the Arab world, and get the peace process move again."
</P>
<P>
On the Israeli-Palestinian track, he said Israel has been
endeavoring to restart the negotiations, adding he would continue
contacts with the Palestinian National Authority, including its
head Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Referring to his recent meetings with Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak and Jordanian King Hussein, Netanyahu said he intended to
rehabilitate the relations with the two countries to ensure
"peaceful ties and economic benefit for everyone."

<HEADLINE> Iraq to Begin Exporting Oil in September </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 9 (Xinhua) -- A senior Iraqi diplomat has
expected that his country would begin to export petroleum in the
second half of September after the United States dropped its
opposition to an "oil-for-food" accord between Iraq and the
United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Abdu Amir Anbari, Iraq's chief negotiator to talks with the
U.N. on the "oil-for-food" arrangement, expressed the expectation
in an interview with the Saudi-owned Arabic daily Al-Hayat in
Paris, which was issued in Beirut this morning.
</P>
<P>
He stressed to the London-based newspaper that the schedule
"depends on the speed of the U.N. Secretariat completing its
measures."
</P>
<P>
"There are still four steps before the Secretariat, the first
of which is to appoint officials responsible for deciding oil
deals (with Iraq) and with their headquarters in New York," the
Iraqi diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
"The second step is to set up communication instruments to
connect the officials in the Iraqi Oil Marketing Company with the
U.N. monitors installed at the outlets of the oil."
</P>
<P>
"The third step is to appoint officials to check the food,
medicines and other humanitarian materials all over Iraq, and the
forth is for the U.N. secretary general to hand over a report to
the Security Council on the measures he has taken," Anbari
added.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that all these steps would be finished "as soon as
possible."
</P>
<P>
On the volume of the oil which Iraq will export according to
the arrangement mapped out with the U.N., Anbari said that it
would be 750,000 to 800,000 barrels a day.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the U.S. could brake the implementation of the
"oil-for-food" deal at any time, the Iraqi official said, "Off
course it can do so."
</P>
<P>
Under the Iraqi-U.N. accord, he said that if any country
doubted an illegal thing and called for an urgent meeting (of the
U.N. sanctions committee), the U.N. officials responsible for oil
deals would be banned from signing any contract until the
sanctions committee make a decision.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. announced Wednesday its approval of the deal between
Iraq and the U.N. which allows Iraq to sell 2 billion dollars
worth of oil over a six-month period to buy food and other
humanitarian supplies to mitigate the effects of sanctions
imposed against Iraq since its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
All 14 other members of the Security Council's Iraqi sanctions
committee had given their consent several weeks before, but the
U.S. wanted to make sure enough U.N. monitors would be sent to
Iraq to supervise the agreement.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Ambassador Madeleine Albright announced in the
U.N. headquarters that Washington "is prepared to move ahead on
986," referring to an April 1995 resolution of the Security
Council on which the "oil-for-food" deal is based.
</P>
<P>
She stressed that this was a purely humanitarian exception and
the six-year-old sanctions against Iraq remained intact.

<HEADLINE> Bright Prospect for Cooperation Across Taiwan Straits: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 9 (Xinhua) -- There is a bright prospect for
cooperation between both sides of the Taiwan Straits in the fields
of mineral resource use, mineral technology, energy prospecting,
personnel exchange, and overall improvement of the mineral
industry.
</P>
<P>
The remarks came from an official from the Ministry of Geology
and Mineral Resources in Beijing during the on-going 30th
International Geology Congress.
</P>
<P>
The official said that 95 percent of the energy used in Taiwan
is imported. Most of its oil is from the Middle East and
Indonesia, and most of its natural gas from Indonesia and Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
In order to ensure its energy supply, Taiwan has sought
cooperation with southeast Asia, south America and the U.S., the
official added.
</P>
<P>
In East China Sea and South China Sea, there are large reserves
of oil and gas, he said, adding that there are rich mineral
resources in China's inland areas, and the amounts of many of them
are among the highest in the world.
</P>
<P>
There is an extremely large potential supply from China's
inland areas for some mineral products like tungsten, zinc and
rare-earth metals that are needed by Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, the general cooperation between both
sides of the Taiwan Straits has increased, but in the field of
geology and mineral resources, greater efforts still need to be
taken.
</P>
<P>
The official advised both sides to work more cooperatively to
set up a mineral resources data base and regular communicating
channels.

<HEADLINE> China Plans to Remove Lending Ceilings on Banks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 9 (Xinhua) -- China's central bank is
considering gradually phasing out lending ceilings on the
country's four state-owned commercial banks, and introducing
instead a full-scale asset-liability management system.
</P>
<P>
According to an official source, The People's Bank of China,
the central bank, has already removed lending ceilings on
non-state-owned commercial banks and urban and rural credit
cooperatives this year.
</P>
<P>
Written materials released by the State Information Center show
that the conditions for replacing the still-prevailing credit
scale management method with economic means have largely been in
place.
</P>
<P>
The four state-owned specialized banks -- the Industrial and
Commercial Bank of China, the Agricultural Bank of China, the Bank
of China and the China Construction Bank -- are undergoing a shift
from direct to indirect macro-financial control, according to the
materials.
</P>
<P>
"Conditions for such a shift are now basically ripe," the
materials said, noting that increases in the number of financial
institutions and instruments have successfully cut the proportion
of loans from the specialized banks in the overall social credit
scale from 75 percent in 1993 to 62 percent in April.
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, there is little room for the traditional credit
scale management method to continue to be effective," the
materials said.
</P>
<P>
The central bank's increasing role in bill discounting and open
market operation in treasury bonds, coupled with the formation of
unified national interbank money market and others, has made
indirect financial macro control a viable choice, experts say.
</P>
<P>
Bills re-discounted by the central bank were valued at 84.4
billion yuan (about 10 billion US dollars) last year, with the
amount for this year estimated at more than 100 billion yuan.

<HEADLINE> Securities Arms Ordered to Be Revoked before Dec. 31 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 9 (Xinhua) -- The securities divisions of
former bank-affiliated trust and investment companies should be
dismantled or transferred before December 31 this year, today's
"China Securities" newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
All the securities divisions with poor economic performance or
business irregularities must be revoked before that date,
according to a notice from the People's Bank of China.
</P>
<P>
The new package of regulations came after the country's four
largest state-owned banks were ordered to disengage from trust and
investment operations last August.
</P>
<P>
Those companies which will be retained after the banks
withdraw their shares can continue their securities business, said
the PBOC.
</P>
<P>
Securities divisions under the to-be-transferred trust and
investment companies will have to find new ownership. Firms that
have been revoked are allowed to transfer their securities
dividions to other securities businesses.
</P>
<P>
PBOC also set criteria for the assignee of the transferred
divisions, whose operating funds must stand below 60 percent of
the total capital. The transferred divisions are not allowed to
hold operating funds that exceeds 30 percent of their total
capital volume.
</P>
<P>
Efficient management, high economic efficiency and credit
rating also count heavily, said PBOC.
</P>
<P>
The notice said the four state commercial banks should ensure
the smooth transition of the securities business, and called for
active participation from Shanghai and Shenzhen securities
exchanges and securities exchanges centers nationwide.

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, August 9 (Xinhua) -- A pro-Islamic Welfare Party (RP)
deputy said that there was no definite proof about Iran's
connection with terrorism, and blamed the U.S. for the problems
Turkey is experiencing in its relations with regional countries.
</P>
<P>
The local newspaper Daily News today quoted Temel
Karamollaoglu, deputy chairman of the RP group in parliament, as
saying that "personally I do not think it is likely that Iran,
Iraq or Syria would engage in activities in support of terrorist
action directed at Turkey, because that would be irrational.
</P>
<P>
In an indirect reference to the U.S., he said, "But I have the
conviction that it is being made to seem as if such things exist
-- simply to harm our relations with our neighbors."
</P>
<P>
Additionally, the RP deputy said that there was an attempt to
create new problems with Iran and certain countries were trying
to "impose" that.
</P>
<P>
Karamollaoglu added that "we favor continuation of friendly
relations with the West but we are determined to establish good
relations with the neighboring countries too."
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton signed the d'Amato-Kennedy law
Monday to reinforce embargoes against Iran and Libya by
dissuading foreign companies and individuals from investing
heavily in the oil industries of the two countries.

LANZHOU, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Lanzhou, capital of northwest
China's Gansu Province, has set its sights on attracting overseas
investment.
</P>
<P>
The city now has more than 1,000 foreign-funded enterprises,
which bring in 635 million US dollars from 34 countries and
regions, including the US, Japan, Thailand, and France, as well as
Hong Kong and Taiwan Province of China.
</P>
<P>
The enterprises operate in 28 fields, covering light industry,
electronics, machinery, chemical and pharmaceutical sectors. More
than 60 percent are involved in production.
</P>
<P>
In order to improve the local investment environment, the city
has set up an office to administrate overseas investment, and has
increased its work in infrastructural construction.
</P>
<P>
The city has built fibre-optic cables that link the city with
capitals of neighboring provinces (regions) and the national
capital city of Beijing, a satellite ground station and advanced
telecommunication networks with an urban telephone handling
capacity of 300,000 lines.
</P>
<P>
Lanzhou will emphasize the use of overseas investment in the
local basic industry, public facilities, hi-tech industry and
industrial technology-upgrading projects.
</P>
<P>
With more than 200,000 employees, the local foreign-funded
enterprises paid 156 million yuan in taxes in 1995, which has
contributed greatly to the city's economic growth.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Court Rejects India's Extradition Plea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 9 (Xinhua) -- A Hong Kong court Thursday
rejected India's request for extradition of Amir Bhai, a key
accused in the Hawala case, an 18-million-U.S. dollar bribery
scandal, the local press said today.
</P>
<P>
Hawala, a network allegedly carrying out illegal foreign
exchange trade in India, is often used as a go-between by some
businessmen to bribe the country's senior government officials or
politicians in exchange for lucrative contracts.
</P>
<P>
At least two dozens of Indian politicians have been accused of
receiving money from Hawala operators since January.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong court rejected the plea by India's Central Bureau
of Investigation (CBI) on the ground that the mere mention of
Bhai's name in the diary of other accused Hawala dealers was not
sufficient evidence of his involvement in the case.
</P>
<P>
Amir Bhai, a Hawala operator, was held nearly 60 days ago at
Kaitak airport in Hong Kong following an Indian request to
Interpol.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong court ordered that Amir Bhai's passport be
returned to him.
</P>
<P>
The local press reports said that the court ruling on the issue
was a major setback to investigation into the Hawala case, which
had shaken India's entire political arena earlier this year.

The output is estimated 420 million Dollars more than last

<HEADLINE> eds Vegetable Seeds Visit Space, Work Miracles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have discovered
that the second generation of vegetable seeds returned from an
experimental satellite space expedition have ripened early,
offered high yields and are resistant to disease.
</P>
<P>
Three times in the past eight years, research fellows in
northeast China's Heilongjiang Province have put hot pepper seeds
in space-bound satellites. When the satellites returned, the
scientists retrieved the seeds and planted them on 334 ha of land.
</P>
<P>
Experiments have shown that the first crop of these vegetable
seeds had a lower germination percentage and output.
</P>
<P>
But the second crop bore more and bigger fruit, and was ripe 11
days earlier than the expected date compared with ordinary
strains. The weight of the peppers averaged 0.7 kg.
</P>
<P>
Deng Liping, head of a research group in the Heilongjiang
Horticulture Institute, said this stemmed from an abrupt change in
the gene of vegetable seeds, which was caused by high vacuum,
strong radiation and the shift of gravity in space.
</P>
<P>
Laboratory tests proved the chlorophyll and vitamin content in
these peppers is 20 percent higher than in ordinary peppers.
</P>
<P>
The per ha yield produced by satellite-visiting vegetable seeds
surpassed 75,000 kg, 50 percent higher than that in fields sown
with ordinary seeds.

MADRID, August 9 (Xinhua) -- At least 71 bodies had been found
by today of 650 campers caught in the flash flood on a Pyrenees
Mountains campsite in Spain early Wednesday.
</P>

beneath the debris.
</P>
<P>
The government had not assigned any blame for the deaths in the
flood, but survivors accused the owners of building the campsite
at the bottom of a steep mountain ravine.
</P>
<P>
However, the campsite owners have not issued any statement on

<HEADLINE> India's TDP Threatens to Leave Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 9 (Xinhua) -- India's Telugu Desam Party
(TDP), a regional party in Andhra Pradesh and a key constituent of
the ruling United Front (UF), Thursday threatened to withdraw from
the government over a dam project in Karnataka State, the local
press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister and TDP party chief N.
Chandrababu Naidu wrote a strongly-worded letter to Prime Minister
H.D. Deve Gowda on Thursday, demanding the government immediately
rescind the sanction of 200 crore rupees (about 563 million U.S.
dollars) for raising the height of the Almatti dam on Krishna
river to impound more waters.
</P>
<P>
Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka State have been disputing for
decades over water-sharing in the Krishna river. Deve Gowda used
to be Karnataka chief minister before he became prime minister on
July 1.
</P>
<P>
Related reports said that Naidu, who had played a crucial role
in the formation of the 13-party United Front, is not averse to
the idea of quitting the UF Steering Committee if the government
allows Karnataka to go ahead with the controversial Almatti
project and extended necessary financial support to it.
</P>
<P>
The TDP threat to withdraw from the UF has been received by the
UF sources here with a degree of concern because a TDP withdrawal
will undoubtedly pose a major blow to the shaky coalition
government which is supported by the Congress party from the
outside, reports said.

<HEADLINE> DPRK Condemns Japanese Civilian Reserve Servicemen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Japan's decision to enlist
civilians for a "reserve self-defense force" reflected its
ambitions as a military power, an official newspaper of the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) said today.
</P>
<P>
Rodong Sinmun (Labor News) said in an article that Japan had
been recruiting only retired "self-defense servicemen" to its
reserve force, but from next year, college students and office
workers will also be able to enlist for reserve service training.
</P>
<P>
The change in Japan's military policy indicated that
reactionary forces in the country still cling to militarism and
are trying to make Japan a big military power, said the article.
</P>
<P>
The approach is aimed at paving the way for large-scale
military expansion at times of so-called "contingency," the paper
said.

<HEADLINE> Ariane Rocket Blasts Off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 8 (Xinhua) -- The 90th Ariane rocket soared into
the equatorial night sky from Kourou, French Guiana this evening,
sending into orbit Italian and French telecommunications
satellites, reports reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
The Ariane-44L rocket, the most powerful in the Ariane-4
series, blasted off at 7.49 p.m. (2249 GMT) from the space
center's launch pad, after the mission was delayed 24 hours to
replace a fuse in the propulsion system.
</P>
<P>
Twenty minutes after take-off, space officials said Italy's
ITALSAT-F2 satellite separated from the rocket. Five minutes
later, the French-made TELECOM-2D was released into its
preliminary orbit.
</P>
<P>
The Italian satellite will provide voice, data and digital
television broadcasting throughout Italy. It will also be used for
mobile communications throughout most of Europe, all of Northern
Africa and part of the Middle East for the European Space Agency.
</P>
<P>
The French satellite will be used for civilian telephone, data
and television links in France and will be used by the French
military for its communications program.
</P>
<P>
This is the third Ariane mission since the disastrous launch on
June 4 of an Ariane-5 unmanned satellite-delivery rocket. The
rocket, the first of a new generation, was exploded by ground
controllers when it veered off course shortly after lift-off on
its maiden voyage.
</P>
<P>
The Ariane-4 is marketed by the French-based Arianespace
consortium that controls more than half of the world's commercial
satellite launch market.

<HEADLINE> Thai Superstore Cave-in Kills Two </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Two building workers were killed
and 16 seriously injured when a superstore in south Thailand under
construction collapsed on Thursday, according to the Bangkok post
today.
</P>
<P>
The workers were crushed when a 16 meter by 126 meter concrete
slab, which supported a mezzanine, fell during construction of a
two-story Big C branch of the Central Pattana Group in Surat
Thani.
</P>
<P>
There was speculation that the 9.5 cm thick slab was not strong
enough to support air-conditioning units being installed.
</P>
<P>
Mayor of Surat Thani Passakorn Charunrat blamed the collapse on
the supervising engineer.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Prasit Wongmanee, a key defendant in a 1993 hotel
collapse disaster in northeast Thailand, has been appointed mayor
of Nakhon Ratchasima this week.
</P>
<P>
Prasit was charged with malfeasance and gross negligence which
resulted in 137 deaths when the Royal Plaza Hotel in Nakhon
Ratchasima collapsed three years ago.
</P>
<P>
He, as municipal councilor, was alleged to have approved the
hotel management's request to expand its building.

<HEADLINE> France to Stick to Immigration Law Despite Protests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 8 (Xinhua) -- France has vowed to keep deporting
illegal immigrants in spite of protests over immigration laws and
growing concern over the plight of 10 migrants on hunger strike.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of demonstrators marched on Wednesday in support of
the rights of the hunger strikers, who have refused food for 34
days as part of a campaign demanding regular residence and labor
permits and a moratorium on deportations.
</P>
<P>
But Interior Minister Jean-Louis Debre said his government will
stick to the law, which says foreigners without papers must be
deported unless they fulfil strict criteria.
</P>
<P>
Immigrants whose children are deemed to be French, and a small
number of exceptional cases, are allowed to stay.
</P>
<P>
"All foreigners who are not in this situation can be certain
that we will be extremely firm," today's Le Figaro quoted him as
saying, "We will not let them stay here."
</P>
<P>
The minister said he would defend immigration laws passed by
parliament in spite of growing opposition from local communities
and immigrants.
</P>
<P>
The 10 hunger strikers are holed up at the Saint Bernard church
in northern Paris which has been taken over by some 300 immigrants.
</P>
<P>
Thursday's expulsion of 78 Africans, including 38 Malians and
40 Moroccans, brings the number of deportations since Debre became
interior minister in May 1995 to 15,504.
</P>
<P>
Debre said on Tuesday that 7,352 people have been deported this
year, 25 percent more than last year.
</P>
<P>
He said a central office has been set up to coordinate the work
of the police, customs and paramilitary gendarmes (police) to
effectively curb illegal immigration into the country, now home to
an estimated one million illegal immigrants.

<HEADLINE> Grain Production to Fall a Fifth in Ukraine in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Natural disasters and the impact of
agricultural reform will lead to a 21 percent fall in grain
production in Ukraine this year, the Agriculture Ministry warned
this week.
</P>
<P>
The ministry estimates production will fall 6.7 million tons to
25.5 million tons with wheat production at between 15 million and
16 million tons.
</P>
<P>
But the government denied the country would need to import
grain and said it could guarantee domestic grain supplies.
</P>
<P>
A series of measures have been taken recently to strengthen the
government's grain procurement program, which so far only has
attained 22 percent of its original target.
</P>
<P>
The State Bank has set up a special fund called "Harvest-97"
which will be used to purchase grain reserves and promote the 1997
agricultural development, the ministry said.

<HEADLINE> Death Toll Rises to 75 in Spanish Campsite Disaster </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, August 8 (Xinhua) -- At least 75 people were killed and
some 180 others injured in a campsite in the Pyrenees mountains in
flush floods caused by torrential rains, hailstorms and snow,
reports said.
</P>
<P>
It was the worst civilian tragedy in the country in 13 years.
</P>
<P>
About 700 people, mostly Spaniards, had been staying at the
Virgen de Las Nieves campsite near the town of Biescas, 25
kilometers from the French border.
</P>
<P>
Two days of torrential rains triggered an avalanche Wednesday,
sweeping through the campsite and carrying away trees, cars and
trailers.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of campers had been evacuated to a nearby sports
stadium in Biescas, reports said.
</P>
<P>
Officials said that 75 bodies had been recovered, and at least
50 of the dead identified, all of them Spanish.
</P>
<P>
However, many tourists were still unaccounted for, and the
death toll could rise to as high as 100, reports said.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 1,000 rescue workers, including divers, fire fighters,
and Spanish army units, were still in the area searching survivors.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, King Juan Carlos and Queen Sofia flew to the
nearby town of Jaca to visit some of the injured and comfort
relatives of the victims.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar interrupted his summer holiday
to inspect the area.
</P>
<P>
"I have flown over the area -- it's a deadful sight," he said.
</P>
<P>
The seven-year-old campsite was very popular among British,
Dutch, French and German tourists.

<HEADLINE> Nepal Introduces New Measure to Curb Air Pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, August 9 (Xinhua) -- The Nepali government has
introduced a strict measure to control the worsening air pollution
in this capital city due to the increasing number of vehicles.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Environment Prakash Man Singh Thursday announced a
vehicle emission control program to test all the vehicles in the
Kathmandu valley by mid-October.
</P>
<P>
Under the vehicle testing program, vehicles with high emission
levels would be banned in the capital on a gradual basis unless
their emissions could be brought under control within a given
timetable.
</P>
<P>
Similar pollution control programs would also be implemented
in other parts of the country in the future, he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister told reporters that nearly 10,000 vehicles have
been tested since the emission test work initiated two months ago
in Kathmandu and over half of them passed.
</P>
<P>
Under the rules, any petrol-fueled vehicle emitting smoke with
more than three percent of carbon-monoxide would fail the test.
</P>
<P>
A vehicle failing the test is given a warning to bring down its
emission with necessary maintenance within two months, traffic
police said.
</P>
<P>
Official figures show that there are nearly 100,000 registered
vehicles in Kathmandu with only 340 kilometers of motorable roads
for them at present.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Denies U.S. Requested Vesco's Extradition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, August 8 (Xinhua) -- The Cuban Foreign Ministry denied
today that the United States has requested the extradition of
Robert Vesco, a U.S. citizen indicted in Cuba for economic crimes.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Marianela Ferriol branded
U.S. State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns a liar for saying
Havana had refused to extradite Vesco.
</P>
<P>
Vesco is in jail awaiting a court decision on charges of
"damage to the economic plans and state contracting, fraud, and
illicit economic activity."
</P>
<P>
She said the United States has not officially requested his
extradition.
</P>
<P>
Washington said it would "appreciate his repatriation," not his
extradition, Ferriol told reporters, saying that "in legal terms
there is a difference between the two actions."
</P>
<P>
She said the application of an extradition treaty signed by
both countries in 1926 and mentioned by Burns recently is valid
only when normal relations exist between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Ferriol said that since 1959 the United States has consistently
refused to extradite to Cuba "prominent criminals and terrorists
enjoying refuge and total impunity in U.S. territory."
</P>
<P>
She referred to Orlando Bosch and Luis Posada Carriles, who
attacked a Cuban Airlines plane with over 70 persons aboard in
1976, and to Leonel Macias, who assassinated a Cuban official in
1994.

TIRANA, August 8 (Xinhua) -- The government has launched a
campaign to stop shops selling rotten and out-of-date meat and
fresh produce.
</P>
<P>
Hot summer weather is causing food in the shops to deteriorate
quickly. But some private shop owners are still selling
out-of-date and rancid food for profit regardless of consumers'
health, the government says.
</P>
<P>
A spot check by the veterinary department of Tirana's local
government in July of 50 meat shops and 70 cold storage rooms in
the city revealed a high incidence of sub-quality food.
</P>
<P>
The inspectors condemned some 10,000 kilograms of cheese,
500,000 eggs, 1,800 kilograms of chicken, 1,500 kilograms of
imported sausage, 20,000 kilograms of imported frozen meat and 400
kilograms of fish.

<HEADLINE> Thai Justice Minister Urges Prime Minister to Resign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Thai Minister of Justice Chalerm
Yubamroong has joined opposition MPs in urging Prime Minister
Banharn Silpa-Archa to "make way for someone else," the local
press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Chalerm, leader of a coalition partner -- the Muan Chon
(Masses) party -- made the call Thursday following allegations
that three business groups had each paid a bribe of 750 million
baht (30 million U.S. dollars) to obtain their banking licenses.
</P>
<P>
Chalerm said that the allegations were "well-grounded" and that
the issue would expose the government to corruption charges and
deal a "fatal blow" to its already low public standing.
</P>
<P>
He said the government had no credibility and no one would
believe its defense against the corruption allegations in the
license issue.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a group of young MPs from both the seven-party
coalition government and the opposition camp agreed to collect the
signatures of at least 150 MPs to support the demand for Banharn's
resignation.
</P>
<P>
The MPs, including members of Banharn's Chart Thai (Thai
Nation) party, said Banharn was not fit to lead the country.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Prime Minister and leader of the Social Action Party
Montri Pongpanich said Banharn could not escape the imminent
censure debate in his capacity as interior minister.
</P>
<P>
Banharn said he has assigned Deputy Prime Minister Amnuay
Virawan, who is in charge of economic and financial matters, to
find out if there was any truth behind the allegations.

<HEADLINE> Poland's Gdansk Shipyard Goes Bankrupt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Gdansk Shipyard, birthplace of
Poland's Solidarity Trade Union movement 16 years ago and
workplace of former president Lech Walesa, was declared bankrupt
today with debts of 153 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
A Gdansk court instructed the management of the 48-year-old
shipyard, which employes 6,000 people, to give creditors two
months to file claims.
</P>
<P>
Ryszard Goluch, chairman of the yard's management board, said
he would not appeal against the bankruptcy verdict in a higher
court.
</P>
<P>
Goluch admitted that the shipyard's debts stand at 415
million zlotys (153 million U.S. dollars) but only has assets
of around 350 million zlotys (129 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
The shipyard had been declared bankrupt in 1988 before being
nationalized two years later.
</P>
<P>
Within 12 months, the yard was partially privatized when 39
percent of its stock was handed out to its workers.
</P>
<P>
A board meeting decided to file for bankruptcy in early June
this year, triggering a 48-hour occupation by shipyard
workers. The Solidarity Union declared a nationwide protest
against Polish government plans to let the business go bankrupt.
</P>
<P>
Lech Walesa, who rose to political stardom from the shipyard
and returned to pick up his old trade as an electrician, expressed
full backing for the protest but declined to lead it.
</P>
<P>
The bankruptcy of the shipyard will enable its workers to get
unpaid wages from the state workers' benefit guarantee fund. The
government has earmarked 2 million zlotys (740,000 dollars) in
aid for Gdansk workers.
</P>
<P>
But parts of the shipyard may yet be saved. The current
management has created a new firm from some of the yard's assets
to save part of the business and a Norwegian-German consortium is
apparently interested in buying a stake in the new firm.

MANILA, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Three of five suspects in a
kidnapping-slaying case in the Philippines were found guilty and

BRASILIA, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Brazilian beef exports have
slumped 9.2 percent to 127,000 tons from a year ago due to rising
exchange rates and health fears of "mad cow" disease, the

<P>
The organization expects exports for the year to fall 12
percent to 220,000, continuing the downward trend started in 1995
when beef exports slumped to 250,000 tons from 358,000 tons in
1994.
</P>
<P>
Appreciation of the Brazilian real increased export prices of
beef and demand from many countries fell due to a health scare

<HEADLINE> Tropical Ecological Forest Network Takes Shape in Hainan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, August 9 (Xinhua)-- A tropical ecological forest has
taken shape in south China's Hainan Province, and is playing an
important role in checking winds and controlling sand, conserving
water and soil, and preserving natural resources.
</P>
<P>
The tropical ecological forest network covers an area of
800,000 ha, half of the total forest coverage in Hainan, according
to the Hainan Provincial Forestry Bureau.
</P>
<P>
Protecting, restoring and developing tropical natural forest
areas have been the primary tasks of Hainan's forestry department
in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Hainan restored the area of tropical natural forest to 520,000
ha last year from the 300,000 ha reported at the end of the 1980s,
by stopping commercial logging and building national- and
provincial-level forest parks.
</P>
<P>
With the aid of 300,000 US dollars from the International
Tropical Timber Organization, Hainan has built four tropical
forest pilot zones, a forestry information center and a managerial
personnel training center.
</P>
<P>
A major forest belt with an area of 52,333 ha has been
established along the 1,520-km coastline of the island province.
</P>
<P>
The province will build a tropical ecological public welfare
forest and a commodity forest in the future, Jiang Houzhen,
director of Hainan Provincial Forestry Bureau said.

<P>
Than Shwe's visit, at the invitation of Malaysia's Supreme Head

</P>
<P>
It will also be the first visit to Malaysia by a Myanmar leader

</P>
<P>
Economic cooperation between Myanmar and Malaysia has been
developing despite the fact that there were few exchanges of
high-level visits in the past few years, the authorities said.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's investment in Myanmar amounted to 312.27 million
U.S. dollars in 10 projects as of the end of May this year, the

<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, August 8 (Xinhua) -- The government of Iran has
condemned a new U.S. law sanctioning foreign firms investing in
the country as an abuse of power and anti-democratic.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Ambassador to Mexico Alireza Deihim said here today
Iran rejects the terrorism charges made by the United States
against it, because they are groundless.
</P>
<P>
"They have no proof or evidence, and they are irresponsible
statements," he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has targeted Libya and Iran in its new legislation
which punishes foreign companies investing more than 40 million
U.S. dollars a year in the two countries' oil and gas
industries. The U.S. believes the two are sponsors of
international terrorism.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian ambassador said the U.S. stand toward Iran "is a
policy of world policeman" that has been rejected by major
U.S. trade partners like the European Union and Japan.
</P>
<P>
The law "contradicts all World Trade Organization principles,
free trade laws, the jurisdiction of national courts, and the
rights of each country," the ambassador continued.
</P>
<P>
He believed the U.S. law would fail, "because we are at a time
when we can solve conflicts and differences through democratic and
legal means."

<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Cuba today denounced new
U.S. legislation threatening sanctions against foreign companies
investing in the oil and gas industries in Libya and Iran.
</P>
<P>
It likened the law to the U.S. Helms-Burton legislation
punishing foreign firms investing in Cuba and condemned both as
extraterritorial and interventionist.
</P>
<P>
The U.S., which has accused Libya and Iran of sponsoring
international terrorism, is threatening to punish any
international firms to invest more than 40 million U.S. dollars a
year in the oil and gas industries in the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Marianela Ferriol, a Cuban foreign ministry spokeswoman, said
the new law, also known as the Kennedy-D'Amato law after its
sponsors, is another attempt by Americans to violate international
law and infringe upon the sovereignty of other countries.
</P>
<P>
She said that her country rejects the sanctions law and
condemns any overbearing and unilateral act that is aimed at
policing the world on behalf of others.
</P>
<P>
The Helms-Burton legislation has already raised strong
opposition from governments and businesses in Canada, Mexico,
Central America and Europe.
</P>
<P>
These countries, many of whose industries have oil and gas
interests in Libya and Iran have protested against the Iran and
Libya Sanctions Act signed into law by U.S. President Bill Clinton
this week.

GUANGZHOU, August 9 (Xinhua) -- South China's Guangdong
Province, a pioneer in the country's opening up drive, will
strictly control diversion of land for non-agricultural purposes
in an attempt to protect arable land.
</P>
<P>
The current practice of taking over cultivated land for
construction projects will be averted, said officials from the
provincial land administration authorities.
</P>
<P>
In turn, the officials said, Guangdong will provide additional
construction space by revamping old cities, restructuring
enterprises and knocking down houses in old villages.
</P>
<P>
The amount of arable land has sharply declined in Guangdong
Province during the past few years, with a per-capita average of
only 0.034 ha. The province lost 212,000 ha of cultivated land in
the 1990-1995 period.
</P>
<P>
In the next five years, 180,000 ha of land are expected to be
covered by construction purposes and the task of protecting
cultivated land is seen "arduous and difficult," officials said.
</P>
<P>
To stem further loss of arable land, Guangdong will be more
selective in offering land for construction purposes and efforts
will also be made to cultivate new land.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the province has ordered that the two million ha
of arable land must not be diverted for non-agricultural
use.

<HEADLINE> Guangdong to Build Big Steel Plant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 9 (Xinhua) -- A big steel plant that is
expected to ease the shortage of steel in south China's prosperous
Guangdong Province is scheduled to complete construction in 1998
in the province's capital city of Guangzhou.
</P>
<P>
At a cost of 600 million US dollars, the Guangzhou Zhujiang
Iron and Steel Co., is expected to start production in 1999, to
have an annual capacity of 820,000 tons of molten steel, 792,000
tons of hot-rolled steel and 300,000 tons of cold steel sheets.
</P>
<P>
The plant is vital to the continued development of the economy
in Guangdong, which produces only 35 percent of the steel it
needs, according to provincial officials.
</P>
<P>
The plant, one of the key projects for the country's Ministry
of Metallurgical Industry and Guangdong Province, is the first of
its kind in China to import compact-strip production (CSP)
technology and equipment from Germany's steel giant
SchloemannSiemag.
</P>
<P>
CSP, widely used around the world, can ensure product quality,
save energy and lower investment costs.
</P>
<P>
The new steel company will also use an advanced high-power
electric smelting furnace with a capacity of 160 tons of steel, as
well as a conventional 160-ton capacity of smelting furnace.

<HEADLINE> War Specter Erased in Philippines: MNLF Chairman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Moro National Liberation Front
(MNLF) Chairman Nur Misuari said on Thursday the specter of war
has been erased in Mindanao as the date for signing the final
peace agreement had been decided.
</P>
<P>
He said that with the MNLF's willingness to sign the final
peace pact with the government, the threat of war in southern
Philippines has disappeared.
</P>
<P>
"It's all very clear. There is nothing that can stop the
signing of the peace accord. I see that there is no more
justification of another postponement after it was originally set
for the second week of July," he said.
</P>
<P>
But before the two sides agreed to initial the final agreement
on August 28, during their fourth round of formal talks in
Jakarta, Misuari has repeatedly warned that war will come again to
Mindanao if the peace deal collapses.
</P>
<P>
According to the Tripoli agreement signed in 1976, the final
pact, which is now being drafted and polished by a team of legal
experts, will be officially concluded at the presidential palace
in Manila.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the government is trying to make progress
with another Moro rebel group, the Moro Islamic Liberation Front
(MILF), by saying it will start peace negotiations with MILF next
year.
</P>
<P>
"We are open to exploring all possible avenues and approaches
to bring everybody in the fold of law", Defense Secretary Renato
de Villa said.
</P>
<P>
The announcement came a day after the MILF, which broke from
the MNLF over political issues and has been demanding separate
talks with the government, said the southern Philippines council
for peace and development (SPCPD) proposed for Mindanao will not
end the Muslim rebellion there.
</P>
<P>
President Ramos said talks with MILF could start if it did not
accept the terms of agreement the government reached with the
MNLF, but the MILF expressed it was willing to wait for a year to
see how the SPCPD fared before making its next move.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Slams U.S. over Sanction on Iran, Libya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia criticized the United
States over its recent legislative measure against Iran and Libya,
saying that a national law of one country should not be forced on
other countries.
</P>
<P>
"It is not only Indonesia which opposes the U.S. sanction.
Non-aligned countries and even America's European friends have
also expressed their opposition to Washington's move," Foreign
Minister Ali Alatas said at a reception here last night marking
the 29th anniversary of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
(ASEAN).
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton Monday signed a law aimed at
preventing new foreign investment in Iran and Libya, two countries
which Washington believed back "international terrorism."
</P>
<P>
The law will punish foreign companies that invest 40 million
U.S. dollars or more a year in oil and gas projects in the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
"There is no reason at all for one country to force its law on
other countries," Alatas said responding to reporters' questions
at the reception hosted by ASEAN Secretary General Ajit Singh.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN groups Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines,
Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Second Secretary at the Iranian embassy in Jakarta
Hamid Nikoharf, who was present at the reception, said the U.S.
action showed American egoism and frustration because it had
failed to force other countries to impose sanctions on Iran.
</P>
<P>
"The American charge that Iran backs international terrorism is
also just a made-up story. There is no evidence or document to
support it," said Nikoharf.
</P>
<P>
He thanked Indonesia for opposing the U.S. sanction and said
that many other countries also condemned the American move.
</P>
<P>
Japan, China, South Korea, Australia, and America's close
European allies have also criticized the American sanction against
Iran and Libya.

<HEADLINE> Shenyang Simplifies Regulations for Investors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Thanks to two new simplified
regulations for investors, it is convenient nowadays for overseas
business people to invest in northeast China's Liaoning Province.
</P>
<P>
The "Government Working Procedure for Overseas Investors in
Liaoning" and the "Regulations for Foreign-Invested Enterprises"
are the first local regulations of those kinds issued in China, to
cut red tape and safeguard the interests of overseas-funded firms.
</P>
<P>
The two regulations have great weight with the climate for
foreign investment in Liaoning, today's "China Daily" quoted Gao
Guozhu, vice-governor of the province as saying.
</P>
<P>
The rules, which went into effect late last June, are also
necessary supplements to national laws related with foreign-funded
enterprises, added Gao Guozhu.
</P>
<P>
The foreign investors in the province will get a handbook
explaining what documents are required and to which departments
they should apply for help, to make the application process as
simple as possible.
</P>
<P>
The guide lists the protections and services available to
foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
One rule of the regulations forbids any local official to force
foreign-funded enterprises to take part in social activities.
</P>
<P>
Another rule prohibits any individual or unit from apportioning
taxes on labor, finance or material resources to foreign-funded
projects.
</P>
<P>
During the first half of the year, the province signed a record
1,200 foreign-funded projects, with contractual overseas
investment reaching 3.4 billion US dollars.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Security Council members
today expressed indignation over the use of children as soldiers
in the long-lasting civil war in Liberia.
</P>
<P>
Tono Eitel, council president for August and German ambassador,
said in a statement to the press that the briefing by James Jonah,
a U.N. special envoy for Liberia, produced a mood among the
council members that he had not seen before.
</P>
<P>
"I am explicitly asked to convey the outrage of all members of
the council on what has been going on in Liberia for quite a while
now, that is to say the use and the arming of children," he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that there was a unanimous feeling that the Security
Council would have to revert the issue.
</P>
<P>
The six-year-old civil war has claimed more than 150,000 lives
and displaced over a third of its 3 million population in the
western African country. The United Nations once sent 90 military
observers to assist the peacekeeping force fielded by the Economic
Community of West African States. Most of the observers were
withdrawn in April with only a dozen remaining there.

Department officials to complain about the measure, the BBC

<HEADLINE> UK Ethnic Minorities Still at Social Disadvantage: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Ethnic minorities in Britain
remain disadvantaged on most main social and economic indicators,
according to an official report published today.
</P>
<P>
The report, named Social Focus on Ethnic Minorities, which is
published by the Office of National Statistics, said that although
some minority groups, particularly Indians, are doing relatively
well in certain areas, ethnic minorities generally fare markedly
worse than the white population on grounds of unemployment, pay,
housing, or as victims of crime.
</P>
<P>
The report, the most comprehensive study of its kind, revealed
that only 34 percent of children of black Caribbean descent are
living with a married man and woman, 54 percent are with a lone
mother.
</P>
<P>
Just 36 percent of Bangladeshi and 40 percent of black
households own or are buying their own homes.
</P>
<P>
In education, Asian children do better than all other groups,
including whites. However, unemployment is far higher among all
minority groups than among whites.
</P>
<P>
Black, Pakistani and Bangladeshi people in particular have
jobless rates three times as high as whites.
</P>
<P>
On pay, average hourly full-time rates are as low as 4.78
pounds (7.4 US dollars) for Pakistani and Bangladeshi women,
compared with 6.59 pounds (10.2 dollars) for white women, and only
6.87 pounds (10.6 dollars) for Pakistani and Bangladeshi men,
compared with 8.34 pounds (12.8 dollars) for whites.
</P>
<P>
On crime, all minority groups are statistically more likely
than whites to be victims of both personal and property offenses.
Meanwhile crime rates are higher in inner city areas, where most
black and Asian people live.

<HEADLINE> Dow Edges Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Stocks on Wall Street were
mostly lower today, with the Dow Jones industrial average losing
5.18 to 5,713.49.
</P>
<P>
Declining issues marginally outnumbered advancers on the New
York Stock Exchange, with its volume decreasing to 334.55 million
shares from 392.47 million in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE's composite index fell 0.52 to 353.91, and the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index fell 1.57 to 662.59.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq composite index fell 3.60 to 1,137.51, and the
American Stock Exchange's market value index rose 1.53 to 551.77.
</P>
<P>
Stocks were pressured most of the session by the bond market,
which was contending with another flood of new securities from
today's auction of 10 billion U.S. dollars in new 30-year Treasury
bonds, the final phase of this week's big government refunding.
</P>
<P>
As bond prices fell, the yield on existing 30-year Treasuries
edged higher to 6.79 percent.
</P>
<P>
Investors were also awaiting Friday's report on wholesale
inflation, hoping it would confirm other recent indications of a
moderating economy.
</P>
<P>
There was little reaction to this morning's government report
that first-time claims for jobless benefits shot up by 24,000 last
week to 318,000.
</P>
<P>
The monthly report, published Friday, heartened investors with
firmest evidence yet that employment costs may not be accelerating
at an inflationary pace and that the Federal Reserve might not
raise interest rate to slow the economy.
