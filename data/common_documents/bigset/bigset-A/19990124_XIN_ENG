<HEADLINE> Drugs and Alcohol Behind Rise in Divorces in UAE </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Drugs and alcohol addiction
among spouses are some of the new factors leading to divorces in
the United Arab Emirates (UAE), a local study has said.
</P>
<P>
Published as a book, "Reasons and Effects of Divorces" by the
Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs, the study revealed that
husbands' addiction to drugs and alcohol, their bad treatment for
their wives, their infidelity and polygamy topped the causes of
divorces in the country.
</P>
<P>
The divorce rate in the UAE has been rising steadily in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
Quoting reports released by the Ministry of Planning, the study
said that the actual divorce cases among a total number of 2.54
million local and expatriate inhabitants in the UAE increased from
1,876 in 1991 to 2,154 in 1996, while the actual divorce cases
among 784,043 UAE nationals increased from 1,149 in 1991 to 1,326
in 1996.
</P>
<P>
According to the study, many divorced women have to depend
entirely on the monthly social grants provided by the government
and a lot of children become victims of the social problem.
</P>
<P>
The study proposed to set up family counseling centers in
addition to the introduction of stricter procedures for obtaining
a divorce.
</P>
<P>
It also called for the establishment of a security fund to look
after the children whose parents had remarried after a divorce.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: E. African Countries Seek Common </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
(by Li Jinqi)
</P>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 23 (Xinhua) -- East African countries leaders
met at one-day summit discussing their common concern -- the
establishment of the East African Community (EAC) Friday in
northern Tanzanian town Arusha.
</P>
<P>
The presidents, Daniel arap Moi of Kenya, Benjamin Mkapa of
Tanzania and Yoweri Museveni of Uganda, reviewed their cooperation
in various fields over the past year and discussed issues on
regional cooperation in foreign affairs, economy, trade, security
and others.
</P>
<P>
The three heads of state especially reviewed the progress in
the draft treaty for the establishment of East African Community
which was made public last May, aiming at accelerating the pace of
regional integration.
</P>
<P>
So far, the draft treaty is being subjected to wide publicity
and public debate in the three countries and public views on any
of the provisions are invited. The public debate will end on
April 30 this year.
</P>
<P>
It is learnt that the treaty on the establishment of EAC is
scheduled to be completed and signed in July this year, thus
making East Africa a political and economic integration as a
common market and investment area, which the three leaders hope
will one day adopt a single currency like the European Community.
</P>
<P>
At the summit, the presidents discussed a memorandum on foreign
policy coordination, zero tariff rate, a mechanism to deal with
terrorism, admission of Rwanda to the community and other issues.
</P>
<P>
According to the memorandum signed by the foreign ministers,
the three east African states will take a common stand at the
international forum and will also assist each other in those
countries where they do not have embassies.
</P>
<P>
On the tariff rate issue, the leaders noted the progress on the
decision to adopt zero tariff rate on all products except an
agreed list of products, with effect from July 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
The three presidents at the summit renewed their efforts for a
free trade zone in east Africa and for economic integration.
</P>
<P>
Tanzanian President Mkapa said efforts should be made to "focus
on increasing the capacity of each country and increasing the
volume of inter- regional and international trade."
</P>
<P>
While vowing "the road to the East African Community is now
irreversible, " Kenyan President Moi called for a vigorous
publicity campaign to market the tourism and tap economic
potential in the region.
</P>
<P>
Uganda President Museveni also hailed the progress being made
to promote the region as an attractive investment destination.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that an east African passport will be launched
soon, which will facilitate easier travel within the region.
</P>
<P>
Each immigration authority in the three states has been
allocated 100, 000 such travel documents to be issued at the
equivalent of 10 U.S. Dollars each. Holders of the travel
document will be able to make multiple entries within the region
for a period of six months.
</P>
<P>
Over the past year or more, the three countries have also
fostered their cooperation in the fields of finance, military and
education.
</P>
<P>
The finance ministers of the three countries met in Nairobi
last April and worked out the "Long-Term Strategy of the East
African Development Bank" to further play the bank's role in the
process of regional economic integration and open up new services
focusing on financing the export of cotton and tea as well as the
export-oriented processing sectors.
</P>
<P>
Over the past five years, the bank has approved a total of 167
productive projects worth SDR71.09 million, including 70 ongoing
projects spread across the region.
</P>
<P>
The three countries have also enhanced their coordination and
cooperation in military affairs. Last June, they successfully
sponsored the first east African military manoeuvre in
northwestern Kenya.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, the countries appointed their respective
representatives to the Defense Affairs Unit at Arusha. The
setting up of the unit will promote collective and rational
utilization of military resources and training facilities, speedy
mobilization of peace-keeping and disaster management operations
in the region.
</P>
<P>
With the setting up of the University Council of East Africa,
there are also active academic exchanges among the universities
with mutual visits and research projects. Kenyatta University in
Kenya has conducted joint research on banana plant with other east
African universities.
</P>
<P>
The University Council of East Africa will this year arrange a
number of meetings on legal and science education, arts and social
sciences, engineering, veterinary education and exchange of
students.
</P>
<P>
East Africa with a combined population of some 84 million has
become an emerging market with vast opportunities for investors.
</P>
<P>
With relative stability in the three east African nations, it
is expected that they will achieve faster development in various
fields through joint efforts.

<HEADLINE> African Countries Lift Sanctions Against Burundi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Seven African countries
Saturday agreed to lift economic sanctions against Burundi's
military government to encourage peace negotiations aimed at
ending a five-year civil war, a report from Tanzania said.
</P>
<P>
"The regional leaders have unaniusly agreed that sanctions
should be suspended, not removed completely, but suspended,"
ugandan president Yoweri Museveni said at a summit in the
northern tanzanian town of arusha.
</P>
<P>
The summit was also attended by the leaders of Kenya,
Tanzania, Rwanda and Ethiopia and senior government officials
from the Democratic Republic of Congo and Zambia.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions were imposed by Burundi's neighbors after Major
Pierre Buyoya took power in a military coup in July, 1996.
</P>
<P>
Buyoya, now Burundi's president, addressed the summit and
pledged to push forward with efforts to bring a quick end to the
civil war between his ethnic Tutsi-led government and Hutu rebel
groups.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Judge Orders Lewinsky to Cooperate With Prosecution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 23 (Xinhua) -- A U.S.federal judge Saturday
ordered Monica Lewinsky, a former White House intern, to submit to
an interview with prosecutor Kenneth Starr to assist the Senate
impeachment trial against President Bill Clinton, a legal source
said.
</P>
<P>
The source said U.S. District Judge Norma Holloway Johnson
ruled that House prosecutors had no right under Lewinsky's
immunity deal with Starr to force her to submit to their
questioning. But Johnson ruled that Starr could force Lewinsky to
answer questions from his staff and allow the House prosecutors to
attend.
</P>
<P>
The House prosecutors led by Henry Hyde, a Republican lawmaker,
obtained Starr's help Friday in attempting to force Lewinsky to
talk to them, touching off a legal battle in Johnson's court.
</P>
<P>
Judy Smith, a spokeswoman for Lewinsky, said her legal team was
considering an appeal. "We're taking that question under
advisement," she said.
</P>
<P>
Starr's prosecutors and the lawyers for Lewinsky went to court
late Friday arguing over whether she had to cooperate. Hyde had
written Starr seeking his help with Lewinsky, who rejected being
interviewed by the House team.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, who went on trial in the Senate on January 7, is
charged with perjury and obstruction of justice in two articles of
impeachment in connection with his relationship with Lewinsky. The
two articles were approved by the House along partisan lines on
December 19 last year.
</P>
<P>
The House has urged the Senate to allow witnesses in Clinton's
impeachment trial, a controversial issue that could be fought out
next week along sharp partisan lines. Most Republicans have backed
the call for witnesses and virtually all Democrats have opposed
live testimony.
</P>
<P>
The prosecutors have not yet submitted their witness list. But
House prosecutors during the Senate trial have said repeatedly
that Lewinsky's testimony could help clarify who is telling the
truth about her sexual relationship with President Clinton and any
cover-up efforts.
</P>
<P>
Clinton is the first president in U.S. to be subjected to a
trial since President Andrew Johnson escaped conviction by one
vote in 1868. A two-thirds Senate vote is needed to convict
Clinton and remove him from office. At the moment, no one believes
there are enough votes in the Senate to remove Clinton.

plans to raise value-added tax (VAT) to 15 percent by the year

<HEADLINE> Lifting of Burundi Embargo Will Ease Food </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 23 (Xinhua) -- The suspension of regional
economic sanctions against Burundi will be a major step in
restoring the central African nation's ability to meet its food
needs, said a news release issued by the Nairobi office of U.N.
World Food Program (WFP) available Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Seven African countries decided Saturday at a summit in the
northern Tanzanian town of Arusha to suspend sanctions imposed on
Burundi in August 1996, as long as peace talks between the
government and Hutu rebels continued to show progress.
</P>
<P>
Now that the sanctions have been suspended, WFP hopes it could
focus on its long-term development projects aimed to enable
Burundi to become more self-reliant in food supply, said the new
release.
</P>
<P>
The embargo drove up the prices of food and agricultural items
such as seeds, tools and fertilizers which had mostly hit the
small farmers, the U. N. food agency said.
</P>
<P>
"Many families could no longer afford to grow enough food or
buy supplies in the market, " said Thomas Yanga, WFP's
representative in Burundi. "This meant people were eating less
and becoming more vulnerable to malnutrition and disease."
</P>
<P>
In the past two and a half years, WFP has distributed over
67,000 tons of food to offset the impact of sanctions and the
civil war which has killed around 150,000 people.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Calls for Condemnation of U.S. Attack on It </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Iraq Saturday asked the upcoming
Arab foreign ministers' meeting to condemn U.S.-British military
strikes against it, a demand that seems unlikely to be satisfied.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf, who is here to
attend the meeting due Sunday, that Baghdad's "minimum" demand is
that the foreign ministers' meeting denounce the recent
U.S.-British attack on Iraq and help get the U.N. economic
sanctions on the country lifted.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sahhaf, who arrived here earlier in the day, made the
remarks after a meeting with Arab League Secretary General Esmat
Abdel-Meguid.
</P>
<P>
Arab countries initially decided to convene the meeting on
December 30 to discuss the Iraqi issue after the attack, seeking
ways of restoring Arab solidarity and unity.
</P>
<P>
At the request of Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, the meeting was put
off to January 24 for better consultations and preparations.
</P>
<P>
Arab diplomatic sources in Cairo said that Iraq's demand would
unlikely be met as many Arab countries will not go so far as to
offend the U.S..
</P>
<P>
Al-Sahhaf denied reports that Iraq was beefing up military
force on the Iraqi-Kuwaiti border.
</P>
<P>
There are no Iraqi military build-up on the border and the
U.N. border inspectors and the Kuwaitis have denied the reports,
which he denounced as part of the efforts to garble and distort
the Arab and world public opinion.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain launched a four-day missile attack on Iraq
in mid-December for what the U.S. denounced as Baghdad's failure
to comply with the U.N. weapons inspections, which hold the key to
the lifting of the economic sanctions the U.N. Security Council
imposed on the country after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.

<P>
JERUSALEM, January 23 (Xinhua) -- The International
Telecommunications Union (ITU) has granted the Palestinian
self-rule areas their own country code this month, local media
reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The new country code, 970, which will be operational from
March, will replace the current one designated for Israel, 972.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian National Authority (PNA) said in a statement
following a weekly cabinet meeting late Friday that the ITU
decision was "a recognition of Palestinian national independence
and sovereignty."
</P>
<P>
The PNA has independent telecommunications, with over 150,000
lines in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, but it has up to now had to
use the country code for Israel.
</P>
<P>
Israel had strongly opposed the proposal by some Arab
countries to grant a country code for the Palestinians, saying
the status of the Palestinian-controlled areas has to be
determined in peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
But the ITU, an affiliate of the United Nations, decided in a
November meeting to reserve the 970 code for the PNA.

Kenneth Maphane, chief of Botswana's Criminal Investigations

<HEADLINE> Palestinians Demand Boycott of Products from </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 23 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) has called on the international community to
boycott products made in Jewish settlements on the
Israeli-occupied Palestinian territories.
</P>
<P>
The boycott call, a response to Israel's suspension of the Wye
peace agreement, came in a statement published after the weekly
meeting of the Palestinian cabinet on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
"In light of Israel's freeze of the agreements, the
Palestinian leadership asks all economic blocs to boycott products
made in Jewish settlements," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The statement noted that such a move "would assert
international objection to settlement building on Palestinian
lands," and would show the efforts of the international community
to push the peace process forward.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet specifically asked the United States, Japan, Russia
and the European Union to took part in the boycott.
</P>
<P>
Israel and the PNA signed the interim peace accord last
October, under which Israel will withdraw from another 13 percent
of the West Bank in return for tougher measures taken by the PNA
to fight terrorism.
</P>
<P>
However, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced
last December to suspend the implementation of the agreement in
the excuse that the PNA had not fulfilled its commitments.
</P>
<P>
Denying the charges, the PNA pointed out that the suspension
was simply part of Netanyahu's attempt to rally support from
right-wing voters before the coming early general elections of
Israel in May.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Warplanes Drop Bombs on Iraqi Air Defense Sites </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 23 (Xinhua) -- U.S. warplanes patrolling
southern no-fly zone in Iraq on Saturday dropped bombs on two
Iraqi surface-to-air missile sites after encourtering Iraqi MiG-21
fighters, U.S. officials said.
</P>
<P>
The two U.S. F-14 Tomcats and two F/A-18 Hornets dropped
laser-guided bombs on two Iraqi surface-to-air missile systems
after encountering Iraqi MiG-21s "darting in and out" of the
off-limit airspace, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
The incident took place at 1:15 a.m. EST (0615GMT). After
the bombing, the U.S. warplanes returned safely to the aircraft
carrier Carl Vinson in the Arabian Sea, they said.
</P>
<P>
The Americans "responded to a threat initiated by two Iraqi
MiG-21s flying south of 33rd parallel in Iraq and ground fire
from anti-aircraft artillery," said Lt. Col. Mike Milord, a
Pentagon spokesman.
</P>
<P>
At the White House, National Security Council spokesman David
Leavy said Saturday's incident would not alter U.S. resolve to
enforce the no-fly zones.
</P>
<P>
"As the president has made clear, we will continue to enforce
the no-fly zone vigorously and take appropriate action to
protect our aircraft and continue to contain the threat Saddam
(Hussein) poses to the region and international community,"
Leavy said.
</P>
<P>
It has been the ninth clashes between U.S. warplanes and Iraqi
air defense sites since mid-December bombing raids at Iraqi
targets by U.S. and British warplanes.

<HEADLINE> Kremlin Refutes Constitutional Changes Over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 23 (Xinhua) -- The Kremlin said Saturday that
there is no need for constitutional amendments on the president's
health as it is already"thoroughly reflected in the constituion".
</P>
<P>
The statement, by President Boris Yeltsin's spokesman Dmitry
Yakushkin, came after Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov's call early in
the day for such changes.
</P>
<P>
Yakushkin said Luzhkov's remarks "introduce unnecessary
nervousness and anxiety in the life of society, while there are
enough real problems in Russia without that," Itar-Tass reported.
</P>
<P>
"Everything seems to have been put in place (in Russia) now --
the Duma (lower house of parliament) works with the government;
the government with the Duma, and everyone has clear-cut tasks,"
Yakushkin said.
</P>
<P>
However, Luzhkov said the current constitution overlooks health
matters, calling for provisions on situations arising from
unexpected changes in the president's health.
</P>
<P>
The latest flurry of arguments surrounding Yeltsin's health
came after Yeltsin was rushed to the Central Clinical Hospital on
January 17 for acute gastric ulcer bleeding.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin, 67, has been in and out of hospital several times in
the past year, prompting calls for him to step down to make room
for early presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
The Kremlin, however, has said repeatedly that Yeltsin is fully
capable of ruling the country as the "colossal factor of stability
in Russian society" and that he will serve out his term until
2000.
</P>
<P>
Yakushkin said statements like that made by Luzhkov "are full
of political intrigues."
</P>
<P>
Luzhkov, a presidential hopeful that often tops opinion polls,
said "the best thing for the president to do today would be to
honestly evaluate his condition and ability to work as the head of
state and perform his extremely intensive functions."

<HEADLINE> Romania to Proclaim Year 2000 "The Eminescu Year" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, January 23 (Xinhua) -- The Culture Ministry of
Romania is to proclaim the year 2000 "The Eminescu Year", to mark
150 years since the birth of the country's greatest poet Mihai
Eminescu.
</P>
<P>
"The Eminescu Year" would be enshrined in the UNESCO calendar,
the national Rompres news agency Saturday quoted Minister of
Culture Ion Caramitru as saying.
</P>
<P>
Eminescu transformed Romanian poetry both in form and in
content. Simplicity of language, masterly handling of rhyme and
verse form, profitability of thought and plasticity of expression
made him the creator of a school of poetry that dominated Romanian
thought and expression of Romanian writers and poets at the end of
the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
His poems have been translated into many languages in the
world. "The evening star" is one of Eminescu's best-known poems.
</P>
<P>
Mihai Eminescu, also a newspaperman, writer, philosopher and
translator, was born on January 15, 1850, and died at the age of
39.

<HEADLINE> Maslyukov Warns Against Altering ABM Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Russian First Deputy Prime
Minister Yuri Maslyukov on Saturday reiterated Moscow's doubts
over the U.S.-proposed revisions to the Anti-ballistic Missile
Treaty (ABM).
</P>
<P>
A discussion on the future of the 1972 treaty has been under
way in the United States for several years, Maslyukov's spokesman
Anton Surikov quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said U.S. experts have failed to pay sufficient attention to
a possible reaction from the so-called third nuclear powers to
changes in the ABM.
</P>
<P>
A deployment of a limited ABM system could devalue their
nuclear forces, Maslyukov said. Therefore, some of these countries
could build up their strategic offensive weapons, primarily
inter-continental ballistic missiles with multiple warheads, as "a
cheapest form of response," he added.
</P>
<P>
Maslyukov warned that While Russia and the United States plan
to reduce their strategic offensive weapons under the START II and
future START III treaties, careless steps in revising the ABM
could provoke reverse steps by the third nuclear powers, Interfax
reported.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, Washington "exaggerates and excessively
dramatizes" the threat from what it calls "rouge countries"
notably Iran, Iraq, and Libya, he said.
</P>
<P>
The nuclear threat from third world countries should be dealt
with by stepping up control of the export of nuclear arms
technologies and the means for their delivery, Maslyukov said.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Official Stresses National Right to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 23 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinians stressed on
Saturday that declaring an independent Palestinian state on May 4
is the right for them acquired by virtue of agreements signed with
Israel.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian Minister of Planning and International Cooperation
Nabil Shaath said May 4 should not be dealt with as an ordinary
day, adding that it is "a historic and vital day," on which the
Palestinian right should be reserved and maintained.
</P>
<P>
Shaath made the remarks at a press conference held after a
meeting between Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat in Egypt's Sinai resort of Sharm el-Sheikh,
about 380 kilometers southeast of Cairo.
</P>
<P>
He termed as "important as usual" the meeting between Mubarak
and Arafat, during which he said the Egyptian president expressed
support for the Palestinians to grasp all chances so as not to
fritter away their rights.
</P>
<P>
Arafat has announced he will declare the Palestinian state on
May 4 according to the Oslo accord signed with Israel in 1993. But
the Jewish state opposes the plan, threatening to take unilateral
actions against the possible step.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Israel's threat to annex occupied Palestinian
lands if the Palestinian state is declared, Shaath said "it is not
these threats which will affect our decisions or the way by which
we take them."
</P>
<P>
"We should not fear the threats of a state that illegally
occupies others' lands," he said, adding that the Palestinians'
stances are "based on righteousness."
</P>
<P>
Arafat, a frequent visitor to Egypt for consultations with
Mubarak on the Mideast peace process, arrived in the Red Sea
resort earlier in the day for a one-day visit, Egypt's Middle East
News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
During their talks, Arafat briefed Mubarak on the deadlock in
the Palestinian-Israeli peace talks due to Israel's freeze of the
implementation of the Wye accord signed last October in
Washington.

<HEADLINE> Russia Accuses U.S. of Violating START I </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 23 (Xinhua) -- A high-ranking Russian defense
official on Saturday accused the United States of violating the
first Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START I).
</P>
<P>
Leonid Ivashov, head of the Russian Defense Ministry's
department of international cooperation, told the Krasnaya Zvezda
newspaper that Washington's breaches of START I would further
hamper the ratification of the START II treaty in the State Duma,
or lower house of the Russian parliament.
</P>
<P>
He said Moscow's major concern is over submarine-based
ballistic missiles Trident, intercontinental ballistic missiles MX
and heavy bombers B-1B, Itar-Tass reported.
</P>
<P>
Ivashov said the U.S., is pursuing flight tests of Trident
missiles for carrying more warheads than allowed by the START I
treaty.
</P>
<P>
The START I treaty, signed in Moscow in July 1991 by then
Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev and U.S. President George Bush,
calls for reducing the two sides' strategic offensive arms by
approximately 30 percent in three phases in seven years.
</P>
<P>
Ivashov said Russian wants Washington's "meticulous and
reciprocal" compliance to the START I treaty.
</P>
<P>
He said keeping the U.S. violations going would provide
Washington with an opportunity to build up unilateral military
advantages that promise to undermine both START I and START II.
</P>
<P>
START II, signed in Moscow by Russian President Boris Yeltsin
and Bush, calls for both sides to halve their nuclear warheads
each to 3,000-3,500 within a decade.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. senate ratified the START II on January 26, 1996, and
the Russian State Duma appeared ready to approve it late last
year, but U.S.-led airstrikes against Iraq and Washington's
sanctions against three Russian institutes for allegedly providing
nuclear and missile knowhow to Iran fueled anti-U.S. sentiments,
almost choking any chance of the START II's ratification in the
Duma in the near future.

</P>
<P>
In his letter, Netanyahu cited reasons why he has to remove
the Defense Minister from office, saying Mordechai was "conducting
negotiations with the opposition parties in order to topple the
Likud government."
</P>
<P>
"Elected to the Knesset (parliament) by Likud and appointed
Minister of Defense by a Likud Prime Minister, you have in the
past weeks nevertheless conducted negotiations with opposition
parties whose goal is to bring down the Likud government,"
Netanyahu said.
</P>
<P>
He said that Mordechai had asked him to promise in a written
form to guarantee the position as defense minister in a
government headed by Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu said in the letter that he could not make such
promise to Mordechai because that could go against the Likud"s
principles.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu also accused Mordechai for not following the Likud
way which leads to security, to safeguarding Israel and Jerusalem
and to negotiations with the Palestinians on reciprocity.
</P>
<P>
Observers here believe that Mordechai's departure from the
government would cause damage to the Likud. But it is also
difficult for Netanyahu to keep Mordechai in the Likud as the
latter had decided to join other parties in running the May
elections.
</P>
<P>
During the last two weeks, Mordechai held secret meetings
with former chief of staff Amnon Lipkin-Shahak and intended to
join his centrist party to run the upcoming elections.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, Mordechai refused to offer his candidacy
for the Likud Knesset list, indicating he would leave the
party soon.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai has accused Netanyahu for running the government
personally and sometimes even rejected listening the proposals
and suggestions provided by the military.

<HEADLINE> Sudanese Government Denies Prolonging Ceasefire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Sudanese Foreign Minister
Mustafa Osman Ismail denied Saturday reports that the government
has prolonged the ceasefire with rebels in southern Sudan.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese News Agency reported that Ismail denied reaching
agreement with southern rebels over a United Nations request to
extend the ceasefire in the famine-ravaged Bahr al-Ghazal province
and upper Nile ares.
</P>
<P>
Ismail said that such issue is to be discussed during the
forthcoming visit by the Inter-Governmental Authority on
Development (IGAD) ministerial delegation to Khartoum from January
23 to 26.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Sudanese government aims to achieve overall
ceasefire and revitalize the blocked peace talks with the rebel
Garang movement since October 1997 under the IGAD auspices.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on a U.S. State Department statement that urged the
Sudanese government to extend the ceasefire, Ismail said no
contacts or debates were conducted with the U.S. over the issue.
</P>
<P>
A previous extension of ceasefire in south Sudan was announced
by the government last July to help deliver relief aids to the
famine-stricken areas.
</P>
<P>
The predominantly Christian and animist southerners took up arms
in 1983 against the Muslim controlled north for increased autonomy.
</P>
<P>
The IGAD partner states, namely Canada, Britain, Italy and the
Netherlands, have been making intensive mediation to end the
16-year civil war, which has claimed the lives of 1.5 million
people.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Sacked Minister Accuses PM of Telling Lies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January (Xinhua) -- Israeli sacked Defense Minister
Yitzhak Mordechai Saturday said that Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu said nothing but lies in the letter of dismissal to him.
</P>
<P>
He said that just contrary to the accusations by Netanyahu, he
was loyal to the country, the Israeli people, the Israeli
military and the Likud party.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai said that it was Netanyahu who run the government
against the will of the Israeli people, according to the Israel
Radio just hours after Netanyahu announced his decision to fire
the minister.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that Netanyahu has no capability for running
the government and should be removed from office.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu said in a statement earlier that he dismissed
Mordechai because the minister had been driven by personal
ambition and not fully supported the policies of the government.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu said that he has to remove the defense minister from
office because Mordechai was "conducting negotiations with the
opposition parties in order to topple the Likud government."
</P>

In a letter to Mordechai, Netanyahu said "you will no longer be

Likud. Your tenure will officially come to an end 48 hours after
this letter is delivered to you."
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu, who is campaigning for the early general elections
scheduled for May, is reportedly to have asked Moshe Arens, his
old friend, to replace Mordechai and he got a positive answer.
</P>
<P>
Arens, Likud's former defense minister and foreign minister,
said Saturday evening that he will make final decision next
Monday.
</P>
<P>
However, Arens accused Netanyahu for leading the Likud into a
mess recently. Arens announced on January 11 that he would run
for Likud's leadership when the party central committee meet
later this month.
</P>
<P>
Observers here believe that Mordechai's departure from the

DAMASCUS, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Syria vowed to help make
successful Sunday's Arab Foreign Ministers meeting at the
Cairo-based Arab League headquarters, the Syrian Arab News Agency
reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The statement was made by Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq
al-Sharaa, who arrived in Cairo Saturday to attend the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian minister hopes that the meeting will be conducive to
the revitalization of Arab solidarity and the achievement of a
common Arab stance.
</P>
<P>
Sharaa called on the meeting to help avert the military actions
against Iraq and lift the United Nations sanctions on Iraq
following its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, initially scheduled for late last December after a
series of air strikes by the United States and Britain on Iraq in
mid December, was put off to January 24 in the wake of some Arab
countries' call for better preparations.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will focus on the Iraqi issue and a Yemeni call for

<HEADLINE> Yemen Optimistic Over Arab Reconciliation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Yemeni Foreign Minister
Abdul Qader Ba-Jammal on Saturday expressed optimism over the
realization of Arab reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
Yemen is "optimistic" about Arab reconciliation, considering
the ongoing extensive talks, Ba-Jammal told reporters after a
meeting with his Egyptian counterpart Amr Moussa.
</P>
<P>
"We should not lose hope in achieving Arab reconciliation," he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait split the Arab world. Till now,
Kuwait and Saudi Arabia have not forgiven the Iraqi government,
and Arab countries have yet to reach a unified stance on the Iraqi
issue.
</P>
<P>
Ba-Jammal, also Yemen's deputy prime minister, arrived here
earlier in the day for the Sunday meeting of Arab foreign
ministers, which is to discuss the Iraqi issue after a recent
military attack by the United States and Britain.
</P>
<P>
Following the U.S.-British mid-December attack on Iraq, Yemen
called for an Arab summit aimed at reaching a unified stand toward
the Iraqi issue, seeking Arab reconciliation and solidarity.
</P>
<P>
Arab countries later decided to hold the foreign ministers
meeting to discuss the Iraqi issue and the possibility of a summit.
</P>
<P>
Yemen still favors a pan-Arab summit in a bid to bring Arab
countries close through frank and open talks, Ba-Jammal said,
stressing that "this is the road we should take at any price to
achieve Arab solidarity."
</P>
<P>
He maintained that the climate is "optimistic" despite
complications in the Arab world, which he described as solvable.

<P>
"All the parties are working for making Sunday's meeting a
success," he said.

<P>
CAIRO, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq
al-Sharaa Sunday criticized the United States and Britain for
launching military strikes against Iraq last month.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening session of an Arab foreign ministers'
meeting here, al-Sharaa denounced the U.S.-British attack as "an
aggression on Iraq regardless of international legitimacy and the
U.N. Security Council."
</P>
<P>
Al-Sharaa, who chaired the session, said the use of force "has
not achieved any clear objective except increasing the sufferings
of the Iraqi people and endangering the regional stability and
security."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain launched four-day air strikes against Iraq
in mid-December for what the U.S. denounced as Baghdad's failure
to comply with the U.N. arms inspectors.
</P>
<P>
The Arab foreign ministers' meeting, originally scheduled in
December and later postponed, is aimed at seeking a unified stance
on Iraq. Eighteen Arab foreign ministers and four representatives
to the Arab League took part in the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sharaa termed the convocation of the meeting an achievement,
calling on the foreign ministers to exert "every possible effort
to restore the minimum level of Arab solidarity."
</P>
<P>
He urged the Arab countries to make serious efforts to get the
U.N. trade embargo on Iraq lifted, calling for full arab
solidarity with the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions, imposed by the U.N. Security Council on Iraq
after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait, will not be lifted until the
U.N. arms inspectors certify that Iraq's weapons of mass
destruction have been destroyed.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait split the Arab world into pro- and
anti-Iraqi camps. The Arab countries are still divided over
stances on Iraq. Till now, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia have not
forgiven Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Germany Does Not Rule Out Sending Ground Troops to Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, January 24 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder on Saturday did not rule out the possibility that
German ground troops would take part in the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization's (NATO) military intervention in the troubled
Yugoslav province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder said in an interview with the Focus magazine that
military pressure is needed on Yugoslavia to prevent an increase
in violence in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"We have to talk to our partners about how we can avoid a
situation similar to what happened in Bosnia," Schroeder
said,"The intervention there came only after tens of thousands
were killed."
</P>
<P>
"We can hardly believe the policies of Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic any more," Schroeder added, "Everyone has to
know that a military intervention can no longer be ruled out."
</P>
<P>
Schroeder said he opposes isolated air strikes because it
"won't improve the lot of people of Kosovo."
</P>
<P>
He also argued that it is wrong that Germany could not send
troops to places where Hitler's Nazi troops once invaded during
World War II.
</P>
<P>
"Just because we have stains in history, we need to go there
with our partners to stop the killings going on," he said.
</P>
<P>
Situation in Kosovo has been slightly eased since Belgrade
froze the expulsion of William Walker as head of the Organization
for Security and Cooperation in Europe's (OSCE) Kosovo
Verification Mission.

ISLAMABAD, January 24 (Xinhua) -- A U.N. delegation will visit
Afghanistan Monday for talks with the Taliban on humanitarian
assistance and conditions for the return of U.N. international
staff to the country.
</P>
<P>
The delegation, to be led by the Islamabad-based Coordinator
for Afghanistan, Erick De Mul, will hold talks with the Afghan
militia's supreme leader Mulla Mohammad Omar in the southern city
of Kandahar, official sources said here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. and foreign non-government organizations pulled out
their international staff from Kabul after an Italian U.N. worker
was shot dead in the Afghan capital by an angry mob on August 21,
last year.
</P>
<P>
The controversy between the Taliban and the U.N. over the
return of international staff badly affect some 70 thousand widows
and orphans in Kabul, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban and the U.N. signed a "security agreement" in
Islamabad on October 23, 1998, listing several conditions for the
return of international staff to the war-ravaged country.
</P>
<P>
The agreement had made the Taliban bound to provide full
protection to the U.N. staff and premises and investigate into the
killing of three U.N. officials in Kabul and the eastern city of
Jalalabad last year.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. wants those responsible for the murders to be arrested
and punished before it sends the international staff back to
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban said that they had arrested two suspected Pakistani
nationals in connection with the attack on the U.N. official in
Kabul who are being questioned in the militia's headquarters of
Kandahar.
</P>
<P>
However, the Pakistanis have pleaded not guilty.

Liberation Army (PLA) Chief of the General Staff General Fu
Quanyou arrived here Sunday night for a five-day official and

close neighbors and there exists a profound friendship between the
peoples of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He said since the establishment of diplomatic relations between
China and Malaysia, the bilateral relations have maintained a

in each field have been well under way.
</P>
<P>
China attaches great importance to developing friendly and

<HEADLINE> Erekat Urges to Move Peace Process Forward </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 24 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian side will
continue to move the peace process forward and the international
community must find compulsory mechanisms to force Israeli
government to implement the signed agreements.
</P>
<P>
The statement was made by Palestinian chief negotiator Saeb
Erekat during an interview with the Voice of Palestine on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"The collapse of the peace process on the Palestinian-Israeli
track means catastrophes to the region and difficulties for the
entire world," Erekat warned.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli government stopped implementing the Wye peace
accord last December citing accusations that the Palestinian side
has not fulfilled its commitments, bringing peace process to a
standstill once again.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the upcoming May elections in Israel will also
affect the peace process, not only in the non-implementation of
the accords, but also pertaining to attempts to gain votes by the
Israeli government from Israeli right wing and extremists who
oppose the agreements signed in Oslo, Madrid and Wye, Erekat said.
</P>
<P>
All of that will be reflected into impacts on grounds, which
means more settlement activities, more land confiscations and more
destructions to the peace process, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The United States should initiate to find compulsory mechanisms
for implementing the peace process, as long as it admits that the
Palestinian side has implemented its commitments of peace, he
said.
</P>
<P>
On the question of whether the Palestinian side will declare an
independent state on May 4 when the five-year interim period of
Oslo ends, Erekat said this is not a Palestinian day and was not
invented by the Palestinians - it was a result of understanding
and agreement between both the Palestinian and Israeli parties.
</P>
<P>
"The date 4 of May appeared for the first time in the Wye
River Memorandum which was signed by Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu himself," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, it is a day which has international legitimacy by
all who participated in signing the agreement. Consequently, the
Palestinian leadership can not postpone this date for even an hour
in announcing an independent palestinian state," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin,
in his capacity as chairman of the Central Military Commission,
recently signed decrees promulgating 13 operational regulations
as part of a new set of regulations for the Chinese Army.
</P>
<P>
These new regulations include the Outline Governing Joint
Campaigns of the People's Liberation Army of China covering
combat rules and logistic support for the army, navy, and air
force and their joint operations.
</P>
<P>
More such rules will be issued to replace the former
operational regulations set forth in the 1980s, military sources
announced here today.
</P>
<P>
The promulgation of the new military operational rules
indicates that the Chinese military has reached a new
understanding of today's regional wars which are characterized by
modern high technologies, sources said.
</P>
<P>
Since the formulation of the old operational regulations, a
new definition of China's military strategy has emerged and the
task of the military is changing, sources said, adding that new
developments in military high technologies have altered military
practices around the world and have had a tremendous impact on
combat theories.
</P>
<P>
New experiences in military training have also been
accumulated, the military sources claimed.
</P>
<P>
Based on these developments, the Central Military Commission
decided to amend the old operational rules.
</P>
<P>
The new regulations are of great significance in upgrading the
Chinese military's capacity to successfully wage modern regional
wars characterized by modern technologies, comprehensively
advancing the military's qualities and realizing the goals of
self-defense and continued growth in the new millennium, the
military sources said.
</P>
<P>
The new regulations cover all branches of the military, and
nearly half of them relate to hi-tech weapons included in
operational rules for the first time.

ministers on the Iraqi impasse, which started earlier in the day,
Abdel-Meguid also urged Arab countries to handle the problem
"through dialogue, understanding and hard work".
</P>
<P>
"This will lead to consolidating Arab capabilities and building
sound and stable inter-Arab relations based on frankness and
reconciliation," he said.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, originally scheduled in December but later
postponed for disagreements in the Arab world, has been intended
to formulate a common stand on the Iraqi issue following the
U.S.-British airstrikes on December 16-19.
</P>
<P>
The ministers will also try to seek the restoration of Arab
reconciliation and solidarity
</P>
<P>
Terming the meeting as "the first step" on the way to improving
the Arab situation, Abdel-Meguid voiced hope that it will produce
substantial results to promote the Arab ambitions "in closing
ranks and restoring solidarity."
</P>
<P>
"Our national responsibility requires us to bring Iraq back to
the Arab family in view of Baghdad's compliance with the U.N.
Security Council resolutions related to the (1990) Gulf crisis,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990 split the Arab world. Till
now, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia have not forgiven Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council imposed sweeping economic sanctions
on Iraq after its invasion of Kuwait in 1990. The sanctions will
not be lifted until Iraq's weapons of mass destruction have been
destroyed.
</P>
<P>
Chairing the opening session of the foreign ministers' meeting,
Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq al-Sharaa criticized the
U.S.-British attack on Iraq. He denounced it as "sheer aggression
on Iraq regardless of the international legitimacy and
U.N. resolutions."
</P>
<P>
He said the foreign ministers were gathering to demand the
lifting of the sanctions and express solidarity with the Iraqi
people.
</P>
<P>
Eighteen Arab foreign ministers and four permanent
representatives to the Arab League are attending the meeting.

<HEADLINE> China to Invest Over 11 Billion Yuan in Civil Aviation This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 24 (Xinhua) China plans to pour 11.1 billion
yuan into the civil aviation sector this year, according to Liu
Jianfeng, director of the General Administration of Civil
Aviation of China.
</P>
<P>
 Some 6.2 billion yuan will be invested in infrastructure
construction, three billion in technical upgrading, and 1.94
billion yuan will be in the form of loans for aircraft purchases.
</P>
<P>
 Liu said this money will be mainly used for projects which
will be put into operation this year, including the Beijing
Capital Airport, the Shanghai Pudong Airport and the Haikou
Meilan Airport located in Haikou, the capital of Hainan Province,
the country's largest special economic zone.
</P>
<P>
 The expansion project at the Kunming Wujiaba Airport in the
capital of southwest China's Yunnan province will be completed on
schedule, in time to welcome the 99' World Horticultural
Exhibition which will be held in Kunming, Liu noted.
</P>
<P>
 The official added that construction of the New Baiyun
Airport in Guangzhou will also begin as soon as possible.

<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Private enterprises are playing
an increasingly important role in economic development and the
reemployment of the jobless in east China's Anhui Province.
</P>
<P>
The combined output value for these enterprises reached 19.4
billion yuan in 1998, accounting for 6.8 percent of the
province's gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
A total of 123,000 laid-off workers were reemployed in private
enterprises in the province last year.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government has issued a series of preferential
policies to support private enterprises, including a loosening of
limitations on management activities and amounts of registered
capital.
</P>
<P>
The Anhui Provincial Administration for Industry and Commerce
has handled a number of cases involving the infringement of
private-business profits. The city of Huangshan's Administration
for Industry and Commerce ruled that it should not take more than
three working days to accept registration for issuing
private-enterprise licenses.
</P>
<P>
The province has also set aside more than 100 million yuan to
support high-tech private businesses. At present, there are more
than 100 high-tech private enterprises in the State-level Hefei
High-Tech and New Technological Industrial Development Zone.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 24 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela has cancelled his planned visit to Uganda in view
of the recent violence in Richmond, KwaZulu-Natal.
</P>
<P>
"In view of the events in Richmond, the president thought he
should delay his overseas trip for a few days. This means that he
will not go to Uganda," South African Press Association quoted
Foreign Ministry spokesman Marco Boni as saying Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Boni said Mandela had spoken to Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni who said he understood the situation.
</P>
<P>
South African Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo and Defense Minister
Joe Modise will lead a delegation to Uganda where they will sign
an investment promotion agreement.

<P>
They will also open a new sports stadium there which is being
named after Mandela.

Mandela, however, still planned to visit Germany and
Switzerland next week.

<P>
Boni did not say whether Mandela would visit Richmond, where
United Democratic Movement General Secretary, Sifiso Nkabinde, was
assassinated Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
Eleven people were killed Saturday night in what is believed to
be a revenge attack for Nkabinde's death.

ISLAMABAD, January 24 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan Taliban militia
Sunday ruled out any possibility of talks with the United States

States and the Taliban.

"Osama is a guest of the Afghan nation," he said, adding that

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 24 (Xinhua) -- The China's '99 International
Senior Citizens Forum opened here today in the Great Hall of the
People.
</P>
<P>
The forum aims at boosting the development of scientific
research and other social activity related to the aging po
pulation, in response to the International Year of Senior
Citizens initiated by the United Nations General Assembly, said
Peng Peiyun, vice chairman of National People's Congress Standing
Committee and director of the Chinese Population Society.
</P>
<P>
Co-sponsored by the Chinese Population Society and the Jintai
commercial group, the forum is welcoming 80 experts and officials
from the fields of population studies, economics, sociology and
medicine who will discuss the impact of the aging process on the
economy, the establishment of a pension system, the relationship
between the aging process and sustainable development and related
topics.
</P>
<P>
The seminars are all being held under the banner of "Towards a
Society for All Ages" designated by the United Nations for this
year.
</P>
<P>
Peng said the UN has reminded the world of the aging process
in 20th century as a challenge new to mankind.
</P>
<P>
Along with their previous contributions, our senior citizens
still offer their strength to society and deserve respect nation
wide, Peng stressed.
</P>
<P>
Respect for the elderly is regarded as a basic ethic in
Chinese culture, and "a society for all ages" means not only that
senior citizens should share in the nation's wealth, but that
they also should be respected as equal members of society
regardless of their age, added Peng.

<HEADLINE> Iranian President Urges Healthy Competition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad
Khatami Sunday called for unity among political parties and
groups in order to present a "healthy competition" in the country.
</P>
<P>
"This competition must be coupled with ethical, Islamic and
humane yardsticks and all must prove their enthusiasm in
practice," Khatami said at the opening session of a three-day
gathering on "Islamic Councils and People's Participation."
</P>
<P>
He called on all political groups and factions to participate
in the coming elections of city and village councils starting on
February 23, the first since the Islamic revolution in 1979.
</P>
<P>
"The councils elections must be turned into a field for
displaying our national will and determination and I expect all
the factions and groups to get united in this arena to ensure
people's presence and sovereignty," he said.
</P>
<P>
Khatami's government has promised to cede some authorities and
rights to the people by holding the local elections to choose
mayors and village chiefs.
</P>
<P>
He also underlined the need to recognize the differences of
styles and tastes of various political factions and individuals.
</P>
<P>
"We must recognize the differences and should not let
competition turn into confrontation," he noted, adding that "the
left, the right, the centralist, all these classifications must
develop."
</P>
<P>
Khatami stressed the importance of people's participation in
the country's political, economic and social affairs, terming it
one of the most important slogans of the government.
</P>
<P>
"To be fair, on the average, the people's (political) maturity
is higher than that of the institutions, organs and those who
claim to be social teachers," he said.
</P>
<P>
Iran's conservative and moderate factions have been engaged in
a political wrangling in recent month following the revelation of
the involvement of the country's intelligence agents in political
killings of several dissidents.
</P>
<P>
An Iranian opposition leader, his wife and at least three other
dissident writers were murdered by a group of agents of the
Intelligence Ministry late last year.
</P>
<P>
The moderates called for a fundamental change in the
Intelligence Ministry after it admitted the involvement while the
conservatives accused Khatami's supporter of being behind the
murders.
</P>
<P>
Political observers here said that the two rival factions
intended to use the murder issue to defame the other prior to the
coming local elections.
</P>
<P>
Khatami has expressed regret over the political killings and
promised to firmly deal with the issue "as a matter of national
security and in order to create mutual confidence."
</P>
<P>
"This source of corruption and the roots of corruption in the
society in general, must be eliminated and we hope that the
society will move forward with more vigor," he added.

Jalil, Taliban's senior official responsible for foreign affairs,
official sources said here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The talks between the Afghan militia and Muratov, who is to
embark on a three-day official visit to Pakistan on Monday, will
be part of joint efforts of Pakistan and Turkmenistan to restore
lasting peace in the war-shattered Afghanistan, said the sources.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan and Turkmenistan agreed to jointly work for the
peaceful settlement of the long-standing Afghan imbroglio during
the visit of Pakistan's Minister of State Siddique Khan Kanju to
Turkmenistan in November last year.
</P>
<P>
The Turkmen foreign minister's forthcoming visit to Pakistan is
seen as part of joint efforts of the two countries in this regard.

<HEADLINE> Full-Steam Ahead for Sydney Olympics: Australian Acting PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 24 (Xinhua) -- The Australian federal
government Sunday expressed "full confidence" in the Sydney
Olympics bidding process and said it was "full-steam ahead" for
the year 2000 Sydney Games.
</P>
<P>
The comments by Acting Prime Minister Tim Fischer follow fears
that the Sydney Olympics could be under threat due to the
burgeoning Olympic bribery scandal.
</P>
<P>
Saturday Australian Olympic Committee President John Coates
said he sensed Sydney's chances of hosting the 2000 Olympics were
slipping away before he pledged extra payments to two African IOC
members on the eve of the 1993 vote.
</P>
<P>
But Acting Prime Minister Tim Fischer was Sunday upbeat about
the future of the event.
</P>
<P>
"It is full steam ahead for the 2000 Sydney Olympics," he said
in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"I absolutely believe they will be held in Sydney and they
will be successful, boosting Australian tourism nationwide.
</P>
<P>
"The saga over Olympic site selection has developed under the
overview of J. A. Samaranch, and clearly there will be procedural
changes in the new millennium."
</P>
<P>
Fischer also voiced support for the Games organizers.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Plans to Phase Out Auto-rickshaws in Dhaka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, January 24 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government is
planning to phase out two-stroke-engine vehicles from Dhaka city
by the year 2001 instead of 2003, in a bid to protect the
environment, the Independent daily newspaper reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the government decided to phase out the
auto-rickshaws by 2003, but considering the deteriorating air
pollution, "we want to do it earlier and complete the job by
2001," an authoritative source in the Ministry of Environment and
Forest was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The motor vehicles, mainly auto-rickshaws, which pollute the
city air heavily, will be phased out under a project to be funded
by the World Bank (WB), he said.
</P>
<P>
A proposal for the purpose is being prepared by the ministry
for approval by the higher authorities of the government.
</P>
<P>
The WB will provide five million U.S. dollars for the
three-year project to be implemented from the middle of this year
to make the city free of air pollution.
</P>
<P>
Comprehensive measures will be taken under the project to
combat the growing air pollution in the capital city inhabited by
over nine million people.
</P>
<P>
Authorities concerned are preparing a detailed work plan under
the project which will lay stress on controlling the emission of
black smoke by motor vehicles, he added.
</P>
<P>
However, the report did not mention how many auto-rickshaws now
plying in the streets and the total cost of the project.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAUSANNE, Switzerland, January 24 ( Xinhua) -- The Executive
Board of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) will study the
report on Sunday and decide whether to recommend that members who
broke the rules on receiving gifts should be thrown out of the
organization.
</P>
<P>
Six of the 13 members involved in the Salt Lake City bribery

<HEADLINE> Iran Opposes U.S. Military Base in Azerbaijan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Iran has voiced its deep concern
over a U.S. military base which is reportedly to be set up in
Azerbaijan Republic.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a flag hoisting ceremony on Saturday, Hassan
Firouzabadi, the chief of the joint staff of Iran's armed forces,
said negotiations are currently underway for the setting up of the
base.
</P>
<P>
"The Israelis and the Americans are approaching us from the
north and we are carefully watching their movements and their
propaganda," the official said.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian armed forces is composed of the army, the Islamic
Revolutionary Guards Corp and security forces under the command of
the supreme leader and Commander-in-Chief Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
</P>
<P>
The joint staff of the armed forces is responsible for
coordinating the three military forces in the country.
</P>
<P>
Firouzabadi also warned the U.S. that the people in Aran,
Azerbaijan, where the U.S. is alleged to set up the base, are
Shiite Muslims with Iranian blood in their veins.
</P>
<P>
"The Americans and the Israelis must pay attention to this
important point," he added.
</P>
<P>
Azerbaijan's State Adviser on Foreign Policy Vafa Gulizade on
Saturday underlined the need for the presence of U.S., Turkish
or NATO forces in his country.
</P>
<P>
Azerbaijan's security is at stake because there are forces
in Russia to revive the former Soviet Union, Gulizade said.
</P>
<P>
He also said Russia is equipping Armenia with modern
weaponry and Turkey should not remain silent in this connection.
</P>
<P>
However, Azerbaijan's ambassador to Tehran Abbasali Hasanov
recently strongly rejected a report on the establishment of a
U.S. base in Azerbaijan and termed it as "baseless."

<HEADLINE> Arab FMs Meet for Unified Stance on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Foreign ministers from 16 Arab
states met here Sunday in a bid to reach a unified stance on the
Iraqi issue.
</P>
<P>
The developments of the Iraqi situation after the mid-December
U.S.-British attack on the country and U.N. sanctions on Iraq top
the agenda of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain launched four-day air strikes against Iraq
last month for what the U.S. denounced as Baghdad's failure to
comply with the U.N. arms inspections.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. economic sanctions, imposed on Iraq after its 1990
invasion of Kuwait, will not be lifted until the U.N. arms
inspectors certify that Iraq's weapons of mass destruction have
been destroyed.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers will seek ways of restoring Arab
reconciliation and solidarity.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the meeting, Arab foreign ministers conducted
extensive consultations to try to work out a statement which will
spell out unified Arab policies towards the Iraqi issue.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf called Saturday
on the Arab countries to condemn the U.S.-British attack on Iraq
and support Baghdad's demand for the lifting of the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
But Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said Saturday that
Arab countries would not agree to defy U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
A draft statement for the foreign ministers' meeting proposed
that the Arab countries express sympathy for the plight of the
Iraqi people under the crippling trade embargo.
</P>
<P>
But it will stop short of voicing support for the government of
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein. It will also urge Iraq to fully
abide by the U.N. resolutions.

NANJING, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Highway construction added 3.2
billion yuan in gross domestic product (GDP) to east China's
Jiangsu Province in 1998, according to a local source.
</P>
<P>
Investment for highway construction reached 14.66 billion
yuan, up 37 percent from 1997. Jiangsu's expressways stretch for
402 kilometers, with another eight expressways, of 906 km long in

asphalt, and 320,000 tons of petroleum, bringing a boost to
related industries.
</P>
<P>
An average of 95,000 people were working on the site monthly.
Highways construction provided 260,000 job opportunities last

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Eleven people were killed
and seven wounded last night in Richmond, about 150 km west of
Durban, hours after the assassination of Sifiso Nkabinde, National
Secretary of the United Democratic Movement, police confirmed
Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
"We have been told of the massacre... Police are
investigating," senior superintendent Henry Budhram said.
</P>
<P>
Among those wounded was Mamkhize Ndabazitha, Deputy Chairperson
of the ruling African National Congress (ANC) in Richmond.
</P>
<P>
The attack came less than 12 hours after the assassination of
controversial politician Nkabinde in Richmond.
</P>
<P>
The 38-year old former African National Congress leader in the
Midlands, KuaZulu Natal Province, was gunned down by three unknown
men early Saturday morning. His bodyguard, Simphiwe Dlamini, and
Dlamini's mother, Lendele were injured in the shooting.
</P>
<P>
Richmond residents, who have seen violent activities in the
area for years, believe that Nkabinde's death could spark the
resurgence of violence in the region.
</P>
<P>
So far, police can not confirm whether the Saturday night
massacre was in revenge of Nkabinde's killing.

<HEADLINE> Unseeded Enqvist Upsets Philippoussis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Sweden's Thomas Enqvist upset
14th seed Mark Philippoussis of Australia at the Australian Open
tennis tournament in Melbourne on Sunday to oust another seed at
the Grand Slam opening event.
</P>
<P>
The unseeded Enqvist followed up his elimination of U.S. Open
champion Pat Rafter in the third round with a 6-2, 6-4, 6-7
(3-7), 4-6, 6-2 victory over Philippoussis in two hours 51
minutes.
</P>
<P>
Enqvist will meet with unseeded Swiss Marc Rosset on Tuesday's
quarterfinal, his second following his loss as the seventh seed
to Australian Mark Woodforde in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Philippoussis looked headed for a quick defeat but he rallied
and broke the Swede when he was serving for the match at 5-4 in
the third set.
</P>
<P>
The set went into a tie-breaker which went to a resurgent
Philippoussis 7-3 as Enqvist began to make many errors.

With his confidence up, Philippoussis broke his opponent's
service in the ninth game when Enqvist's forehand found the net.

Enqvist made full use of his reprieve and held his service for
5-2 and broke Philipoussis again in the eighth game for his

<HEADLINE> TV Shopping Brings Moans From Public </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Television shopping has come
under fire from the public in China's Fujian province for its
high prices, false claims and shoddy products on sale.
</P>
<P>
A survey by the provincial consumers' commission concluded
from an analysis of 19,000 complaints that TV shopping, a
relatively new way for people to buy commodities, has resulted in
many complaints from consumers.
</P>
<P>
TV shopping took off after direct sales were banned and has
appeared on most stations in Fujian. A dozen TV stations in
Fuzhou City alone have set up TV shopping corporations.
</P>
<P>
But many of the prices are too high price, while some
advertisements exaggerated the worth of the products on sale, and
other products are fakes or shoddy, according to a commission
official, who also claimed that many of the companies did not
provide after-sale services.
</P>
<P>
For example, a box of slimming medicine promised it could
reduce weight between three to six kilograms and that this was a
one-off for life. But a customer complained that his weight
actually increased three kilograms. In consultation with the
company selling the product he was told to take more, but his
weight went up another three kilograms after he took three more
doses.
</P>
<P>
Now Fujian Provincial Administration for Industry and Commerce
is enforcing a supervisory code for the industry.

<HEADLINE> Thai Govt Urged to Relax Bank Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Economists and businessmen
attending a meeting of the Thai Chamber of Commerce on Sunday
called on the government to relax bank rules.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Tarrin Nimmanahaeminda told the participants
that he would press the banks not to take advantage of depositors
by keeping deposit rates low.
</P>
<P>
The interest rates must reflect the cost and income of banks,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Bank clients have complained that banks have been charging high
penalty rates for customers who have defaulted on interest
payment. Tarrin admitted that the new classified non-performing
loans (NPLs), deriving from three-month interest default, are
still on the rise.
</P>
<P>
Tarrin expressed sympathy for borrowers who had been charged
penalty rates after failing to pay interest for three consecutive
months, and said the banks should consider cutting interest rates
for customers instead of punishing them.
</P>
<P>
It was learned that the Bank of Thailand (central bank) has
been asked to consult with banks on the matter, and the outcome is
expected shortly. Tarrin also said he had asked the central bank,
other government-owned banks and commercial banks to speed up debt
restructuring.
</P>
<P>
Tarrin reiterated the government's plan to launch an additional
economic-stimulus package through increases in fiscal spendings by
March and promised to put more pressure on banks to cut interest
rates further.
</P>
<P>
"The government will initiate a second fiscal package to
stimulate the economy through job-creation projects in both urban
communities and rural areas," he said.
</P>
<P>
Public expenditure aims to create employment opportunities,
educational programs and health care, he said, adding that funds
would be allocated quickly for small projects nationwide.
</P>
<P>
Chalongphob Sussangkarn, president of the Thailand Development
Research Institute, said the government and the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) should re-examine the financial restructuring
program in order to give more flexibility to banks and encourage
them to lend to the "real" economic sector.
</P>
<P>
"The serious question now is to ask whether we should
reconsider the previous measures that were aimed at raising local
bank practices to international standards, given the unresolved
liquidity crunch and the domino threat on bankruptcies of private
companies," he said.
</P>
<P>
Such international standards, like provisions for overdue
interest payment of more than three months, will cause problems
for banks, he said.
</P>
<P>
He estimated that the NPL had surged to about 50 percent, which
would further weaken the lending capacity of the banks.
</P>
<P>
Chalongphob believed the IMF might want to discuss this new
issue given its previous agreement to allow the government to run
a higher budget deficit and go for lower interest rates.
</P>
<P>
Narong Chokwatana, president of Pan Group, shared Chalongphob's
view by calling upon the government to abolish the economic-reform
program prescribed by the IMF.
</P>
<P>
He took an opposing view to that of Tarrin by saying that banks
should cut interest rates for good customers rather than
non-paying customers.

<HEADLINE> Iran Seeks U.S. Compensation for Stray Missile </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Iran will seek compensation from
the United States for the losses caused by the strike of two
U.S. stray missiles on Iranian city during the U.S.-British
military attacks on Iraq last month, local daily Tehran times
revealed on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
An Iranian Foreign Ministry official told the daily that Iran
is assessing the damages inflicted on Khorramshahr, southwestern
Khuzestan province and would lodge its complaint against the
U.S. following the assessment.
</P>
<P>
"The assessment of the damages is under consideration," the
official said on the condition of anonymity, "Iran hold the
governments of the U.S and Britain responsible for the damages
caused by the missiles."
</P>
<P>
Khorramshahr was hit by two stray missiles on December 17
when the U.S. and Britain started their military strikes on
Iraq. The missile attacks left heavy damages in the city close
to the Iraqi border but caused no casualty.
</P>
<P>
Iran lodged its strong protest to the U.S. and Britain soon
after the attacks by summoning the British charge d'affaires and
the Swiss ambassador, whose country looks after the American
interests in Iran.
</P>
<P>
However, British Foreign Office Minister Derek Fatchett on
Thursday turned down the Iranian request for compensation for
the missile attacks, because the British forces did not fire
any missiles during the attacks on Iraq last month.
</P>
<P>
In a written reply to the parliament, Fatchett confirmed that
Britain has received a compensation request from the Iranian
government. He suggested that the issue should be raised with the
U.S. authorities.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 24 (Xinhua) -- The China Pacific Insurance
Co. Ltd, one of the top insurers in China, has vowed to increase
its market share this year based on surging business in 1998.
</P>
<P>
To meet the target, the company is expected to focus on expandi
ng business in cities and developed areas. It will also adopt
new accounting rules in line with international norms this year,
and speed up the computerization of its business management
system.
</P>
<P>
The value insured by the company surged by 26.8 percent in
1998 to 3.8 trillion yuan (457.8 billion U.S. dollars), with the
profits rocketing 60 percent to 380 million yuan, according to a
company report.
</P>
<P>
The rapid business growth could be attributed to increased
market promotion, improved financial management and the unified
handling of premiums income, said the company president Wang
Guoliang at an annual conference.
</P>
<P>
The company also set up a joint-venture insurance company with
a leading US insurance company last year, aiming to introduce
advanced insurance techniques and management expertise.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Allied Militiaman Wounded in South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, January 24 (Xinhua) -- A member of the Israeli allied
South Lebanon Army (SLA) was seriously wounded in south Lebanon
Saturday night in an attack by the Lebanese guerrilla group
Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah, or Party of God, launched the attack on a SLA's post
at Kalkab village in the eastern sector of the Israeli occupied
border zone in south Lebanon, the Orient radio reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The SLA official radio Voice of the South has admitted the
casualty, saying the injured member was rushed to an Israeli
hospital for treatment.
</P>
<P>
This is the first casualty SLA suffered since the start of this
year. Thirty-four SLA militiamen were killed last year.
</P>
<P>
Israel carved out a self-declared security zone in south
Lebanon in 1985 with a claimed aim of protecting its north from
Lebanese guerrillas cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah has since been spearheading a guerrilla war to drive
Israeli occupation forces and their proxy SLA out of the country.

<P>
CHENGDU, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Southwest China's Sichuan
Province had cut the number of laid-off workers by 10.8 percent
by the end of 1998, against its 1997 figures, local authorities
have said.
</P>

The success was attributed to the local government's
intensified efforts on re-employment and relevant training.
Statistics show that 678,200 people joined re-employment
projects, and 322,000 laid-off workers of state-owned enterprises
found new jobs last year.

The effort will help ensure social stability and boost the
local economy, officials said.

In the past year, the provincial government has implemented a
series of preferential policies to encourage re-employment of the
jobless, including speeding up the construction of basic
facilities and exploiting labor-intensive industries to increase
job opportunities.
</P>
<P>
All state-owned enterprises have set up special re-employment
centers, with the total number reaching nearly 7,000.

PYONGYANG -- Japan's accusations that the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK) had fired a ballistic missile originated
from its ambitions to become a military power and to expand
overseas, a newspaper published here said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK launched a rocket unannounced on August 31 last year.
The paper described it as a successful satellite launch instead
of a missile test.
</P>
<P>
It said in a commentary that Japan, under the pretext of
so-called threat from DPRK, set up a meeting within the
government for quick response to defense related matters, while
attempting to adopt in the Diet (parliamentary) bills regarding
Japan-U.S. defense cooperation. These acts showed Japan's
hostility toward the DPRK, said the commentary, adding that
Japan's ambitions to be a military power and expand overseas have
constituted a big threat and challenge to the peace and security
of not only DPRK, but also Asia as a whole.

<HEADLINE> Millennium Disaster Expected Twice in Kenya in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 1 (Xinhua) -- Kenyans have to brace for two
computer breakdowns this year ahead of the final and devastating
assault on computers by the millennium bug, experts have warned.
</P>
<P>
The first break down is expected at the stroke of midnight of
April 19, 1999, according to a report from the local Herald
newspaper Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The next such breakdown is anticipated on September 9, 1999, a
date when digitalized as 9-9-1999, the four nines will mean
changing commands in computers, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Experts said when the bug strikes in non-compliant instruments,
major facilities like elevators, aircraft, banking, security
operation and virtually any computer-related instrument will
collapse overnight, precipitating what is believed to be record
breaking lawsuits from complaining users.
</P>
<P>
The threat of concerning computer systems has triggered a
massive race to ensure that firms are 2,000 compliant and avert
what could become a " dooms day."
</P>
<P>
For the ordinary Kenyans, running a bank account or those with
an insurance policy with an insurance company, consolation may
only come when one insists on being provided with monthly
statements being issued on the state of accounts to provide a
fall-back position to rely on, when computers go under.
</P>
<P>
And to counter the devastation expected, Kenya has put in place
systems that reject non-compliant computers being imported into
the east African country.

<HEADLINE> Xinjiang Reports Record Gold Output </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Northwest China's Xinjiang
Uygur Autonomous Region produced 10 tons of gold in 1998, a
record high in the region's gold production history.
</P>
<P>
The 1998 gold output ranked the region ninth in the country.
</P>
<P>
According to local sources, the gold output value was worth
more than 500 million yuan (60.2 million U.S. dollars) and the
region raked in 69.98 million yuan (8.4 million U.S. dollars) in
pre-tax profits.
</P>
<P>
Xinjiang is one of the areas that abound in gold reserves in
China and has a prospective gold reserve of 500 tons.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the region's gold production sector faced a number
of difficulties, including two gold price cuts, and with many
gold mines suffering from inadequate availability of gold r
eserves.
</P>
<P>
Local gold administrative departments took measures to help
gold producers lower production costs and encourage them to pool
fund for prospecting gold and increasing availability of gold
reserves, while stepping up efforts to deal with illegal gold
diggers.
</P>
<P>
The region was added with 11.2 tons of verified recoverable
industrial gold reserves last year, said the sources.

<P>
GUANGZHOU, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Guangzhou, capital of south
China's Guangdong Province, plans to invest 17.1 billion yuan
(2.06 billion U.S. dollars) in infrastructure construction during
1999, up 21 percent on 1998.
</P>
<P>
The bulk of funds will be earmarked for key urban engineering

The city spent 14 billion yuan in 1998 on wide-ranging
projects related to communications, sport and cultural
facilities, afforestation and environmental protection. Last
year's allocations were the largest in the past 50 years, said

NAIROBI, January 24 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news

</P>
<P>
Daily Nation:
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. President Bill Clinton called on Ethiopia and Eritrea
to accept an Organization of African Unity peace plan and end
their border dispute, a White House statement was quoted as

<HEADLINE> Film-Shooting Begins To Drop In Los Angeles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Film-shooting on the
streets of Los Angeles dipped sharply last year as tighter
spending sliced into film, TV and commercial production.
</P>
<P>
The numbers released Saturday by Entertainment Industry
Development Corp., which issues permits for about 80 percent of
the shooting done in Los Angeles County, show an overall drop of
four percent in production days.
</P>
<P>
Feature film shooting, for example, took a sharp 13 percent
drop as studios cut their bloated movie slates. Commercials, hurt
by the Asian and international economic troubles, fell by 7.5
percent, while television dropped by 4.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
That marks the strongest statistical evidence to date that the
soaring production growth Southern California enjoyed in the mid
-1990s reached a plateau in the middle of last year.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the production days soared nearly 30 percent
following a 27-percent increase in 1995. The first drop in growth
alarmed industrial experts and economists.
</P>
<P>
Given the increasingly larger role entertainment is playing in
the Southern California economy, they believe that the dip in
production is not only an unwelcome development for the
entertainment industry, but also for the region as a whole
because thousands of small to medium-size suppliers and service
companies do business with Hollywood.

<HEADLINE> Liaoning to Monitor Enterprises' Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Northeast China's Liaoning
Province, a major heavy industrial base, has been constructing an
electronic network to monitor production and marketing of 288
large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises in the province.
</P>
<P>
According to local authorities, when the network is put into
operation, the enterprises are requested to list 35 monthly
indexes regarding production and marketing of the respective
enterprises so that relevant departments of the province can
easily refer to and work out policies accordingly.
</P>
<P>
The network is financed by the provincial and city-level
committees of economy and trade at a cost of 120,000 yuan. It is
built on a similar but small existing facility set up last year
and covering 60 businesses.
</P>
<P>
Liaoning has one tenth of China's large and medium-sized
enterprises.  And reducing losses and increasing profits in the
enterprises have been listed as a priority of the province's work
agenda.
</P>
<P>
A total of 130 enterprises of the 288 have incurred economic
losses. A local official said the establishment of the
monitoring network would be important for the work of reducing
the losses and increasing profits.
</P>
<P>
Preparations for opening website addresses of different cities
have been finished. It is expected that the 288 enterprises will
also be hooked into the new electronic network before the
traditional spring festival which falls on February 16.

<HEADLINE> African Traditional Dress Urged to Be Promoted in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Managing Director of the
Harare-based Queen of Africa Boutique, Dulce Ricardo, has launched
a campaign to promote the wearing of African fashion by African
women, The Sunday Mail magazine reported.
</P>
<P>
The rapid permeation of westernized clothing and accessories in
the continent have virtually sidelined traditional African
outfits, especially in young ladies, Ricardo told the magazine
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
She said this westernization of fashion has resulted in a loss
of identity, recognition and pride.
</P>
<P>
"It is now very difficult to separate Africans from Americans
and Europeans, because we are all wearing the same things," she
said.
</P>
<P>
"What Queen of Africa Boutique is campaigning for now is the
adoption of traditional outfits instead of western ones," Ricardo
said.
</P>
<P>
She said that some of the continent's greatest women have worn
traditional clothing, such as Zimbabwe's first lady Grace Mugabe,
and their identifies and cultures have therefore been respected as
they radiate from the very clothes that they have worn.
</P>
<P>
"Perhaps the best-dressed women in any social and formal
gathering would be those wearing African dresses, which are
outstanding and adaptable to any setting," said Ricardo.
</P>
<P>
Apart from their eye-catching, glittering appearance, African
dresses are weather-resistant, thus providing warmth in cold, and
are cool during heat, she said.
</P>
<P>
"I hope we will go into the next millennium holding closely
onto our identity, or culture and our pride. We must begin the
African renaissance from our very clothes," Ricardo said.

<TEXT>
<P>
Lhasa, January 24 (Xinhua) -- The following are some facts and
figures about the religious activities of the people in the Tibet
Autonomous Region:
</P>
<P>
At present, there are 1,787 sites for Tibetan Buddhist
activities in the Region, and there are 46,380 Buddhist monks and
nuns living in monasteries. The Tibet Autonomous Region and the
seven prefectures or cities under its jurisdiction all have their
own Buddhist associations, and the autonomous regional Buddhist
association has its own journal and establishment for printing
Tibetan-language scriptures.
</P>
<P>
In 1951 the Central Government and the local government of
Tibet, headed by the Dalai Lama, signed the 17-article Agreement
on Measures for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet, which
explicitly stipulated that "In Tibet a policy ensuring people's
freedom of religious belief will be carried out, the religious
beliefs, customs and habits of the Tibetan people will be
respected, and the Lamaist monasteries will be properly
protected. The Central Government will allow no change in the
revenues of monasteries."
</P>
<P>
In 1959, the Democratic Reform started in Tibet. The feudal
privileges of the three major categories of feudal lords,
including senior monks, as well as the system of exploitation,
were abolished, and religion was separated from government. At
the same time, the Central Government reaffirmed its stand for
"respecting the freedom of religious belief and the customs and
habits of the Tibetan people," and that the monasteries should be
managed independently and in a democratic way by people of
religious persuasion.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Central Government and the government of the
Tibet Autonomous Region have ranked some famous religious sites,
such as the Potala Palace and Jokhang Temple, and the
Tashilhunpo, Drepung, Sakya and Sera monasteries, among the key
historical sites under state or regional protection. Since the
early 1980s the state has allocated special funds as well as gold
and silver every year for the maintenance, restoration and pr
otection of monasteries in Tibet, to the total sum of over 300
million yuan-worth.
</P>
<P>
The state and the autonomous region have financed the
maintenance and restoration of a number of famous monasteries,
including the Jokhang, Palkor, Tselayungdrung, Mindrol, Samye
(built in the eighth century), Tashilhunpo, Drepung, Sera and
Ganden (the latter four being the four main monasteries of the
Gelug Sect of Tibetan Buddhism), the Jampa Ling in Qamdo, the
Redreng, the Sakya Monastery of the Sakya Sect, the Mtshur-phu
and Karma-gdan-sa monasteries of the Karma Kagyu Sect, the
Drigung Thil Monastery of the Drigung Sect, the Meru and Rala
Yungdrung Ling monasteries of the Bon religion, and the Shalu
Monastery of the Shalu Sect.

ANAHEIM, California, January 23 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Vice
President Al Gore is expected to announce Sunday that the White
House will increase spending on high-tech projects next year at
the annual meeting of the American Association for the
Advancement of Science in Anaheim, a report from Washington D.C.
said.
</P>
<P>
The administration plans to spend 366 million dollars more on
high-tech projects during fiscal 2000, which starts on Oct. 1,
and extend a research tax credit of 2.4 billion dollars aimed at
helping scientists develop super-fast computers that can speak

official as saying.
</P>
<P>
The spending increases are part of the administration's
1.8-billion-dollar budget for high-tech research, about 60 perc
ent of which will go to research universities, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Gore also will propose extending an existing tax credit worth
2.4 billion dollars, which offers a 20-percent tax break based on
a company's increase in research spending.

The state allocated a special fund of more than 55 million
yuan for the five-odd-year renovation of the Potala Palace
involving a total floor space of 33,900 sq m. Another special
fund of 6.7 million yuan, together with 111 kg of gold and over
2,000 kg of silver and a large amount of gems, has been provided
to finance the restoration of the funerary stupas and sacrificial
halls of the fifth to the ninth Panchen Lamas. In addition, the
state has allocated 66.2 million yuan and 650 kg of gold for the
construction of the funerary stupa and sacrificial hall of the
10th Panchen Lama. In 1994 an additional appropriation of 20
million yuan was made to further renovate the Ganden Monastery.
</P>
<P>
In 1992 the Religious Affairs Bureau of the State Council
approved the succession of the 17th Karmapa Living Buddha, in
accordance with Tibet's religious practices. In 1995, a great
event in the Buddhist world came to pass when the rite of drawing
lots from a golden urn was carried out, and the boy who in
Buddhist belief was the reincarnation of the deceased 10th
Panchen Lama was identified, confirmed, given the title,
enthroned and ordained as the 11th Panchen Lama in accordance
with the religious practices and historical conventions and with
the approval of the State Council.
</P>
<P>
Government departments at all levels treat all religions and
religious sects, as well as all people, whether religious
believers or not, in Tibet, equally and without any
discrimination. They respect and protect all religious activities
in accordance with the law. The internal affairs of temples and
monasteries are independently handled by the management bodies
formed through democratic elections. Buddhist monks and nuns, on
their own initiative, study and debate the scriptures, attend
lectures given by eminent monks, perform Abhiseka (consecration
by pouring water on the head) and ordainment, disseminate
Esoteric doctrines, perform Buddhist ceremonies, chant scriptures
in the presence of believers, release the souls of the dead and
pray for blessings by touching the heads. Religious people have
the freedom to make pilgrimages to temples and monasteries, and
holy mountains and lakes, including circumambulation around holy
mountains and spinning prayer wheels. They are also free to offer
sacrifices, give food or alms to Buddhist monks and nuns, burn
incense and chant scriptures.
</P>
<P>
Prayer banners, cairns of stones with scripture texts painted
or carved on them and religious people devoutly prostrating
themselves on the ground, spinning prayer wheels or on
pilgrimages can be seen everywhere in Tibet; and prayer niches
and shrines to Buddha can be found in the houses of almost all
religious people. It is estimated that more than one million
religious believers go to Jokhang Temple in Lhasa to pay homage
and burn incense to Buddha each year.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka Launches Massive Traffic Improvement Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, January 24 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government,
together with the Dhaka City Corporation, is launching a 11.7
billion taka (241.2 million U.S. dollar) project to improve the
capital city's traffic system, the Daily Star newspaper reported
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The key objective of "the Dhaka Urban Transport Project" (DUTP)
is the preparation of a 20-year transport plan for Dhaka, which
started Saturday with the World Bank providing 117 million dollars
for the project, said the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The DUTP will help finance urgently needed traffic management
measures through a variety of traffic system and infrastructure
improvement, including pavement reconstruction, separation of
motorized and non-motorized traffic, improved traffic control
using modern traffic signals, and measures to reduce risks for
pedestrians.
</P>
<P>
To develop an improved and well-organized mass transport
network in the city, the project envisages good bus services
provided by the private sector to be the main thrust of public
transportation.
</P>
<P>
The project will also strengthen the capacity of key municipal
agencies involved in the city's transport system, including the
metropolitan police, by providing equipment and training.
</P>
<P>
The Dhaka Transport Planning Coordination Board, a
public-private partnership for transport planning and management
in Dhaka headed by the city mayor, will be formed to oversee the
long-term urban transport policy making.
</P>
<P>
The traffic congestion in Dhaka, a city with a population of
over nine million living in an area of 815 square kilometers and
where about 630,000 vehicles and nearly one million rickshaws are
plying in the streets, has already reached "crisis proportions."

<HEADLINE> Pope Sets out Church's Goals for New Millennium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Pope John Paul II has
signed here a major document setting out the Catholic church's
goals for the new millennium and the actions to be taken.
</P>
<P>
The document, made known by the Pope at a mass Saturday,
touches upon human rights, indigenous peoples, globalization,
foreign debt, corruption, drug trafficking and the environment.
</P>
<P>
The document called drug trafficking a serious threat for the
social fabric of the nations of America, saying it contributes to
the increase of crimes, violence, and destruction of families
while destroying governments, eroding the economic security and
the stability of the nations.
</P>
<P>
The document stressed drug trafficking as one of the most
urgent challenges which many nations of the world must face.
</P>
<P>
Turning to globalization, the document said, globalization can
have positive consequences, such as promotion of efficiency and
increase of production that permit the development of the
relations between the diverse countries and strengthen the unity
of the peoples.
</P>
<P>
However, it warned that if globalization follows the mere laws
of the market applied "according to the conveniences of the
powerful," it also has negative consequences.
</P>
<P>
The Pope repeated in the document that the globalized economy
must be examined in the "light of the principles of social
justice."
</P>
<P>
The 24-page message was written in response to suggestions
from bishops in both North and South America, called to the
Vatican in 1997 to agree on joint strategy to win back disenc
hanted Catholics and promote a genuine "Christian spirituality."
</P>
<P>
The Pope arrived here on Friday at the start of a trip which
will on Tuesday take him to St. Louis, Missouri.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 24 (Xinhua) -- China's foreign trade
administration system will be radically transformed, the Business
Weekly reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
China is to establish a foreign trade system based on tools
such as tariffs, taxation and credits, said Wang Shichun, deputy
director-general of the foreign trade administration department
of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation
(MOFTEC).
</P>
<P>
China needs an import and export license control mechanism
and rational and transparent quota allocation procedures to help
foster the competitiveness of the Chinese economy, according to
Wang.
</P>
<P>
MOFTEC has cut the number of licensed exports to 58 at the
beginning of this year, he said, adding that the number will be
further reduced.
</P>
<P>
Instead of being monopolized by State export firms, quotas
will be allocated via public bidding among Chinese exporters and
determined by higher prices, the deputy director-general noted.
</P>
<P>
Early this month, 20 private manufacturers were granted
import and export rights. Wang described it as another major move
in trade system reform.
</P>
<P>
In addition, some 6,000 major Chinese manufacturers no longer
need MOFTEC approval to conduct foreign trade after they register
with relevant authorities.
</P>
<P>
Wang pointed out that his department will gradually shift its
focus from the arduous task of daily examination and approval, to
market research, policy-making and negotiations to forestall
trade disputes.

located close to the schools as they were distracting students
from attending classes and also encouraged petty thefts by
students and youngsters," Mann Chheun, chief of the Municipality's
cabinet, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Any outlet which does not adhere to the authority's
instructions will have their equipment confiscated and the premise
sealed," he added.

playing truant from schools. They are normally found in the video
games arcades or snooker centers located near the schools.
</P>

Police officials said students were also resorting to extorting
money from their class or school mates to feed their passion for
the games which is addictive.

ban in order to fill in the strong demand in domestic market, the
Business Weekly reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation
(MOFTEC) decided at the end of last year to cancel controls on
timber importers, so that companies with foreign trade rights can
engage in timber import business.
</P>
<P>
"We can completely depend on imports to solve the problem of
inadequate timber supply following the output reduction," Chinese
Premier Zhu Rongji said when he was inspecting the flooded areas
in northeast China last year.
</P>
<P>
The devastating floods that swept across China last Summer
have created demands for timber products in reconstruction, and
resulted in a ban on the logging of natural forests.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that the country will reduce timber production
by 10 million cubic meters a year.
</P>
<P>
The massive infrastructure projects launched by the central
government also fueled the demand for timber products.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, imports will be very important to plug the growing
demand-supply gap of timber products this year, experts said.

<HEADLINE> Record Grain Production In Chinese Earthquake Area </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Grain output of the city
of Zhangjiakou in China's Hebei Province reached a record 1.6
million tons in 1998 despite the earthquake measuring 6.2 on the
Richter scale that jolted its Shangyi and Zhangbei area on Janua
ry 10 of last year, leaving 35 people dead and injuring more than
100.
</P>
<P>
The success has been attributed to rapid recovery in
agricultural production through local government efforts to build
water conservation facilities and to repair reservoirs and dig
more wells.
</P>
<P>
The city increased its irrigated land by 11,200 hectares and
water-conserving land area by 22,000 hectares. More advanced
agricultural techniques are also credited with helping.

<HEADLINE> Menem Defends Plan to "Dollarize" Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Argentine President
Carlos Menem said Saturday that his proposal to adopt the U.S.
dollar as the national currency accords with the United States
plan to create a free trade zone throughout the Americas.
</P>
<P>
"We need a single currency for Mercosur, and this process of
economic integration into a free trade zone in all of the
continent has as a logical consequence the possibility of a
single currency," Menem told a press conference. Mercosur groups
Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay to form a top trade bloc
in South America.
</P>
<P>
Menem, who was in La Rioja, his home province, was responding
to the nation's main opposition Alliance, which had questioned
the plan of "dollarizing" the Argentine economy as a protection
from the crisis that affects neighboring Brazil.
</P>
<P>
Raul Alfonsin, former Argentine president and one of the
Alliance's main leaders, had said that to adopt the dollar as the
national currency would mean subjecting the country to U.S.
decisions.
</P>
<P>
"We are losing our nation's ability to take decisions. In all
areas we are putting the country's future in jeopardy," Alfonsin
said Thursday after hearing the proposal.
</P>
<P>
In defending the plan, Menem said: "It is stupid to say that
to use the dollar as the national currency is to attack the
sovereignty. With that criterion in Europe all the countries
which adopted the euro as their currency have attacked their own
sovereignty."
</P>
<P>
Menem's proposal of adopting the dollar to replace the peso,
for which Argentina and the United States would have to reach an
agreement, has provoked criticism from some politicians and
economists. There were accusations that the proposal was just
the sort of "audacious" move in the election year of 1999.
</P>
<P>
Argentina pegged the Peso at par with the dollar in 1991.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Govt Accuses NLD, PDF of Inciting Riots </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar authorities have accused
the opposition National League for Democracy (NLD) and the
People's Defense Force (PDF), which the government calls an
expatriate insurgent group, of inciting riots in the country by
spreading anti-government pamphlets in the last two months.
</P>
<P>
The authorities said some of their members dropped and
distributed "instigative" pamphlets in the Institute of Medicine
No.2 in Yangon, on buses and at bus stops, and in public parks
during November and December, the official New Light of Myanmar
reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
An organizer of the PDF, formed in 1990 in a Thai border area,
was charged with distributing the pamphlets and propaganda
leaflets in collusion with some NLD members.
</P>
<P>
Action is being taken against them for the move, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
The NLD, a winning party in the 1990 general election, last
June urged the government to call the parliament. After its call
met with ignorance, the NLD unilaterally formed a 10-member
"Committee Representing the people's Parliament Elected in the
Election" and set up the "People's parliament" on September 16.
</P>
<P>
On December 8, the Representing Committee further formed 10
"sub-committees", adopting some resolutions including a criminal
complaint against the government's National Intelligence Bureau
for detaining the party's parliament representatives-elect and
forcing a number of its party branches and members to dissolve and
resign respectively since then.
</P>
<P>
According to the NLD, 747 of its members including its 158
parliament representatives-elect and 589 organizers are still
being held by the government up to now since last May.

<HEADLINE> Death Toll Rises to 47 in Indonesia's Maluku Rioting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 24 (Xinhua) -- The death toll from the rioting
since Tuesday in Ambon, capital of Indonesia's Maluku province,
has risen to 47, said reports reaching here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"There is a possibility that the number of victims will still
rise as security forces are still sweeping the locations of the
riots," Maluku Chief of Police Col. Karyono said on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Expressing his concern, Karyono said three police officers were
hospitalized after being seriously wounded.
</P>
<P>
The biggest riots that ever happened in Maluku's provincial
capital have caused the burning or damaging of 261 house, 20 cars,
11 motorcycles, 216 pedicabs, 82 kiosks, 3 traditional markets, 13
houses of worship and two banks, one government office, one hotel
and one movie theater, according to the reports.
</P>
<P>
The riots also forced 20,619 people to flee to military
complexes, mosques, churches, and other public facilities. Most of
the refugees are still afraid to return home.
</P>
<P>
The security situation in Ambon in general was now under
control, enabling many residents to resume their activities,
especially buying food staples and kerosene, reports said.
</P>
<P>
However, fears of renewed violence are still hanging over the
area on Saturday, as the military threatened to shoot rioters on
sight, said the reports.
</P>
<P>
Trikora Regional Military Commander Maj. Gen, Amir Sembiring
has issued orders to security officers in the field to stop any
civilian they see carrying a weapon, disarm and question him.
Security personnel are authorized to shoot on-the-spot anyone
offering resistance to enforcement of the law.
</P>
<P>
The commander has also called on residents not to appear in the
streets in groups and not to leave their neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
The communal clashes started on Tuesday when a local resident
extorted a minivan driver identified as Jopie. The unrest quickly
spread to Sanan district, North Maluku and West Seram subdistrict,
Central Maluku.
</P>
<P>
Indonesian Armed Forces Commander Gen. Wiranto, who visited
Ambon Friday night, has ordered local security forces to capture
those believed to have provoked the riots. A curfew has been since
imposed in the city to prevent further rioting.
</P>
<P>
With a population of 2.08 million, Maluku province comprises
1,027 islands, and 70 percent of its territory is covered by sea.
Some of the islands are in the Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
According to the 1997 official statistics, 59.01 percent of its
population are Muslims, Protestants make up 35.29 percent, while
Catholics number 5.19 percent.
</P>
<P>
Maluku is one of a few provinces, including Aceh, Irian Jaya
and East Timor, whose history is marked with separatist movements.
</P>
<P>
According to the official Indonesian National History book,
rebel Robert Steven Soumokil once established the South Maluku
Republic (RMS). He intended to declare a separate state from
Indonesia in the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
After the 1970s, the group was little heard of. Most of its
elderly leaders live in the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, according to local residents, some RMS flags were
hoisted in Ambon.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Wants Regional Mechanism for Labor Migration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Thailand is to propose the
setting up of a regional mechanism to deal with labor migration in
Asia when it hosts a meeting on the issue in April, the Bangkok
Post reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Worked out by government officials, non-government
organizations and academics, the proposal calls for member states
of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) to launch
the mechanism before extending it to other Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh, one of the main countries of origin of migrant
labor, was identified as a target member.
</P>
<P>
The proposal was forged during a day-long brainstorming session
in preparation for the international symposium towards regional
cooperation on undocumented migration, which Bangkok is due to
host from April 21-23.
</P>
<P>
A total of 18 countries are due to participate in the symposium
including the nine member states of ASEAN.
</P>
<P>
A official from the Thai foreign Ministry was quoted as saying
that countries of origin should prevent migration problems by
looking after their nationals and providing information on
international law.
</P>
<P>
When a problem occurs, they should take them back and the
United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and other
international organizations should help in the repatriation of
these migrants, the official said.

<HEADLINE> AmCham-China White Paper Praises China's Commercial Surrounding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 24 (Xinhua) -- More than 550 U.S.-based
companies doing business in China recently agreed that the
context surrounding American commercial involvement in China was
"largely positive", the English Business Weekly reported today.
</P>
<P>
This was announced in the first white paper issued by the
American Chamber of Commerce in China (AmCham-China), which is on
behalf of over 1,250 corporate and individual members.
</P>
<P>
In the white paper, the chamber recognized China's
implementation of market-oriented reforms and the achievement of
high economic growth rates consistently since 1979. "Especially
noteworthy has been China's stability and continued growth in the
face of recent Asian financial troubles," it said.
</P>
<P>
Serving as a forum for the collective voice of American
businesses in China, the white paper also cited three major
stumbling blocks for U.S. businesses in China which were the
growing U.S. trade deficit with China, the uncertainty regarding
China's Normal Trade Relations status, and the controversy
surrounding China's accession to the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
"American commercial diplomatic efforts should be expanded
through increased funding for trade advocacy, trade finance and
on-the-ground commercial support," the white paper said.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. Government should also remove unilateral sanctions,
such as restrictions on the ability of the Trade and Development
Agency and the U.S. Agency for International Development to
operate in China."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, it also encouraged the US Government to extend
permanent NTR trading status to China.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, member companies of the chamber also raised a series
of suggestions to the Chinese Government, such as increasing the
transparency of rules and regulations, opening the distribution
services sector, and strengthening local enforcement of laws and
regulations concerning intellectual property rights.

<HEADLINE> Brazil Currency Devaluation No Terrible Harm to China: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Brazilian financial turbulence
will not do terrible harm to China's foreign trade sector, the
"Business Weekly" reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Li Zhixiang, a senior researcher from the Chinese Academy of
International Trade and Economic Cooperation, told the newspaper
that the devaluation of the real will only have limited influence
on China.
</P>
<P>
China's exports to Brazil reached 959 million U.S. dollars
between January and November last year, only accounting for 0.5
percent of China's total exports in the period.
</P>
<P>
"The whole Latin American area accounts for a mere 1.6 percent
of China's total export volume," said Li. "Therefore the losses
caused by the currency devaluation in this region will not amount
to a significant level."
</P>
<P>
The researcher said that the growth rate of China's exports to
Brazil tumbled from a hefty 36.8 percent in 1997 to a negative
1.7 percent at the end of last year as a result of weak demand
and new import barriers erected by the country.
</P>
<P>
Trade protectionism has grown in Latin America since it was
hit by the repercussions of the Asian financial turmoil last year.
</P>
<P>
Martin Posth, vice-chairman of the Asia Pacific Advisory
Council of U.S.-based Arthur D. Little International INC, told Bus
iness Weekly that he believes the Brazilian turbulence would not
spread to Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and China's
mainland.
</P>
<P>
But some analysts said that in the long run, the Brazilian
turmoil may hurt overseas investors' confidence in the renminbi
and the Hong Kong dollar.
</P>
<P>
"The Brazilian monetary and economic crisis will cause bankers
and portfolio investors to reassess the risks involved in
investing in all emerging markets, and therefore may make it a
little more difficult for these economies, including China, to
raise capital from the international financial market," said Mu
Yibin, a scholar from the People's Bank of China.

<HEADLINE> 1998 GDP Growth Of 9 Percent In Eastern China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, January 24 (Xinhua) -- China's Anhui Province had
economic growth of nine percent in 1998 in spite of some serious
natural disasters, official statistics show.
</P>
<P>
Anhui's GDP was 283 billion yuan last year, up 9 percent from
1997. Early last year its economic growth fell to below the
national average for the first time since 1992. It was made worse
by excessive snowfalls, floods, and drought.
</P>
<P>
To improve the situation, Anhui restructured the economy and
placed greater importance on the service industry and increased
fiscal support for state-owned sector reforms, grain
distribution, social security, rural and township enterprises,
and the private sector.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that agriculture's added value
production was up 2.3 percent last year and industry's, 9.7
percent. Anhui's revenues were up 12.8 percent to 26.5 billion
yuan in 1998, and farmers incomes per capita edged up 2.8 percent
to 1,860 yuan.

<HEADLINE> Compensation Call for UK Olympic Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 23 (Xinhua) -- A leading member of Britain's
failed bid to stage the 2000 Olympic Games said on Saturday
Manchester should be compensated for the millions of pounds it
spent on its fruitless campaign.
</P>
<P>
Labour MP Graham Stringer made the call as Sydney faced more
allegations of corruption over its winning bid.
</P>
<P>
Further allegations are being made of favours being granted to
IOC members and jobs for their relatives during the battle for
the games.
</P>
<P>
Stringer, MP for Manchester Blackley, who was leader of the
city council and a key member of the bid team, said the IOC
should compensate all the losing cities.
</P>
<P>
"They paid out good money and they should be paid
compensation," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The IOC have sat back and done nothing when they were in a
position to clean the whole thing up."
</P>
<P>
Manchester was estimated to have spent 7.5 million pounds of
private sector money on its bid.
</P>
<P>
Stringer said he suspected it was impractical to take the
games away from Sydney at such a late stage. But the IOC should
consider fining or punishing them if they had behaved improperly.
</P>
<P>
"You only have to be within the confines of the Olympic
movement for five minutes to realise that things are not
straightforward, that there has been corruption," he said.
</P>
<P>
"That doesn't mean you can prove it. What has happened
recently is that proof has come out that Salt Lake City and
Sydney used bribery and improper practices to get their
nominations.
</P>
<P>
"We always said we were a clean bid and were not indulging in
bribery and we thought that was a positive asset. We have played
by the rules.
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if we would have won. There were other
geophysical reasons involved. But we will never know," he said.

HANGZHOU, January 24 (Xinhua) -- China plans to build a karst
cave museum beside Yaolin Fairyland, a group of karst caves in
Zhejiang Province, this year.
</P>
<P>
The Yaolin Karst Cave Museum will be a part of the Fairyland

Hangzhou, Zhejiang's capital. It has 6 major caves, the largest
of which covers a 27,000-sq.m. area.
</P>
<P>
Scientists say the caves are typical of the karst topography
of a damp subtropical coastal area. They were opened to the
outside world in 1980 and have had more than 15 million
visitors.
</P>
<P>
The Fourth International Conference on Tourist Caves is
scheduled to meet in Yaolin in October 2000.

<P>
WASHINGTON, January 23 (Xinhua) -- The Phoenix Suns have
signed Tom Gugliotta Saturday with a six-year contract worth
about 60 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The deal will have a clause allowing him to opt out after five
years, when he would be eligible for a better-paid player.
</P>
<P>
Gugliotta, 29, could have made more money by re-signing with
the Minnesota Timberwolves, but he said he was more interested in
finding a better team.
</P>
<P>
Gugliotta averaged 21 points per game last season but missed
41 games because of foot surgery. He played four seasons in
Minnesota after the first two in Washington.
</P>
<P>
Luc Longley went to the Suns from Chicago today after a
sign-and-trade agreement was approved by the NBA. Phoenix sent
the Bulls Mark Bryant, Martin Muursepp and Bubba Wells, along
with a first-round draft choice. Longley was reportedly signed a
six-year contract worth about 32 million dollars.

<HEADLINE> Decommissioning in N. Ireland May Halt Peace Process: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 23 (Xinhua) -- The Northern Ireland First
Minister David Trimble warned on Saturday the peace process may
have to be "parked" if the Irish Republican Army (IRA) does not
start to hand over its weapons.
</P>
<P>
Trimble's comments came just weeks before the scheduled
handover of power from parliament to a devolved administration in
Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on BBC Radio Ulster's Inside Politics program, he said
there was no question of compromising the basic principles of
peace and democracy.
</P>
<P>
"I have every intention of making whatever progress can be
made, and if it is necessary to park the process for a while so as
to tackle the obstacles created by the paramilitaries, well and
good."
</P>
<P>
"What we don't want is for the process to have a crash-landing
where it is seriously damaged."
</P>
<P>
Trimble said he would "construct a soft landing" if by the time
of handover of power from London there was still no move from the
paramilitaries on weapons.
</P>
<P>
He warned that the paramilitaries would have to clean up their
act and deliver the real peace and evidence of it.
</P>
<P>
Trimble was resisting attempts to set up the new executive for
the Northern Ireland Assembly, which would include two seats for
Sinn Fein, until the IRA hands over some weapons.

<HEADLINE> Sanctions Suspended to Encourage Burundi Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of the Great
Lakes region Saturday suspended the economic sanctions imposed on
Burundi since August 1996 when Pierre Buyoya came to power in a
bloodless military coup.
</P>
<P>
President Yoweri Museveni of Uganda, chairman of the one-day
summit attended by seven east and central African presidents or
their representatives, announced the decision in Tanzania's
northern town of Arusha.
</P>
<P>
Following a briefing by the international mediator, Tanzania's
former president Julius Nyerere, Museveni said the on-going peace
process in Burundi, however, will be closely monitored "until the
sanctions are completely lifted."
</P>
<P>
At the summit, President Pierre Buyoya of Burundi pledged
continuation of the peace talks which have entered the fourth
round since last June under Nyerere's mediation because they are
"a sacred and an irreversible process."
</P>
<P>
He urged all Burundians to join the peace process to restore
the country to the path of development and reconstruction although
it will take many years and dismissed fears that his government
was not sincere to restore democracy.
</P>
<P>
However, Buyoya expressed his concern over the continuing armed
 hostilities launched by the armed Hutu rebels.
</P>
<P>
Museveni assured Buyoya that the region was committed to see
peace restored in Burundi, underlining that "few extremists
(referring to armed rebels) should not stop us from negotiations."
</P>
<P>
Museveni, Buyoya and their Tanzanian, Kenyan, Rwandan
counterparts and representatives of presidents of Ethiopia, Zambia
and the Democratic Republic of Congo as well as the Organization
of African Unity (OAU) Secretary General Salim Ahmed Salim
expressed their thanks to Nyerere for his mediation effort.
</P>
<P>
President Daniel arap Moi of Kenya, an elderly east African
leader, urged Africa to move away from crisis to development and
economic progress.
</P>
<P>
"When will that dream of the United States of Africa come
true?" Moi asked his counterparts.
</P>
<P>
He said small countries like Burundi should join in the
regional grouping of economic and political cooperation to bring
prosperity to their people who have been shattered by poverty,
ignorance and under-development.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the fourth round of talks on Burundi peace process
concluded in Arusha late Saturday with Nyerere calling for
stepping up the efforts to reach an early peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
Encouraged by the suspension of the sanctions on Burundi,
Nyerere suggested at the closing of the plenary session, held at
the Arusha International Conference Center, that when the talks
resume in June, the parties should be ready to sign a peace
accord.
</P>
<P>
He said the four committees formed during the talks should be
ready to present their reports in June in a bid to "enable all of
us to reach an agreement."
</P>
<P>
The committees fall into four groups on the nature of Burundi
conflict, good governance and democracy, peace and security as
well as economic reconstruction and development of Burundi.
