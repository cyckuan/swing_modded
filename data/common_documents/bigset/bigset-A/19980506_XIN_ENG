<HEADLINE> China to Be Important Contributor to World IT Industry: Intel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 5 (Xinhua) -- China's importance as a computer
manufacturer and consumer is growing, said visiting Chairman and
CEO of Intel Corp. Andrew Grove, here today.
</P>
<P>
He also said that China "will be an important contributor to
the world IT (information technology) industry."
</P>
<P>
The 63-year old leader of the world's largest chip producer
made the remarks at a news conference on Intel's latest China
plans after his meetings with Chinese officials including
President Jiang Zemin.
</P>
<P>
The company will set up the Intel China Research Center in
Beijing within the first half of the year. The investment is
expected to be 50 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The operation of the center will be part of Intel's annual 2.8
billion dollar world-wide research and development efforts,
according to Grove.
</P>
<P>
The center will report to Intel headquarters located in Santa

<HEADLINE> Beijing University Host Nobel Prize Winners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Beijing University, one of China's
most prestigious universities, is currently witnessing
enthusiastic celebrations marking the centennial anniversary of
its establishment.
</P>
<P>
Nobel Prize winner Chen Ning Yang was delayed for half hour
this moring in a traffic jam while on his way to attend
celebration activities.
</P>
<P>
Professor Yang arrived in Beijing after a long journey from New
York and appeared before a group of admiring university students
today.
</P>
<P>
"I was familiar with the Beijing University (Beida) campus some
60 years ago," said the 76-year-old Yang. "I used to ice skate on
Weiming Lake in the winter."
</P>
<P>
"Alumni from around the world have witnessed the university's
great achievements, with young students of today indicating their
bright future," said Yang, who graduated from Southwest Associated
University consisting of Peking (Beijing), Tsinghua and Nankai
universities in the 1940s.
</P>
<P>
Professor Yang, who shared the Nobel Prize in Physics with his
colleague Trung Dao Lee in 1957, inspired the young listeners with

<HEADLINE> Ottawa to Halt Lake Water Export </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, May 5 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian government is
investigating legal means to halt an Ontario company's bid to
export fresh water from Lake Superior to Asia, reports said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Affairs Minister Lloyd Axworthy voiced his strong
opposition to the proposed water export, which has been approved
by Ontario provincial environment ministry.
</P>
<P>
"We are now examining various pieces of legislation ... to
determine if there is some form of prevention that can be
applied," Axworthy was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
"What we are looking at is the real question of the large-scale
export of fresh water, which we certainly have always taken a
strong stand against," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is a matter of some real concern, and we're looking at some
of the options that we have," the minister told the parliament on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Nova Group, a company based in the city of Sault Ste. Mario on
the eastern tip of the lake, has won a first-ever permit from the
Ontario provincial government to export water from Lake Superior
to Asia.
</P>
<P>
With the permit, the company hopes to take up to 600 million
liters of water a year for the next five years from the lake for
shipping abroad.
</P>
<P>
Though the amount is "reasonably small" compared to the normal
flow of water out of the lake, the action could set a precedent
and encourage companies from Canada and the United States to draw
on limited fresh water resources for profit, Axworthy said.
</P>
<P>
"If one entrepreneur decides to do it and get away with it,
then others will be encouraged to follow, then you have a serious
problem," he noted.
</P>
<P>
The provincial environment ministry granted the export permit
on the grounds that the company had demonstrated the project would
result in no significant environmental damage.
</P>
<P>
The permit has led to a U.S. government official saying that
Washington is concerned the exports could violate a 1909 treaty
which established joint Canada-U.S. management of the Great Lakes.
</P>
<P>
So far, Nova Group said it has not arranged any sales yet. The
permit will allow it conduct feasibility studies and attract
potential investors.
</P>
<P>
"There is a need for water in the Asia market," Nova president
John Febbraro said. Selling water there was "worth a shot".
</P>
<P>
The water from Lake Superior, the cleanest of the Great Lakes,
is believed to have a market in Asia because the region is often
plagued by water shortages, he added.

<HEADLINE> French FM Defends France's Role in Rwanda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 5 (Xinhua) -- French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine
Tuesday strongly defended the role played by France in Rwanda
before and during the 1994 genocide committed against the Tutsi
minority by the Hutu majority in that country.
</P>
<P>
During a hearing held by the special commission of the National
Assembly investigating the French role in Rwanda from 1990 to
1994, Vedrine said that France had worked with "tenacity" to
prevent the genocide from taking place.
</P>
<P>
"The French policy, rightly or wrongly, was based on the idea
that one should absolutely attain a political agreement (in
Rwanda)... But unfortunately, we only succeeded in delaying the
violences," he said.
</P>
<P>
When the genocide in Rwanda took place, Vedrine was the
secretary general of President Francois Mitterrand, who had a
semi-secretive presidential staff specialized in African affairs.
</P>
<P>
Vedrine admitted that France was trying to help the regime of
Rwandan President Juvenal Habyarimana to fend off attacks from the
Tutsi-led Rwandan Patriotic Front, which invaded from Uganda.
</P>
<P>
But at the same time, Paris was pressuring Habyarimana to
accept a sharing of power with the Tutsi minority, he said.
</P>
<P>
Habyarimana was killed on April 6, 1994, when the French
military helicopter carrying him and his Burundian counterpart,
Cyprien Ntaryamira, was shot down by a missile over Kigali, the
capital of Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
His death immediately triggered the massacres of Tutsis and
moderate Hutus by Hutu militias backed by troops.
</P>
<P>
Vedrine said that on the eve of his death, Habyarimana had
accepted French proposal that Hutu extremists be excluded from his
government.
</P>
<P>
The Hutu extremists were exasperated by the attitude of France,
he added.
</P>
<P>
Vedrine refused to speculate on who shot down the helicopter of
Habyarimana, saying that it could either be done by Hutu
extremists or the Rwandan Patriotic Front which he said was trying
to take over power from the Hutus.
</P>
<P>
He said that on the Soviet-made SA-16 missile which shot down
the helicopter, the registration numbers were incomplete so one
cannot say from where it came from.
</P>
<P>
As for the role played by the United States in central Africa
at that time, Vedrine said that Washington was supporting Uganda
in order to contain its neighbor Sudan, which the Americans
accused of supporting terrorism.

ISLAMABAD, May 5 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan Taliban militia claimed
Tuesday that they have captured 13 strategic posts in two of the
northern Afghan provinces.
</P>
<P>
Molvi Najibullah, a senior Taliban official based in Peshawar,

Monday.
</P>

The 13 strategic posts were located in the two northern Afghan
provinces of Takhar and Kundoz, he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 5 (Xinhua) -- December 18, 1998 will see the 20th
anniversary of the landmark Third Plenary Session of the 11th
Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC).
</P>
<P>
The CPC Central Committee issued a circular which was made
public today to list a series of activities to mark the
occasion.
</P>
<P>
The Third Plenum was held in Beijing between December 18 and 22.
</P>
<P>
The major topic of the plenum was to discuss how to shift the
party's focus of work to the development of socialist
modernization. It opened up a new period in China's reforms and
opening to the outside world.
</P>
<P>
The plenum criticized the erroneous policy of two "whatevers,"
or "resolutely upholding whatever policy decisions made by
Chairman Mao and unswervingly following whatever instructions
issued by the late leader."
</P>
<P>
It fully affirmed the necessity of completely and accurately
mastering the scientific system of Mao Zedong Thought, highly
appreciated the discussion on the argument that practice is the
sole criterion for verifying truth and reestablished the
ideological line of emancipating the mind and seeking truth from
facts.
</P>
<P>
The Third Plenum resolutely discarded the slogan of "taking
class struggle as the key link," which no longer suits socialist
society, rejected the erroneous theory of "continued revolution
under the dictatorship of proletariat" and made a strategic
decision on shifting the focus of work of the party and the
people's attention to socialist modernization.

economy, reform over-concentrated economic management system,
enhance economic cooperation with all other countries on the basis

situation of lingering on the way forward since the smashing of

It solved the problem of shifting the focus of the party's
work, the one which failed to be solved since 1957 and brought
order out of chaos.
</P>
<P>
The plenum terminated the situation of fluctuation led by the
erroneous policy of "two whatevers" put forward by the leader who
presided over the work of the CPC Central Committee at that time.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Records Fewer Prison Escapes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 5 (Xinhua) -- The number of escapes from South
African prisons had dropped from an average of 100 a month last year
to 40 a month at present, Correctional Services Minister Sipo Mzimela
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking during a parliamentary debate on his budget vote, Mzimela
said the drop in escapes followed the introduction of anti-corruption
measures and the installation of electric fences on prison perimeters,
South African Press Association reported.
</P>
<P>
He said he hoped that this signified the end of escapes in the not
too distant future.
</P>
<P>
Last year, 4,200 prisoners escaped from South Africa's prisons. The
escapes of some of the country's most wanted and dangerous criminals
sparked widespread public furore.
</P>
<P>
Later study showed the majority of the breaks could be attributed
to negligence of police officials. Other problems included
over-population of cells and poor facilities.

<P>
BUCHAREST, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Romania can assume all the
obligations incumbent on it as possible future member of the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD),
Romanian Prime Minister Radu Vasile told a press conference on
Tuesday held for the official launch of an OECD study on Romania.
</P>
<P>
Romanian Prime Minister hoped that the economic study on
Romania, the first in-depth analysis of the country by the
Organisation in line with its other studies on its memebr
countries, would show a certain priority for Romania.
</P>
<P>
Vasile said that Romania wanted to widen its relations with the
organisation with a view to becoming OECD member. "The admission
of Romania will strengthen the economic potential in Central
Europe, together with Hungary, the Czech Republic, Poland - all
three OECD members, and with Slovakia, another possible future
member," stressed the Prime Minister.
</P>
<P>
Romania tendered in March 1995 an official request to OECD to
be admitted as observer to three committees of the Organisation,
namely trade, commerce and sea transport.

<HEADLINE> No Preconditions for Peace Negotiations in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, May 5 (Xinhua) -- A U.N. envoy said here Tuesday that
there should be no preconditions for peace negotiations by either
side in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after a meeting with Cyprus President
Glafcos Clerides, U.N. Resident Representative in Cyprus Gustave
Feissel said that "I think that is one of the fundamental rules
of negotiations: that there should be no preconditions."
</P>
<P>
He said that his meeting with Clerides focused on the visit of
U.S. presidential emissary Richard Holbrooke and "what emerged by
all that."
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke wound up his three-day visit to Cyprus Monday, but he
failed in his attempt to resume the stalled intercommunal dialog
after intensive talks with the two communities' leaders on the
island.
</P>
<P>
Asked to comment on the results of Holbrooke's visit, Feissel
said that the U.S. envoy himself admitted that he was not able to
move things forward "so we are still basically where we were and
where we have been for some time."
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, this is not good. We have been in an impasse and
the political situation has been getting worse, more difficult
and of course it is very important that we find a way to move
forward, because this is the only way that we can reach a
settlement," the U.N. envoy said.
</P>
<P>
Feissel stressed that it is in the interest of the parties
involved in the Cyprus issue to find a settlement to this problem
without delay. Otherwise, he warned that there would be negative
developments for the parties and the whole region.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkish troops
invaded and took over the northern third of the island in the
wake of a failed pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. and other parties involved have been trying for
decades to reunite the divided island in a bizonal and bicommunal
federation through peace talks, but so far no tangible results
have been achieved.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 5 (Xinhua) -- French Minister of Industry, Finance and
Economy Dominique Strauss-Kahn Tuesday expressed reservation over
the proposal by the Communist Party to impose a new tax on
speculative capitals.
</P>
<P>
But he agreed that the movement of such capitals are capable of
"destabilizing entire economies" as they did in Southeast Asia
last year.
</P>
<P>
When answering a question from a Communist deputy at the
National Assembly on the possible imposition of tax on speculative
capitals, the minister said that an international cooperation is a
precondition for restricting the flow of speculative capitals,
which are becoming increasingly great in amount.
</P>
<P>
Finance ministers of the Group of Seven (G-7) most
industrialized nations agreed in Washington last month that
greater transparency and greater surveillance were necessary to
control the flow of speculative capitals.

<HEADLINE> African Telecom Show Symbol of Revival: Mubarak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Africa Telecom '98, the
largest gathering of telecommunication experts and equipment in
Africa, symbolizes a spirit of revival and re-awakening
throughout the continent, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
His message was read by Egyptian ambassador to South Africa at
a forum running parallel with the telecommunications exhibition
opened Monday in Johannesburg.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of the world's top telecommunication companies and
dozens of ministers from around the world attended the six-day
event.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak said in his message that African nations are
determined to rise to the challenge of modernization without
detracting from its people's heritage.
</P>
<P>
"We will spare no effort in order to equip our new generations
with the knowledge and tools necessary to meet the challenges
that will face them," he said.
</P>
<P>
Telecommunications is gaining an ever-growing importance in
people's new way of life, he said. "It is becoming one of the
main contributors to economic growth and a major tool for the
promotion of trade and investment."
</P>
<P>
Although African nations have make tangible progress in growth
and development in the past few years, they have fully realized
that much remains to be done to meet the people's increasing
needs and aspirations, Mubarak said.
</P>
<P>
The telecommunications show is a fitting occasion to crown the
achievements and to signal the beginning of a new era where
African nations will stand among nations of the world, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the challenges are beyond the means of any of the
countries in Africa individually, but well within the resources
of nations acting together.
</P>
<P>
New structures are being developed to try to pool resources
together to meet telecommunication demands which an individual
country can not meet with its national budget, he added.

CAIRO, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority
President Yasser Arafat is to brief his Egyptian counterpart Hosni
Mubarak Thursday on the results of the London talks.
</P>
<P>
Arafat will arrive in Cairo after stopping over in Morocco and
Algeria, Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here said intensive mediation by United States
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright between Arafat and Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in London on Monday and Tuesday
has failed to make a breakthrough in Israeli troop pullback from
the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has tried to persuade Netanyahu to accept its proposal
calling for Israeli withdrawal from 13.1 percent of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu, citing security reasons, has rejected the proposal,
saying that Israel will withdraw no more than 9 percent of the
West Bank. The Palestinians have reportedly agreed to accept the
U.S. proposal in principle.
</P>
<P>
"The situation remained unchanged: a Palestinian acceptance of
the American initiative and an Israeli rejection of it," Moussa
said.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the impact of the failure of the London talks, he
warned of escalation of tensions in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
"There is no doubt that the failure of the talks will not pass
without having an impact on the angry atmosphere in the area.
Maybe the Israeli side is aware (of it) but does not care," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian and Israeli negotiators will go on discussing the
issue of Israeli troop pullback from the West Bank.

HANOI, May 5 (Xinhua) -- General Secretary of the Communist
Party of Vietnam (CPV) Le Kha Phieu Tuesday said that Vietnam's
leadership does not think it is necessary to adjust the target of
national economic growth rate in 1998.
</P>
<P>
In a news conference with local and foreign press, Phieu said
in the first months of the year, Vietnam obtained an economic
growth rate of 8.7 percent despite a long drought in the country
and impacts of the financial and monetary crisis in the region.
</P>
<P>
The party chief admitted that Vietnam's economy is facing
challenges, namely the low efficiency of the national economy, low
competitiveness of commodities, and low quantity of processed
farm, forest, husbandry and aquatic products.
</P>
<P>
Phieu, however, pledged further improvement of the investment
environment in order to facilitate foreign investors' business
operations in the country.

UNITED NATIONS, May 5 (Xinhua) -- "I am concerned about the
deteriorating situation in Kosovo and the absence of progress in
negotiations between the parties concerned," UN Secretary-General
Kofi Annan reported to the Security Council of the United Nations
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In his report, the UN chief cites "alarming reports" about
incidents along the border with Albania, but notes that the United
Nations has only a humanitarian presence in the area, and
therefore is monitoring the situation through the Organization for
Security and cooperation in Europe (OSCE), the Contact Group and
the European Union.
</P>
<P>
Annexed to the UN chief's report is information received form
the OSCE and the European Union, as well as the Russian
Federation, which is a member of the Contact Group.
</P>
<P>
The European Union and the OSCE both report a tense situation
in kosovo, including the harassment of civilians at checkpoints.
The OSCE warns that the existing tension could "easily escalate
into a new clashes with unforeseen consequences" threatening "the
stability of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, the region and
Europe as a whole."
</P>
<P>
For its part, the Russian Federation says it is "disappointed
by the fact that Kosovo Albanian side has once again ignored
Belgrade's proposal to begin the dialogue."
</P>
<P>
According to the Russian Federation, "It is the leadership of
the kosovo Albanians who set forth preconditions, demanding the
presence of international mediators and a conduct of negotiations
solely with the representative of the President of the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia."
</P>
<P>
In the view of the Russian Federation, "there should be no
direct mediation in the process of the negotiations per se."

This will allow OLS to deliver food and other relief to war and
drought-affected population in Bahr Al Ghazal and other areas of
southern Sudan, so that a potentially disastrous famine can be
avoided.
</P>
<P>
This brings the total number of aircraft managed by OLS to five
C-130s and three Buffalos. With these aircraft and other modes of
transport, OLS will be able to deliver approximately 6,000 tons of
food assistance per month.
</P>
<P>
This will greatly assist OLS to meet the food needs of 380,000
people in both government and rebel-held areas of Bahr Al Ahazal,
and an additional 410,000 people facing severe hunger in other
parts of southern Sudan, such as the Bentiu area in Unity State
and parts of Equatoria.

<HEADLINE> Arab League: Lockerbie Victim Families Support </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 5 (Xinhua) -- The Cairo-based Arab League (AL) said
Tuesday the families of the British victims in Lockerbie air
bombing support the Arab stance on quickly ending the tangle over
the trial of two Libyan suspects.
</P>
<P>
AL Secretary General Esmat Abdul-Meguid said he got the message
of support in a letter from Jim Swire, spokesman for the British
families.
</P>
<P>
Also in the letter was the text of a message Swire sent to
British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook on the outcome of his recent
talks with both Abdul-Meguid and Libyan officials.
</P>
<P>
Following his meeting with the League's permanent delegates,
Abdul-Meguid said the families in their message to Cook expressed
their support of the Arab undertaking to resolve the long-standing
Libya-West crisis and called on London to follow suit.
</P>
<P>
U.N. sanctions were imposed on Libya in 1992 in response to
Tripoli's refusal to hand over the two Libyans charged with
bombing of the Pan-Am flight over Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988, in
which 270 people were killed.
</P>
<P>
Britain and the U.S. insist the two Libyans be tried in Britain
or the U.S., a stance rejected by Libya which said they had
already prejudged the two suspects even before trial.
</P>
<P>
The AL supports Libya in terms of reaching a compromise on
expediting a fair trial of the two Libyans in a neutral country.
</P>
<P>
The message Swire addressed to Cook included all the proposals
and ideas on settling the dispute along with the British families'
proposal, according to Egypt's Middle East News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Swire visited Tripoli in late April, carrying suggestions on
bringing the two Libyan suspects to trial before an international
judiciary body, comprising five judges, presided over by a
Scottish judge to be appointed by the British prime minister,
according to Scottish law.
</P>
<P>
The Libya-West showdown has been again put under the spotlight
following the International Court of Justice ruling in February,
saying it has the jurisdiction over the case.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain have watered down the ruling and insisted
that the Security council is the body concerned with the issue.
</P>
<P>
A committee which groups representatives of the victims'
families, after a meeting in London in April with Cook, vowed to
pursue pressures on the British government to accept Libya's
compromise solutions to defuse the crisis.

<HEADLINE> IPE Launches Proposal to Reduce CO2 Pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 5 (Xinhua) - The International Petroleum Exchange
(IPE) announced Tuesday a proposal to establish a traded market in
Carbon Dioxide (CO2) emissions in order to secure maximum
environmental benefits at minimum economic cost.
</P>
<P>
The proposal which calls for free markets to be allowed to
evolve, has been submitted to John Prescott, UK Deputy Prime
Minister and to the European Commission.
</P>
<P>
The world's first international treaty to combat climate change
was signed in December 1997, and one of the most important
principles to emerge was that of a market based solution to
pollution problems.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, John Prescott challenged the City of London
to develop a mechanism for trading emissions permits.
</P>
<P>
The IPE said it had positioned itself to take up this
challenge, as a business development team had already undertaken
initial research into the possibilities of emission permit
trading.
</P>
<P>
The IPE is regarded here as a strong supporter of a market
based approach to pollution control as opposed to a top down
regulatory approach such as a tax on emissions.
</P>
<P>
Lynton Jones, Chief Executive of the IPE said: "The UK has a
unique opportunity to lead the rest of the world in the
establishment of a market in CO2 emissions permits."
</P>
<P>
"Market based mechanisms, properly monitored and enforced, are
undoubtedly the most cost effective and flexible way of achieving
pollution reductions," he added.

<HEADLINE> Iran Rejects Argentina's Terrorist Charge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Iran Tuesday once again rejected
Argentina's accusation that Tehran was involved in the 1994 bomb
attack on a Jewish center in Buenos Aires, Iran's official news
agency IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Mahmoud Mohammadi dismissed
as "baseless" the recent charge raised by Argentine prosecutor
Eamon Mullen that the then Iranian cultural attache to Argentina
had been involved in the bomb attack which killed 88 people and
injured 159 others.
</P>
<P>
IRNA quoted him as saying that the Zionist (Israeli) circles in
Argentina attributed the bombing to Iran in an attempt to cover up
the opposition of the Argentine people to the influence of the
Zionists on their country.
</P>
<P>
Argentina had already charged four Argentine policemen with the
bombing and this indicated that terrorism is an internal
phenomenon in Argentina, he said, adding that attributing it to a
foreign country is a step to escape from the truth.
</P>
<P>
After the bombing, an Iranian national offered information to
the Argentine authorities claiming that some Iranian diplomats
were involved in the bombing. However, no enough evidence was
found to support the accusation during the past three years.

<HEADLINE> India Announces Growth in Exports to Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 5 (Xinhua) -- India's exports to Nigeria increased by
38.84 percent in 1997 compared to the previous year, the Indian High
Commission (embassay) to Nigeria said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
An embassay statement said that India's exports to the west African
country grew to 201.36 million U.S. dollars last year, from 146.47
million in 1996, the News Agency of Nigeria reported.
</P>
<P>
According to the statement, the entry of Indian parboiled rice into
the Nigerian market, against stiff competition from Thai rice,
contributed to the increase.
</P>
<P>
Other items which recorded a large increase in India's exports to
Nigeria during the period were transport equipment, machinery and
instruments, agro-chemicals, pharmaceuticals and fine chemicals,
manufactures of metals, and cosmetics and toiletries, the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
However, there was some decline in the export of cotton and
man-made yarn, fabrics, paints, enamels and varnishes due to a general
downturn in demand in the Nigerian market, it noted.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the trade surplus against India slightly declined as the
south Asian country's imports from Nigeria decreased from 1.54 billion
dollars in 1996 to 1.37 billion last year, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
India mainly imports from Nigeria crude oil, cashewnuts, artificial
resins, non-ferrous metals and wood products.
</P>
<P>
According to the statement, the two countries are finalizing a new
trade agreement followed by the meeting of a joint trade committee.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu said here Tuesday that the three-way peace talks in
London made some progress, but some problems remain unresolved.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu, who had three rounds of the heated talks with U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright over the past two days, told
a press conference: "There has been progress, even significant
progress in some of the areas."
</P>
<P>
But he also stressed: "We have not closed all the gaps and we
are working and going to be working in the next few days to see if
we can resolve some of the outstanding issues".
</P>
<P>
"The difficulty arises from a very simple point: we cannot
compromise on Israel's security," he added.
</P>
<P>
On the U.S. proposed peace talks in Washington next week,
Netanyahu noted that a further round of talks in Washington was a
possibility if there was progress in further discussions in London
this week between Israeli officials and U.S. negotiators.

<P>
LAGOS, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's Federal Environmental
Protection Agency (FEPA) Tuesday called for the enactment of a
law regulating the use of pesticides to safeguard the country's
environment and public health from the effects of pesticides.
</P>
<P>
Such a law was also expected to prevent the dumping of banned
and toxic pesticide formulations from other countries under the
guise of legal trade imports, said FEPA Director-General Raphael
Adewoye, quoted by the official News Agency of Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
As there are only a few agro-chemical formulating companies in
Nigeria, most of agro-chemical being used in the country are
imported, he noted.
</P>
<P>
On the part of FEPA, he said, the organization has put in
place a standing committee to assess various chemicals and
pesticides based on trade benefits derivable for their use, local
research findings, impact on the environment and public health
risks.
</P>
<P>
The committee has begun the registration program for
industrial chemicals, pesticides and ozone depleting substances.
</P>
<P>
According to him, an international convention on the control
and use of pesticides will soon be signed into law this year.
Nigeria is a signatory to the convention.

LUSAKA, May 5 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations High Commissioner
for Refugees (UNHCR) Tuesday called for the involvement of all
stake-holders in the proper management of food for refugees.
</P>
<P>
UNHCR representative in Zambia Oluseyi Bajulaiye said that the
commissioner experiences a number of problems concerning food
management.
</P>
<P>
Opening a four-day regional workshop on food management and
distribution for refugees, Bajulaiye said that people involved in
food distribution to refugees experience various problems such as
communication breakdown.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the need for dialog and the involvement of local
authorities and women in the distribution of food.
</P>
<P>
Refugees need to become self reliant so that they could
continue feeding themselves even when their rations are cut off,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Bajulaye called for joint efforts to help minimize the
problems of food management and improve the nutrition status of
the refugees.
</P>
<P>
He cited food shortages due to logistic problems like late
deliveries as some of the issues that need immediate attention.
</P>
<P>
The workshop is aimed at upgrading the skills of humanitarian
food distributors among asylum seekers and refugees.
</P>
<P>
UNHCR will soon carry out a nutrition survey in Maheba refugee
camp in Zambia's northwestern province.

<HEADLINE> IMF: Egypt's Economic Reform Remarkable Success </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 5 (Xinhua) -- The economic reform adopted by Egypt
since the early 1990s is a "remarkable success story," according
to a study conducted by the International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
In presenting the study, the first of its kind conducted by the
IMF on Egypt, Howard Handy, IMF deputy head of Middle East
Department, gave a high mark to Egypt's privatization program at a
news conference here Monday night.
</P>
<P>
He said the Egyptian government succeeded in promoting the
private sector's development and rolling back the "once pervasive
scope of state controls."
</P>
<P>
Egypt has one of the "most rapidly privatizing economies in the
world," ranking among the top four emerging markets in terms of
the pace of privatization, he said.
</P>
<P>
A mission of the IMF is visiting Egypt for talks with senior
officials on the steps taken so far in Egypt's structural
adjustment program.
</P>
<P>
The study said that the Egyptian macroeconomic policy has
"brought much reduced inflation leading to improved public
finances, a stable currency, and a strengthened banking system
together with a sound balance of payments position."
</P>
<P>
From 1991 up till now, Egypt's economic growth has increased
from 2 percent to over 5 percent, inflation decreased from 20
percent to under 4 percent and foreign currency reserves topped 20
billion U.S. dollars. The budget deficit is below one percent of
gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
However, the study said that a sustained reinvigoration of
Egypt's structural reform efforts is essential to further
investment and growth in the context of rapid regional economic
liberalization.
</P>
<P>
Competition in the global market requires more trade
liberalization, privatization and public sector reform, it
recommended.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Public Sector Minister Atef Obeid said recently that
Egypt will not have a new stand-by agreement with the IMF when the
current one expires in August, saying that Egypt no longer needs
IMF loans as its reform and privatization program is bearing fruit.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 84 public companies have been offered for sale since
1993 and more will be privatized at a rate of 10 companies a
quarter until the government's target of 314 is reached.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Peace Efforts Not in Deadlock: Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus said on Tuesday that the
efforts to find a solution to the protracted Cyprus problem is in
lack of progress, rather than a complete deadlock.
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot government holds firm position that it is ready to
accept any initiative promoting reunification of Cyprus under a
bizonal and bicommunal formula sponsored by the United Nations,
government spokesman Christos Stylianides said at a press briefing.
</P>
<P>
Stylianides called on the international community to put
pressure on Turkey and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash in a
bid to move forward the Cyprus peace process.
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope that the international community will
understand that Denktash and Turkey bear exclusive responsibility
for the lack of progress.
</P>
<P>
Denktash insists that he will not return to peace talks with
Cypriot President and Greek Cypriot leader Glafcos Clerides unless
his entity in northern Cyprus is internationally recognized.
</P>
<P>
Stylianides' comments came one day after United States envoy
for Cyprus Richard Holbrooke wrapped up a three-day visit to
Cyprus, during which he tried in vain to help revive the
intercommunal negotiations.
</P>
<P>
"The government is studying the situation as this has
developed," said the Cypriot spokesman.
</P>
<P>
He said the Cypriot National Council will meet on Friday to
discuss the latest developments on the island.
</P>
<P>
"The Council will define the positions of the Cypriot political
leadership on the basis of current developments," he added.
</P>
<P>
The council is the top advisory body to the Cypriot president
for the handling of the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkey landed its
troops and took over the northern third of the Mediterranean
island after a failed coup by Greek Cypriots seeking union with
Greece.

<HEADLINE> UNITA Accused of Preserving Force </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Angolan Defense Minister Pedro
Sebastiao Tuesday accused the National Union for Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA) of preserving armed forces beyond
the control of the U.N. observer mission.
</P>
<P>
Sebastiao said when massing its forces at the beginning of the
peace process, UNITA sent thousands of women and child soldiers
to the assembly points while hiding up large amounts of its crack
troops.
</P>
<P>
The defense minister made the remarks Tuesday while opening
the third conference of Angola's military attaches.
</P>
<P>
It should be reconsidered whether UNITA is sincere in its
efforts in the peace process and in the implementation of the
1994 Lusaka Peace Protocol, particularly in the re-establishment
of national administration in the areas formerly controlled by it
and in the realization of free movement of personnel and goods
across the country, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
The progress in the accomplishment of the above two tasks is
slow because of UNITA's attitude, Sebastiao noted.
</P>
<P>
Referring to external military relations, Sebastiao said
Angola's armed intervention in former Zaire and the Republic of
Congo had prompted an early resolution of the conflicts, creating
favorable conditions for realizing peace in Angola as both
countries had provided assistance to UNITA.
</P>
<P>
On the mission of the military attaches, Sebastiao said his
Ministry will arrange courses to train them so that they can know
more about the military and political situation at home and the
policy of national defense in order to defend the interests of
their nation.

<HEADLINE> French Gov't Presents Anti-Exclusion Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 5 (Xinhua) -- The Socialist government of France
Tuesday presented to the National Assembly a draft law on fighting
social exclusion, symbolized by the six million people, or one
tenths of the French population, living on welfare.
</P>
<P>
Warning that the idea of "Republic for all" is in endanger,
the Minister of Employment and Solidarity Martine Aubry told the
parliament that social exclusion is the "collective failure" of
France and appealed for a mobilization of all for a "social
pact."
</P>
<P>
The law, while emphasizing on helping the unemployed,
especially the young, to look for jobs, also promises a one
billion franc (166 million U.S. dollar) emergency fund for
families living under poverty line, and help the poor have medical
cares.
</P>
<P>
Nearly three fourths of the deputies in the National Assembly
were absent when Aubry presented the law.
</P>
<P>
The Gaullist Rally for the Republic said that it would vote
against the law, while the Communist Party proposed some new
clauses including a strict control on lay-off of workers by
enterprises.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Reaffirms Commitment to Mideast Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus Foreign Minister Ioannis
Kasoulides Tuesday reaffirmed his government's commitment to the
Mideast peace process and its readiness to contribute actively
to its successful outcome.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a four-day conference of the "Young Leaders
Network," sponsored by the Peres Center for Peace in Israel,
Kasoulides said that Cyprus has recognized the urgent necessity of
taking practical steps to set up a special program of economic and
technical assistance to the Palestinian people.
</P>
<P>
Around 60 youth leaders from Egypt, Jordan, the Palestinian
territories and Israel are attending the conference, which opened
Sunday in Paphos, western coastal town on the island. Former
Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres also attended the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The Peres Center for Peace was founded in Israel last year
and its mission is to advance Arab-Israeli cooperation by creating
a wide-range of projects in the fields of economics, education and
social development.
</P>
<P>
Kasoulides described Peres as "one of the great statesmen of
our times with rare political courage and unwavering dedication to
the peace process... who shaped the history of Israel and the
future of the Middle East."
</P>
<P>
"Peres was also one of the first leaders in the Middle East,
who equally recognized that the search for peace and stability in
our region does not end with a comprehensive settlement of the
Middle East problem, and with the solution of the Cyprus problem
as well," he added.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that a united Cyprus would "benefit all the
people of Cyprus and peace and stability in our volatile region,"
adding that it would also affect positively the course of the
peoples and the nations in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkish troops
invaded and took over the northern third of the island in the wake
of a pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
Kasoulides noted that offering the advanced technical
infrastructure and skilled human resources, Cyprus is in a unique
position to become a meeting point for the peoples and cultures
and a bridge for cooperation among the nations of the region.

<HEADLINE> London Peace Talks Ended with No Breakthrough </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 5 (Xinhua) -- The two-day Middle East peace talks
ended in London Tuesday afternoon with some progress but no
breakthrough in revitalizing the deadlocked Middle East peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Over the past two days, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright held several rounds of talks with both Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian President Yasser
Arafat in an effort to bridge the "significant gaps" between the
Israelis and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Although the London talks, started early Monday, was forced
into a second day of heated argument, the Americans failed to
create dramatic miracle in bringing Netanyahu and Arafat to the
same table due to differences over a crucial new American peace
initiative under which Israel will have to cede another 13 percent
of West Bank.
</P>
<P>
With no breakthrough in near sight, U.S. President Bill Clinton
invited Israeli and Palestinian leaders to Washington next Monday
for another rounds of peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Arafat, who has accepted the U.S. invitation for another
meeting, told reporters: "I can not say the London talks failed. I
have heard from Madame Albright that there was some progress and
time is needed."
</P>
<P>
"It is true that we still face obstacles from the Israeli side.
I hope as soon as possible to see this progress in reality,"
Arafat said.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu, whose government under immense pressure to accept
the new U.S. proposal, painted a positive picture of the London
talks by saying: "there has been progress, even significant
progress in some areas."
</P>
<P>
But he also admitted: "We have not closed all the gaps and we
are working and going to be working in the next few days to see if
we can resolve some of the outstanding issues."
</P>
<P>
On the Clinton proposed Washington meeting, Netanyahu noted
that a further round of talks was a possibility if there was
progress in further discussions in London between Israeli and
American negotiators.
</P>
<P>
Albright, who chaired the two-day London talks, urged both
sides, especially the Israelis, to make efforts in bringing the
Middle East peace talks back on track.
</P>
<P>
"We have a strategic opportunity to put the (Middle East) peace
process back on track and we can not afford to lose it," she said,
adding "If the issues are resolved, President Clinton is prepared
to invite the parties to launch accelerated final status
negotiations."
</P>
<P>
The Middle East peace process was plunged into a stalemate for
more than a year due to Israel's staunchly maintained Jewish
settlement construction projects in defiance of the opposition by
the Palestinians.

<HEADLINE> N. Nigerian State Decries Rampant Blood Hawking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Cases of blood hawking have gone
rampant within the vicinity of government hospitals in northern
Nigeria's Kano State.
</P>
<P>
State Commissioner of Health Adamu Nuhu confirmed that scores
of family men litter around the hospitals ready to exchange a
pint of blood for 1,500 Naira (about 20 U.S. Dollars) in order to
feed their families, the News Agency of Nigeria reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"It is a fallout of the present socio-economic circumstance
that compels people to indulge in such practices," he said.
</P>
<P>
Under such situation, Nuhu said his ministry has improved its
blood screening methods to avoid transfusing of blood carrying
HIV virus and other communicable diseases.
</P>
<P>
He also said that efforts are being made to stem the rampant
cases of blood hawking in the hospital.
</P>
<P>
On the scourge of HIV patients in the state, the commissioner
said more than 1,000 cases were recorded in the state in 1997,
which were far above the 1996 record.
</P>
<P>
However, Nuhu said the rise in the number of cases was largely
due to the presence of more screening centers across the state.

<HEADLINE> Albright Briefs Hussein on London Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, May 5 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright made a phone call to King Hussein of Jordan Tuesday,
saying the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks in London have achieved
"some progress."
</P>
<P>
She expressed the intention to "resume the talks in Washington"
in a short time, Jordan's official news agency quoted Albright as
telling the king during the call.
</P>
<P>
Albright has held rounds of separate meetings with Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
in London since Monday over the further Israeli withdrawal from
the West Bank and other issues. The talks did not have a
breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
The planned Washington meeting between the Palestinians and the
Israelis is expected to "lead to initiate the final status
negotiations" between the two sides, she said.
</P>
<P>
For the upcoming talk, the U.S. will insist on its proposal
over the Israeli pullback, Albright added.
</P>
<P>
In the proposal, the U.S. asks Israel to evacuate from 13.1
percent of occupied Palestinian land. Arafat accepted the
proposal but Netanyahu rejected it.
</P>
<P>
During Tuesday's phone call, Albright also briefed the king on
other aspects of her meetings with the two leaders.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli negotiations have been deadlocked for a
year due to the Jewish settlement expansion in Arab East Jerusalem
and the delayed Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Senate Urged to Approve Nuclear Accords </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Sandy Berger, President Bill
Clinton's national security adviser, urged the Senate Tuesday to
ratify a package agreements to ban nuclear testing and limit
weapons and missile defense systems.
</P>
<P>
"The future of arms control is now," Berger told the annual
meeting of Business Executives for National Security in
Washington. "We must not let this extraordinary opportunity slip
away."
</P>
<P>
Berger leaves for Moscow on Wednesday to prepare for a meeting
next week between Clinton and Russian President Boris Yeltsin in
Birmingham, Britain, where the Group of Seven countries plus
Russia will hold a summit.
</P>
<P>
He indicated that the administration's goal is to see approval
of the pacts by year's end, including the Comprehensive Test Ban
Treaty, an updated Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Defense Treaty.
</P>
<P>
Senate leaders, particularly Foreign Relations Committee
Chairman Jesse Helms have been withholding consideration of the
treaties until after Russian lawmakers ratify START II.
</P>
<P>
In January, Helms wrote Clinton that the test ban treaty,
signed by 149 nations had no chance of entering into force for at
least a decade.
</P>
<P>
"The Senate needs to do what the president asked in his State
of the Union address _ provide its advice and consent for the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty this year," Berger said.
</P>
<P>
Berger added that both the Senate and the Russian parliament of
Duma must also go forward on strategic arms control.
</P>
<P>
The Russia Duma, led by Yeltsin opponents, hasn't approved
START II, partly because some Moscow leaders want assurances the
United States will comply with the antimissile defense treaty,
according to Berger.
</P>
<P>
Since Yeltsin installed a new reform government last month, the
Clinton administration said there's a better chance the stalled
START II will go forward.
</P>
<P>
"In a hopeful sign, we also see more support in the Duma,
reflecting a growing recognition that START II is in Russia's
interest as well as our own," Berger said.

<HEADLINE> Anna Encouraged by ICTR Progress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 5 (Xinhua) -- U. N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan said Tuesday that he was encouraged by the progress made by
the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) in Arusha
while starting a two-day visit to Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
"In the past six months the new officials of the Tribunal have
effected major improvements in their operations and are moving
ahead to fulfill its objectives," Annan told the U.N. staff in the
Tribunal which is seated inside the Arusha International
Conference Center (AICC) complex in northern Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Annan's remarks were apparently to clear the air over mounting
criticism on the inefficiency of the ICTR in executing cases,
according to a report reaching here.
</P>
<P>
The Tribunal opened its first trial only in January last year,
more than two years after its establishment in November, 1994
under a resolution by the U.N. Security Council. But so far only
two cases are approaching its final stage.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Jean Kambanda, former prime minister of Rwanda,
pleaded guilty to all six charges of genocide while the first
accused, Paul Akayesu, is awaiting for judgement expected to be
delivered before end of next month.
</P>
<P>
"I'm greatly encouraged after holding talks today with the
ICTR President, Mr Laity Kama, and the Registrar, Dr. Agwu
Okali," the U.N. chief told reporters.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that the U.N. would construct the third
courtroom for the Tribunal at the AICC to speed up hearing of the
cases, urging the staff to continue to show their commitment in
seeking justice.
</P>
<P>
The Tribunal staff complain that poor coordination among
judges, registrars and prosecutors, lack of facilities for more
trials to be lodged at the same time, as well as aloofness of
some countries involved are what should be blamed most for the
delay.
</P>
<P>
A total of 35 suspects have been indicted by the Tribunal, but
up till now only 23 have been detained in a prison on the
outskirts of Arusha awaiting trial while the other 12 are still
at large with one being set free by the U.S. authorities last
December citing no hard evidence.
</P>
<P>
Among the detainees are 22 Rwandan Hutus including a woman,
and a Belgian journalist who is accused of making broadcasts
inciting violence and hatred against Tutsis in the tiny central
African country.
</P>
<P>
The massacre erupted in April 1994 soon after President
Juvenal Habyarimana, a Hutu, died when his plane was shot down
over capital Kigali. Over 500,000 people, mostly Tutsis and
moderate Hutus, were reportedly killed in the three-month
slaughter.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, obstacles still remain in the transfer of the
accused from countries concerned while most witnesses could not
be able to offer useful evidence at the courts, the U.N.
officials said.
</P>
<P>
Annan, who arrived from Nairobi, Kenya, toured the ICTR
premises and attended a court session before departing for a
sightseeing of the well-known Ngorongoro Crater National Park and
the descend Crater accompanied by his wife Nane Annan.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief is expected to arrive in Dar es Salaam on
Wednesday to meet with Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa and
other senior officials as well as the U.N. staff before he leaves
for Rwanda and Burundi. Tanzania is the fifth leg of his
eight-country African tour. He had visited Ethiopia, Eritrea,
D'jibouti and Kenya before coming to Arusha.

LAGOS, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Demobilized soldiers in Liberia
besieged the Defense Ministry at the weekend, demanding for

Gun shoots were fired during the demonstration, but no

The retired soldiers, who were disarmed and demobilized at the
end of the country's seven-year-old bloody civil war, were angry
for they did not get what they thought they should have got.

Meanwhile, citizens in the capital Monrovia are sympathized
with the retired soldiers as underpayment is not only the problem
with the retired soldiers, but also one with the civil service,
the report said.

Troops of the west African peace keeping force ECOMOG have
sealed off that area, it said, without indicating whether or not
the crisis has been solved by now.

ATHENS, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Greece Tuesday voiced its willingness

<HEADLINE> Peres Supports Creation of Palestinian State </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Former Israeli Prime Minister Shimon
Peres Tuesday expressed his support for the creation of a
Palestinian state, next to the existing Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the conference of the "Young Leaders Network,"
which opened Sunday in Paphos, western coastal town in Cyprus,
Peres pointed out that a bi-national state would be an almost
unattainable alternative.
</P>
<P>
"I feel that without a Palestinian state, we (Israel) can't
remain a Jewish state," he said.
</P>
<P>
Peres also stressed the need for the economic development of
the Palestinians, noting that if great economic differences
remain, then the problem will turn from a political to an
economic one.
</P>
<P>
"We need two states but one economy," he said, adding that
what is needed as far as the Israeli-Palestinian problem is
concerned is "political separateness" and "economic integration."
</P>
<P>
Peres also stressed that in a changing world the Middle East
should also change otherwise it would run the danger of being
left behind.
</P>
<P>
He urged young generation not to follow the footsteps of their
predecessors, "not because their fathers were worse than the
children or their parents but because the world has changed."
</P>
<P>
Peres said "there is no longer an objective need for war."
"Every country and every people can reach a new height of
economic development and a new degree of freedom and different
relations can develop among nations," he added.
</P>
<P>
Around 60 young people from Egypt, Jordan, the Palestinian
territories and Israel are attending the conference organized by
the Peres Center for Peace.
</P>
<P>
The center was founded last year in Israel and its mission is
to advance Arab-Israeli cooperation by creating a wide-range of
projects in the fields of economics, education and social
development.

<HEADLINE> Hamas Ready to Contain Disputes With PNA: Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Visiting leader of the Palestinian
radical movement Hamas Sheikh Ahmed Yassin expressed readiness on
Tuesday to contain disputes with the Palestinian National
Authority (PNA).
</P>
<P>
"We are one people, our objective is one and the same, our
enemy is one, and we can not possibly engage in hostilities with
our brothers unless we have lost our senses, and (we) are ready to
contain any differences," Yassin told a news conference held here.
</P>
<P>
He said the ties between Hamas, or Islamic Resistance Movement,
and the PNA are based on fraternity and love.
</P>
<P>
Yassin termed the London talks as "waste of time" and "another
crafty deception" of the Jews and the west.
</P>
<P>
On Monday and Tuesday, United States Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright held separate talks with PNA President Yasser
Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in London in
a bid to bridge the gap between the two sides over Israeli troop
pullback from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
But Albright failed to persuade Netanyahu to accept a U.S.
proposal calling for Israeli withdrawal from 13.1 percent of the
West Bank. The PNA has agreed to accept the proposal in principle.
</P>
<P>
Yassin called on Arafat to reconsider and avert the path he has
been pursuing and agree to Hamas movement in the best interests of
the Palestinian cause and the Palestinian people.
</P>
<P>
On the murder of Mohi Sherif, Yassin voiced absolute confidence
that Israelis killed the Hamas chief bombmaker, whether directly
or indirectly, and would have to bear the consequences.
</P>
<P>
Hamas will not give up its right or forsake the revenge, he
said, adding that it will respond at appropriate time.
</P>
<P>
Regarding Hamas cooperation with Islamic organizations in the
Islamic world, Yassin said Hamas will cooperate with whoever helps
it in its cause.
</P>
<P>
He said his visits to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and other
Arab states are aimed at contacting with the leaders of the
countries, briefing them on the latest developments of the
Palestinian problem and exchanging views.
</P>
<P>
The tour is primarily part of the efforts to serve the
Palestinian cause and promote PNA's interests rather than breach
them.
</P>
<P>
Yassin arrived here on Monday after wrapping up a visit to
Iran, before which he has traveled to Egypt, Saudi Arabia and
Qatar.

JERUSALEM -- Israeli Manufactures Association Vice President
Doron Tamir said early this week that 1998 would be "a lost year"
for Israel from the economic perspective.
</P>
<P>
Tamir said that "1999 may also be lost unless there is a

leaders stop talking and start doing."
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- The Israeli government is making efforsts to join
the European Union (EU)'s fifth research and development program,
which will start in 1999.
</P>

The cost of the four-year program to Israel, an associate
member of the EU, is some 150 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- Israeli Elbit Systems company has won a contract

NICOSIA, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Minister of Science Michael
Eitan has said that his country will push for close cooperation
with Cyprus in many fields, especially high technology, the Cyprus
News Agency reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus could serve as a center for Israeli firms, and
partnership between the two countries can be established to use
the potential of the island's manpower, Eitan said in an interview
with the news agency on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Eitan paid a one-day visit on Monday to the Mediterranean
island, during which he met with Cypriot Commerce, Industry and
Tourism Minister Nicos Rolandis to discuss bilateral cooperation
in the field of high technology.
</P>
<P>
The two officials agreed to exchange visits to promote
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Eitan said the island's growing offshore industry is an
additional advantage to encourage Israelis to invest in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
"Israel needs to expand and Cyprus is offered as a possible
venue," Eitan added.
</P>
<P>
"A basic precondition for increased cooperation is to involve
the private sector," he said, adding that the public sector should
contribute to establishing the right environment.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Seeks COMESA Membership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Egypt, a north African country, is
possibly to be admitted into the Common Market for Eastern and
Southern Africa (COMESA) next month, a local source told Xinhua
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
An Egyptian government delegation is in Lusaka to discuss
Cairo's application for the membership of COMESA with Erastus
Mwencha, acting secretary general of COMESA with its headquarters
based in Lusaka.
</P>
<P>
A COMESA summit to be held in Kinshasa next month is expected
to admit Egypt into the 20-member grouping, said the source.
</P>
<P>
In a report released here Tuesday, COMESA secretariat said
Egypt's participation will strengthen regional integration in a
larger area.
</P>
<P>
The report said Egypt will provide strength to the region not
only through its productivity but also through its consumptive
capacity.
</P>
<P>
With a population of 63 million, Egypt will provide a big
market for some of the exports of the current COMESA member
states, it said.
</P>
<P>
The total trade of COMESA member countries was estimated to be
30 billion U.S. Dollars in 1994 while Egypt's total trade in the
same year was estimated to be 15 billion Dollars, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
Once admitted into COMESA, the north African country is likely
to benefit from the huge hydro-electric power potential of the
Democratic Republic of Congo, also a COMESA member, according to
the report.
</P>
<P>
Plans are underway to supply Egypt with electricity from
Congo's Equatoria Province through another COMESA member, Sudan.
</P>
<P>
Congo's hydro-power potential is so vast that from Egypt the
power could be further extended to the Middle East countries and
Turkey, according to a COMESA official.

<HEADLINE> Chiluba Appeals for Donor Support </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick Chiluba
appealed to foreign donors Tuesday to continue supporting his
country's economy.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba stressed that any future success of his country
depends on western aid. He also reiterated that his government's
far-reaching economic reforms are irreversible.
</P>
<P>
These remarks were made ahead of Zambia's aid consultative
meeting with the Paris club members billed for next week in
Paris. Zambia's 35 percent of its 1998 financial budget is
supposed to rely on western aid, according to a Reuters report.
</P>
<P>
However, the western donors froze their aid to Zambia
following the country's foiled military coup last October and
subsequent detentions of oppositions leaders including former
President Kenneth Kaunda.
</P>
<P>
They also set a precondition for aid support that the aid will
not be released until Zambia's state-owned copper mines, which
usually covered more than 90 percent of the country's total
foreign exchange earnings, are privatized.
</P>
<P>
Zambia has achieved macro-economic stability after years of
neglect and mismanagement, Chiluba said, warning that the donors'
failure to provide further aid to his country will jeopardize
such gains.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, Zambia's gross domestic product registered 3.5
percent growth and its inflation rate fell down to 18.6 percent
from 35 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
As for the country's privatization progress, Chiluba, who
carried out a western-style free market economy instead of
Kaunda's command economy after coming to power in 1991, said his
country's selling off of state-run enterprises is progressing as
planned with more than 130 firms sold or liquidated.
</P>
<P>
"We have implemented every rule in the game of economics,"
said Chiluba, adding, "We have done what most countries have so
far failed to achieve and surely our efforts deserve support and
not repudiation."
</P>
<P>
Western donors will meet in Paris on May 12 and 13 to review
Zambia's economic performance and assess its request for further
aid of about 165 million U.S. Dollars in project support.

<HEADLINE> Annan Encouraged by ICTR Progress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 5 (Xinhua) -- U. N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan said Tuesday that he was encouraged by the progress made by
the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) in Arusha
while starting a two-day visit to Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
"In the past six months the new officials of the Tribunal have
effected major improvements in their operations and are moving
ahead to fulfill its objectives," Annan told the U.N. staff in the
Tribunal which is seated inside the Arusha International
Conference Center (AICC) complex in northern Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Annan's remarks were apparently to clear the air over mounting
criticism on the inefficiency of the ICTR in executing cases,
according to a report reaching here.
</P>
<P>
The Tribunal opened its first trial only in January last year,
more than two years after its establishment in November, 1994
under a resolution by the U.N. Security Council. But so far only
two cases are approaching its final stage.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Jean Kambanda, former prime minister of Rwanda,
pleaded guilty to all six charges of genocide while the first
accused, Paul Akayesu, is awaiting for judgement expected to be
delivered before end of next month.
</P>
<P>
"I'm greatly encouraged after holding talks today with the
ICTR President, Mr Laity Kama, and the Registrar, Dr. Agwu
Okali," the U.N. chief told reporters.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that the U.N. would construct the third
courtroom for the Tribunal at the AICC to speed up hearing of the
cases, urging the staff to continue to show their commitment in
seeking justice.
</P>
<P>
The Tribunal staff complain that poor coordination among
judges, registrars and prosecutors, lack of facilities for more
trials to be lodged at the same time, as well as aloofness of
some countries involved are what should be blamed most for the
delay.
</P>
<P>
A total of 35 suspects have been indicted by the Tribunal, but
up till now only 23 have been detained in a prison on the
outskirts of Arusha awaiting trial while the other 12 are still
at large with one being set free by the U.S. authorities last
December citing no hard evidence.
</P>
<P>
Among the detainees are 22 Rwandan Hutus including a woman,
and a Belgian journalist who is accused of making broadcasts
inciting violence and hatred against Tutsis in the tiny central
African country.
</P>
<P>
The massacre erupted in April 1994 soon after President
Juvenal Habyarimana, a Hutu, died when his plane was shot down
over capital Kigali. Over 500,000 people, mostly Tutsis and
moderate Hutus, were reportedly killed in the three-month
slaughter.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, obstacles still remain in the transfer of the
accused from countries concerned while most witnesses could not
be able to offer useful evidence at the courts, the U.N.
officials said.
</P>
<P>
Annan, who arrived from Nairobi, Kenya, toured the ICTR
premises and attended a court session before departing for a
sightseeing of the well-known Ngorongoro Crater National Park and
the descend Crater accompanied by his wife Nane Annan.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief is expected to arrive in Dar es Salaam on
Wednesday to meet with Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa and
other senior officials as well as the U.N. staff before he leaves
for Rwanda and Burundi. Tanzania is the fifth leg of his
eight-country African tour. He had visited Ethiopia, Eritrea,
D'jibouti and Kenya before coming to Arusha.

<HEADLINE> London Peace Talks End with No Breakthrough </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 5 (Xinhua) -- The two-day Middle East peace talks
ended in London Tuesday afternoon with some progress but no
breakthrough in revitalizing the deadlocked Middle East peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Over the past two days, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright held several rounds of talks with both Israeli Prime
Minister Benjami Netanyahu and Palestinian President Yasser Arafat
in an effort to bridge the "significant gaps" between the Israelis
and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Although the London talks, started early Monday, were forced
into second day of heated argument, the Americans failed to create
dramatic miracle in bringing Netanyahu and Arafat to the same
table due to differences over a crucial new American peace
initiative under which Israel will have to cede another 13 percent
of West Bank.
</P>
<P>
With no breakthrough in near sight, U.S. President Bill Clinton
invited Israeli and Palestinian leaders to Washington next Monday
for another rounds of peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Arafat, who has accepted the U.S. invitation for another
meeting, said, "It is true that we still face obstacles from the
Israeli side. I hope as soon as possible to see this progress in
reality."
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu, whose government is under immense pressure to accept
the new U.S. proposal, painted a positive picture of the London
talks by saying: "there has been progress, even significant
progress in some areas."
</P>
<P>
But he also admitted: "We have not closed all the gaps and we
are working and going to be working in the next few days to see if
we can resolve some of the outstanding issues."
</P>
<P>
On the Clinton proposed Washington meeting, Netanyahu noted
that a further round of talks was a possibility if there was
progress in further discussions in London between Israeli and
American negotiators.
</P>
<P>
Albright, who chaired the two-day London talks, urged both
sides, especially the Israelis, to make efforts in bringing the
Middle East peace talks back on track.
</P>
<P>
"We have a strategic opportunity to put the (Middle East) peace
process back on track and we can not afford to lose it," she said,
adding, "If the issues are resolved, President Clinton is prepared
to invite the parties to launch accelerated final status
negotiations."
</P>
<P>
The Middle East peace process was plunged into a stalemate for
more than a year due to Israel's staunchly maintained Jewish
settlement construction projects in defiance of the opposition by
the Palestinians.

<HEADLINE> 3 Unionist Parties Unite Against N.Irish Peace Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Politicians from three pro-British
parties in Northern Ireland joined forces Tuesday to oppose the
historic peace agreement reached last month.
</P>
<P>
"We now realize they can give no guarantee that if you vote
`yes' in this referendum, you will have peace," William Thompson,
a member of the largest Ulster Unionist Party, told a news
conference.
</P>
<P>
He said the pro-Irish guerrilla groups were continuing their
sectarian shootings, attempted bombings and explosions even after
the peace deal was struck on April 10.
</P>
<P>
"We see the number of people who have been murdered, we see the
bombs which have gone off, and it's clear that this document will
not bring peace," Reuters quoted Thompson as saying in Belfast.
</P>
<P>
Half of the party's 10 parliament members have expressed
opposition to the deal, though the party has managed to gain 72
percent support for the accord.
</P>
<P>
Other opponents include the small Democratic Unionist Party led
by Ian Paisley and the U.K. Unionist Party led by Robert
McCartney.
</P>
<P>
They fear the deal's provisions for new institutions uniting
Northern Ireland with the republic south of the Irish border mark
the beginning of the end of Northern Ireland's union with Britain.
</P>
<P>
The province's 60 percent Protestant majority is split over the
deal, though opinion polls show majority support for the deal on
both sides of the island, where concurrent referendum votes will
be held on May 22.

<HEADLINE> Whitewater Grand Jury Wraps Up Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 5 (Xinhua) -- The second Whitewater grand jury
in Little Rock, Arkansas, to investigate financial business in the
Arkansas background of U.S. President Bill Clinton and his wife
Hillary finished its probe Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The grand jury has issued only one indictment, to Susan
McDougal, during its two-year term.
</P>
<P>
Although the 23 members of the grand jury reportedly examined
the business of the Clintons' land deals, they only indicted
McDougal for refusing to answer questions during the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
Charles Bakaly, the spokesman for independent counsel Kenneth
Starr, told reporters Monday that information gathered by the
Little Rock grand jury could be passed on to the grand jury based
in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
The first grand jury indicted James McDougal, his ex-wife,
Susan, and former Arkansas Governor Jim Guy Tucker, on fraud
charges in 1995 and former deputy Attorney General Webster Hubbell
on mail fraud and tax evasion in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The McDougals and Tucker were convicted in 1996 and Hubbell
pleaded guilty to his charges 1994, agreeing to cooperate with
independent Kenneth Starr. He served most of a 21-month sentence,
but is now facing new charges.
</P>
<P>
Hubbell, his wife, a tax lawyer and an accountant were charged
last Thursday in a 10-count indictment with tax violations and
mail fraud.

<HEADLINE> European Shares Down on Interest Rate Rise Concern </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Major stock markets in Europe
suspended Monday's rally and ended lower Tuesday, dragged down by
a weaker Wall Street, fresh concern over interest rate hike and
the European Union summit compromise on the leadership of the
European Central Bank.
</P>
<P>
Britain's FTSE 100 index on the London market, which did not
open Monday for a bank holiday, fell below the 6,000-point level
to end at 5,986.5, down 23.8 points or 0.40 percent.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said that leading shares were dragged into the red amid
concerns about euro interest rate prospects.
</P>
<P>
Profit-taking across the continent was sparked by an unexpected
0.5 percent rate rise in Denmark and fears that Germany would
follow suit. Meanwhile, opening weakness on Wall Street helped
compound the market's dull tone.
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, German shares closed 82.63 points or 1.55 percent
down on the DAX-30 index after a very weak dollar prompted further
consolidation.
</P>
<P>
One analyst said that the market were surprised by the weakness
of the dollar, which made many investors cautious.
</P>
<P>
On the Paris bourse, French shares retreated as investors took
profits amid growing concerns about European interest rates, with
the CAC-40 index closing down 29.34 points or 0.74 percent at
3,944.91.

<HEADLINE> Greek Police Seize Large Quantity of Contraband </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Greek police said Tuesday that they
have seized a large quantity of contraband cigarettes from a
warehouse near the village of Drymos in northern Greece.
</P>
<P>
The contraband cigarettes, estimated at over five million
packets, were discovered on Sunday afternoon when police raided
the warehouse for a stolen car.
</P>
<P>
Police said that they found two trucks with foreign license
plates loaded with contraband cigarettes while the warehouse
itself was stacked high with more cartons.
</P>
<P>
Police believe that it is the biggest ever seizures in Greece
of contraband cigarettes which would have cost Greece 3 billion
drachmas (about 9.68 million U.S. dollars) in lost revenue if sold
on the black market.
</P>
<P>
So far, police have arrested four people including two
Albanians.

<HEADLINE> Ciubuc Nominated for New Moldova Premiership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Ion Ciubuc, the caretaker premier
of the Republic of Moldova, was nominated Wednesday for a new term
by the President Petru Lucinschi.
</P>
<P>
Under the constitution and parliamentary regulations, Ciubuc
is empowered to draft the ruling program and the cabinet line-up,
subject to parliament's scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
Parliamentary leader Peter Luchinsky on Monday and Tuesday
consulted with the four parliamentary factions to highlight a
candidate for premiership.
</P>
<P>
The Alliance for Democracy and Reform, the parliamentary
majority formed last month after the March 22 election, consists
of three of the four parliamentary factions -- the Democratic
Convention, the Democratic and Prosperous Moldova Bloc and the
Party of Democratic Forces.
</P>
<P>
The Party of Communists, which ranked the first in the
election, became the only opposition in the parliament.
</P>
<P>
The Democratic Convention nominated Valentin Dolganiuc for the
premiership, while the president said that he would like to see
Ion Ciubuc in the position.
</P>
<P>
The Communist group, which considered that Dolganiuc did "not
have all necessary qualities for taking the premiership", stated
earlier that they would back Ion Ciubuc if he was proposed by the
President.
</P>
<P>
The prerogative to move a candidate for the post belongs to the
head of the state, under the constitution.
</P>
<P>
The new parliament, meeting Wednesday in a plenary session,
will consider the candidacy.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Bankers Disappointed with Ottawa's Bank Rule </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Foreign bankers in Canada expressed
dismay and disappointment after Ottawa said it might delay
legislation that would make it easier for their banks to expand in
the country.
</P>
<P>
The bill was to be presented to the federal parliament before
the summer breaks begins in June.
</P>
<P>
The Finance Department has indicated that the government is
"considering not releasing our branching legislation" until after
the task force on financial services reform comes down in autumn.
</P>
<P>
The new law would let foreign banks operate in Canada as
subsidiaries of their parent companies with full access to their
big capital bases instead of as separately capitalized entities.
</P>
<P>
Gennaro Stammati, chief executive of Banca CommercialB8taliana
of Canada, said he is "disappointed and concerned" over the bill's
delay.
</P>
<P>
John Masters, chief executive of Bank of America Canada, said
the delay is "disheartening," especially since the legislation was
supposed to be tabled last December.
</P>
<P>
"It would have been wonderful to have this issue resolved
(ahead of the) bigger issues (Ottawa) is trying to grapple with,"
he was quoted as saying by Wednesday's Financial Post newspaper.

<HEADLINE> Asian Bowling Tour Organizers Call off China Masters Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Organizers of the inaugural Asian
Bowling Tour (ABT) have decided to call off the China Masters Cup
due to timing and logistical difficulties, it was announced here
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The China Masters Cup, set for May 2-3, is the second of the
five Masters Cup events of this year's Tour, with the first one
being the Malaysian Masters Cup in March.
</P>
<P>
Tour organizers had postponed the event due to timing problems
but had finally had to cancel it as they had failed to put things
together for a high caliber event.
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, logistical difficulties lead to delays which we
felt imposed time constraints not conducive to planning a
world-class event," said Richard Young, vice-president of
Operations for the Tour.
</P>
<P>
"We look forward however to the China Masters Cup debuting in
the future seasons of the ABT," he added.
</P>
<P>
The next Masters Cup event would be the Philippine Master Cup
set for June 13-14.
</P>
<P>
"Though it is a pity that the China leg was canceled, it is
anticipated that the Philippines Masters Cup will see top caliber
bowlers from all parts of Asia gathering together again to match
their skill against one another to acquire points for qualifying
into the Grand Slam Finals," said Vivien Fung, president of the
FIQ-WTBA Asian Zone.
</P>
<P>
Following the Philippines Masters Cup will be the Hong Kong
Masters Cup on July 13-14 and the Singapore Masters Cup on August
17-18.
</P>
<P>
The Grand Slam Finals is scheduled for January next year in
Taipei.
</P>
<P>
Each participant will accumulate their tour ranking points and
the top 16 ranked men and women bowlers from their tour rankings
will qualify for the Grand Slam Finals.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Factory Orders Pick Up Modestly in March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. factory orders picked up
modestly in March, but the first quarter of this year was
relatively soft due to Asian financial and economic crisis, the
Commerce Department reported here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Factory orders which represents the future production,
increased 0.3 percent to a seasonally adjusted 336.2 billion U.S.
dollars following a 0.7 percent drop in February, according to the
report. Orders for the quarter as a whole are down 0.8 percent
from the fourth quarter of 1997.
</P>
<P>
U.S. manufacturers, the export-reliant aircraft industry in
particular, have been hurt by soft demand in Asian countries.
However, the weakness hasn't yet stimulated unemployment or
dampened American consumers' confidence.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, shipments of factory goods, a measure of current
production, jumped 0.8 percent to a seasonally adjusted 340.5
billion dollars in March, the third increase in four months.
Shipments for the quarter were up 0.8 percent over the fourth
quarter of last year.
</P>
<P>
The faster pace of shipments, compared with new orders, helped
manufacturers to lower the backlog of unfilled orders for the
third time in four months. It dipped 0.8 percent in March to a
seasonally adjusted 538.7 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
In March, factory orders were led by a 4.1 percent increase for
computers and other office equipment. Overall, durable goods,
expensive items expected to last at least three years, rose 0.5
percent.
</P>
<P>
Those included a 3 percent rise for stone, clay and glass
products, a 1.1 percent rise for communications equipment, a 4.4
percent gain for medical instruments and a 7.9 percent increase
for electronic components.
</P>
<P>
However, orders for aircraft slumped 16.6 percent, on top of a
34.8 percent plunge in February. Orders fell 4.2 percent for
primary metals such as steel, 0.1 percent for fabricated metal
products. They also declined for electric lighting and wiring and
engines and turbines.
</P>
<P>
Non-durable goods orders were unchanged from the month before.
Orders declined for chemicals, but increased for printed
materials.

<HEADLINE> Westerners Should Know More about Chinese Culture: Sinologists (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
She said that she thought that Westerners have not got enough
knowledge about Chinese culture, though more and more Westerners
are learning the Chinese language.
</P>
<P>
"Before the 1970s there were few students at Harvard University
learning the Chinese language. But now the number of students
learning Chinese ranks third on the campus, after those learning
French or Spanish," said Professor Steven Owen from Harvard
University.
</P>
<P>
Owen attributed the change to the fact that China is becoming
stronger and no longer so unfamiliar to and far away from the
Western world, and that Westerners are changing their attitude
toward culture.
</P>
<P>
Almost the same reasons led Roland Felber, professor of Chinese
history at Berlin's Humboldt University, to the conclusion that it
is time for East and West to hold dialogue on an equal footing.
</P>
<P>
Felber, an overseas student in the department of history at
Beijing University in the 1950s, spoke highly of Cai Yuanpei,
president of the university some 80 years ago, calling him a
pioneer in modern Chinese history to attempt equal exchanges of
Eastern and Western cultures.
</P>
<P>
"He did not advocate 'total Westernization', but preferred
Chinese culture with modern characteristics; he promoted spreading
Chinese culture to the West, but without arrogance," Felber said.
</P>
<P>
"The most important thing in cultural exchange is to find out
what will benefit humanity, no matter whether it is Chinese or
Western," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Cultural exchanges are bilateral," said Allen. "In this regard
my paper could also be titled: 'Why Chinese should learn from
Western Culture'."

<HEADLINE> Canadian Firm to Scrap Water Export Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, May 6 (Xinhua) -- A small Canadian company that planned
to export lake water to Asia is now preparing to abandon the idea.
</P>
<P>
The company said its proposal to ship Lake Superior water
abroad was not intended to create an international incident, but
to countries that need fresh water.
</P>
<P>
"If the Canadian government decides to revoke the permit, then
the Nova Group will abide by that decision," said president John
Febbraro.
</P>
<P>
Nova Group, based in the Ontario city of Sault Ste. Mario on
the eastern tip of the lake, was last week granted the first-ever
permit from the Ontario provincial government to export water from
Lake Superior to Asia.
</P>
<P>
The company hoped to take up to 600 million liters of water a
year for the next five years from the lake for shipping abroad.
</P>
<P>
However, the planned sale of lake water had raised fears that
Canada could lose control of its fresh water supply to water
markets.
</P>
<P>
Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister Lloyd Axworthy voiced his
strong objection to the proposed water export, and is scheduled to
meet Ontario Environment Minister Norm Sterling on Wednesday to
discuss the issue.
</P>
<P>
The federal government was "examining various pieces of
legislation" to determine if there was a way of preventing the
export, Axworthy said early this week.
</P>
<P>
"What we are looking at is the real question of the large-scale
export of fresh water, which we certainly have always taken a
strong stand against," Axworthy said. "It is a matter of some
real concern."
</P>
<P>
While admitting the planned export amount was "reasonably small"
compared to the normal flow of water out of the lake, the minister
said that the action could set a precedent and encourage companies
from Canada and the United States to draw on limited fresh water
resources for profit.
</P>
<P>
The Ontario Environment Ministry said it granted the export
permit on the grounds that the company had demonstrated the project
would result in no significant environmental damage.
</P>
<P>
A U.S. government official was reported as saying that
Washington was concerned the exports could violate a 1909 treaty
which established joint Canada-U.S. management of the Great
Lakes.

MOSCOW, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin and
his Uzbek counterpart Islam Karimov decided to sign a 10-year
cooperation treaty when they met at the Kremlin Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The treaty will be signed during Yeltsin's official visit to
Tashkent, capital of Uzbekistan, in early October, reported the
Interfax news agency.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin and Karimov also agreed to raise the level of the

</P>
<P>
A joint statement was issued following the talks. The two

</P>
<P>
Yeltsin and Karimov also exchanged views on the situation in
Afghanistan, which they described as "explosive".
</P>

<HEADLINE> Pakistani PM Confident of Asia's Recovery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif said here Wednesday that he was confident that with the
support and assistance from international agencies and countries
like Japan and China, a resumption of growth will take place in
Asia within this year.
</P>
<P>
Delivering a keynote address at the Ninth Annual Corporate
Conference of the Asia Society, which opened Wednesday evening at
the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Center, Sharif expressed
his confidence about the resumption of growth though he said
that it will take another two or may be three years for the rate
of progress to revert to its earlier dynamic path before the Asian
financial turmoil.
</P>
<P>
Asia is a market of more than three billion people which is
expanding and opening at a fast pace, Sharif said.
</P>
<P>
The rapid pace of economic growth coupled with urbanization and
changes in habits and consumption patterns are enlarging the
markets for goods and services, he noted.
</P>
<P>
In many countries, non-tariff barriers have been eliminated and
tariff walls have been lowered, he added.
</P>
<P>
"These on the one hand are offering greater access to foreign
products and on the other forcing domestic industries to
restructure, improve efficiency, and acquire competitiveness,"
Sharif said.
</P>
<P>
The composition and pattern of imports are distinctly
undergoing a transformation, Sharif said.
</P>
<P>
They are becoming an attractive market for high-tech products
and processes and their imports of tradable services are
expanding, he added.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-nine percent of the world population, a latent world
market, and 45 percent of the world labor force is in China, India
and Pakistan alone.
</P>
<P>
The present trends indicate that these countries are set to
grow two to three times faster than the industrialized countries,
Sharif said.
</P>
<P>
During the recent economic downturn in East Asian countries,
China took a bold and commendable decision not to devalue its
currency thereby stabilizing the economics of neighboring
countries, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Sharif said that Central Asia and South Asia are on the move
now and conditions are being created for rapid economic growth in
both regions.
</P>
<P>
The prospects for a South Asian free trade area early in the
next century will further accelerate growth and trade in the
region, he said.
</P>
<P>
The greatest potential for business lies in exploiting the
complementarities of Central and South Asia, Sharif pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The energy-rich Central Asian Republics can meet the demand of
the populous and rapidly industrializing South Asian countries, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
In tern, the South Asian states can provide the Central Asian
Republics with technical know-how, managerial services, and a
whole array of consumer and intermediate goods.
</P>
<P>
Importantly, the shortest routes from Central Asia to South
Asia and to world markets, pass through Afghanistan and Pakistan,
Sharif said.
</P>
<P>
He said that to further the enormous potential of Central
Asia and South Asia, Pakistan will be hosting the first ever
Central Asia-South Asia Economic Summit in Islamabad from
September 13 to 15 this year.
</P>
<P>
It will be a pioneering initiative to bring together the two
regions with great economic potential in terms of complementary of
resources and expertise, Sharif said.
</P>
<P>
"The Asian countries must cooperate closely to prove equal to
the challenges of the next millennium," Sharif said.
</P>
<P>
"Let us not be deterred by the enormity of the task before us.
Let us harness our assets and resolutely move forward towards ever
higher achievements," Sharif concluded.

<HEADLINE> British TV Company Probes Fake Drugs Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 6 (Xinhua) -- A major British television company
Carlton said on Wednesday it was investigating claims that a
ward-winning documentary on Colombian drugs cartel were faked.
</P>
<P>
Britain's Guardian newspaper said on Wednesday that a 1996
documentary made by independent Carlton Communications Plc on the
Cali cartel and its heroin smuggling route between South America
and London, contained a number of major deceptions.
</P>
<P>
Carlton spokesman Peter Rushton told reporters the company was
investigating many of the issues revealed in the newspaper in a
full scale.
</P>
<P>
The hour-long program, The Connection, featured an exclusive
interview with a man who claimed to be the number three of the
Cali cartel and also showed a drugs courier, known as a "mule",
swallowing packets of heroin before boarding a flight to London.
</P>
<P>
But the Guardian alleged that the interviewee was a retired
bank cashier with low-level connections to the drug world.
</P>
<P>
Carlton sold the program to 14 countries, winning eight
international awards and world-wide praise for its educational
content.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Independent Television Commission (ITC), Britain's
television watchdog, was aware of the reports, saying it was
"waiting to see Carlton's reaction to these reports."
</P>
<P>
The ITC has the power to withdraw Carlton's broadcasting
license if it has enough evidence and reason.

BEIJING, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Beijing Guo'an remained unbeaten
this season after beating a 10-man Yanbian Aodong 2-0 at home in

<HEADLINE> Westerners Should Know More about Chinese Culture, Sinologists (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 6 (Xinhua) -- "I believed that what we Westerners
do and think was natural before I touched Chinese culture, but
later I changed my ideas," said Professor Sarah Allan, a
52-year-old US sinologist.
</P>
<P>
"Because I knew then that in the Far East there has been a
totally different way of thinking and living since ancient times,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
Perhaps that is why this professor of Chinese history at
Dartmouth College offered a paper to the International Symposium
on Sinology which opened here today, discussing why Westerners
should get to know more about Chinese Culture.
</P>
<P>
"Now the Westerners are doubting their traditional culture, and
a way to solve the problem might be to learn from another
culture," she said. "By learning from another culture, we may
check and improve our own thinking."
</P>
<P>
Allan is among some 300 Sinologists from 17 countries and
regions who will continue to discuss Chinese language and
literature, history, philosophy and archaeology, in the next two
days at the Fragrant Hills Hotel.
</P>
<P>
Like many other foreign sinologists at the symposium, Allen
regards Chinese culture as an important part of world
civilization. "We will be more aware of the nature of mankind once
we know this country, which is most distant to us in terms of
culture," she said.
</P>
<P>
"I am touched by the beauty of ancient Chinese jades or
bronzes. And when I read a poem from the 'Book of Odes' or a
passage from the 'Zhuang Zi', I am also enthralled. Then I realize
that no matter how distant we are in time, space and cultural
atmosphere, we share a common humanity," she wrote in the paper
she presented at the symposium.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Call for Cooperation in Biotechnology </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Scientists at an international
seminar here today called for international cooperation in
biotechnology.
</P>
<P>
"To increase international cooperation, especially the
cooperation between developing and developed countries, and to
narrow the gap of biotechnology between them, will be of great
significance for the world's stability and development," said
Professor Zhou Zenquan of Beijing University.
</P>
<P>
Scientists said that developing countries should not count on
applying biotechnology to solve their food problems for a long
time.
</P>
<P>
Although there is worldwide optismism on biotechnology's
prospects for the 21st century, Professor Ray Wu of Cornell
University said that developing countries will have obstacles to
overcome.
</P>
<P>
He said that biotechnology will play a big role in agriculture,
but that it will be more useful for developed countries.
</P>
<P>
"For developing countries, the issue relates not only to
technology but also to the way of funding input and research," the
U.S. biology professor said.
</P>
<P>
The meeting revealed that because of the shortage of research
funds, many developing countries have to import seeds from Western
biotechnology companies. Experts say that this trend has made
developed countries the biggest beneficiary in the biotech
revolution.
</P>
<P>
People suffering from food shortages mainly live in developing
countries and account for the biggest proportion of the world's
population.

<HEADLINE> MOFTEC Spokesman on US Reduction of Textile Quotas to China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The spokesman for China's Ministry
of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation today criticized the
United States for unilaterally deducting 5.1 million US
dollars-worth of quotas for textile products from China.
</P>
<P>
The US government, without providing clear evidence, accused
Chinese enterprises of illegally re-exporting textile products to
the US, and decided unilaterally to cut the quotas of Chinese
textile products by 300 percent. The decision severely violates
the bilateral agreement on textile products, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has always scrupulously followed the
provisions of the agreement, and holds that the two sides should
develop bilateral trade on the basis of equality and mutual
benefit, solve disputes with a practical, understanding and
consultative attitude, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The act of the US government wantonly violates the bilateral
agreement on textile products, and is absolutely unacceptable to
the Chinese government, he said.

<HEADLINE> HK to Step Up Enforcement Against Speeding At Sea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong Marine Police will step
up enforcement actions against speeding and unlicensed operations
of pleasure vessels in Hong Kong waters.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference here Wednesday, Poon Tze-chung,
divisional commander of the Marine Police, said the actions aim at
improving water safety and deterring unqualified persons from
operation on pleasure vessels.
</P>
<P>
"We are also considering actions against owners of pleasure
craft who permit their vessels to be operated by unqualified
persons," Poon said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that despite continuous efforts to remind masters and
operators of marine crafts to engage in a safe speed, speeding
remains a major problem.
</P>
<P>
To tackle the problem more effectively, the Marine Police have
procured five laser guns, each cost 40,000 HK dollars (5,128 U.S.
dollars) this April.
</P>
<P>
The introduction of the new laser guns will make the job of
mounting anti-speeding operations less manpower intensive and
eventually more such offense will be detected, he said.
</P>
<P>
Poon also noted that greater emphasis will be placed on
enforcing speed-restricted zones this year, particularly on
weekends and public holidays.
</P>
<P>
Besides actions against speeding and unlicensed operations of
pleasure vessels, the Marine Police also assist the Marine
Department in conducting routine checks on safety equipment of
pleasure vessels, he said.

<P>
JERUSALEM, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu reiterated Wednesday that he would not bow to U.S.
pressure over the issue of next redeployment in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Israel Radio, Netanyahu said that he
might reject the invitation by U.S. President Bill Clinton
for peace talks in Washington next week if attending the meeting
meant yielding to the American dictates.
</P>
<P>
He noted that "he is ready to go, but Israel is a sovereign
country and will not accept certain condition."
</P>
<P>
After the two-day separate talks in London with Netanyahu and
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) President Yasser Arafat,
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright announced Tuesday that
if Israel accepted the U.S. proposals, Clinton would invite the
Israeli and Palestinian leaders to Washington next Monday for
accelerated final-status talks.
</P>
<P>
The American peace plan calls on Israel to hand over 13.1
percent of the West Bank to the Palestinians during the second
redeployment in return for the fulfillment of the Palestinian
commitments for combating terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu convened the inner cabinet meeting Wednesday to
discuss the U.S. proposal.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Netanyahu briefed Infrastructure Minister
Ariel Sharon, Defense Minister yitzhak Mordechai, and Trade and
Industry Minister Natan Sharansky on his talks in London.
</P>
<P>
No reports on the outcome of the meeting were available. But
Sharon has told reporters that Israel must not hand over more than
9 percent of the West Bank in the further redeployment and every
extra percent handback will harm Israeli national security.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, PNA Culture and Information Minister Yasser Abed
Rabbo said Wednesday that the London talks were completely a
failure, and the Palestinians were not hopeful that there would be
different results in Washington next week.

different, the two nations share much in common with regard to the
maintenance of world peace and stability and the development of
their economies, he said.
</P>
<P>
China holds that the world should develop toward
multipolarization, he noted, adding that the EU has a crucial
position and influence in world affairs, and its continuously
strengthened political power and increasingly developed economy
will benefit the process of global multipolarization.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that China and the EU have been cooperating well,
and both sides have devoted great efforts to enhancing the
friendly ties.
</P>
<P>
China welcomes the EU's plan for the single currency, the
"euro", which will be helpful for balancing and stabilizing global
economic activities, he said.
</P>
<P>
He also appreciated the EU's decision to remove China from its
"non-market economy" list.
</P>
<P>
Li provided the visitors with a detailed explanation of China's
system of people's congresses, and its current legislative and
supervisory status. He also introduced them to China's trade
unions, wage system and economic system.
</P>
<P>
He said that China is keen to further foster its friendship
with the parliament of Belgium, and those of the European Council
and of other West European nations, so as to contribute to the
overall development of its relations with those nations.
</P>
<P>
Swaelen thanked the NPC for inviting the delegation to China.
</P>
<P>
The visitors had a far-reaching discussion with Chinese leaders
on matters of common concern, he said, and also saw something of
the Chinese cultural heritage while visiting some scenic spots.
</P>
<P>
The two nations have a tradition of friendship and cooperation,
and Belgium is ready to further strengthen exchanges and
cooperation between the two governments and parliaments, he noted.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Li hosted a welcoming banquet in honor of
the visitors.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Computer Company Produces One Million PCs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Intel Chairman and CEO Andrew Grove
received the one-millionth PC that China's Legend Group produced,
at a celebration ceremony here this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
"I never thought that Legend would have such a wonderful
celebration today when I visited the company in 1994," Grove told
the several hundred representatives of Chinese and international
telecommunications industry, journalists and government officials
at the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
"Today's Legend is very, very different from the Legend of four
years ago," he said.
</P>
<P>
In the past eight years Legend has boosted its annual
production and sales of PCs to over 500,000 from 2,000 in 1990.
</P>
<P>
It occupied 10.7 percent of China's PC market in 1997, and it
is expected to increase its market share to over 20 percent and
annual sales to 1.5 million PCs by the end of the century.
</P>
<P>
Yang Yuanqing, general manager of the computer company under
the Legend Group, said that Legend can do what foreign computer
companies cannot do in the Chinese market.
</P>
<P>
He said that Legend has a good understanding of the needs of
Chinese users, and focuses on applications and functions of the
PCs.
</P>
<P>
He noted that, at present, the solutions that foreign
companies designed for China's small- and medium-sized enterprises
are actually missing the target.
</P>
<P>
"Such solutions can only be used in certain departments of
large companies in China," he said.
</P>
<P>
Legend Chairman and CEO Liu Chuanzhi said that the key to
Legend's success in competing with overseas manufacturers is
"cutting costs."
</P>
<P>
He said that the operation cost of Legend is about one-third of
that of its foreign counterparts.
</P>
<P>
"China's reform and opening-up drive has created an environment
of fair competition for Legend and other PC manufacturers," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Legend will concentrate its resources on
consolidating and expanding its position in the domestic
market. It will strive to become one of the top ten PC
manufacturers in the world, he said.
</P>
<P>
In 1997 Chinese manufacturers took more than 60 percent of
China's PC market, which is the sixth-largest in the world.
</P>
<P>
Liu said that Legend will further strengthen cooperation with
foreign manufacturers. Now it buys Intel chips and test-runs
Intel's newly developed chips on its products.
</P>
<P>
Grove said that he will place the one-millionth Legend PC in a
museum that Intel has set up in the United States.

<P>
In order to ensure effective operation of the committee,
members need to abide by all the rules and safeguard the

</P>
<P>
He pledged that the Preparatory Committee will encourage all
its members to have their say, but they must abide by the
decisions of the committee and maintain its unity when expressing
their views outside, he noted.
</P>

He stressed that the above-mentioned requirement does not mean
that the members cannot give interviews to the mass media; indeed,
they are all able to express their views so long as they uphold
the decisions of the committee.
</P>
<P>
Empowered by the National People's Congress, the Preparatory
Committee for the Macao SAR is responsible for all matters related
to the preparations for the Macao SAR.

<HEADLINE> EU Fights Against Fraud Cases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The European Union is stepping up
fight against the rising number of cases of fraud and financial
irregularities.
</P>
<P>
A 1998-1999 work program was adopted Wednesday by the European
Commission, the EU executive body, to deal with the problem after
an annual report revealed Wednesday that fraud cases increased
from 4,552 in 1996 to 5,162 in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The cost entailed by fraud rose from 1.3 billion European
Currency Units (1.17 billion U.S. dollars) in 1996 to 1.4 billion
ECUs (1.25 billion dollars) in 1997.
</P>
<P>
"It is a very worrying phenomenon, especially since we know
that these syndicates also are involved in drug smuggling, trade
in weapons, corruption of public officials and money laundering."
said European Commissioner Anita Gradin.
</P>
<P>
"And now we can see them operating from neighboring countries
in the east, undermining their progress toward the rule of law,"
said Gradin, the commissioner in charge of financial control and
fight against fraud.
</P>
<P>
When asked to elaborate, the commissioner said that some former
border security officials in central and eastern European
countries had formed gangs of their own to smuggle weapons as well
as cigarettes, alcohol, sugar and butter.
</P>
<P>
There are 10 probes underway in the commission itself for cases
involving discipline, efficiency and corruption, she said.
</P>
<P>
The commissioner called for her institution to ratify the work
program into legislation so as to give the fight an effective
instrument.
</P>
<P>
She said that she would present the work program to the next
European Council meeting of economy and finance ministers this
month to help quicken the ratification process.

<HEADLINE> S. Korea Exports to Rise by 7.6 Percent in 1998: Think-tank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, May 6 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's exports are expected to
rise by 7.6 percent to 146.5 billion U.S. dollars in 1998 despite
the worsening business environment at home and abroad, the Samsung
Economic Research Institute said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
But South Korean exporters will meet much tougher trade
competition in the international market in the coming months, the
institute said.
</P>
<P>
Exports by the steel, shipbuilding and petrochemical sectors
will likely show relatively high annual growth rates ranging from
16 percent to 18 percent while textiles, electronics and machinery
are likely to register near-zero or negative growth, the institute
said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, imports will noticeably drop in the second half of
this year, reducing the total import volume by 11.3 percent to 128.5
billion U.S. dollars from last year.
</P>
<P>
As a result, this year's trade surplus will be around 20
billion U.S. dollars, added the Samsung institute.

<HEADLINE> Thai Cabinet Okays Central Bank Governor Nomination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The Thai cabinet on Wednesday okayed
the nomination of Chatumongol Sonakul as new central bank governor
to replace the resigned Chaiyawat Wibulswasdi.
</P>
<P>
Chatumongol was nominated by Finance Minister Tarrin
Nimmanhaeminda after Chaiyawat resigned under great pressure.
</P>
<P>
Local media hailed Chatumongol's nomination, saying his
integrity, courage, straightforwardness and past record as a
former director general of the Revenue Department suited him to
the challenging task.
</P>
<P>
The new central bank governor said Wednesday that his priority
would be restructuring the central bank and reforming its working
system.
</P>
<P>
He also proposed a group leadership for the central bank.
</P>
<P>
The resignation of Chaiyawat followed a report of an
investigation commission which was assigned to determine the cause
of the disastrous blunders by the central bank during last year's
foreign exchange crisis.
</P>
<P>
The report said Chaiyawat is one of the seven people who should
be responsible for the central bank's failed attempt to use
foreign currency reserves to defend the baht against speculative
attacks.
</P>
<P>
The abortive attempt almost depleted the country's foreign
reserves which plunged from 36.6 billion U.S. dollars to 2.5
billion dollars.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Belgium saw its jobless rate inch
down by 0.7 percent in the past month, local press reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Belgian television RTBF quoted the Belgian labor ministry as
saying that 430,000 people claimed unemployment benefit by the end
of April, a figure which was dropping slightly.
</P>
<P>
Compared with 12 months ago, however, the decrease was 5.3
percent.
</P>
<P>
Belgium's total unemployment rate now stands at 12.2 percent,
just below the average unemployment rate of the 15-nation European
Union of which Belgium is a member.
</P>
<P>
Unemployment has been a headache for national government
officials and those of the European Commission.
</P>
<P>
The commission, the EU executive body, held a special summit
late last year to address the problem.
</P>
<P>
Commission President Jacques Santer promised that the launch of
Euro would serve as a platform for both employment and

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Minister Tang
Jiaxuan and his Chilean counterpart Jose Miguel Insulza, in talks
here this afternoon, agreed that Sino-Chilean relations have
witnessed satisfying development since the two countries forged
diplomatic ties 28 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Tang said, in the 1990s the two countries have enjoyed fruitful
cooperation in many areas, shared close or identical views on
major global issues, and supported each other and coordinated
closely in world affairs. Bilateral trade has also grown rapidly,
he added.
</P>
<P>
Chile has become one of China's most important trade partners
in Latin America, and the trade volume between the two countries
account for 10 percent of trade between China and Latin America as
a whole, although Chile only has four percent of the population of
the region.
</P>
<P>
Tang said that China values its friendly cooperation with
Chile, and considers the country as an important cooperative
partner in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
Based on the principles of mutual trust, equality, mutual
benefit and complementarity, China is ready to make joint efforts
with Chile to forge long-term stable relations of beneficial
cooperation geared to the 21st century, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Insulza agreed with Tang's view on furthering economic and
trade relations between the two nations, and said that he looked
forward to closer bilateral relations of cooperation in various
areas.
</P>
<P>
Insulza said his country will continue to stick to its "one China"
stand.

</P>
<P>
Led by John E. Mcphee, acting deputy assistant secretary for

computer companies selected by the U.S. Department of Commerce
arrived here Tuesday on a 10-day visit to China.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Norway Urges Progress at Washington Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Norwegian Foreign Minister Knut
Vollebaek urged the Palestinians and Israelis to come up with
"frank" decisions at the upcoming Washington peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The Norwegian minister made the appeal following his talks with
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa Wednesday on developments of
the Middle East peace process in light of the London meeting.
</P>
<P>
The back-to-back talks Palestinian and Israeli leaders had with
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright have failed to produce
any real progress on the ground except promises of more talks in
Washington on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Vollebaek said he agrees with his Egyptian counterpart on the
importance of achieving some progress ahead of the U.S.-sponsored
Washington talks.
</P>
<P>
"What matters is that the Palestinians and Israelis should head
for Washington carrying frank positions vis-a-vis the American
ideas," he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. is known to be demanding Israeli withdrawal from 13.1
percent of the West Bank, a proposal already accepted by the
Palestinian National Authority but rejected by the Israeli
government, which sticks to a 9-percent ceiling.
</P>
<P>
Vollebaek spoke of Egypt's effective and positive stand to push
forward the Arab-Israeli peace talks, adding that Norway is also
assisting in bridging gaps between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
During their talks Wednesday, the two ministers tackled means
of activating the U.S.-brokered Oslo accords, which were signed by
the Palestinians and Israelis in 1993 in the Norwegian capital as
the cornerstone of the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The Norwegian top diplomat arrived here Tuesday night on a
two-day visit to Egypt for talks with Moussa and President Hosni
Mubarak on Egyptian and European efforts to breathing life into
the deadlocked peace-making.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli negotiations have been stalled since
March 1997 over Israeli settlement expansion and long-delayed
troop withdrawal from the West Bank.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 6 (Xinhua) -- China will further tighten the work
on legislation, law enforcement and judicial administration in
line with the basic policy of managing the country according to
law, Li Peng, chairman of the National People's Congress (NPC)
Standing Committee, said here today.
</P>
<P>
This is aimed to provide a legal guarantee for the growth of
the country's socialist market economy, Li said, in a meeting with
24 executive committee members of the International Association of
Prosecutors (IAP), who are here to enhance international
cooperation and effective crime-fighting methods.
</P>
<P>
He said China values the socialist law-building and takes it as
a basic condition and important guarantee to promote the reform
and opening-up, as well as the modernization drive.
</P>
<P>
Li said the NPC is the most powerful state organ in China which
takes charge of the country's legislation. "We'll continue to
accelerate and improve legislation, and tighten the
post-legislative supervision," he said.
</P>
<P>
The NPC will also urge relevant departments to earnestly
implement law enforcement and the judicial administration, and to
fight crime in an effective way, he said.
</P>
<P>
The top legislator said that he wished the ongoing executive
committee meeting success in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Li said China supports its prosecutors' departments and
societies to encourages them to closely cooperate with their
international counterparts and to play a positive role in the IAP
for a concerted crime-fighting effort.
</P>
<P>
The Society of Public Prosecutors of China has decided to host
the Fourth IAP Conference in Beijing in September of 1999. Li said
China will offer full support for the conference.
</P>
<P>
Eamonn Barnes, president of the IAP executive committee, said
he appreciated China's promise to further strengthen cooperation
with its international counterparts to fight crimes.
</P>
<P>
This is also the basic goal of the IAP, he said, adding that
his organization thanks China for its efforts to make possible the
meeting being held in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Han Zhubin, Procurator-General of the Supreme People's
Procuratorate, was present at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The non-governmental organization, founded in Vienna in June of
1995, urges all prosecutors throughout the world to effectively
prosecute criminals, crack down on internationally organized crime
and implement repatriation treaties.
</P>
<P>
A total of 27 senior Chinese prosecutors have joined the
association.

BEIJING, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Vice-Premier and Chairman of the
Preparatory Committee for the Macao Special Administrative Region
(SAR) Qian Qichen said today that the committee's mission
should be based on achieving the great concept of "one country,
two systems" in Macao.
</P>
<P>
In his speech at the close of the first plenary meeting of the

and decisions adopted by the National People's Congress and
its Standing Committee serve as the criteria and foundation for
preparing the establishment of the Macao SAR.

Following the establishment of the Preparatory Committee
Tuesday, all the 100 members attended the two-day plenum,

</P>
<P>
Qian said that the preparations for the Macao SAR are an
important matter which draws the attention of people throughout
the country, particularly the compatriots in Macao.
</P>
<P>
"We must fully practice democracy and solicit opinions from
people from all walks of life in Macao, including all kinds of
different views," Qian said.
</P>
<P>
Stressing openness, the committee should rely on all Macao's
people and mobilize the initiative of people from all walks of
life, he said.
</P>
<P>
He called on the members of the committee to conscientiously
observe the rules of the committee on collective responsibility,
confidentiality and press releases, and safeguard its authority and
image.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the task of the working groups in the near future
is to arrange their working schedules and prepare for the second
plenary meeting of the Preparatory Committee, to be held in early
July.
</P>
<P>
Talking about public security in Macao, Qian pointed out
that the Portugal Macao authorities should be entirely responsible
for handling this problem, and the Preparatory Committee has the
task of putting forth suggestions.
</P>
<P>
Qian expressed the belief that the Preparatory Committee would
score successes, backed by the prosperous motherland, guided by
the "one country, two systems" principle, led by the Communist
Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, and with the support of
the people of the whole country and the participation by the
compatriots in Macao.

<HEADLINE> China Promoting Law on Fire Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 6 (Xinhua) -- China's Minister of Public Security,
Jia Chunwang, said here today that a sound implementation of the
law on fire control first requires an extensive promotion campaign
to increase people's awareness of the law and firefighting.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a news conference, Jia said the law on fire control
is a fundamental legal document in China's firefighting campaign,
and departments of public security at each level must take a
leading role in promoting the law by making full use of media
outlets such as newspapers, radio and television.
</P>
<P>
The law on fire control was approved at the second meeting of
the Standing Committee of the Ninth National People's Congress
last month. Chinese President Jiang Zemin issued a decree and
accounced that the law will go into effect on Sept. 1, 1998.
</P>
<P>
Jia said the law not only defines the responsibilities of
related departments for fire control, but also establishes the
obligations of social organizations and citizens in firefighting.
</P>
<P>
The law also emphasizes fire prevention and the key management
work in this aspect by drawing lessons from major fires that have
occurred in the country, while setting out rights, obligations and
responsibilities on all sides in the form of a legal document, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Jia called on firefighting groups at each level to give aid to
the local governments in handling problems related to
firefighting. He issued a reminder that spring is fire season, and
that related departments must prepare for fire prevention.

<HEADLINE> First Quarter Saw 31 Major Fires in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 6 (Xinhua) -- China suffered 31 major fires in the
January-April period this year, resulting in 75 deaths and 58
people injured, according to the Ministry of Public Security today.
</P>
<P>
The direct property loss amounted to 110 million yuan (13.3
million US dollars), 2.7 times the figure for the same period in
1997, according to the statistics.
</P>
<P>
Major causes of this year's major fires were violations
of safety rules and careless use of fire, electricity and gas.
</P>
<P>
The ministry pointed out that many fires broke out in
public places, oil and chemical industry locations, and other places
where combustibles and explosive substances were stored.
</P>
<P>
Besides, most people still have a poor awareness of fire
prevention and precautions in case of fire, the ministry noted.
</P>
<P>
Concerning the major fires this year, the ministry has issued a
circular and set out concrete requirements and measures as regards
fire fighting.
</P>
<P>
The Law on Fire Control was adopted by the second meeting of
the Standing Committee of the Ninth National People's Congress on
April 29 and will go into effect September 1 this year.
</P>
<P>
The ministry urged local governments to attach great importance
to firefighting work and improve firefighting facilities.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the general public must be made more aware of the
importance of fire safety, it noted.

<P>
COLOMBO, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's Tamil rebels Wednesday
shot dead three policemen and attacked army positions in Northern
province of the country, ending a ceasefire to mark a visit by a
UN envoy, police sources here said.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the rebels ambushed the policemen from
Chettikulam in the district of Vavuniya, where UN envoy Olaara
Otunna was visiting.
</P>
<P>
The Tamil rebels Sunday announced a two-day (Wednesday and
Thursday) unilateral ceasefire to coincide with the UN official's
visit to the northern regions.
</P>
<P>
A Sri Lankan Defense Ministry spokesman Monday dismissed the
rebel truce as a gimmick, citing an earlier truce broken by the
Tamil rebels in April, 1995 after 100 days.
</P>
<P>
The Tamil rebels have been fighting a war for a separate state
in the north and east of the country since 1983.
</P>
<P>
The latest fighting between government forces and the Tamil
rebels began on April 19, 1995 when the rebels blasted navy
gunboats at Trincomalee signaling an end to a cease-fire and peace
talks with the government.

<HEADLINE> Worldwide Prosecutors Meet to Discuss Ways to Combat Crime </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 6 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. prosecutor said today that he
felt no fear walking in the streets of Beijing at 6 a.m. with his
wife, something he could not do in New York City.
</P>
<P>
John Kaye, who was attending the executive committee meeting of
the International Association of Prosecutors (IAP) here,
said: "The government in China is very strong about order and rule
of law."
</P>
<P>
The IAP's 24 executive members are meeting in Beijing to
enhance international cooperation and seek effective methods to
deal with crime.
</P>
<P>
The non-governmental organization, established in June of 1995
in Vienna, urged prosecutors throughout the world to effectively
prosecute criminals, crack down on internationally organized crime
and implement repatriation treaties.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-seven Chinese senior procurators have joined the
association. In addition, China will host the Fourth IAP
Conference in Beijing in September of 1999.
</P>
<P>
"We are trying to walk toward a uniform approach to the
operation of prosecuting," said Kaye, president of the National
District Attorney Association in the United States.
</P>
<P>
"The association should develop worldwide standards of
performance that will protect the profits and property of
international businesses. It's very important that these companies
are treated fairly no matter where they are," he said.
</P>
<P>
High-ranking prosecutors at the meeting put combating organized
crime high on their priority list.
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people feel that the only victims of organized crime
are those who get involved with robberies, prostitution or drug
use," Kaye said. "But that is not true. Organized crime actually
attacks everybody."
</P>
<P>
Kittipong Kittayarak from Thailand said that China has a good
judicial system and effective legal bodies.
</P>
<P>
"China has made great progress in fighting crime. And it's very
good for your country to take fighting economic crime as a
priority," said Kittayarak, executive director of the Institute of
Criminal Law of the Attorney General of Thailand.

<HEADLINE> Veteran Thai Politician Chatichai Dies of Cancer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Former Thai prime minister and
leader of Thailand's Chart Pattana Party Chatichai Choonhavan died
of cancer in London Wednesday morning, news reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
The 78-year-old veteran politician, who went for England four
weeks ago and undergone a second intestine cancer operation in
London, died at 0955 GMT (4:55 p.m. Bangkok time).
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai expressed his condolences over
Chatichai's death and said the ongoing cabinet meeting stopped one
minute for mourning.
</P>
<P>
Chatichai was elected prime minister in August 1988. When in
office, he maintained Thailand's successful status as a newly
industrialized country and was also active in foreign affairs.
</P>
<P>
In 1991, a military coup d'etat ousted the democratically
elected Chatichai cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Chatichai was also the leader of the Chart Pattana Party, which
is the third largest political party in the parliament.
</P>
<P>
Last week, a Chart Pattana Party senior official said that the
party will select a new party leader this month.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Chart Pattana Party leader Korn Dabaransi, who is also
Chatichai's nephew, said Chatichai's body will be sent back home
as soon as possible.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: China, Kazakhstan Expand Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA ATA, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The six years since China and
Kazakhstan established diplomatic ties have witnessed a rapid
development of their good-neighbor relations, with trade and
economic cooperation growing year after year.
</P>
<P>
The upcoming visit to China by Kazakh Prime Minister Nurlan
Utebovich Balgimbaev, beginning on Thursday, will add a new
impetus to the bilateral relations and cooperation in the future.
</P>
<P>
Sharing a 1,700-kilometer-long border, the two countries will
take full advantage of their geographic convenience to speed up
their economic reforms and opening up to the outside world.
</P>
<P>
The two neighbors can benefit immensely from cooperation. While
Kazakhstan can supply oil, natural gas, non-ferrous metals and
other raw materials badly needed for China's modernization drive,
China can supply industrial products, especially consumer goods,
to Kazakhstan and serve as a convenient outlet of the landlocked
country to the Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
Under the care of their leaders, the two countries have signed
a series of economic and trade agreements to boost trade, protect
investment, and cooperate in banking, transport and oil
production. They have also set up an inter-governmental committee
to facilitate economic, trade and scientific cooperation.
</P>
<P>
In fact, their trade and economic cooperation have expanded
steadily over the years. Two-way trade, which was 336 million
U.S. dollars in 1994, rose to 527 million dollars in 1997. It is
expected to reach one billion dollars by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
A major investor in Kazakhstan, China has set up 375 businesses
there, with a total investment of 320 million dollars. The
Chinese-funded enterprises are operating in the fields of oil
production, farm product processing, leather processing and
catering business.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Kazakhstan has established 15 businesses in
the neighboring Chinese ethnic region of Xinjiang, becoming the
fourth largest foreign investor there. Their business operations
cover leather processing, construction materials and auto repairs.
</P>
<P>
Businesses from the two countries are also exploring the
possibility to cooperate in auto-making, textile industry,
telecommunications and construction.
</P>
<P>
The year 1997 represented a landmark in their relations.
Chinese Premier Li Peng and Vice-Premier Li Lanqing visited the
central Asian country in September, giving a strong push to the
cooperation between the two countries. In June, China's
state-owned oil company won the tenders to develop oil and gas in
Aktyubinsk and Uzen, two of Kazakhstan's major oil and gas
fields. In September, the two sides formally signed three
agreements on oil and gas cooperation, which were described as the
"contracts of the century" by Kazakh President N. A. Nazarbayev.
</P>
<P>
As the president noted, the cooperation in oil and gas will
help spur the overall development of the relations between the two
neighbors.

<HEADLINE> Analysis: Why China Is Restructuring its Grain Marketing System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Local analysts observe that the
announcement Wednesday by the Chinese government on the
restructuring of the grain marketing system is of great importance
to the country's long-term grain security.
</P>
<P>
Premier Zhu Rongji, speaking at a national conference on
the issue, said that it is "inevitable and urgent" to carry out the
reform.
</P>
<P>
An official with the State Development Planning Commission told
Xinhua today that the existing grain circulation system in China
has been increasingly unsuited to the country's grain production,
and the changes in grain supply and demand.
</P>
<P>
Farmers find it difficult to sell their grain in good harvest
years, while grain prices soar in poor harvest years, the official
said, stressing that this contradiction must be resolved.
</P>
<P>
The official held that China's per capita grain output stands
at less than 400 kg, though the country ranks first in the world
in grain production, which has resulted in a long-time
imbalance of grain supply and demand in the country.
</P>
<P>
Under the current circumstances, the operation of the grain
circulation system plays an important role in grain production and
consumption, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The main problems in China's grain marketing system lie in the
fact that the state-owned grain companies play a dual role of both
storage and marketing, with a managerial mechanism that has failed
to operate in line with the laws governing market operation and
has resulted in severe financial losses, according to some local
experts.
</P>
<P>
For decades, China's grain firms have mixed government
functions and commercial roles, with the result that they have
been suffering from bad debts and financial losses for many years.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the state grain firms are trapped by planned
economy structures; they do not have the authority to make
managerial decisions on their own, and suffer from overstaffing,
high operation costs and poor economic returns.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that state grain companies have lost
more than 100 billion yuan in the past seven years.
</P>
<P>
More important is the fact that nearly half of the country's
grain has been sold to consumers by state firms. The poor
operation of these companies has made it very difficult for them
to guide grain prices, and for the government to regulate the
grain market and fight against hazards there.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the grain production capacity in different
provinces varies remarkably, while the country's grain market as a
whole is immature. As a result, local governments depend heavily
on the central government for grain supplies, and problems often
crop up between local governments regarding grain purchases and
sales.
</P>
<P>
To tackle these problems, the central government Wednesday
announced the "four principles and one improvement" policy for the
restructuring of state grain companies, namely, separation of
functions of the government from those of enterprise functions,
storage from managerial functions, responsibilities of central
government from those of local governments, and new from old
accounts, and improvement of the grain pricing system.
</P>
<P>
The State Council has worked out concrete measures to carry out
the reform based on these principles, and these measures will be
announced soon.

<HEADLINE> Largest Travel Agency Network Formed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 6 (Xinhua) -- China's largest travel agency
network was established here today, with the head office of China
International Travel Service (CITS) as the core.
</P>
<P>
The network of 120 members is expected to be the strongest
force in the country's tourism sector. The move is designed to
alleviate the effects of the Southeast Asia financial crisis,
currency devaluations in some European countries and the fierce
competition among domestic travel agencies, said Li Lu'an,
president of the CITS head office.
</P>
<P>
Network members will consolidate cooperation, conduct business
with a single image and the same service standard, and seek
tourism sources for others in an effort to attract more tourists.
</P>
<P>
The CITS group was set up in 1989, but group members did not
link assets nor have any regular internal operating mechanism or
rules.
</P>
<P>
The travel agencies have been working toward joint air and
railway transport networks in the last few years. CITS group is
now preparing to pass its ISO9000 quality certification
examination.
</P>
<P>
The CITS head office, the country's largest travel agency,
handled 533,000 overseas tourists last year, representing a
year-on-year rise of 10.7 percent. Other CITS members also
reported good performances.

<HEADLINE> G-15 to Prepare for South-North Summit With G-7 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The Group-15 of developing countries
will prepare for a summit meeting with the G-7, a club of the
world's leading industrialized countries, the Middle East News
Agency reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The G-15, now grouping 16 developing countries, will convene
its eighth summit in Cairo on May 11-13, only days before the G-7
holds its own summit in Birmingham, Britain, in the middle of this
month.
</P>
<P>
Among topics to be raised at the G-15 Cairo summit is a message
from the G-15 to the G-7 to examine means of entering a dialog at
various levels with the ultimate goal of holding a summit of the
two groups, according to well-informed sources.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak has sent a message containing
the proposal to British Prime Minister Tony Blair, whose countries
now holds the rotating presidency of European Union presidency and
the G-7.
</P>
<P>
His message addressed economic worries of the developing
countries and their wish to open a constructive dialog with the
seven major industrialized nations.
</P>
<P>
The G-15 summit is to discuss political and economic issues
including Asian countries' financial crisis, cooperation between
member states and activation of North-South dialog.
</P>
<P>
It will offer opportunities to the member states to take stock
of the recent developments of the world economy, formulate a
unified stand on global economic order and forge constructive
dialog with developed countries.
</P>
<P>
As a group of developing countries from Latin America, Africa
and Asia, the G-15 was founded in 1989. Kenya became the 16th
member last year, joining Egypt, India, Indonesia, Malaysia,
Algeria, Zimbabwe, Senegal, Nigeria, Argentina, Jamaica,
Venezuela, Mexico, Brazil, Peru and Chile.
</P>
<P>
Seven heads of state, three vice presidents and a number of
ministers are expected at the summit, in which they will issue a
communique spelling out the group's stances on economic and
political issues.
</P>
<P>
In preparation for the summit, trade ministers and foreign
ministers of the G-15 will convene their separate meetings here
this week.
</P>
<P>
The G-15 members, accounting for 30 percent of the world's
population and 27 percent of the land area of the third world,
represent the emerging economies of the developing world.
</P>
<P>
Their total gross domestic product makes up 39 percent of the
third world and exports, 31 percent of the developing countries'
total.

<HEADLINE> S. African Moslems Dismayed at Visa Refusal for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The Moslem community of South
Africa on Wednesday expressed shock at the reluctance of the
South African government to issue visas to Hamas spiritual leader
Sheikh Ahmed Yassin.
</P>
<P>
Yassin was reportedly refused a visa last week, and Moslems'
hope of him meeting President Nelson Mandela during his South
African visit this week was dashed Tuesday when a presidential
aide said Mandela had no plans for the meeting, South African
Press Association reported.
</P>
<P>
The welcoming committee for Yassin said in a statement that
Yassin was invited by the South African Moslem community as part
of his international tour.
</P>
<P>
"We appeal to the South African government to consider our
request that Sheikh Yassin be allowed to set foot on South
African soil, especially in view of the fact that his trip is a
private one," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"President Mandela has since his inauguration maintained an
open policy and indicated that he would be willing to meet Hamas
at some point in the future," it said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, South African Moslem condemned the "interference by
the Palestinian National Authority in attempting to stop" Yassin's
visit to South Africa.
</P>
<P>
"This kind of political opportunism flies in the face of the
expressed unity and cooperation between the Palestinian National
Authority and Hamas," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
News reports earlier this week said the Palestinian Authority
of Yasser Arafat had apparently exerted pressure on the South
African government to prohibit Yassin from visiting.
</P>
<P>
Last month, South African Justice Minister Dullah Omar and
Constitutional Affairs Minister Valli Moosa met Yassin while they
were in Saudi Arabia to attend the annual haj, or pilgrimage, to
Mecca.
</P>
<P>
Hamas' military wing has been responsible for a series of
suicide bombings in Israel over the past decade, which claimed
scores of Israeli lives. Yassin was released from an Israeli jail
last year in exchange for Israeli commandos held in Jordan.

<P>
BEIJING, May 6 (Xinhua)-- The Chinese government appreciates
Spain's positive attitude in promoting bilateral relations and
pushing the European Union (EU) to improve its ties with China,
Premier Zhu Rongji said here this afternoon.

<P>
Zhu made the remark while meeting with visiting Spanish Foreign
Minister Abel Matutes. China values its relationship with Spain
and the friendly and cooperative relations between the two
countries have a promising future, he said.
</P>
<P>
There are no conflicts of interests in essence between China
and Spain, Zhu said. Consolidating and promoting the friendly and
cooperative relationship complies with the fundamental interests
of the people of the two countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
China hopes to establish an all-around relationship of long
stability with Spain and the EU, and carry it into the 21st
century, Zhu said.

Matutes told Zhu that Spain is following China's reforms with
great interest. The reforms are not only beneficial to the Chinese
people, he said, but also to worldwide stability and development.

Matutes said that his talks with his Chinese counterpart and
the Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation have
achieved positive outcome.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka's Population Ages Faster </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's population is ageing
faster than any country's in the history of the world, according
to a news release from the United Nations Development Program
received Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The report estimates that over the next two decades Sri Lanka's
workforce will shrink, while the number of the elderly will
double. By the year 2025 Sri Lanka will stand alone as the only
non-high income country with an elderly population greater than 20
percent
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka's population will stabilize at 21 million before
2025.
</P>
<P>
Currently, Sri Lankans are 25 years old on average but, by
2025, that median age is expected to jump to 40, and reach 50 in
less than 60 years, the report pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The percentage of the population over 60 years will increase
rapidly from 8 percent currently, to reach 13 percent in 2010 and
20 percent in 2025, said the report, adding that inevitably this
will mean a drastic increase of old age dependency.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka's successful family planning programs and efficient
health services, coupled with economic factors, have also made a
significant impact on the country's current demographic changes,
the report said.

</P>
<P>
The First Plenum of the Preparatory Committee for the

Congress was held in Beijing May 5-6.
</P>
<P>
Senior Communist Party of China (CPC) and state leaders Jiang
Zemin, Li Peng, Zhu Rongji, Li Ruihuan, Hu Jintao, Wei Jianxing
and Li Lanqing met with all the Preparatory Committee

of the CPC and Chinese president, delivered an important speech at
the meeting, which was presided over by Xie Fei, vice-chairman of
the Preparatory Committee. Qian Qichen, chairman of the
Preparatory Committee, made speeches, respectively, at the opening
and closing meetings.
</P>
<P>
The plenum discussed and approved the work rules of the
Preparatory Committee, set up four working groups to handle
political, legal, economic and social and cultural affairs,
respectively, and held an earnest discussion on the future work of
the Preparatory Committee.
</P>
<P>
The plenum holds that the establishment of the Preparatory
Committee of the Macao SAR marked the start of a new phase in the
preparations for resuming the exercise of sovereignty by the
Chinese government over Macao.
</P>

Preparatory Committee members will solicit opinions of people
from all walks of life in Macao and engage in all kinds of
preparations for the founding of the Macao SAR in accordance with

National People's Congress and its Standing Committee.
</P>
<P>
The plenum maintains that the resumption of exercise of
sovereignty over Macao by the Chinese government on December 20,
1999, will be another grand event after the return of Hong Kong to
the motherland last year. This is of great significance to the
long-term stability and development of Macao and the eventual
realization of the complete reunification of China.
</P>
<P>
All Preparatory Committee members, fully aware of the heavy

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Unilever Corp., a British-Dutch
joint venture, today set up its regional headquarters in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Unilever is the third multinational firm this year to set up
regional headquarters in this leading industrial and commercial
center of China, following Microsoft and Kodak from the United
States.
</P>
<P>
"The establishment of new headquarters indicates our confidence
in the long-term development of China," said an official from the
firm.
</P>
<P>
Unilever, one of the largest daily necessities producers in the
world, has invested more than 640 million U.S. dollars in China.
</P>
<P>
In the past several years, 55 of the world's top 100
multinational firms have launched 129 projects in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
The change from solely manufacturing products in China to
setting up regional headquarters also shows the improvement of
China's investment environment, according to local government
sources.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey by the Shanghai government shows that over 90
percent of foreign-funded firms are optimistic about their future
development in China and 83 percent of them plan to increase
investment over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
To improve its competitiveness in the Chinese market, Unilever
also plans to work in cooperation with the Shanghai Institute of
Organic Chemistry to produce cosmetics and detergent using
traditional Chinese medicine.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Legislators Join Abacha Persuasion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's newly-elected state and
national legislators have joined the campaign aimed at persuading
the military leader, General Sani Abacha to transform himself
into a civilian president this October.
</P>
<P>
The legislators, under the umbrella of the "Union of
Democratically-Elected Representatives of Nigerians", will meet
on the issue Thursday in Abuja, the Nigerian capital.
</P>
<P>
According to media reports, the meeting is expected to pass a
resolution calling on Abacha to accept the invitation of the
country's five political parties to have him as their consensus
candidate in the presidential election scheduled for August.
</P>
<P>
Senator Arthur Nzeribe, the co-ordinator of the group, told
newsmen in Abuja Tuesday that the resolution will be forwarded to
all foreign missions and embassies for onward transmission to
their respective governments.
</P>
<P>
The legislators will also proceed on a peace march to the Aso
Rock presidential villa to present their resolution to General
Abacha, the co-ordinator said.
</P>
<P>
Nzeribe said that "General Abacha saved this country from
disintegrating and we now have a hope and a vision for the future
via the Vision 2010 which was put together by some of the best
brains."
</P>
<P>
He argued that "there is nothing wrong with the sequential
call on General Abacha to contest the presidential election, in
the interest of Nigeria."
</P>
<P>
Nzeribe, however, advised Abacha to contest the presidential
election as a civilian.
</P>
<P>
Abacha's special adviser, former Internal Affairs Minister
Wada Nas has said that Abacha will contest as "General Abacha".

<HEADLINE> HK Jetfoil Might Have Hit Ship Wreck in Crash: Fisherman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 6 (Xinhua) -- A fisherman reportedly said that
the Macao-bound Hong Kong jetfoil, which crashed Saturday
afternoon, might have hit the wreck of a sunken ship, Hong Kong
newspapers reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The crash of the Far East jetfoil "Flores" occurred some 1.6
kilometers off Tai O at Hong Kong's largest island Lantau, leaving
120 passengers and crew members injured. A seriously wounded old
woman died in hospital early Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
The jetfoil was believed to have hit an unidentified underwater
object in the accident.
</P>
<P>
Vessels with sonar detecting equipment and divers sent by the
Hong Kong Marine Department had been searching the scene to find
anything submerged in the water which might be related to the
accident.
</P>
<P>
The department had called on witnesses to come forward to help
the on-going investigation.
</P>
<P>
A fisherman named Chan Ma-sing said he was fishing with his
family when he saw the damaged jetfoil directly above the wreck of
a 90-meter-long ship that sank six years ago. He believed the
vessel hit the wreck even though he did not hear any loud noise at
the time.
</P>
<P>
All fishermen in these waters knew where the wreck was and the
driver of the jetfoil should also know the location as the wreck
had been marked on Hong Kong marine charts, said Chan, who has
been fishing in the area for more than 10 years.
</P>
<P>
The wreck is 1.5 nautical miles (2.4 kilometers) north of the
location of the accident given by the jetfoil's captain and lies
off the jetfoil's route, one of the three approved routes for Far
East jetfoils, according to Marine Department officials.
</P>
<P>
Although the wreck is quite far from the reported crash site,
Marine Department officials said they would check the wreck to see
whether it had been hit.
</P>
<P>
Other experts had held that the vessel might have hit garbage
such as parcels from abandoned boats, logs and furniture, which
had been found floating or submerged in the waters.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Lower, Resting up for Big Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar rested up
Wednesday, closing little changed and marginally lower.
</P>
<P>
Thursday brings a busy day for the local currency with the
release of April labor force figures and the semi-annual statement
by Reserve Bank of Australia Governor Ian Macfarlane.
</P>
<P>
The local session closed at 64.10 U.S. cents, from 64.14 late
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The Australian dollar has stayed in a very tight range ahead
of the monetary policy statement and the employment figures
tomorrow," a Commonwealth Bank dealer said.
</P>
<P>
"The currency is just waiting to see what Mr. Macfarlane has to
say on the economy and draw some inference from that on monetary
policy," he said.
</P>
<P>
Macfarlane will speak before the House of Representatives
Standing Committee on Financial Institutions and Public
Administration in Melbourne.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Bureau of Statistics will release labor force
figures Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
Employment fell by a seasonally adjusted 15,500 in March, from
February's rise of 14,800. The March unemployment rate rose to a
seasonally adjusted 8.2 percent, from 8.1 percent in February.
</P>
<P>
Market expectations for April employment center on a rise of
25,000 and range from a rise of 10,000 to 40,000. Forecasts for
the unemployment rate range from 8.0 percent to 8.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar closed at 84.85 from 85.37 against the
Japanese yen, and at 1.1359 from 1.1431 against the Deutsche mark.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Coroner Calls for Ban on PU Foam Products </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 6 (Xinhua) -- A Hong Kong inquest coroner has
called for an immediate withdrawal from market all products made
of PU foam, according to a Special Administrative Region (SAR)
government spokesman.
</P>
<P>
In his report on last year's Mei Foo Sun Chuen fire which was
released here Tuesday, Ian Thomas listed recommendations on
improving fire safety. Nine people died in the fire.
</P>
<P>
He recommended, among other things, that all furniture and
mattresses made of PU foam be withdrawn from the market in Hong
Kong and that import of such items be banned.
</P>
<P>
PU foam, a petroleum by-product in the form of plastic foam, is
mainly used for the production of mattresses, upholstered cushions
and furniture fillings.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong has legislative control on all consumer goods,
including PU foam furniture. The Consumer Goods Safety Ordinance,
which came into effect in late 1995, imposes a statutory
responsibility on manufacturers, importers and suppliers to ensure
that consumer goods supplied for private use are safe. The
ordinance created a "general safety requirement" and specified the
reasonable level of safety required of different consumer goods,
the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that PU foam is not one of the listed dangerous
goods under the Dangerous Goods Ordinance, which provides for the
control on potentially hazardous substances. PU foam is not
recognized as dangerous goods according to international standards
prescribed under the International Maritime Dangerous Goods Code.
</P>
<P>
Special legislation on the control of PU foam products is not
common, with the only such cases in Britain and the United States,
the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the government is considering other
recommendations in the coroner's report, such as the importance of
the proper operation and maintenance of fire safety installations.

He thanked the Angolan troops for their assistance in solving
the military conflict in his country.
</P>
<P>
As to the situation back in home, President Sassou Nguesso
said that generally speaking, peace has been realized after a
period of recovery, particularly in the Capital city of
Brazzaville.
</P>
<P>
Now, weapon collection has begun across the country, said the
president.
</P>
<P>
In 1997 when conflict broke out in Congo, Angola sent
thousands of its troops there, contributing a lot to the
reinstatement of Sassou Nguesso as Congolese president.
</P>
<P>
President Sassou Nguesso arrived in Luanda for a short visit.
This is his second visit to the country since he returned to
power in October 1997.
</P>
<P>
Last October, the Congolese president came to Luanda to attend
the four-side summit of Angola, Congo, Gabon and the Democratic
Congo.

<HEADLINE> Feasibility Study on Trans-Asia Railway Ready in June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Transport Minister
Ling Liong Sik said Wednesday the feasibility study on the
Trans-Asia Railway from Singapore to Kunming, China, is expected
to be ready next month.
</P>
<P>
The outcome of the study conducted by Malaysia would be the
basis for the implementation of the project which was approved at
the 5th ASEAN summit in Bangkok on December 15, 1995, he said in
parliament, according to the Malaysian national news agency
Bernama.
</P>
<P>
Once the feasibility study is ready, it would be tabled at the
ASEAN heads of government meeting and the possibility is that the
meeting would invite an international consortium to implement the
project.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian government has allocated 2 million ringgit (about
0.53 million U.S. dollars) for the feasibility study while the
consortium involved would pay 3 million ringgit (about 0.795
million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The estimated cost of the project could only be decided after
the engineering study is done, the minister said, adding the
engineering study would include topography, detailed engineering
designs, compliance with minimum standards and also the estimated
cost of building the tracks and the choice of route.
</P>
<P>
Ling said the consultants were considering several routes
including
(1) Singapore-Malaysia-Thailand-Cambodia-Vietnam direct to
Kunming,
(2) Singapore-Malaysia-Thailand-Laos with connection in Vietnam,
(3) Singapore-Malaysia-Thailand-Laos direct to China, and (4)
Singapore-Malaysia-Myanmar and from Myanmar direct to China.
</P>
<P>
He said that for Malaysia, the existing railway lines could be
used and there would be no extra cost for the project.

<HEADLINE> UNAIDS Shows Concern for "Youth in Shadow of AIDS" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 6 (Xinhua) -- A United Nations official has asked
for a global effort to help young people around the world "out of
the shadow of AIDS."
</P>
<P>
"Young people today grow up in the shadow of AIDS (because) new
infections in them are occuring at the rate of five per minute,"
said Peter Piot, executive director of the Joint United Nations
Program on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), in an interview with Xinhua New
Agency.
</P>
<P>
Adolescents should be entitled to concern in HIV/AIDS
campaigns, not only because they were particularly important for
society, but also because they have been seriously affected by the
epidemic, said Piot today in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
UNAIDS reported that more than half of new infections with HIV,
the human immunodeficiency virus which causes acquired immune
deficiency syndrome (AIDS), are occurring in the 10-24 age group
each year. Those who have dropped out of school, who live on
the streets, share needles with other drug users or engage in
commercial sex are especially vulnerable to HIV infections, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"That's why UNAIDS has chosen to focus the 1998 World AIDS
Campaign on young people," Piot said.
</P>
<P>
The campaign would encourage more adolescents to participate in
HIV/AIDS control efforts, and offer help and care to HIV victims.
</P>
<P>
"Furthermore, young people are not just a target group for
action, but also a force for change," he said, commenting
favorably on an essay competition on "Adolescents and AIDS" which
concluded Tuesday in Beijing. Some 600 students participated in
the essay contest.
</P>
<P>
Piot, 49, devoted himself to HIV/AIDS research for a dozen
years before his appointment as director of UNAIDS, established in
1996 by the United Nations as a leader of the global campaign
against AIDS.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Raps U.S. Weak Stand in Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 5 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian permanent delegate to
the Arab League said Wednesday that a "weak" U.S. stance has led
to the failure of the London meetings and overcast the peace talks
in Washington next week.
</P>
<P>
In statements to the middle East News Agency, Mohamed Sobeih
expressed pessimism over another round of back-to-back talks
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) President Yasser Arafat and
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to have with
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright in Washington next Monday.
</P>
<P>
"My pessimism is attributed to the hostile and antagonistic
stance by Israeli Premier Netanyahu vis-a-vis the Oslo Agreement,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Going to Washington, following a similar round of meetings in
London last Monday and Tuesday, are meant to give time to all
parties including the U.S. administration and the Palestinian and
Israeli leaderships to flesh out an acceptable solution to break
out of the 14-month deadlock in peace-making.
</P>
<P>
"Time is a pressing element to the Palestinians," Sobeih added.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side accepted the U.S. ideas which talked among
other things of an Israeli withdrawal from 13.1 percent of the
West Bank, freezing of any unilateral step, and calling for a
third Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
"Israel did not respond to these ideas, shirking off the
withdrawal from the 13.1 percent but the U.S. stance was not firm
in this respect," he said.
</P>
<P>
Sobeih said failure to reach an agreement to implement the
U.S. initiative is "nothing but a reluctance on the Israeli side
and a kind of laxity on the U.S. side."
</P>
<P>
Albright is known seeking Israeli approval of a further
pullback of 13 percent from the West Bank, an interim withdrawal
proposal acceptable to Arafat but shunned by Netanyahu who has
offered no more than 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
On the eve of the London meetings, Netanyahu's adviser said the
Israeli premier was not empowered to redeploy forces in more than
9 percent of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian official termed the U.S. stance as weak, citing
the fact that neither Albright nor U.S. Mideast peace coordinator
Dennis Ross who came to the Mideast in the last week of April,
made public the new U.S. ideas.
</P>
<P>
However, he pointed out that "in the end, the entire issue
remains the U.S. administration's responsibility if it really want
to realize peace in the region."
</P>
<P>
Arafat will make a full assessment of the peace process on the
Palestinian-Israeli track with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
here on Thursday, said the Palestinian delegate to the Cairo-based
Arab League.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli talks have been stalled since March
1997 over Israeli settlement buildings and long-delayed military
withdrawal from the West Bank.

<HEADLINE> State Council Meeting Hears Reports on Ecology, AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The Executive Meeting of the State
Council, presided over by Premier Zhu Rongji, heard two reports
today on improving the country's environment and AIDS prevention
and treatment.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, Vice-Minister of the State Development Planning
Commission Wang Chunzheng explained an outline on improving the
environment, and Minister of Health Zhang Wenkang delivered a
report on the prevention and treatment of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
Since China's reform and opening-up, the national economy has
continued its rapid growth. However, some localities have ignored
the protection of natural resources. As a result, the environment
is deteriorating and sustained social and economic growth has been
seriously undermined, participants at the meeting said.
</P>
<P>
In this sense, it is a critical and pressing task for China to
improve the environment by curbing soil erosion through planting
trees and grass, halting desertification and developing ecological
agriculture.
</P>
<P>
With an eye on long-term ecological benefits, the priority
should be placed on short-term goals, according to the
participants. In addition, the relationship between national
interests and local interests should be handled better.
</P>
<P>
Hearing the report on AIDS prevention and treatment, the
participants said that the spread of AIDS has drawn the attention
of governments of various countries, and the disease has become a
major health and social problem.
</P>
<P>
In China, AIDS is spreading quickly. Governments at all levels
should intensify efforts to improve the relevant regulations, map
out work plans, increase input and further raise the awareness of
the public about the disease, according to participants.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Takes Measures to Increase Revenues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
lUSAKA, May 6 (Xinhua) --The Zambia Revenues Authority (ZRA)
Wednesday announced measures to increase revenues so as to reach
the country's 1998 target estimated at 1,090 billion Kwacha or 700
million U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference held at the State House, ZRA Commissioner
General Kevin Donovan said that the authority, among other
measures, will widen the country's tax base and curb smuggling
and undervaluation of imported goods.
</P>
<P>
Donovan said that ZRA will be mounting an operation to get
local Zambians working for foreign embassies expatriate staff
into the country's tax net since these people have never paid tax
to the revenues institution.
</P>
<P>
He warned that these people should "come immediately" to pay
their income tax, otherwise they will "suffer the consequences."
</P>
<P>
Donovan said that in order to curb smuggling, ZRA will deploy
more special teams to monitor imported goods.
</P>
<P>
Most of the smuggled goods, including foodstuff and cooking
oil, came from South Africa and Zimbabwe, he said.
</P>
<P>
In the past years since ZRA was established in 1993, Zambia's
revenues have steadily increasing from 421 billion Kwacha (300
million Dollars) in 1994 to 954 billion Kwacha last year.
</P>
<P>
Though this year's target is difficult to acheive,
Donovan expressed his optimistic over ZRA's performance since in
the first quarter of this year, it collected 248 billion Kwacha
(170 million Dollars) against a target of 229 billion Kwacha (160
million Dollars).

<HEADLINE> Biotech Immature for Developing Nations to Combat Grain Shortage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 6 (Xinhua) -- It will take some time for
developing nations to use biotechnology as an effective weapon
against insufficient rain, said scientists today at a conference
on life sciences in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Biotechnology is playing a major role in combating global grain
shortages as high and new technologies in the field are quickly
spreading around the world, especially in Western nations, said
Professor Ray Wu of Cornell University in the United States.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, developing nations must overcome problems in
funding scientific research and other systematic shortcomings
before biotechnology itself can help reduce grain shortages.
</P>
<P>
As famines and grain shortages pose a great threat to humans,
most countries have targeted biotechnology as an important part of
its scientific research, according to scientists attending the
conference.
</P>
<P>
In the developed world, said Professor Wu, genetically
engineered crops able to resist cold, disease and insects through
inheritance are already planted in small experimental fields, and
more varieties are expected to become popular within the next
decade.
</P>
<P>
However, developing nations, the main victims of grain
shortages, have to import new crop varieties from abroad because
of insufficient funding to support their own research.
</P>
<P>
Some experts believe the developing world's reliance on the
developed nations will make the latter the greatest beneficiary of
progress in biotechnology.
</P>
<P>
Professor Zhou Zengquan of the School of Life Sciences of
Beijing University, said that increased international cooperation,
especially that between developed and developing countries, to
close the gaps existing in biotechnological research is of great
significance to global stability and development.
</P>
<P>
"Developing nations must put more emphasis on fund input and
personnel training in biotechnological research," said Wu.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the omnipresent problem of fund shortages, he added,
inadequate allocation of the funding, meaning that money is not
funneled to the most important projects, is also a factor in the
scientific research gap between developed and developing
countries.

<HEADLINE> Two S. Africans Jailed for Over 340 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Two Johannesburg men were sent
to prison for a combined total of more than 340 years on Tuesday
for conducting a reign of terror in the metropolis' northwestern
suburbs.
</P>
<P>
Charges against Frank Motsusi, 21, and Ernest Mosadi, 29,
included murder, attempted murder, robbery, kidnaping, hijacking
and unlawful possession of firearms.
</P>
<P>
Between June and December 1995, the two robbed various
restaurants, pizza shops and video outlets in five suburbs of
Johannesburg. Among the cases were the murder of a bottle store
owner and the murder of a man whose gun they had taken.
</P>
<P>
"They were having an absolute royal time,... Every Friday or
Saturday night they would go out and rob one or other place. They
were very violent and that's the reason why the judge was so
upset and gave them such high sentences," said a police captain,
who was celebrating Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
The arrests of the two in December 1995, while they were
trying to rob a shop, brought an end to a crime spree that made
ordinary residents in the neighborhood too afraid to leave their
homes at weekends.
</P>
<P>
Motsusi was sentenced to 215 years on more than 20 charges,
and Mosadi was sentenced to 126 years on 16 charges.

NEW DELHI, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Health services in Indian capital
New Delhi remained paralyzed for the second day Wednesday as more
than 11,000 nurses continued their indefinite strike.
</P>

The strike, which started here Tuesday in 28 government
hospitals in the city, has been called by the Delhi Nurses Union
(DNU) to protest the alleged backtracking by the government on the
agreement signed with it last September on pay scales, promotion
and other demands.

for talks minus any hike in pay.
</P>
<P>
General Secretary of the DNU G. K. Khurana said Tuesday that
they would not relent until the government accepted all their
demands. Any attempt by the government to sabotage the strike by
bringing in students from the nursing schools would be resisted
tooth and nail, Khurana said.

JOHANNESBURG, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The Namibian electricity
supplier, Nampower, has secured a loan of 620 million Rand (124
million U.S. Dollars) from the European Development Bank (EDB) to
strengthen Namibia's electricity supply network.
</P>
<P>
The money will help fund a 880-million-Rand

</P>
<P>
The rest of the funding is to be raised by Nampower locally,
and the project will be completed by the year 2000, according to
SAPA.
</P>
<P>
Nampower Wednesday described the agreement with the EDB as one
of the biggest projects since Namibia's independence in 1990.
</P>
<P>
The main source of Namibian electrical power is the Ruacana
hydro-electricity station in the north. Unreliable rain patterns
and growing electricity demand will require additional supply in
the future.

<HEADLINE> China's Hainan Island, Land of Longevity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The average life span on China's
island province of Hainan is now 73.1 years, compared to a
national average of 70, thanks to a decade of health care work.
</P>
<P>
The semi-tropical island, with its coastal climate, has a good
environment that has been little affected by the island's becoming
China's fifth special economic zone 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The amount of carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and dust in the air is
much lower than the nation's standard, and the amount of forest
coverage is above 50 percent, making it one of the top three
provinces in the field.
</P>
<P>
Before China was founded in 1949, the average life span of the
poverty-ridden island was only 35 years. From 1949 to 1987, the
island's economy was backward and spending on health care was very
low, recalls one local official, who explains that, at that time,
people were threatened by diseases like malaria, cholera, and
dengue fever, and before 1987, the incidence of infectious
diseases was three times the national average.
</P>
<P>
After it was designated a province in 1988, spending on health
care began to increase and, by the end of last year, it had nearly
2,000 hospitals and clinics, and more than 30,000 doctors. In
Haikou, the provincial capital, there are 9.1 doctors per 1,000
residents.
</P>
<P>
The official says that the local government has placed priority
on infectious diseases, and set up a special research institute of
tropical diseases, and diseases that have plagued the island for
years are now under control.
</P>
<P>
An increasing number of urban residents are spending money to
use gyms and farmers in rural areas have gradually learned about
hygiene.

<HEADLINE> Mozambique: Cholera Under Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, May 6 (Xinhua) -- A Mozambican national health
official has announced that cholera is already under control in
the southern African country.
</P>
<P>
"Actually, the situation in the whole country is stable," the
Noticias newspaper Wednesday quoted Avertino Barreto, Director
Assistant of the National Health Bureau, as saying.
</P>
<P>
Barreto Tuesday pointed out that cholera has come under
control as far as the whole nation is concerned, though there are
still places where the disease is spreading.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, some makeshift clinics have been closed and the
personnel invited to act as doctors and nurses have returned to
work in their own institutions and study in the training schools.
</P>
<P>
The medical institutions and medical schools across the
country have returned normal, said Barreto.
</P>
<P>
He said that in the past two days only two persons died of
cholera in the whole country and there were only 78 cholera cases
recorded.
</P>
<P>
"Since last August when cholera broke out, there have been 767
people dying of cholera and 33,781 more suffering from the
epidemic," said Barreto.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, this does not mean that the country can
relax their effort over the disease.
</P>
<P>
Barreto reminded that great care should be taken of personal
hygiene and preventive measures should not be abandoned without
the order of the Ministry of Health.
</P>
<P>
According to him, among the patients newly infected by
cholera, 46 are living in central Zambezia Province, 27 in Fofala
Province and five in the southern Gaza Province.
</P>
<P>
So far, of the 10 provinces in Mozambique, only three in the
north have not reported any cholera cases.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Zemin Meets Members of Macao Committee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Meeting members of the Preparatory
Committee for the Macao Special Administrative Region (SAR),
President Jiang Zemin said here today that the committee's
founding indicates that preparations for Macao's return to the
motherland have entered a new stage.
</P>
<P>
The 100-member Preparatory Committee was set up Tuesday, and
the members had their first plenary meeting during the past two
days.
</P>
<P>
"Macao's return is another great matter for the Chinese nation
following Hong Kong's return to the motherland," said Jiang, also
general secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central
Committee.
</P>
<P>
China is experiencing a crucial period of development at the
turn of a new century, Jiang noted. The 15th CPC National Congress
held last fall and the First Session of the Ninth National
People's Congress held in March of this year have outlined the
country's promising prospects.
</P>
<P>
"In the new century, we will not only build our country into a
modern and strong country, but will achieve the great cause of
reunifying the motherland in the end," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the great concept of "one country, two systems"
created by Deng Xiaoping is the fundamental principle to resolve
the questions concerning Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
"The practices in Hong Kong over the past 10 months since its
return to the motherland have shown that the principle is entirely
correct," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that Macao's return will also follow the
principle of "one country, two systems" and "a high degree of
autonomy". And Macao residents will be able to manage the internal
affairs of the Macao SAR in accordance with the Basic Law of Macao
SAR.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that Macao people can administer Macao well, and
our compatriots in Macao can surely maintain Macao's social
stability and economic growth and create a more splendid future
for Macao," he said.
</P>
<P>
Macao's return will produce another good example for the
concept of "one country, two systems," and will be conducive to
resolving the Taiwan question and enventually achieving the entire
reunification of the motherland, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
The Preparatory Committee is facing an arduous workload because
Macao's return is less than 600 days away, he said, adding that he
expects the committee members to display their wisdom and the mass
of Macao residents to take an active part in contributing to the
founding of the Macao SAR on December 20, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Senior leaders Li Peng, Zhu Rongji, Li Ruihuan, Hu Jintao, Wei
Jianxing and Li Lanqing were among those present at today's
ceremony.

<HEADLINE> Jordan to Resume Commercial Flights to Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Jordan's National carrier, Royal
Jordanian (RJ), will begin resuming regular commercial flights to
Tehran, Iran, on June 15, after a hiatus of 18 years.
</P>
<P>
RJ Deputy Director General Majdi Sabri said here Wednesday that
the airlines will fly twice every week to and back from Tehran and
the flights mainly aim to serve religious tourists from Iran to
Islamic sites in Jordan, said Sabri.
</P>
<P>
The RJ has noticed that the number of Iranians coming to
Jordan to visit the sepulchers of some companions of Prophet
Mohammad increased by a large margin during the past two years, he
added.
</P>
<P>
The resumed flights will also accommodate businessmen shuttling
between the two countries, according to the official.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, no Iranian airlines declared intention to fly to
Amman in the near future, said Sabri.
</P>
<P>
Flights between capital cities of the two countries stopped 18
years ago as Iran suspended political ties with the kingdom over
Jordan's tilt over Iraq during the Iraq-Iran war (1980-1988).
</P>
<P>
The two countries resumed ties in 1991.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Signs off Apollo Hotel Ltd. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The Ugandan government has signed a
divestiture agreement with Ethiopia-based Midroc Tuesday, selling
80 percent shares in Apollo Hotel Corporation Limited.
</P>
<P>
Under the pact, Midroc shall pay 19 million U.S. Dollars for
the offered shares in stages, the Monitor newspaper reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The buyer is also required to provide a performing bond of 1.9
million U.S. Dollars within 30 months.
</P>
<P>
"'The shareholders' agreement will only be signed on
completion of actions stated above and the management of the
hotel shall remain under ITT Sheraton," a press statement
released after the signing said.
</P>
<P>
Mayanja Nkangi, the Ugandan minister of finance who signed on
behalf of the government, urged the new owner of the hotel to
provide better service to customers.
</P>
<P>
"You have taken on the very best. We do not sell property to
be distributed away but to be improved upon," he said.
</P>
<P>
In pledging his commitment to upgrading the hotel, Alfred
Ireland, Deputy General Manager of Midroc, said: "We are here to
stay. Uganda is the second country we are investing in Africa
and we hope we sustain the relationship with the government and
the business community."
</P>
<P>
Apollo Hotel Corporation owns the Sheraton Kampala Hotel, one
of the largest and best hotels in Kampala, serving as the
frequent seat for holding big regional and domestic events.
</P>
<P>
The pace of Uganda's privatization program is impressive. By
October 1997, 54 parastatals had been divested in order to meet
the target, set by President Yoweri Museveni in January 1995, of
privatizing 85 percent of parastatals by the end of 1998.
</P>
<P>
The country's acute need for financial resources to
rehabilitate the economy, coupled with its heavy indebtedness to
the World Bank and other international financial institutions,
made it necessary to restructure the parastatal sector.
</P>
<P>
Uganda's gross domestic product (GDP) was about 6 billion U.S.
Dollars in 1997 while its external debt stood at more than 3.5
billion U.S. Dollars.

<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Germany's Daimler-Benz AG confirmed
Wednesday that it has entered into talks with U.S. carmaker
Chrysler on a possible mega-merger.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued Wednesday morning, Daimler-Benz said the
merger could take the form of a share swap, with the two forming a
joint company.
</P>
<P>
However, Daimler also stressed that there was no certainty that
an agreement could be reached.
</P>
<P>
The two companies had also agreed not to disclose further
details until the merger talks were completed, Daimler said.
</P>
<P>
With the statement, Daimler was responding to a report in
Wednesday's edition of the Wall Street Journal which said that
Chrysler's directors were to discuss the estimated
35-billion-dollar merger proposal later Wednesday at a regular
board meeting. Daimler's board was also due to discuss it this
week.
</P>
<P>
The report pointed out that the two companies had made
significant progress in their talks and a decision could be
reached soon.
</P>
<P>
If a deal was done, it would be a mega-merger combining
Germany's largest industrial concern with the third largest
U.S. carmaker, which is unprecedented in strategy and size.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh's Coastline Threatened: Article </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's 720-kilometer-long
coastline is threatened with inundation, intrusion of salinity and
increased frequency of cyclones, hurricanes, unusual tidal bores
and erosion, a signed article carried by The Daily Star said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Coastal erosion is a major hazard, with which people live along
the coast have had to learn to live, the article said.
</P>
<P>
The coastal eco-system of the country consists of complex delta
of the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna river systems which carry an
estimated annual sediment load of 1.5-1.8 billion tons while
flowing through Bangladesh on their way to Bay of Bengal.
</P>
<P>
The sediment is subjected to coastal dynamic processes
generated mainly by river flow, tide and wind actions, leading to
accretion and erosion in the coastal area.
</P>
<P>
It is said that every year at least a million people are
displaced, and many of them join the ranks of the floating
population and most eventually drift to nearby towns or industrial
belts or end up in Dhaka in search of food, shelter and
employment, the article said.
</P>
<P>
Erosion and accretion are a continuous process along the
coastal belt, and studies show that prominent erosion occurs along
the wide river channels. Most of the erosion of the Bay front was
due to storm surges and wave action.
</P>
<P>
An overall seaward extension of the delta was observed, it
noted, adding on some inhabited islands, erosion is taking place
at an alarming rate. For instance, the area of Sandwip island was
1,080 square km in 1780, but now it has reduced only to 238 square
km.
</P>
<P>
Besides, a sea-level rise by one meter will inundate 17.5
percent of Bangladesh's land, it warned.
</P>
<P>
The article called on the people living along the coast to
enhance their environmental awareness of protecting the coast.
</P>
<P>
The Forest Department of the country has realized the
importance of coastal afforestation as a means for stable
formation. The department has undertaken extensive afforestation
projects in the coastal zone, it stated.
</P>
<P>
It added that the Ministry of Environment and Forest has
already started a multi-million-dollar coastal green-belt project
after the devastating cyclone and tidal surge of April 1991.

<HEADLINE> Weekly Economic Review: Banks Invest Heavily in Housing Sector (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The China Agricultural Bank
announced this week that it will channel 20 billion yuan into the
real estate sector this year, of which 10 billion yuan will be
used for individual mortgages.
</P>
<P>
The China Construction Bank has also released its plan of
offering 25 billion yuan in housing loans this year. So far, all
of China's commercial banks have designed their plans for housing
loans, with an aggregate of more than 100 billion yuan, an
increase of 72 billion yuan over last year.
</P>
<P>
To reach its target of eight percent economic growth this year,
the Chinese government has listed the housing sector as a new area
of economic growth. A new round of fundamental housing reforms
will put a full stop to the welfare housing distribution system
that has been working in China for dozens of years.
</P>
<P>
Starting this year, urban residents will no longer enjoy
low-rent public housing. Instead, they will have to buy houses in
the market with subsidies from their work units.
</P>
<P>
Financial experts believe this is the right time to initiate
the housing reform plan, which will both help solve the housing
difficulties of urban residents and also revitalize the national
economy.
</P>
<P>
However, the present average income level of China's urban
residents is still fairly low. Many people cannot afford to buy a
house on their own, so bank loans become a critical factor for the
success of housing reform.

<HEADLINE> Weekly Economic Review: Banks Invest Heavily in Housing Sector (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Reliable analysis indicates that investment in residential
housing can give a considerable push to the economy. An input of
10 billion yuan in housing construction can generate social
demands of 17-to-22 billion yuan; while a housing sales volume of
10 billion yuan can spur a consumption of 13-to-15 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Financial experts believe that, if the scheduled housing
investment is fully realized, it can contribute 1.8 percent to
this year's economic growth.
</P>
<P>
China's commercial banks began offering housing loans in the
early 1990s; now residential housing finance has become the
backbone of housing reform.
</P>
<P>
In line with related policies, the People's Bank of China
(PBOC) issued a circular last week demanding all commercial banks
to channel no less than 15 percent of their newly increased loans
to residential housing.
</P>
<P>
Institutions allowed to accept deposits and offer credit in the
housing sector have been expanded to include all state-owned
commercial banks and the Bank of Communications.
</P>
<P>
The PBOC also demanded that commercial banks give more support
to residential housing consumption.
</P>
<P>
The business climate index for real estate, released this week

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Up to 100,000 people crammed the
center of Melbourne, Australia, Wednesday protesting against the
federal government's industrial laws.
</P>
<P>
The rally was called by the Victorian Trades Hall Council
(VTHC) to protest against the federal government's Workplace
Relations Act, but later it became a massive show of solidarity
with 1,400 dock workers, who are now preparing to resume work
after the High Court decided Monday to reinstate the workers
sacked on April 7.
</P>
<P>
Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) president Jennie
George said the large turnout was the beginning of a community
campaign which would see the federal government thrown out of
office, the Australian Associated Press reported from Melbourne.
</P>
<P>
"This day will go down in a very rich history of working class
tradition," she told the protesting workers, "What happened on
Monday in the High Court was a great moral victory, but we haven't
won yet."
</P>
<P>
"This has not been a dispute about productivity. This is has
been a challenge to workers' wages and conditions, this has been a
challenge to workers' rights," she said.

HANOI, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Hotel occupancy in Ho Chi Minh city
and Hanoi dropped to 20 percent in the first quarter of this year,
Vietnam News reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In comparison, the rate a year ago was 40 to 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted a survey conducted by the Vietnam National
Administration of Tourism (VNAT) as saying that most hotels in the
two cities have seen their occupancy rates decline by 50 to 70
percent.
</P>
<P>
Many hotels have reduced their staff by 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
Some property development projects under construction have also
been stopped because foreign investors halted capital
contributions to the projects, the paper added.
</P>
<P>
In southern provinces, nine out of 24 inoperative projects have
foreign partners from countries heavily hit by the Asian financial
crisis. The rest, owned by European investors, have been
indirectly affected by the economic woes.

<HEADLINE> Vietnamese Officials Stand Trial for Smuggling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's provincial officials have
been brought to trial for smuggling goods from Cambodia, which
caused an alleged import tax lost of more than 66 billion dong
(about 6.5 million U.S. dollars) within six months, Vietnam News
Agency reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A local court Tuesday began hearing evidence in the trial of
the 15 defendants, including a former deputy chairman of a
provincial people's committee.
</P>
<P>
The hearing is scheduled to last at least six days.
</P>
<P>
The provincial police and customs officers uncovered the first
smuggling case in January 1996 during a joint inspection of a
shipment of goods from Cambodia which was worth 3.2 billion dong
(about 315,200 dollars).
</P>
<P>
The smugglers were caught red-handed, prompting officers to
launch a series of subsequent investigations, which eventually
uncovered the evidence of anther 171 shipments illegally made over
the previous five months, said the report.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the province's total import tax revenue between
August and December in 1995 was only 3.49 billion dong (about
343,800 dollars), less than five percent of the 70.33 billion dong
(about 6.93 million dollars) expected by the customs authorities,
said the report.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The Football Association of Zambia
(FAZ) has been dissovled by the country's Sports Council (SCZ)
over alleged abuse of funds, Times of Zambia reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The dicision was announced Tuesday in Ndola, 330 kilometers
north of the capital, by Lloyd Siame, chairman of SCZ's legal and
disciplinary sub-committee chairman.
</P>
<P>
The matter has been handed over to police and SCZ has furnished
FIFA, the world soccer governing body with reasons for their
action.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Siame as saying that the dicision to dissove
FAZ follows a audit report on the funding given to FAZ to prepare
the national team for the 1998 African Nations Cup (ANC) held last
February in Burkina Faso.
</P>
<P>
Siame further revealed that the FAZ constitution has also been
suspended and an interim committee will be put in place soon.
</P>
<P>
The SCZ's legal and disciplinary sub-committee has been
investigating FAZ on 2.8 billion Kwacha (about 2 million
U.S. dollars) given by the Zambian government for the Birkina Faso
tournament.
</P>
<P>
However, the investigations showed that 577 million Kwacha
(400,000 dollars) was not accounted for, while a further 212
million Kwacha (140,000 dollars) was spent on items unrelated to
the preparations for the tournament in which the Zambian team
performed disappointedly.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Bars Public Officials from Honorary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government has banned
all serving public officials from accepting awards of honorary
degrees, fellowships and other related titles from local or
foreign institutions.
</P>
<P>
The ban, according to Secretary to the Federal Government
Alhaji Gidado Idris, is to check the abuses of such honors, press
reports said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Government has observed with concern that the time-honored
practice of honoring deserving persons with honorary degrees,
diplomas, fellowships, etc., is being abused," he said in a
circular dated April 6 this year.
</P>
<P>
According to him, "the situation has deteriorated to the
extent that the established procedures for bestowing such honors
are no longer observed."
</P>
<P>
"In some cases, the intentions for giving the award appear
less than noble. It is hardly surprising that these awards no
longer command much respect."
</P>
<P>
Accordingly, serving public officials are barred from
accepting honorary degrees, fellowships, etc. from domestic or
foreign universities, polytechnics and other higher institutions.
</P>
<P>
The ban, however, does not apply to fellowships and
memberships awarded by accredited professional bodies to their
bonafide members, said the circular which was copied to key
government functionaries.
</P>
<P>
The government in September 1997 clamped a similar ban on the
acceptance of chieftaincy or traditional titles by sitting
ministers and other public officials.

<HEADLINE> Over 70 Percent of Zambian Adults Infected with </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Over 70 percent of Zambian adults
have been infected with tuberculosis and nearly one in very 200
Zambians get the disease every year, according to press releases
reaching here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Zambia Tuberculosis and Leprosy Trust (ZATULET) said in the
releases that Zambia is one of the countries in southern Africa
with the highest number of tuberculosis cases.
</P>
<P>
With a population of only 8,275,000 in 1996, the number of
detected tuberculosis cases per 100,000 stood at 448 while South
Africa with a population of 42,393,000 had a case detection rate
of 216 per 100,000. Uganda had 139 tuberculosis patients per
100,000.
</P>
<P>
At least four out every 10 adults in Zambia dying from medical
problems are due to tuberculosis, said one press release.
</P>
<P>
"Taking into account of the various constraints like the lack
of finance, government's low commitment to the program and the
low socio-economical status of our people, the problem of
tuberculosis will continue to cause havoc on the population of
our nation," ZATULET Executive Director David Mondoka said in a
release.
</P>
<P>
"Tuberculosis poses as one of the most serious health problem
of our times. It is devastating a lot of our people's lives day
in and day out," Mondaka said, adding that "many people,
especially the young of between 15 and 39 years of age are the
most affected age group according to the statistics."
</P>
<P>
ZATULET is a newly-formed non-governmental organization with
its main aim to supplement or complement government's efforts in
case-finding, diagnosing, treating, controlling and preventing
both tuberculosis and leprosy in the country.

<HEADLINE> Scientist Says Bigger Oil Fields Expected To Be Found in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 6 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese scientist said here today
that there is a great possibility that China might find big oil
fields in coming years.
</P>
<P>
Li Guangding, an academician from the Geophysics Institute of
the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said: "From east China to the
southern Beibu Gulf, there exist some 40 basins which were on the
bottom of ancient oceans and may contain abundant oil and gas."
</P>
<P>
He said that some of the potential oil fields are expected to
be larger than any of those currently in operation.
</P>
<P>
Liu announced his findings at an international symposium on
modern physics held at Beijing University. He said that previous
drilling was done mainly in continental basins where oil was
formed in rivers and lakes in the Cenozoic Era.
</P>
<P>
Some 500 million years ago, the piece of land where China is
now located was under an ocean. After the sea receded and the
continent began to emerge 200 million years ago, basins containing
oil were left.
</P>
<P>
However, according to Liu, drastic mountain-making movements
occurred afterward which distorted the shapes of the basins, and
made it difficult for scientists to find them.
</P>
<P>
"China's geological history features extreme complexity. There
have been theoretical and technological problems in our work," he
said.
</P>
<P>
But breakthroughs have been made recently, according to the
scientist. A well was drilled last year in northeast China from an
ocean-formed basin which turned out 1,000 tons of oil a day.
</P>
<P>
"More advanced geophysic methods should be applied in
researching basins left over from pre-Cenozoic time, where we have
done little work," he said.
</P>
<P>
China produced 143 million tons of land oil and 16.2 million
tons of offshore oil last year.
</P>
<P>
The rapid development of China's economy has greatly increased
oil demands. Statistics show that China imported 33.8 million
crude and refined oil last year, up 140 percent over 1996.
</P>
<P>
China has signed contracts with several countries to jointly
drill for oil in the Middle East and South America.
</P>
<P>
However, many experts said that in the coming 10 years, China
should mainly supply itself with domestic oil products.

<HEADLINE> 20,000 Ugandans Flee Homes in West </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Some 20,000 Ugandans have fled
their homes in the west in the wake of the government troops'
operations against the rebels there.
</P>
<P>
The authorities have registered 10,000 refugees in Bundibugyo
District and need urgent food supplies to support them, the New
Vision newspaper Wednesday quoted Edward Masiga, the resident
district commissioner, as saying.
</P>
<P>
The paper estimated that the number of the Ugandans fleeing
their homes might amount to 20,000.
</P>
<P>
Francis Onyai, Chief Administrative Official of the district,
confirmed that many people have fled their homes and taken refuge
in towns in the district.
</P>
<P>
The Ugandan government troops launched operations in recent
days against the rebels of the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) in
the district and inflicted casualties on the ADF rebels. And the
local residents feared the revenge from the rebels.
</P>
<P>
The World Food Program had started distributing food to the
refugees, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The Allied Democratic Forces are a rebel group active in the
west with hundreds remnants based in Rwenzori in western
districts of Kasese and Bundibugyo.
</P>
<P>
The ADF remnants earlier fled their camps in the east of the
Democratic Republic of Congo since the joint operation against
them launched by government troops of Uganda and Democratic
Congo.
</P>
<P>
Previously, ADF had some 1,500 fighters.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Comptroller's Report Ignites Religious </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The report of Israeli State
Comptroller criticizing the preferential treatment given to the
ultra-Orthodox segments of society, has ignited a storm of
protests by religious parties.
</P>
<P>
Local daily Haaretz said on Wednesday that most of the
religious leaders lashed out at the state comptroller Miriam
Ben-Porat, calling her report a "gimmick" and "disgrace".
</P>
<P>
Ben-Porat in her report issued Tuesday, noted that benefits
were given to religious and ultra-Orthodox settlements even though
they were ineligible according to the government's national
priority map, and lands were allocated to the ultra-Orthodox
without legally tenders.
</P>
<P>
The report devoted several chapters to the millions of shekels
allocated to the religious and ultra-Orthodox sectors in defiance
of official criteria for these allocations.
</P>
<P>
The primary theme of Ben-Porat report drove straight to the
heart of one of Israel's most fundamental divides, the struggle
for power between secular and ultra-Orthodox segments of society.
</P>
<P>
"Power tends to corrupt. You need great self-control to resist
temptations when power is in your hands," Ben-Porat said in the
48th annual State Comptroller's report, covering 1997.
</P>
<P>
In response, Deputy Religious Affairs Minister, Rabbi Arieh
Camliel, said Ben-Porat "had exceeded her charge and is talking
like a politician. " He said Ben Porat was using the
ultra-Orthodox public as a gimmick to draw attention to her
report.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Housing Minister Meir Porush, of the ultra-Orthodox
United Torah Judaism Party, accused by Ben-Porat of favoring his
constituents in housing projects, also said the report "fits in
well with the general onslaught against ultra-Orthodox Judaism."
</P>
<P>
Porush said he had never encountered "such an ugly and
disgraceful campaign of calumny" as the one currently being waged
against the ultra-Orthodox population.
</P>
<P>
Since Likud coalition came to power in 1996, the religious
power has been growing in the country. And in the 120-seat
Knesset (parliament), there are 23 ultra-Orthodox members, who
play an important role in formulating policy.

BEIJING, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Rainfall in the past few days has
helped ease severe drought affecting most of China, according to
the Beijing-based State Flood Control and Drought Prevention
Headquarters.
</P>
<P>
But drought is still worsening in some areas, such as the
northeastern Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, northwestern Jilin
Province, southwestern Sichuan Province and Yunnan Province,
officials in the headquarters said.
</P>
<P>
The headquarters reported that the rainfall is not only
beneficial to crops in the field, primarily wheat, but also for
planting autumn crops, according to today's Economic Daily.
</P>
<P>
However, the rainfall is only marginally helpful for planting
rice, the paper reported.
</P>
<P>
Statistics on May 4 show that the drought-affected area has
reached 2.1 million hectares. The drought has also caused drinking
water shortages for 11.5 million people and 9.8 million livestock.
</P>
<P>
The headquarters urged local governments to prepare for a
worsening situation.

TOKYO, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices plunged in Tokyo
Wednesday with the key Nikkei index closing at its lowest level
since January 14, on renewed concerns about credit risks in Japan.
</P>
<P>
The key Nikkei average of 225 selected issues on the First

<HEADLINE> Tourism Brings Hope to Poor County </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Zhangxian County, formerly one of
the poorest counties in China, has been transformed into a booming
tourism attraction.
</P>
<P>
The county town in northwest China's Gansu Province features
impressive hotels, karaoke clubs, coffee houses and boutiques
lining what were previously desolate streets.
</P>
<P>
Polite young men and women dressed in colorful clothing greet
tourists in standard Chinese. Ironically, a few years ago girls
never dared wear skirts and dirty-faced young men avoided
strangers.
</P>
<P>
Tourists are flocking to Dingxi Prefecture to view the county's
over 3,700 canyons filled with spectacular mountains, scenic
rivers, waterfalls and historic sites.
</P>
<P>
The 1992 nationwide boom in tourism encouraged local Zhangxian
officials to introduce tourism in order to eradicate poverty. The
prefecture has since hosted over 1.4 million tourists, with total
earning from tourism surpassing 25 million yuan (three million US
dollars).
</P>
<P>
Although Tourism revenues account for only a small proportion
of the local economy, the sector offers highly beneficial social
effects, according to a local official.
</P>
<P>
While 78 percent of the local population lived below the
poverty line in the early 1980s, the proportion has declined
dramatically to only 18 percent at present.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Manufacturers to Earn 100 Million Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Zambian manufacturers will earn 100
million U.S. Dollars from their exports to South Africa once the
two governments sign and ratify a non-reciprocal trade agreement
this month.
</P>
<P>
"This is a major achievement for Zambia and local exporters
will now be earning a total of 100 million dollars from their
exports to South Africa alone," Mark O'Donnell, Chairman of the
Zambia Association of Manufacturers, said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Times of Zambia newspaper Wednesday quoted O'Donnell as saying
that when Zambia signs the long-awaited non-reciprocal agreement
with South Africa, local exporters will thereafter export their
goods freely to South Africa and other member countries of the
Southern African Custom Union (SACU).
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Zambian manufacturers will export their
goods to South Africa, Botswana, Namibia, Swaziland and Lesotho
at reduced duties unlike now when they find it difficult to
export goods to SACU member countries because of high duties, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Currently, Zambian manufacturers earn less than 50 million
U.S. Dollars from their exports to South Africa because of stiff
trade barriers imposed by the SACU member countries, according to
the chairman.

<P>
ULAN BATOR, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The purchasing price for cashmere
in Mongolia has dropped in the past few days by 12.8 percent to
10,000 togrog (about 12.2 U.S. dollars) one kilogram.
</P>
<P>
In some places, the price has been as low as 9,000 togrog
(about 11 dollars).
</P>
<P>
The price was 11,500 togrog (about 14 dollars) a kilogram a
month ago when the new marketing season just began, news reports
said.
</P>
<P>
The drop was mainly due to higher export duties imposed by the
government last year to limit export.
</P>
<P>
As a result, exporters have to lower their purchasing prices to
make a profit.
</P>
<P>
Mongolia, the second largest cashmere exporter in the world,
has a 25 percent share of the international market. The country is
expected to produce more than 3,000 tons this year.

To date, nobody in the village has a similar reaction if
someone plans to borrow from the bank because Goinjue has become a
millionaire.
</P>
<P>
To Tibetans, bank loans used to be considered more horrible
than ghosts and as a last resort in extreme poverty. Until the
1980s banks in the suburbs of Lhasa, capital of the Tibet
Autonomous Region, found it very difficult to find prospective
borrowers.
</P>
<P>
And, among the limited amounts of bank loans, more than 70
percent of them were used for daily necessities instead of
business transactions.
</P>
<P>
With the implementation of a series of aid-the-poor projects
and the renouncement of Tibetans' outdated concepts, a growing
number of Tibetans have become prosperous by borrowing to set up
their own businesses.
</P>
<P>
Danzim, a farmer in Qiumu village of Namling County, borrowed
5,000 yuan from the bank to start his own flour mill three years
ago. The mill now brings 20,000 yuan of annual income for his
family.
</P>
<P>
Dawa Cering and Zhaxi Jangyang, two brothers in Gurong Village
of Doilungdeqen County, borrowed 110,000 yuan from the bank in
1993. They used the loan to set up their own business producing a
sort of glutinous rice cake that is used to supply to the Potala
Palace.
</P>
<P>
The glutinous rice cakes not only sell well in China, but have
now entered the markets of India and Nepal, earning the brothers
more than 200,000 yuan of net income last year.

<P>
The two brothers have paid back their loans, purchased flats in
Lhasa, and bought a brand-now Dongfeng Brand truck.
</P>
<P>
"The changes are really great," sighed president of the
Agriculture Bank in Doilungdeqen County.
</P>
<P>
"I used to travel to every corner of the county to look for
potential borrowers and often ended in vain, " he said.
</P>
<P>
"Nowadays, I just sit in my office, and wait for the farmers
who come to me one after another and, more importantly, they
borrow funds to start a business instead of to purchase daily
necessities."
</P>
<P>
As the Tibetan farmers and herdsmen develop a deeper
understanding of loans, the total amount borrowed by Tibetans has
been on the rise for several years.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the farmers and herdsmen of the
autonomous region had borrowed 427 million yuan in 1997, which
means that the amount of loan for each person is higher than the
national average.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the average bank deposit of Tibet's farmers and
herdsmen has climbed to 184 yuan, double the figure in the early
1990s.
</P>
<P>
"We have the obligation to deposit our surplus money into the
bank, which will help more people out of poverty," said Cering
Bandian of Nedong County in Shannan Prefecture, "as we are the
direct beneficiaries of the bank loans."

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The industrial sector of Shanghai,
the biggest city in China, has made progress in reducing
pollutants while maintaining sustainable development.
</P>
<P>
The city has closed or relocated more than 1,000 polluting
enterprises in its urban areas in the past decade, eliminating
300 polluting sources and clearing an urban ground space
of 3.75 million square kilometers.
</P>
<P>
The city's industrial structure has also become more rational
through reducing the ratio of seriously polluting industries and
developing high-tech ones. The city has formed six pillar
industries headed by auto manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
About 30 billion yuan (3.7 billion U.S. dollars) has been spent
annually on renovating industrial technology and pollution
control, which resulted in a sharp decrease of discharged
pollutants.
</P>
<P>
The discharge of waste water per 100 million yuan of industrial
output valaue has been reduced from 485,000 tons to 178,000 tons;
waste gas, from 172 million cubic meters to 92 million cubic
meters; and solid waste, from 51,000 tons to 24,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
The city has also invested two billion yuan annually in recent
years in treating old polluting enterprises.

CHONGQING, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Chongqing, metropolis in southwest
China, plans to start building 10 million sq m of residential
houses this year, as a move to develop the real estate industry
into one of the city's economic growth areas.
</P>
<P>
The city will complete construction of 5.8 million sq m of
housing this year, nearly twice the average during the Eighth
Five-Year Plan period (1991-1995).
</P>
<P>
The per capita housing space of Chongqing residents will
increase to nine sq m after the completion of the new scheme.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chongqing residents will find it much easier to
apply for bank mortgage loans to purchase houses, since local
commercial banks have set aside 400 million to 600 million yuan of
housing loan, in addition to the 50 million yuan in loans provided
by the city's housing fund administration center.
</P>
<P>
Starting from July 1, 1998, local residents will be able to
sell their houses freely on the market.

<HEADLINE> China's Large-scale Power Grids To Be Connected by 2020 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Almost all of China's power grids
will be connected before 2020 to make power exchanges possible
nationwide, a senior official said here today.
</P>
<P>
The fast-growing economy has brought a new stage in power
development characterized by large capacity and large grids, said
Huo Ji'an, deputy general manager of the State Power Grid
Development Co. Ltd., and that China has six large grids and a
group of provincial ones with 567,000 kilometers (km) of
transmission lines.
</P>
<P>
He said the Three Gorges Power Station will allow for the
connection of power grids nationwide. The station will provide
power for areas in central and north China, and Sichuan grids, and
help form the Great Central China Power Grid spanning a distance
of 2,000 km from east to west. The grid will still serve as a link
to the grids in north, northwest and south China.
</P>
<P>
By 2000, the framework of various inter-provincial grids will
take shape, involving perfection of the 500 kilovolt (kv) and 330
kv grids.
</P>
<P>
Huo said that the Three Gorges Power Station will be completed
by 2009, and a 500 kv project ranging from there to the power
grids in central and north China, and Sichuan Province will be
established with 9,100 km of DC and AC transmission lines.
</P>
<P>
Thermal power-production bases in Shanxi, Shaanxi and Jiangxi
provinces will ensure large power supplies for Beijing, Tianjin,
Tangshan, Baoding and other cities in northeast China, he said.

<HEADLINE> PNA Denies Arafat's Remarks on Abu Dis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) has denied a report that President Yasser Arafat had
accepted Abu Dis on Jerusalem's suburb as capital of the future
Palestinian state, the Hebrew-language Haaretz daily reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In its front-page story Tuesday, Haaretz reported that Arafat
told a delegation from the New York-based Council of Foreign
Relations that the 1996 Beilin-Abu Mazen and Beilin-Eitan
agreements were realistic foundations for a final settlement with
Israel.
</P>
<P>
Asked if an agreement could be reached on the sensitive issue
of Jerusalem, Arafat was quoted as replying: "Certainly, the idea
of Abu Dis, which belonged to Al Quds (Jerusalem) under Jordanian
control, is acceptable."
</P>
<P>
But PNA Cabinet Secretary Ahmed Abdel Rahman said the report
was untrue. He said that Arafat told the delegation that East
Jerusalem is occupied territory and an integral part of the rest
of the Palestinian territories.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian National Council has resolved that Jerusalem
will be the capital of an independent Palestinian state and the
United Nations Resolution 242 calling for Israeli pullout from
occupied territories also refers to East Jerusalem, Rahman said.
</P>
<P>
However, Haaretz repeated that one of participants in the
meeting said on condition of anonymity that Arafat had in fact
spoken about setting up the Palestinian capital in Abu Dis.
</P>
<P>
Henry Siegman, head of the American delegation, told the
English-language daily The Jerusalem Post that Arafat said "there
are several plans for the resolution of the problem of Jerusalem
that can serve as an acceptable basis for discussion."
</P>
<P>
He even confirmed that Arafat singled out the Beilin-Abu Mazen
plan as one such promising proposal and indicated that the idea of
Abu Dis serve as a Palestinian capital is one of several worth of
consideration.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that according to the plan formulated by
Israel's Labor lawmaker Yossi Beilin and Arafat's deputy Abu Mazen
in 1996, the future capital of a Palestinian state will be set up
in Abu Dis in East Jerusalem's suburb. Most settlements under
Israeli control will remain, whereas settlers living in highly
populated Palestinian areas could live in the Palestinian state or
move to Israeli territories.
</P>
<P>
Jerusalem is the most sensitive issue that should be solved in
the final-status talks under the Oslo accords. Israel has vowed
not to relinquish its sovereign control over the whole Jerusalem,
while the Palestinian side hopes to establish a state with East
Jerusalem as the capital.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Trade Increases in Eastern Chinese Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Although it too was affected by the
Southeast Asian financial crisis, east China's Shandong Province
has nonetheless had some slight growth in foreign trade in the
first quarter of the year.
</P>
<P>
Foreign trade was worth 4.38 billion US dollars during the
period, up 2.9 percent on a year-on-year basis.
</P>
<P>
Imports amounted to 1.88 billion US dollars, up 0.6 percent,
and exports, 2.5 billion US dollars, up 4.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
Because six of the province's major trade partners, including
the Republic of Korea and Japan, were affected by the financial
crisis, exports to these countries were down 9 percent.
</P>
<P>
Machinery, garments, textiles, and shoes still account for most
of the goods traded.

GUANGZHOU, May 6 (Xinhua) -- South China's Guangdong Province
is giving an impetus to the growth of large and medium-sized
township enterprises, which have developed rapidly in recent years
in the province.
</P>
<P>
The province has now established 350 township enterprise groups
by merging major township enterprises. Thirtytwo of them have been
approved by the Ministry of Agriculture as "China's major township
enterprise groups."
</P>
<P>
Guangdong now has 369 township enterprises each with annual
business revenues of more than 100 million yuan. The Kelon
Electrical Appliance Co. Ltd. in Shunde City, for instance, has
annual business revenues of 5.57 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Shantou City set a goal of developing large township
enterprises, brand-name products and pillar industries. As a
result, 58 township enterprises were approved by the Ministry of
Agriculture as large or medium-sized enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that the appearance of large township enterprise
groups signifies an overall development of the township
enterprises in Guangdong and that the next phase will focus on
the improvement of product quality.

<HEADLINE> 1 Israeli Stabbed to Death In East Jerusalem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 6 (Xinhua) -- An Israeli was stabbed to death
early Wednesday morning in Arab East Jerusalem, Israeli police
said.
</P>
<P>
The incident came as the Israeli and Palestinians remained
locked in the dispute over the scope of further Israeli troop
redeployment in the West Bank after the failure of the London
meetings Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Israeli military reinforcements were brought up to the area
following the incident while dozens of Palestinian young people
were rounded up near the Damascus Gate of the Old City by Israeli
security forces.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli police have not identified the victim, but said
efforts would be made to find out the killer.
</P>
<P>
This was the second killing occurred in East Jerusalem so far
this year. A 30-year-old Jewish student was stabbed to death in
February when he was on his way to a synagogue in the Ramat Shilmo
neighborhood in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Last November, a Jewish student was shot to death in the Muslim
quarter of the Old City. Since then, Israel has beefed up police
presence and set up more police stations there.
</P>
<P>
East Jerusalem has been at the center of Israeli-Palestinian
disputes as Israel claims its sovereign control over the whole
city, while the palestinians want it as the capital of their
future Palestinian State.

<HEADLINE> Fruit Growers Cutting Down Thousands of Bad Quality Date Saplings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Fruit growers in the city of Leling
in east China's Shandong Province had destroyed 200,000 Chinese
date saplings by the end of March because they were no good.
</P>
<P>
The small Chinese date, or jujube, has sold well for years,
even when sales of other jujubes were down, with a kilogram of
small Chinese dates going for more than 10 yuan (1.2 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
In Leling, the hometown of jujubes, the trees are referred to
as "money trees" by farmers, and since 1995, it has been common
for a farmer here to earn 30,000-40,000 yuan a year from the fruit.
</P>
<P>
But, during a planting spree, some farmers paid less attention
to the quality of saplings than to the price and ended up eating
the bad fruit they had planted themselves after one bad harvest
last year.
</P>
<P>
Hu Panhe, a farmer of the village of Zhangtiechui, was quoted
by People's Daily as saying that the jujubes from his 25 bad
saplings last year were still in piles even though the price had
dropped to 3 yuan per kg. And not a single one of his "money
trees" dropped any money on him.
</P>
<P>
The recent inferior sapling cutting campaign was organized by
the city government. The local sapling growers association is
supporting the move by providing a better strain of saplings to
farmers at 80 percent of the cost.
</P>
<P>
Market analysts explain that better saplings are the only way
to avoid stagnant fruit sales, because quality is more important
than quantity on today's agricultural produce market.

<P>
YANGON, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar Wednesday dismissed as a myth
the allegation by Indian Defense Minister George Fernandes that
China was using a Myanmar island for defense purpose.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Myanmar government, Lieutenant-Colonel Hla
Min, said it is "very regretful" that the Indian defense minister
chose to make a claim without substantial evidence.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar had been a staunch non-aligned nation throughout the
Cold War era and continues to faithfully pursue the same policy of
being "a friend of all nations but an ally of none," the spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
He said, "Myanmar has been unfairly dragged into the complex
scene and a myth has been unprecedentedly created to serve as a
pretext for international and domestic relish of scenario in an
attempt to justify the nuclear and defense build-up in the
region."

<HEADLINE> Tourism Blooms in Northwest China's Autonomous Region </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Northwestern China's Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region is expected to receive 200,000 overseas tourists
and six million domestic tourists this year.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, Xinjiang had an annual increase of 69 percent in the
number of overseas tourists, much higher than the country's
average of 22 percent.
</P>
<P>
Abul'ahat Abdurixit, chairman of Xinjiang, said the regional
government now plans to attract more tourists to this region,
which occupies one-sixth of China's total area.
</P>
<P>
Besides pillar industries such as petroleum and cotton, he
said, tourism is expected to become a new economic growth area for
the region.
</P>
<P>
Starting in 1978, tourism earned 46,000 U.S. dollars of foreign
currency for Xinjiang. Overseas tourists spent over 70 million
U.S. dollars in Xinjiang in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The chairman said he was confident in the region's tourism
potential, which comes from the abundant resources and steady
development of infrastructure facilities.
</P>
<P>
Situated in the middle of the "Silk Road," Xinjiang used to be
an important area for economic and cultural exchanges between the
West and the East.
</P>
<P>
To develop tourism, Xinjiang extended telephone lines from
urban to rural areas, and constructed a high-rated road connecting
the tourism cities of Urumqi and Turpan, which will be in
operation before August.

<P>
FUZHOU, May 6 (Xinhua) -- East China's Fujian Province has made
great efforts to strengthen infrastructure construction and
improve investment environment in recent years.
</P>
<P>
An official from the provincial government said that, in the
1979-1997 period, Fujian province completed 425 billion yuan of
fixed assets investment, with 118 billion yuan in infrastructure
facilities.
</P>
<P>
The 1992-1997 period was the prime period for infrastructure
construction in Fujian, with investment of 79.1 billion yuan,
accounting for 55 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
Fujian Province constructed and reconstructed a series of major
projects for water supply, electricity, railways and
airports. After years of effort, the province has had rapid
increases in transportation and handling capacity of ports.
</P>
<P>
The province has four civil airports including the two
international airports of Xiamen Changqi and Fuzhou Changle.
</P>
<P>
The first expressway in Fujian (Quanzhou-Xiamen) was in
operation in December of 1997, followed by the Xiamen-Zhangzhou
expressway. The Fuzhou-Quanzhou expressway is under construction.
</P>
<P>
With the operation of several large thermal power plants and
hydro-power plants, Fujian Province is no longer short of
electricity.

<HEADLINE> China Looking At New Railway Construction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANCHANG, May 6 (Xinhua) -- China is considering building a new
railway as part of an east-west artery in the southern part of the
country.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary work on the railway, from Longyan in Fujian
Province to Ganzhou in Jiangxi Province and to Shaoguan in
Guangdong Province is now underway.
</P>
<P>
The 488-km railway would link up with the Yingtan-Xiamen
railway and Nanning-Kunming railway, cutting the distance from
coastal parts of Fujian to southern and central China by some 344
km.
</P>
<P>
The railway department had, in fact, already included the
project on its construction scheme as early as the 1950s, but a
lack of funds put a halt to construction.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say that more than two million people who live along
the proposed route will benefit from the projected railway.

JAKARTA, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government will
provide special scholarships to more than 400,000 cash-strapped
university students nationwide to help them continue their

</P>
<P>
The National Development Planning Board will provide at least

<HEADLINE> China's Township Firms Getting More Funds For Technology </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, May 6 (Xinhua) -- A hundred million yuan for technical
improvements is expected to help the Luli Group Co., a plywood
manufacturer in the city of Shouguang in east China's Shandong
Province, to become a major power in that business.
</P>
<P>
The company can now produce 1.2 billion cu.m. of plywood a year.
</P>
<P>
Shandong is the home of the second most powerful group of
township level enterprises in the country, with total asset valued
at 160 billion yuan. But, their products have not been very
competitive because of the backwardness of the production
facilities and the lack of technology.
</P>
<P>
Since 1993, the provincial government has said that technical
improvements in township firms should come before new factories,
and since that time, 40 million yuan has been allocated annually
for technology to get the firms to compete with state enterprises
on an equal footing.
</P>
<P>
Last year, 20 billion yuan was spent on 9,600 technical
improvement projects, which are expected to generate 70 billion
yuan worth of goods and 9.5 billion yuan in pre-tax profits.
</P>
<P>
Investment priority has been given to the machinery, chemical,
and building industries, and 36 key improvement projects have used
1.05 billion yuan since 1993.

<HEADLINE> Number of HIV/AIDS Patients in China Continues to Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 6 (Xinhua) -- China had 9,970 people infected with
the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) on record at the end of
March, 290 of which had fully developed acquired immune deficiency
syndrome (AIDS) and 173 others had died.
</P>
<P>
The official figures, released by the Ministry of Health
(MOH) on Tuesday, represent a small rise from the figures for
last October, when there were 8,303 HIV carriers.
</P>
<P>
AIDS experts have estimated that between 200,000 and 250,000
Chinese were in fact infected by the virus at the end of 1997,
compared with 150,000 to 200,000 in 1996. They have warned that
any failure to act promptly could result in an increase to one
million by early next century.
</P>
<P>
Intravenous drug use remains the leading cause of HIV
infections in China, with other cases resulting from sexual
activities and contaminated blood. There are also instances of
infants being infected, the MOH reports.
</P>
<P>
"The increase in the number of HIV cases related to intravenous
drug use and sexual contacts indicates a critical HIV epidemic in
China," said Sun Longchun, vice-minister of the MOH.
</P>
<P>
He told an awards giving ceremony for an essay contest on "AIDS
and Adolescents" in Beijing that China needs a larger publicity
campaign to provide information about HIV/AIDS for the Chinese,
especially youngsters. The Ministry of Education has got some 600
essays and posters on the subject from middle school students and
their teachers from across China in the past four months.
</P>
<P>
"We've learned from the participants' works that a great number of
youngsters still know little about HIV/AIDS. Promoting health
awareness among them is an urgent matter," Sun said.
</P>
<P>
Ten percent of those Chinese infected with the HIV is under the
age of 19, and most of them are victims of intravenous drug use.
</P>
<P>
According to a national questionnaire in 1997, 60 percent of
adolescents in China knew nothing about the basic knowledge of
HIV/AIDS, and 21 percent about HIV/AIDS prevention.
</P>
<P>
The awards giving ceremony was attended by Peng Peiyun,
vice-chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's
Congress, and Dr. Peter Piot, Executive Director of the Joint
United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS, who is in China on
business.

<HEADLINE> China Encouraging Non-state Enterprise Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The non-state economic sector in
China is getting stronger support from the central government as
it plays an increasingly important role in economic growth and
employment.
</P>
<P>
When President Jiang Zemin's recent visit to township
enterprises in the eastern province of Jiangsu signalled greater
government support for the sector, the People's Bank, China's
central bank, announced that financial institutions would increase
credit for medium-sized and small businesses.
</P>
<P>
The sector includes township enterprises, private businesses,
urban collective enterprises, and cooperative companies that issue
stock and have no state capital. Of these, the private sector
alone contributes 30 percent to the total industrial output and
employs more than 13 million workers.
</P>
<P>
By now, two decades of reforms and development have put the
sector in a position where it matches the state-owned economy, and
the central government is encouraging private and township
enterprises to buy into small and medium-sized state firms.
</P>
<P>
Some provinces are going even further than this. Shandong
Province in east China, for example, has adopted some policies
that allow government functionaries to develop private
businesses. And Henan and Shaanxi provinces are also poised to
change the ownership of small and medium-sized state businesses,
while trying to protect their interests.

DHAKA, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has
offered a 43-million-U.S.-dollar package investment for upgrading
Bangladesh's two seaports, the independent Associated Press of
Bangladesh (APB) reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The ADB set a precondition for the funds that all operational
sides inside jetties and outer anchorage be privatized to reap
maximum benefit from the parts, ADB officials were quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The ADB-appointed Mott Macdonal Ltd. and Associates had
prepared a report on "Bangladesh Port Upgrading Project" and
completed a draft final report which had been handed over to
Chittagong Port Authority (CPA) a few days ago, APB noted.
</P>
<P>
A preliminary economic analysis has been carried out and a
detailed economic and financial analysis will be soon submitted
with the final report.
</P>
<P>
The donor stressed full privatization of port operations such
as container handling, onshore and offshore activities for greater
productivity, breaking the chain of persisting irregularities
which nearly crippled the port, the report said, adding the CPA
expressed its soft reaction and reservation to the issue as it was
considered most sensational by trade unions.
</P>
<P>
Such steps might trigger major labor unrest and even cause
collapse of port activity, CPA officials warned, adding partial
privatization in some sectors excepting existing function by CPA
could be allowed and reasonable if the government agreed to in
principle.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh's major seaport of Chittagong had been facing
serious problems like equipment and space shortage, APB pointed
out.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, trade unions active in Chittagong Port
strongly oppose any privatization attempt, it added.

To increase the pace of housing reforms, local banks have also
signed agreements with more than 300 real estate developers to
provide 200 million yuan for mortgages.

BEIJING, May 6 (Xinhua) -- China's Minister of Foreign Trade
and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC) Shi Guangsheng said that China
is willing to join hands with Spain to achieve a trade balance
between the two countries and is eyeing the comprehensive
development of bilateral trade ties.
</P>
<P>
Shi made the remarks in today's meeting with Spain's Foreign
Minister, Abel Matutes.
</P>
<P>
Shi said that China and Spain have smoothly developed
cooperation in various fields since the two nations forged
diplomatic ties 25 years ago.

<P>
Spain is an important trading partner of China, Shi added.
</P>
<P>
Spain's participation in China's economic construction is
welcome, Shi said, and he hopes the European country will win a
broad market in China.
</P>
<P>
China wants to jointly develop international markets such as
Latin America along with Spain, Shi stressed, adding that this

also serve Sino-Spanish economic and trade cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Matutes said that Spain and China enjoy sound political ties
and broad potential for economic and trade relations.
</P>
<P>
The Spanish government encourages its enterpreneurs to invest

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Parliament Passes Bills on CHT </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi parliament has passed
three bills on the country's southeastern Chittagong Hill Tracts
(CHT), which are reportedly aimed at giving legal effect to a
peace accord between the government and hill tribals.
</P>
<P>
The Bandarban Hill District Local Government Council
(Amendment) Bill was passed by the Jatiya Sangsad on Tuesday
night, despite strong opposition from the opposition Jatiya Party
and absence of MPs from the major opposition Bangladesh
Nationalist Party since Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The parliament passed two similar bills on Sunday and Monday
respectively on Rangamati and Khagrachhari, the other two
districts of the hill tracts, which account for nearly 10 percent
of the country's total area of about 148,000 square kilometers and
less than 1 percent of its population of about 127 million.
</P>
<P>
The opposition have fiercely attacked the treaty since it was
signed last December, accusing the treaty of "violating" the
country's constitution.
</P>
<P>
The treaty was designed to end the decades-long armed conflict
in the hill tracts.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Customs Returns Ancient Chinese Artifacts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 5 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Customs Tuesday returned
some four dozen Chinese antiquities to China in compliance with a
relevant U.N. convention.
</P>
<P>
A ceremony was held at the Chinese Embassy at which 47
artifacts seized by the U.S. Customs Service in Tampa last July
were brought back to their rightful owner.
</P>
<P>
The antiquities are believed to date back to the Han, Tang and
Ming Dynasties covering the years from 206 B.C. to 1644 A.D. U.S.
experts in this field estimate that they have a wholesale of about
23,000 U.S. dollars, but their market prices are said to be over
10,000 dollars each.
</P>
<P>
The artifacts, ceramic articles removed from Chinese burial
sites, were presented to Chinese Ambassador Li Zhaoxing by Acting
Customs Commissioner Sam Banks at a spacious hall where 27 of the
returned pieces were put on display.
</P>
<P>
When Banks handed over the relevant documents to Ambassador Li,
officials from both sides gave applause to endorse the cooperation
in preventing smuggling Chinese cultural property to the United
States.
</P>
<P>
The artifacts were seized when a Customs inspector, suspicious
of goods labeled as Chinese antiquities, examined the shipment and
discovered 47 antiquities, all without the requisite Chinese
licenses for the legal export of cultural artifacts.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Customs authority informed the Chinese Embassy of the
seizure, and arrangements were made for the return of the
artifacts.
</P>
<P>
Sources from both sides confirmed that it was the first time
the U.S. Customs returned antiquities to China, but it was not the
first time the U.S. Customs seized Chinese artifacts in Tampa
and Seattle. Several shipments were turned back to the ports of
departure.
</P>
<P>
China and the United States are signatories to the 1970 UNESCO
Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit
Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the ceremony, Banks said, "The people of China have
a very rich and very old cultural heritage and Customs is proud to
have played a role in helping to preserve it."
</P>
<P>
The acting commissioner added that customs of the United States
and China enjoy very close cooperation in this field.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Li in his turn expressed deep appreciation to the
U.S. Customs Services in Tampa, Florida, for its prompt seizure of
the Chinese artifacts at the request of the Chinese Embassy and
for its hard work in the technical appraisal of so many pieces of
heavy objects.
</P>
<P>
"I would also like to express the same deep appreciation to the
headquarters of the U.S. Customs Service in Washington, DC, for
its decision to return these precious artifacts to their rightful
owner," Li added.
</P>
<P>
He described the Sino-U.S. cooperation in preventing Chinese
cultural property from being illegally brought into the U.S. as
"gratifying and effective."
</P>
<P>
The Chinese ambassador disclosed that partially as a follow-up
to this friendly gesture, the State Bureau of Cultural Relics of
China and the U.S. Embassy in Beijing have started consultations
for a bilateral agreement based on the 1970 UNESCO Convention.
</P>
<P>
"With all these, we have every reason to expect a strengthened
cooperation in the implementation of the UNESCO Convention between
our two countries," Ambassador Li said.
</P>
<P>
Li presented to Banks a miniature copy of an ancient Chinese
bronze cooking vessel called "Ding" in Chinese, which, he said,
"symbolizes not only stability but also friendship."

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Launch Job Creation Schemes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesia government is set to
launch the second phase of labor-intensive projects in mid-May at
a cost of 1 trillion rupiah (125 million U.S. dollars) to help
create jobs, a senior official said.
</P>
<P>
"This program will get under way on May 18 in all provinces,"
Manpower Minister Theo L. Sambuaga said here Tuesday. The first
phase of labor-intensive projects was launched between January and
March this year at a cost of 6.2 billion rupiah (775,000 dollars).
</P>
<P>
The second phase of the projects will target both skilled and
unskilled workers who have become unemployed as a result of the
economic crisis and the prolonged drought, local leading
newspapers Wednesday quoted the minister as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said 116,000 unskilled workers in rural and urban areas of
215 districts and municipalities will gain daily employment
through a nationwide program of 598 billion rupiah (74.8 million
dollars).
</P>
<P>
They will be hired to work in a range of projects, including
the renovation of traditional markets, roadwork and irrigation
development.
</P>
<P>
They will also be placed to work in the fisheries, agriculture
and commerce sectors.
</P>
<P>
For skilled workers laid off from their jobs, the government
has allocated 399 billion rupiah (about 50 million dollars) to
fund the creation of 65,000 job opportunities in 18 provinces, the
minister said.
</P>
<P>
Skilled workers will be employed as business consultants,
technicians, managers, operations facilitators or administrative
staff at productive business institutions, such as social
cooperatives.
</P>
<P>
Official sources said the number of unemployed people in
Indonesia has reached 9 million and is estimated to increase to 13
million by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia has been hit by the regional monetary crisis and its
economy is expected to contract by 5 percent this year.

<P>
WASHINGTON, May 5 (Xinhua) -- United States Defense Secretary
William Cohen and U.S. military leaders are urging Congress to
repeal a law on the use of anti-personnel land mines, the Pentagon
said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The law bans U.S. use of land mines for one year, starting from
February 1999.
</P>
<P>
Cohen and the Joint Chiefs of Staff asked Congress in a letter
to repeal the law which was passed and signed by U.S. President
Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Defense Department spokesman Ken Bacon told reporters that the
U.S. military needed more time to develop alternatives to land
mines.
</P>
<P>
He said the military would have to add thousands of troops and
hundreds of tanks and other weaponry in a potential conflict
situation to make up for any lack of mines.
</P>
<P>
Clinton refused to sign an international agreement against land
mines in Ottawa last year, claiming that the U.S. military needed
"an adequate transition period to seek out alternatives to
anti-personnel land mines," Bacon said.

<HEADLINE> Bangkok Residents to Hand in Rat Tails for Money </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Bangkok residents will be given a
new way to earn money as the city authorities are considering an
economical way to rid the city of rats.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper The Nation reported Wednesday that the Bangkok
metropolitan administration is considering encouraging residents
to catch rats and sell their tails to the local government, which
would save millions of baht to be required for hiring a private
company.
</P>
<P>
The project, if approved, will be implemented as soon as
possible, an adviser to the Bangkok governor said.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that apart from the 6 million human residents,
there are 50 million rats living in Bangkok's 1,500 square
kilometers of areas.
</P>
<P>
The figure came from a Hungarian company which conducted a
survey of rats in the Thai capital.
</P>
<P>
The company has proposed to eliminate the rodents at a cost of
about 300 million baht (7.89 million U.S. dollars), the adviser
said.
</P>
<P>
However, the price was considered too high with the country
facing an economic downturn and so the city authorities came up
with the short-term rat tails-for-money project.
</P>
<P>
"This project will be short-term as the problem of rats-borne
disease should be tackled as soon as possible," the adviser said.
</P>
<P>
It would also help jobless people earn money since it would not
be too costly to implement, he added.

<HEADLINE> PLA Chief of Staff Stresses China's Defensive Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, May 5 (Xinhua) -- China's national defense policy is of
a totally defensive nature with no intent at hegemony, aggression
or expansion, a visiting top Chinese military official said here
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Fu Quanyou, chief of the general staff of the Chinese People's
Liberation Army (PLA) and member of China's Central Military
Commission, made the remark at a meeting with Inspector-General of
the Austrian Federal Army Karl Majcen.
</P>
<P>
While implementing a strategy of active defense, China does not
seek military alliances with any country. Nor does it station any
troops abroad or establish overseas military bases, said Fu.
</P>
<P>
He said the PLA's mission is to strengthen the national
defense, fend off aggression, safeguard territorial sovereignty
and the rights and interests of territorial waters, and maintain
national integrity and safety.
</P>
<P>
China's national defense and military construction are
subordinate to the country's economic development, with servicemen
supporting and taking an active part in economic construction,
especially in rushing aid and relief to emergencies and
disaster-hit areas, Fu said.
</P>
<P>
On military relations between China and Austria, Fu and Majcen
agreed that the two armed forces should increase multi-level and
multi-area exchange and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Fu arrived in Vienna on Monday for a four-day visit to
Austria. He had talks with Austrian Defense Minister Werner
Fasslabend on his arrival.
</P>
<P>
Austria is the second stop on Fu's four-leg tour which has
already taken him to India. He will next visit the Czech Republic
and Spain.

<HEADLINE> Southern Chinese Trade Giant Avoids Regional Financial Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, May 6 (Xinhua) -- China's Guangdong Province, a
major source of foreign trade, managed to avoid the Asian
financial crisis and maintained foreign trade growth in the first
few months of this year.
</P>
<P>
Its imports and exports were worth 29.3 billion US dollars in
the first quarter, a year-on-year rise of 16.2 percent. Exports
were worth 17.6 billion US dollars, a 20 percent increase, and
imports, 11.72 billion US dollars, a 10.7 percent increase, both
figures above the national average.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong is China's number one foreign trader and accounts for
40 percent of the country's trade. Market analysts here say that
its growth indicates that the Asian financial crisis has had no
serious effect here, but add that they need to keep their thinking
clear and work out ways to deal with any eventualities.
</P>
<P>
They say that sound economic growth in Guangdong's major
trading partners like Hong Kong, Taiwan, the United States, and
the EU has helped guarantee trade growth. But, diverse products,
product quality, and high-tech products are also important.
</P>
<P>
Manufactured goods account for as much as 94 percent of
Guangdong's exports, and more than 300 items are worth 10 million
US dollars each. Most of these are labor-intensive and
low-value-added products, however, so it is important for
Guangdong to improve its technology and create more name-brand
products, experts say.
</P>
<P>
They suggest that Guangdong keep up with international trend in
high-tech development and take advantage of the stability of the
renminbi to direct foreign capital into the capital-intensive,
high-tech enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Because China's general tariff level has dropped to around 17
percent and may go down still more, Guangdong could have certain
advantages in foreign trade, they say. Foreign trade is expected
to grow by 10 percent in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Head of Pope's Guards Killed by Fellow Soldier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, May 5 (Xinhua) -- The new commander of the Swiss Guards
for Pope John Paul II was shot to death by a young fellow soldier,
the Vatican's chief spokesman Joaquin Navarro-Valls said on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Commandant Alois Estermann, a 43-year-old Swiss national, was
found dead with his wife in their home on Monday evening.
</P>
<P>
He had been appointed just 10 hours earlier to head the elite
100-member guards that has protected successive popes for nearly
500 years.
</P>
<P>
The gunman was vice-corporal Cedric Tornay, 23. He shot the
couple and then himself with his duty-issue pistol, Navarro-Valls
told reporters in a press conference.
</P>
<P>
Tornay had stayed away one whole night from the barracks in
February and was given a written warning by Estermann, who was
then deputy commandant of the Swiss Guard.
</P>
<P>
The vice-corporal was also left off a list of Swiss Guards to
be honored by the Pope in a ceremony scheduled for Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"It was a fit of madness in a person with very peculiar
psychological characteristics," Navarro-Valls said.
</P>
<P>
It is reportedly also the first violent death at the Vatican in
living memory.
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1506, the Swiss Guards are the world's smallest army
and one of the most colorful.
</P>
<P>
On May 6, 1527, 147 of them were killed in St. Peter's Square
protecting Pope Clement VII during the sack of Rome by the forces
of Emperor Charles V.
</P>
<P>
From then on, the Popes have preferred to have only the Swiss
nationals only to guard the Vatican.

<HEADLINE> China Searching For 700-Year-Old Sea Battle Remains </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Chinese underwater archaeologists
are going to start looking for any remains of more than 1,000
warships of the Southern Song Dynasty (1127-1279) that were sunk
by Kublai Khan's army some 700 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The search will take place in Yinzhou Lake, in the city of
Xinhui in Guangdong Province, in the southern part of China. The
lake was part of the Yamen Sea where the epic battle between the
Yuan Dynasty (1271-1368) and Southern Song took place in 1279.
</P>
<P>
"Searching for the wreckage will be part of our work for the
next decade," says Zhang Wei, the director of the underwater
archaeology department of Beijing's National Museum of Chinese
History.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhang, Chinese archaeologists have been
cooperating with oceanographers to determine the location of the
sunken ships in the lake and have taken a piece of wood from a
ship in one of the locations and have found that it dates back to
the time of the battle.
</P>
<P>
According to historical records, the Mongols, led by Kublai
Khan, invaded China and drove the imperial court of the Southern
Song Dynasty to the southern part of the mainland in 1277.
</P>
<P>
The Southern Song Dynasty built a fleet of some 2,000 warships
that patrolled the sea area near the present-day cities of Xinhui
and Zhuhai.
</P>
<P>
In 1279, however, the fleet was attacked by the Yuan army and
only about 800 of the warships escaped. A minister of the Southern
Song, with the young emperor on his back, then jumped into the sea
to commit suicide, and the dynasty was finished.
</P>
<P>
According to scholars, most of the sea area where the battle
was fought has become dry land over the past 700 years, leaving
only the lake, where pieces of pottery, porcelain, and boards of
ships are frequently found.
</P>
<P>
This has suggested that some of the sunken warships may be
buried on land but others may remain at the bottom of the lake,
says Yu Weichao, a prominent archaeologist and former curator of
the National Museum of Chinese History.

<HEADLINE> Serbia Invites Ethnic Albanians to Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, May 5 (Xinhua) -- The Yugoslav Serbian government
Tuesday extended an invitation to leaders of ethnic Albanians in
the Serbian province of Kosovo to discuss the worsening situation
there.
</P>
<P>
The Serbian government proposed that the talks be held in
Pristina, Kosovo, next Tuesday and focused on the major issues of
the autonomous status of Kosovo and the drafting of a law on local
autonomy.
</P>
<P>
The Tanjug news agency reported that the invitation was issued
by Deputy Prime Minister Danilo Markovic.
</P>
<P>
The Serbian government has decided to solve all problems
concerning ethnic Albanians and other ethnic minorities through
talks in line with existing international norms, Tanjug quoted
government officials as saying.
</P>
<P>
The ethnic Albanians demand the presence of international
mediators in negotiations whereas the Serbian government regards
the issue of Kosovo as an internal affair and rejects any foreign
intervention.
</P>
<P>
In a referendum conducted on April 23, 95 percent of the
Serbian citizens opposed the involvement of a third party in the
Kosovo affair.
</P>
<P>
Also on Tuesday, the Albanian foreign ministry issued a
communique, accusing Serbia of carrying out a "scorched earth
policy" in Kosovo and concentrating heavy forces in areas that
border Albania.
</P>
<P>
"Serbian paramilitary and police continue to conduct military
mopping-up operations in Kosovo, which resulted in casualties to
ethnic Albanians," the communique said.
</P>
<P>
It said Albania will maintain close cooperation with the
international community in finding a peaceful and lasting solution
to the issue.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Some 140 Cambodian refugees were
voluntarily repatriated Tuesday, the newspaper The Bangkok Post
Wednesday quoted the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)
as saying.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Thai Army Commander-in-Chief Chettha Thanajaro said
his country is ready to repatriate all of the nearly 100,000
refugees on its soil.
</P>
<P>
He added that the repatriation is being planned at the request
of the Cambodian government, which wants its citizens to
participate in the general election polls scheduled for July 26.
</P>
<P>
The UNHCR said the 140 refugees repatriated Tuesday include 81
men and 59 women from 71 families.
</P>
<P>
So far, as many as 3,877 Cambodian refugees have been sent home
under the UNHCR's Selective Voluntary Repatriation Program, which
began last October.
</P>
<P>
Some 25,000 more Cambodian refugees crossed into Thailand since
last Friday to escape fighting between Cambodian government forces
guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Two makeshift camps have been set up about eight kilometers
inside Thai territory to shelter the refugees.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, another 30,000 refugees were reportedly moving close
to the Thai-Cambodian border and ready to flee into Thailand if
the situation in Cambodia deteriorates.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Sees Fewer Tourist Arrivals Than Expected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Foreign tourists arriving in
Thailand in the first three months of this year increased by only
2.98 percent over a year earlier, according to figures released by
the Tourism Authority of Thailand available Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Foreign tourist arrivals from January to March totaled 1.99
million, in contrast with the encouraging figures for January,
when arrivals went up by 13.6 percent compared with January 1997.
</P>
<P>
The Thai government and the private sector have been counting
on tourism for an economic recovery. The Amazing Thailand 1998-99
campaign aims to achieve a 5.4-percent growth in tourist arrivals.
</P>
<P>
Arrivals from East Asia, the key tourist market for Thailand,
were 4.6 percent lower in the first quarter compared with the same
period last year, with those from crisis-hit South Korea dropping
80.59 percent and Indonesia 58.08 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Asian decline was however offset somewhat by encouraging
growth from European markets, from where arrivals rose 14.54
percent to 619,520. Tourist arrivals from the Middle East were up
34.78 percent to 32,698.
</P>
<P>
East Asian arrivals totaled 1.04 million, with 264,009 from
Japan, 191,836 from Malaysia and 122,539 from Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Growth was healthy from Hong Kong, with shoppers swelling
arrivals by 31.3 percent.

<HEADLINE> Thai Snake-Man Aims for 7 Days With Deadly Crawlers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 6 (Xinhua) -- A Thai farmer is trying to set a
special world record by living with more than 100 poisonous snakes
in a small glass-walled room for seven days starting Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Shoppers visiting a Bangkok shopping mall Tuesday were stunned
to see Boonruang Buachan, 27, relax himself with two king cobras,
100 cobras, 30 centipedes and 20 scorpions. His only protection is
a pair of goggles.
</P>
<P>
Boonruang claims to have befriended snakes since his childhood.
</P>
<P>
His parents said he was born with a serious skin disease which
gave a snake skin-like appearance to his skin until he was two or
three. When his skin improved, Boonruang developed a liking for
snakes.
</P>
<P>
Boonruang said that he had spent more than 20 years living with
snakes and that snakes often came out to play with him.
</P>
<P>
He was only bitten once when he tried to protect one of his
friends from being attacked by a cobra.
</P>
<P>
The cobra then led him to a herb which he used to cover the
wound and was saved.
</P>
<P>
Boonruang said he had agreed to stay in the glass room to prove
that he could be friends with any snakes, not only those from his
village.

<HEADLINE> Air Fares in Indonesia Raised by 37 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government has
approved an Indonesian National Air Carriers Association (INACA)
proposal for a 37-percent increase in air fares, following a steep
hike in fuel prices, an INACA official said.
</P>
<P>
The rise would come into effect on Wednesday and would be
applied to economy class on domestic flights only, the
association's chairman, Soelarto Hadisoemarto, said here Tuesday
evening.
</P>
<P>
The government announced Monday that fuel prices would go up by
between 25 and 71.43 percent as of Tuesday to reduce subsidies and
curb the state budget deficit.
</P>
<P>
Soelarto said the air fares increase was in line with a regular
 tariff adjustment made every six months by the association as a
result of the rupiah's fluctuation against the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
INACA hiked air fares in December last year to adjust to the
sharp appreciation of the U.S. dollar against the rupiah.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah has dropped to 8,000 per dollar from 2,500 per
dollar last July.

<HEADLINE> Album on Yarlung Zangbo River Canyon Published in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, May 6 (Xinhua) -- An album of photos on the world's
deepest Yarlung Zangbo River Canyon in Tibet has recently been
published.
</P>
<P>
The album, published by the Petrel Publishing House in central
China, contains 525 photos and a 600,000-character description of
the canyon's beauty, geology, weather, glaciers, snow-covered
mountains, rare plants and wild animals, giving readers a
complete picture of this natural wonder.
</P>
<P>
Chinese scientists have conducted a series of research in the
canyon since the early 1970s and have gathered a great number of
materials and data on the 500-km-long canyon.
</P>
<P>
The canyon is formed by a sudden bend of the 2,058-km Yarlung
Zangbo River. The river starts in southwestern Tibet, travels
eastwards along the Himalayas, and suddenly changes its course
southwards in southeastern Tibet, before it flows out of China and
eventually empties into the Bay of Bengal.
</P>
<P>
A member of the Petrel Publishing House said that the photos
were taken by Chinese Academy of Sciences researchers who have a
total of 20 years of experience doing scientific surveys in the
canyon area.

<HEADLINE> Ferrari Boosted by New Exhaust System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Formula one team Ferrari said on
Tuesday they will introduce a radical exhaust system in Sunday's
Spanish Grand Prix.
</P>
<P>
This might boost the team's number one racer, Michael
Schumacher's hopes of catching championship leaders McLaren.
</P>
<P>
The exhaust system sees the pipe exit at the top of the rear
bodywork rather than under the rear diffuser. This makes the car
faster as it is more stable under braking and acceleration.
</P>
<P>
Ferrari will also introduce new rear suspension geometry, a
more efficient fuel-injection system and a new rear wing in a bid
to close the gap on McLaren.
</P>
<P>
McLaren have a clear lead over Ferrari in the constructors'
championship and Mika Hakkinen leads from McLaren teammate David
Coulthard in the drivers' standings. Schumacher is third.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANAGUA, May 5 (Xinhua) -- The Nicaraguan Health Ministry
closed a prison in Managua Tuesday for one week due to an outbreak
of meningitis.
</P>
<P>
The disease killed two prisoners and sent three others to the
hospital.
</P>
<P>
Visits by prisoners' relatives have been suspended and every
one has been prohibited from entering or leaving a police station
where the contagious virus was reportedly discovered, the ministry
said.
</P>
<P>
Epidemiologist Fabiola Prado said the outbreak is under
control, but the quarantine is still in effect to prevent the
meningitis bacteria from spreading.
</P>
<P>
The Health Ministry has provided medical treatment and
immunizations to 199 prisoners and 20 policemen in order to
prevent the spread of the virus.
</P>
<P>
Of the seven cases of meningitis discovered in the capital city
this week, four people have died. Last year the disease killed

<HEADLINE> Tiny Baby Leaves Hospital Safe and Sound </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, May 5 (Xinhua) -- A baby, considered the tiniest
to survive in the U.S. state of Oregon, went home from hospital
last week in apparent good health, the Oregonain reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
When William Steven Hunnicutt was born 13 weeks prematurely, he
weighed only 12.7 ounces (0.360 kilogram) and was nine inches
(about 22.86 centimeters) in length. The baby's diminutive size
made him a giant challenge for doctors.
</P>
<P>
At the gestational age of 27 weeks, William was in a life-and-death
situation for his parents to make a decision: Continue to stay in his
mother's womb and hope for the best, or be brought into the world by
surgeons and rely on medical technology to keep him alive.
</P>
<P>
At 27 weeks' gestation, an infant of normal weight -- about two
pounds four ounces (about 1.024 kilograms) -- has a 90 percent
chance of living if sophisticated medical treatment is available,
doctors say. But studies of infants born weighing less than 17.5
ounces (about 0.497 kilogram) indicate a 20 percent probability of
survival.
</P>
<P>
For William to survive, doctors had to place a tube down his
throat to connect his lungs to a ventilator that would breathe for
him. And they had to thread catheters into the major vein and
artery in his umbilical cord. The catheters allow doctors to give
intravenous fluids and medications and to take blood samples.
</P>
<P>
The neonatal intensive care unit, where the baby spent 111
days, was equipped with the smallest of everything -- the tiniest
catheters, needles, measuring devices.
</P>
<P>
The doctors say that the baby has avoided many of the worse
ailments that can befall a premature child. He didn't have a brain
hemorrhage. His lungs and intestines are well developed. He has
some retinopathy but appears to be minor. He had no seizures after
birth -- a sign that he could have escaped serious neurological
problems that often afflict premature children.
</P>
<P>
Now at home, the baby relies on supplemental oxygen for his
tiny lungs.
</P>
<P>
Since birth, he has bulked up to four pounds (about 1.816
kilograms) and has grown in length to 16 inches (about 40.64
centimeters).
</P>
<P>
Doctors say it's too early to tell whether William will suffer
long-term disabilities. Extremely small babies are at risk for
neurological impairment such as cerebral palsy.

SANTIAGO, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Chilean forestry exports reached
253.2 million U.S. dollars in the first two months of the year, a
17.1 percent reduction over the same period in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Jose Antonio Prado, executive director of the National Forestry
Corporation, said the reduction was attributed to the lack of
demand from Asian countries since the recent financial crises
occurring in Asia have interrupted normal business activities.
</P>
<P>
Wood products are the main exports of Chile and Asian countries
are the main buyers.
</P>
<P>
Exports to South Korea reached only 12 million dollars in
January and February, which represents a 75 percent reduction,
while Japan's imports went down 25.4 percent to reach 49.20
million dollars.

<HEADLINE> Nicaraguan Officials Suspended for Links with Drug </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANAGUA, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Nicaraguan President Arnoldo Aleman
on Tuesday suspended four high ranking officials from their duties
for their alleged involvement in a drug-trafficking case.
</P>
<P>
The officials were Mario Rivas, director of civil aeronautics,
Carlos Garcia Solorzano, general director of migration and foreign
affairs, Carlos Palacio Linarte, anti-drug police chief, and
Carlos Bendana, who was the link with the interpol.
</P>
<P>
According to police investigations, an airplane, Jet Lear 35a,
was stolen on December 15, 1997, in Florida, the United States,
and flown into Nicaragua on December 24, 1997.
</P>
<P>
The aircraft was later used by a Cuban American citizen,
identified as Jorge Guasch, to transport cocaine from South
America to the United States.
</P>
<P>
To avoid being inspected, the drug dealer devoted 10 flight
hours for trips of the president and some other high ranking
government officials.
</P>
<P>
Announcing the decision to suspend the four officials at a
press conference here, President Aleman said, "the executive power
is obliged to look after the compliance with the law, national
security and public morals."
</P>
<P>
He admitted having traveled once by the aircraft when attending
a presidential summit in Central America on February 4.
</P>
<P>
However, he denied local press reports which named him "mulero"
(person who transports an article or illicit product) of the drug
dealer and accused him of taking narcotics to the atlantic coast
of the country.
</P>
<P>
The president demanded his innocence in this case, saying that
this sole trip in the aircraft had a very strong security and
military custody.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, three commissions have been formed to continue
investigations into the "Jet Lear 35a case" and they are required
to present their conclusions to the president within a week.

NANNING, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Air quality in Nanning, capital of
south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, now has greatly
been improved.
</P>
<P>
The city government has allocated substantial funding in recent
years for afforestation to control air pollution.
</P>
<P>
The landscaped coverage in the city was 36.4 percent in 1997,
with per capita greenery standing at 6.7 square meters. Nanning
is, in fact, recognized as one of the nation's park cities.
</P>
<P>
The city's environment department has severely punished
chemical plants and sugar factories causing heavy pollution, and
has installed industrial waster and air treatment equipment. Some
75 small enterprises creating heavy pollution have been closed
over the past three years.
</P>
<P>
The city sits in a basin surrounded by mountains which restrict
wind velocity needed to remove polluted air.
</P>
<P>
Nanning has over 300,000 motor vehicles and 140,000
motorcycles. Motor vehicle emissions are the major culprit in air
pollution.

<HEADLINE> United States Names 20 to World Cup Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 5 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Soccer National Team head
coach Steve Sampson on Tuesday named 20 of his 22-man roster for
the 1998 World Cup finals in France, with some players to make
their third World Cup appearance.
</P>
<P>
The roster includes 12 players from the 1994 World Cup team and
six players from the Atlanta Olympics squad beside two, Marcelo
Balboa and Eric Wynalda, who will play their third World Cup
finals.
</P>
<P>
Sampson said he intended to fill the final two spots with
midfielder Tab Ramos and defender David Regis. Both players will
be evaluated during the team's three weeks together before
departing to France June 4.
</P>
<P>
"I believe we can do something special at this World Cup. I
would not put it beyond this team to get to the third round," said
Sampson in a teleconference call.
</P>
<P>
The official roster will not be submitted until the FIFA
deadline of June 2, he said.
</P>
<P>
Missing from the squad is former captain John Harkes, a veteran
of the last two World Cups, dropped by Sampson two weeks ago
because of poor play and attitude.
</P>
<P>
The move surprised several members of the American team, and
displayed the seriousness of Sampson's approach to the World Cup.
He named Thomas Dooley, who turns 37 on may 12, as the new
captain.
</P>
<P>
Striker Roy Lassiter was also not included, with Sampson citing
his poor recent form in Major League Soccer.
</P>
<P>
The team's average age is 28 and the average number of
international appearances is 51.
</P>
<P>
The United States finished 14th in the U.S.-hosted 1994 World
Cup and expectations are high to improve on that performance in
France. The U.S. team will play its opening World Cup match June
15 against three-time champions Germany in Paris.
</P>
<P>
Six days later, the Americans will face Iran in Lyon, and will
play Yugoslavia on June 25 in Nantes.

RIO DE JANEIRO, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Atletico Madrid midfielder
Juninho, who has just recovered from a broken leg, lost his place
in Brazil's squad to Barcelona's Giovanni when defending champions

Juninho has returned to fitness quickly after breaking his
leg in February but coach Zagallo decided to use an in-form

<P>
The only other surprise was the inclusion in the squad of
central defender Marcio Santos, a survivor from the 1994 World
Cup.
</P>
<P>
Paris St Germain midfielder Rai, who was recalled after a
four-year absence for last week's friendly against Argentina, was
excluded, while Fiorentina's Edmundo, who has suffered from a
suspect temperament this year, was included.

<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, May 5 (Xinhua) -- The Communist group, the only
opposition in the new Moldovan parliament, will back Ion Ciubuc,
the resigned premier, for a new term in the office of premier if
he is proposed by the president of the republic.
</P>
<P>
The statement was made by secretary of the party Andrei Neguta
as reported Tuesday by the Moldovan news press BASA-PRESS.
</P>
<P>
The Democratic Convention is due to advance its candidate and
the other alliance members must respect this choice, under the
agreement of foundation of the parliamentary majority -- the
Alliance for Democracy and Reforms which is composed of the
Democratic Convention, the Democratic and Prosperous Moldova Bloc
and the Party of Democratic Forces.
</P>
<P>
Andrei Neguta said that Valentin Dolganiuc, nominee of the
Democratic Convention, "does not have all necessary qualities for
taking the premiership." The communists will take its final
attitude on the issue of government after it is informed of the
program and membership of the new cabinet, he added.
</P>
<P>
Legislators from the majority Alliance for Democracy and
Reforms decline from commenting on the subject unless guaranteed
the anonymity. Many of them describe Dolganiuc as "lacking
experience."
</P>
<P>
Dolganiuc's supporters, however, affirm that reservations
shared by a part of deputies, including members of the coalition,
"might have had another origin: unwillingness to allow a person
who is far from a particular nomenclature or influent circles to
hold a key post."
</P>
<P>
President Petre Luchinsky had consultations Monday and Tuesday
with Alliance and Communist leaders to highlight a nominee for
prime ministership.
</P>
<P>
The prerogative to move a candidature for the post of premier
belongs to the head of state, according to the constitution.
</P>
<P>
The government headed by Ion Ciubuc resigned last Thursday
after 15 months of work. Petre Luchinsky had said earlier that he
would like to see Ion Ciubuc in the position of the premier.

<HEADLINE> New York Stocks Pull Back </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Stocks on Wall Street pulled back
from its record high Tuesday, as investors are again worried about
inflationary pressures.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average fell almost exactly as much as
it rose in setting a record Monday, slipping 45.09 points to
9,147.57.
</P>
<P>
Broader indexes also extended Monday's late pullback.
</P>
<P>
Stocks were pressured throughout the session by a weak bond
market, where the yield on the 30-year Treasury rose back toward 6
percent.
</P>
<P>
Bonds struggled after a top official at the International
Monetary Fund indicated again the possibility for the Federal
Reserve to raise interest rate to cool down the economy.
</P>
<P>
The comments quickly reopened the inflation debate that
unexpectedly flared up last week, but was seemingly resolved only
days later by a series of encouraging economic reports.
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advancers by an 8-to-5 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume totaled 583.63 million
shares, similar to the pace of the prior two sessions.
</P>
<P>
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 fell 6.42 to 1,115.65, and the Nasdaq
composite index fell 13.95 points to 1,864.91.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE composite index fell 2.98 to 579.75, and the American
Stock Exchange composite index fell 3.52 to 745.28.
</P>

The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 3.72 to
481.74.

<HEADLINE> Canada Revamps Extradition Laws </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Canada moved Tuesday to revamp its
ancient extradition laws in a bid to make it easier to extradite
accused criminals.
</P>
<P>
The legislation tabled by Justice Minister Anne McLellan would,
among other things, allow alleged war criminals to stand trial at
international tribunals.
</P>
<P>
Among the other planned changes to streamline the extradition
process:
</P>
<P>
-- The ground for extradition will be broadened and not limited
to a specific list of crimes set out in the act. This will allow
for extradition for new offenses, such as computer crimes;
</P>
<P>
-- More flexibility in admitting in Canadian courts different
forms of evidence in other countries;
</P>
<P>
-- New procedures to allow a fugitive to waive extradition and
voluntarily return to the other country.
</P>
<P>
The new laws will also abandon a former list of extraditable
offenses that included such outdated crimes as slave trade.
</P>
<P>
This is the first in over 120 years that Canada reforms its
extradition laws, which is expected to bring the country more in
step with other industrialized nations.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Military Opens Hearing on Flight Accident in Italy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 5 (Xinhua) -- There was no evidence that a U.S.
Marine pilot intentionally flew his surveillance jet under a ski
lift in Italy, killing 20 skiers in a gondola car, a U.S. military
attorney said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A week-long hearing was held in Camp LeJeune Marine Corps Base,
North Carolina, to determine whether Captains Chandler Seagraves,
28, and William Raney II, 26, should be court-martialed for the
accident, which took place in February at ski resorts near the
Aviano, Italy, air base.
</P>
<P>
In opening arguments, Marine Captain Paul Kaplan disputed
prosecutors' allegations that there was a "cable car club" that
crewmen could join by making a dangerous pass under a lift cable.
</P>
<P>
"The evidence simply will not support such a wild theory," said
Kaplan, a military attorney for Seagraves.
</P>
<P>
Later this week, a military judge will consider whether
Seagraves and Raney should be court-martialed on 20 counts each of
involuntary manslaughter and negligent homicide.
</P>
<P>
Seagraves and Raney sat at the rear seats when the accident
occurred.
</P>
<P>
The jet's pilot, Captain Richard J. Ashby, 30, of Mission
Viejo, California, and navigator Captain Joseph Schweitzer, 30, of
Westbury, New York, will face a similar hearing in June.
</P>
<P>
Captain Michael Recce, the first prosecution witness and
squadron duty officer on the day of the mishap, said the ski lift
was not on U.S. military maps of the region.
</P>
<P>
A military report said there were standing orders to maintain a
minimum altitude of 610 meters and a maximum airspeed of 450 knots
on low-level training flights.
</P>
<P>
However, the jet clipped the cables suspended between 111 and
113 meters off the ground and reached speeds of up to 555 knots
during the flight.

<HEADLINE> Romania's Population Migrates From Town to Village </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bucharest, May 5 (Xinhua) -- The urban-to-rural migration tide
is preponderant in Romanian internal migration, the state news
agency Rompres Tuesday cited the National Statistics Commission as
saying.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time since the 1968 administrative division
that in 1997 the population in urban areas registered a negative
residence changing migration balance, which had been ascertained
in over two thirds of the all 41 county capitals and Bucharest,
the same source said. In the past year, the rate of internal
migration was 13.4 persons per 1,000 inhabitants.
</P>
<P>
According to the same source, the negative balance in the urban
areas was due, within the population structure by age, to the
inhabitants of 34 years old and over, in the sense that the
percent of the departures exceeded the arrivals one.
</P>
<P>
Among the main reasons to the urban-to-rural migration tide are
the high rate of unemployment in the urban areas and the process
of land privatization in the countryside, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
It is worth noticing that out of a total number of persons
changing their residence last year, only an 11.1 percent declared
as a reason the change of working place, while the rest of them
claimed family problems.

<HEADLINE> Former Student Gets Prison Term for E-Mail Hate Crime </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, May 5 (Xinhua) -- A former University of
California student became the first person in the United States to
be sentenced to prison for committing a federal hate crime over
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
A U.S. district court in Santa Ana, California, Monday
sentenced Richard Machado to one-year imprisonment. He was
convicted in February of violating the civil rights of 59 Asian
students at UC-Irvine to whom he sent threatening e-mail in 1996.
</P>
<P>
With credit for time served in custody, Machado, 21, is free on
conditions including one year on federal probation, a 1,000-dollar
fine and mandatory psychiatric counseling.
</P>
<P>
In his e-mail message, signed "Asian Hater," he warned that all
Asians should leave campus or the sender would "hunt all of you
down and kill your stupid asses."
</P>
<P>
Defense lawyers had portrayed the former student as a bored and
troubled teenager who sent the message as a prank.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors countered with testimony from students who said
they were terrified by Machado's message. Machado told police then
that there were too many Asian students at Irvine, and that they
studied too hard and threatened his own ability to succeed. Asian
students account for 58 percent of UC-Irvine's undergraduate
population, the highest proportion on any UC campus.
</P>
<P>
One of the attorneys who prosecuted Machado's case praised the
sentence as a victory for federal authorities seeking to crack
down on hate crimes in cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Attorney's Office in Los Angeles district is
investigating a new case involving a student at California State
University's Los Angeles campus who allegedly sent an anti-Latino
e-mail message to professors.

<P>
LONDON, May 5 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
will fly to Northern Ireland Wednesday to urge the electorate to
give a huge "yes" vote in the referendum on the peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
He will share a platform with the architect of the agreement,
former Conservative government Prime Minister John Major, BBC
ceefax news reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The current major opposition Conservative Party leader William
Hague and the third largest Liberal Democratic Party leader Paddy
Ashdown will also tour the divided province soon to boost the
peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
The historic peace agreement was struck on April 10 by eight
major political parties in Northern Ireland with sponsorship of
the British and Irish governments. A referendum will be held
concurrently in Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic on May 22
to decide on the fate of the peace deal.
</P>
<P>
Northern Ireland's 60 percent Protestant majority is split over
the peace accord, although opinion polls show the majority are
supportive to the deal on both Northern Ireland and the Irish
Republic.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Airlines Vie for Asian Routes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Canada's largest carrier Air Canada
is pushing hard to get unlimited access to Asian destinations and
compete freely with rival Canadian Airlines on its home turf.
</P>
<P>
The move comes as Canadian Transport Minister David Collenette
begins a review of air policy, and Canadian Airlines is in better
shape after a restructuring last year.
</P>
<P>
Air Canada, which has traditionally focused its international
traffic on Europe, is prevented from expanding its Asian business
by a federal policy intended to protect Canadian Airlines'
traditional dominance there.
</P>
<P>
At present, the carrier is not allowed to fly to any Japanese
city other than Osaka, and is limited to four flights a week to
Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, demand for flights to Asia is booming beyond
Canadian Airlines' ability to meet it.
</P>
<P>
"When we can't fly directly to foreign climes, that traffic
gets diverted to U.S. hubs, and Toronto, Vancouver and Montreal
lose jobs," said Geoffrey Elliot, Air Canada's senior vice
president of corporate affairs.
</P>
<P>
"It's not just Air Canada pays the price, the whole economy
pays the price," Elliot noted.
</P>
<P>
It's estimated that every new daily route to Asia can create
950 direct and indirect jobs for the country, he added.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Air Canada is pushing the government to forge
Open Skies deals with countries other than the United States.
</P>
<P>
Canada should move quickly while the United States is forging
aggressively ahead with multilateral treaties giving its carriers
free access to the world, it argued.
</P>
<P>
The recent U.S.- Japanese Open Skies Pact paves the way for 90
new flights a week between the two countries.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Former Defense Chiefs Call for Continued F-22 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 5 (Xinhua) -- A group of seven former U.S.
defense secretaries urged Congress to fund the multi-billion
dollar F-22 project despite problems, fearing that a replaced
fighter project would drag the United States behind other nations,
the United Press International said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The F-22 project should be continued because it was a superior
airplane and also because it would take years for the Air Force to
design and build a new stealth fighter from scratch, the defense
chiefs said.
</P>
<P>
Such a delay would allow other nations, several of which are
already in the advanced stages of developing new stealth fighters,
to start adding aircraft that are superior to current U.S.
military planes to their air forces, the secretaries warned in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
The statement was issued through the Alexis de Tocqueville
Institution, a think tank that specializes in defense-related
issues.
</P>
<P>
The statement was signed by Casper Weinberger, William Perry,
Frank Carlucci, Richard Cheney, James Schlesinger, Donald
Rumsfeld, and Harold Brown, the report said.
