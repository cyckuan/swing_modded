<HEADLINE> Albanian President Will Not Resign: Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Albanian Presidential spokesman
Genc Pollo said in a television statement late Saturday that
President Sali Berisha, who has faced growing demands for his
resignation, has shown no intention to step down.
</P>
<P>
The statement, broadcast by the state television station, noted
President Berisha intended to go on with the agreement signed last
Sunday at a round table meeting with the country's other political
parities to implement political dialogues, establish a national
reconciliation government and hold a parliamentary election.
</P>
<P>
"Any attempt to deviate from this agreement will create
division and have unforeseen consequences in deepening existing
destabilization," it said.
</P>
<P>
The statement also said President Berisha repeated his pledge
to quit if the ruling Democratic Party lost in the election, which
will be held as scheduled before the end of June.
</P>
<P>
The president had been blamed for January's collapse of pyramid
investment schemes in which thousands of Albanians lost their life
savings.
</P>
<P>
Public anger turned into violence as people looted weapons from
army depots and took control several cities in southern Albania.
</P>
<P>
Local military forces in the south has demanded the
unconditional resignation of President Berisha, while mobs in the
capital Tirana looted a warehouse of flour last Thursday and
raided security depots in search of guns.
</P>
<P>
Berisha deployed tanks in front of main institutions in the
country and called the European Union to the provide military
assistance to help restore order.
</P>
<P>
However, the EU decided Sunday to send military and police
advisers instead of launching a military intervention.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that up to 4,000 Albanians have fled to Italy
since violence broke out here. More are still making efforts to
leave.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, some 300 Albanians forced a way onto a navy vessel
and 30 other smaller boats in the country's Adriatic port Durres
and later arrived at Italy's port of Brindisi.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, scores of Albanian police clashed with about
a thousand civilians trying to force their way onto a Greek navy
vessel which came to Durres, Albania's largest port, to evacuate
foreign citizens from the country.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees had called on
Albania's neighbors Italy and Greece to shelter refugees of the
unrest Balkan state.
</P>
<P>
Italy has agreed that refugees will be given political asylum
but will be repatriated once the anarchy subsided.

<HEADLINE> Solution of Kashmir Issue Is Must for Peace in Asia: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Foreign Minister
Gohar Ayub Khan said today that the solution of the Kashmir issue
is a must for peace in Asia.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks when inaugurating a three-day International
Conference on "Peace in Asia" at the institute of Strategic
Studies here.
</P>
<P>
India and Pakistan should get to the core issue of Jammu and
Kashmir and resolve it amicably, Gohar Ayub said.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan is determined to create an environment of peace,
security and stability in South Asia, he said.
</P>
<P>
"There is nothing but the unresolved dispute over Jammu and
Kashmir which bars genuine neighborly relations between the two
countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistan foreign minister noted that "fresh initiatives are
underway to break the stalemate that has interrupted the process
of normalization of relations between India and Pakistan."
</P>
<P>
He said both India and Pakistan have realized the importance of
bilateral discussions if they are to witness a stable future.
</P>
<P>
The regional organizations like ECO, SAARC, ASEAN and APEC can
play a meaningful role in development of economic interdependence
and economic integration in Asia as well as promoting peaceful
co-existence, he said.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that the United Nations will have to play a
greater role not only in conflict prevention and resolution but
also in transcending new problems such as safeguarding of national
sovereignty, right of self determination, territorial integrity
and the right of minorities.
</P>
<P>
For this purpose, he said, ways and means must be found to make
the world body more universal and democratic in its influence and
actions.
</P>
<P>
There should be a total restructuring of the rights and
authorities of the UN Security Council, General Assembly and the
Secretary General so that the developing countries had a greater
participation and responsibility in formulation and implementation
of policies and decision, he said.
</P>
<P>
The conference on "Peace in Asia" is being attended by experts
from Pakistan, Bangladesh, Russia, China, India, Germany, the
Philippines and South Korea.

<HEADLINE> Illegal Gold Panning Remains Rampant in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Illegal alluvial gold panning in
Zimbabwe's major rivers remained a thorny issue for the country,
a member of the Natural Resources Board, Prof. Chris Magadza,
said here today.
</P>
<P>
Magadza said the government should do everything in its power
to stop gold panning which was destroying the country's rivers.
</P>
<P>
He said although gold panning itself was not illegal, it was
necessary that stipulated regulations were adhered to.
</P>
<P>
Regulations were very clear that panners should not pan for
gold anywhere less than three meters from the river bank, said
the professor.
</P>
<P>
"What we see now is that people are digging close to the banks
and bringing soil to the river and it gets shifted to the dams
causing siltation," he said.
</P>
<P>
He cited some environmental problems in the country as land
degradation, loss of water resources, over-grazing, soil erosion
and deforestation.
</P>
<P>
The professor said there was now loss of bio-diversity in
Zimbabwe which meant that there was loss of fish and other
species in the rivers.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Major Stakes All on TV Debate With Blair </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 16 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister John Major
has decided to challenge opposition leader Tony Blair to a series
of TV debates which he believes could swing millions of undecided
voters back behind his government.
</P>
<P>
Amid a growing expectation that the prime minister prepares to
see the queen and ask for parliament to be dissolved early next
week, senior Tories confirmed that Major is ready to face Blair in
Britian's first-ever TV debate between the main party leaders.
</P>
<P>
Major was reported to instruct aides, who are negotiating with
broadcasters over the format, that it is no longer a question of
whether, but merely of when and how the debates would be held.
</P>
<P>
The debates will give the British people a chance to see both
party leaders in their political contest.
</P>
<P>
Major wants three debates with Blair, each lasting an hour.
Aides said it reflected his confidence that he can win by exposing
Blair as "all soundbite and no substance."
</P>
<P>
Blair's office said the opposition leader would welcome a TV
showdown but would want to examine any strings attached.
</P>
<P>
But a row loomed Saturday night as it emerged that Major wants
Liberal Democrat leader Paddy Ashdown excluded. It raised the
prospect of a legal challenge by the party which might prevent the
TV debates going ahead.
</P>
<P>
The exclusion of Ashdown, who Tories point out is "not in the
running to become prime minister," is certain to trigger protests
from him and other leaders such as Sir James Goldsmith and
Scottish Nationalist Alex Salmond.
</P>
<P>
Tory hopes of staging the unprecedented TV debates also
suffered a blow as an NOP poll for the Sunday Time showed Labor
has extended its lead to 25 points, its biggest since last May and
seven points up on last month's figures.
</P>
<P>
Despite the grim news from the opinion polls, Major insisted
that his party would win a fifth consecutive term of office in
"one of the most crucial general elections we have known for
generations."
</P>
<P>
In a keynote speech to the last big Conservative gathering
before the general election in Bath, England, Saturday, Major said
voting for Labor would be like waking up on an airplane whose
captain and crew had never flown before.
</P>
<P>
"You can only be sure with the Conservatives," Major added.

previously scheduled Madrid NATO summit.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 16 (Xinhua) -- The Air Zimbabwe authority set up a
team today to negotiate with pilots who have been on strike since
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The new team would take over from the management-workers
team which had been looking into the conditions of all
employees when the 70 pilots suddenly went on strike.
</P>
<P>
An Air Zimbabwe spokesman said the management team comprises
four people and the pilots are also expected to name an
equivalent number of people.
</P>
<P>
"They have to review the negotiations which have been going on
in a bid to find an answer to the impasse," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said they had hired aircrafts from a South African private
company which, as of Sunday, had operated all domestic routes
except Mauritius.
</P>
<P>
This also applied to flights to London and Frankfurt whose
passengers were being put on other carriers.
</P>
<P>
"We are making attempts to continue talking to the pilots.
Once again we are appealing to them to return to work so that we
do not inconvenience the passengers," said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the national carrier denied it was bankrupt as
reported by the local media on Friday.

<HEADLINE> 23 PKK Rebels Killed in Southeastern Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Twenty-three rebels of the
outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) have been killed in the
armed clashes in southeastern Turkey between the PKK and the
Turkish security forces for the past three days.
</P>
<P>
A statement from the office of the Emergency Regional Rule said

Kigi town of Bingol province and seven in Cemisgezek town of
Tunceli province.
</P>
<P>
The security forces captured one PKK guerrilla in Cemisgezek
town, the statement said, adding that seven PKK rebels had
surrendered to the security forces in Silopi town of Sirnak
province bordering Iraq.
</P>

<P>
ABU DHABI, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Omani Minister for Defense
Affairs Badr Bin Saoud Al-Busaidi has spelled out the necessity
of drawing lessons from the Gulf War and the need to strengthen
Arab Gulf self-defense capabilities.
</P>
<P>
The Omani minister told reporters here today that the Gulf War
has produced several useful lessons in various fields. He said
that all armies are studying and evaluating these lessons in line
with their combat capabilities and conditions.

On military cooperation and coordination among the Gulf
Cooperation Council (GCC) states, he said that there was close
cooperation among GCC defense ministers, whether through their
regular periodic meetings or through exchanging visits.

<HEADLINE> De Klerk Urged to Disclose Whereabouts of Missing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 16 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's ruling
African National Congress (ANC) demanded today that former Deputy
President F. W. De Klerk give full disclosure of the whereabouts
and graves of many anti-apartheid activists who were missing
before ANC took power in 1994.
</P>
<P>
"De Klerk's full disclosure to the nation will give the people
of South Africa an opportunity to mourn and honor their fallen
heroes and heroins who sacrificed their life to liberate their
own people," ANC spokesman Ronnie Mamoepa said.
</P>
<P>
Mamoepa said National Party leader De klerk and members of the
former State Security Council could not escape political
culpability for the cold-blooded murders of several ANC activists
throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
"Last week's exhumation of bodies (of ANC supporters) was a
serious indictment of de klerk's government," he said.
</P>
<P>
The exhumation was confirmation that the former De Klerk
regime had developed a two-pronged strategy to multi-party
negotiations -- talking to the ANC while unleashing a vicious
cycle of violence against ANC supporting communities and
activists, he added.
</P>
<P>
Six former security policemen are seeking amnesty for the
murders of 10 anti-Apartheid activists, including four whose
bodies were exhumed last week.
</P>
<P>
They had been buried in farms previously leased by members of
the Kwazulu-Natal security police as alleged bases for torture
and interrogation.
</P>
<P>
The 10 activists were allegedly killed between the late 1980's
and early 1990's.
</P>
<P>
The ANC called on the National Party and De Klerk to come out
clean on the whereabouts of countless other activists who had
disappeared at the hands of covert state security units, Mamoepa
said.

In the town of Kigoma today, all weapons and ammunition of the
soldiers have been withdrawn from them and were placed under
police custody.
</P>
<P>
The Rukwa regional authorities have been communicating with
their counterparts in Kigoma so that the 20 soldiers could be
moved to Kigoma and join those 220 who entered there last
month.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Kigoma Regional Commissioner, Yusuf Makamba,
told the official Daily News today over telephone from the
town of Kigoma that the repatriation of the 220 Zairean soldiers
has hit a snag after the relevant international bodies decided to
keep aloof.
</P>
<P>
He said the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC)
and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) had
advanced several grounds that they were not responsible for
undertaking such an operation.
</P>
<P>
He said that according to the ICRC officials in Kigoma, the
ICRC headquarters in Geneva instructed the Kigoma ICRC officials
not to accept the responsibility of repatriating the Zairean
soldiers.

<P>
During a meeting with a visiting delegation of the
widely-circulated Russian newspaper Pravda, he said that Russia

JERUSALEM, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu said today that he would carry out his
government's decision to go ahead with the construction of a new
Jewish neighborhood in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu made the remarks at a joint press conference with
King Hussein of Jordan, following a two-hour meeting between them
at the Prime Minister's Office in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Hussein arrived in Israel earlier today on a condolence visit
to the families of the seven schoolgirls who were shot dead by a
Jordanian soldier in Naharayim in the Jordan Valley Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Hussein also visited a girl pupil and a teacher, injured
during the shooting incident, at Hadassah Hospital in Jerusalem,
as well as President Ezer Weizman, who underwent surgery on
Friday after a fall.
</P>
<P>
"We understand our friends' different views and concerns
regarding to our decision (to build Har Homa)," said the Israeli
prime minister, but he stressed that the Israeli government made
the decision and would implement it.

"I said it (the construction of Har Homa) will start this
week, and it will start this week," Netanyahu said.

to Israel, which he termed as "a mission of peace," adding today
was the time when the peace process was pushed forward.

various issues between the two sides, but pledged to solve their
differences through dialogs and negotiations.
</P>
<P>
They also reaffirmed their commitments to advance the peace
process in the region, to work together to strengthen the
bilateral relations, while helping and encouraging others to
achieve peace in the region.

<P>
Netanyahu told reporters that during the meeting, Hussein and
himself talked with Palestinian National Authority President
Yasser Arafat by telephone on the current situation in the region.
</P>
<P>
He said differences between Israel and the Palestinians
should not lead to violence, which would destroy the entire
peace process, and should be resolved through negotiations.

The last time Hussein was in Jerusalem was in November
1995, when the Jordanian monarch came here to attend the
late Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's funeral.

<P>
ANKARA, March 16 (Xinhua) -- The evacuation of Turkish
citizens and diplomats from Albania began today with the help of
the Turkish armed forces, said the Foreign Ministry in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Many of the Turks caught in the midst of the anarchy sweeping
Albania fled via the Adriatic port of Dirac in boats after leaving
Tirana and Elbasan in buses accompanied by Turkish commandos, said
the statement.
</P>
<P>
About 300 Turks were taken on board a Turkish frigate waiting
on the coast to take the evacuees to the Italian port of Bari, 120
kilometers away, before being transported back to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The rescue operation was delayed until today because of
restrictions on movement due to a curfew.
</P>
<P>
Another Foreign Ministry statement issued today said Ankara is
closely following the situation in Albania, adding that it called
for the situation in the region to return to normal for the
interests of every one.
</P>
<P>
The latest developments in Albania are a threat not only to the
country itself, but to the peace and stability of the whole
region, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
It added that the events in Albania should be prevented from
affecting other neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the ministry also denied the press reports that
Turkey has sent armored vehicles to Albania by planes which
landed in neighboring Macedonia over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
It dismissed the reports of Turkish military intervention in
Albania's civil chaos. "The official visit of Deputy Chief of
General Staff Cevik Bir to Macedonia is simply a military visit
and has no connection whatever with events taking place in
Albania," it added.
</P>
<P>
The press reports alleged that General Bir recently visited
Macedonia together with two Hercules C-130 airplanes carrying
buses, military equipment and other vehicles.

CAIRO, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa today called for an end to the Israeli settlement
operations in Arab East Jerusalem, which he described as
"unwholesome and based on mistaken concepts."
</P>
<P>
At a press conference here, Moussa warned that Israel's
insistence on a new Jewish housing plan in East Jerusalem despite
an international chorus of objection would lead to "the gravest of
all consequences."
</P>
<P>
"This attitude would mean that the Israeli leadership is
insensitive about challenging Arab and international public
opinion, violating international law and breaching signed
agreements," he added.
</P>
<P>
On prospects for salvaging the Syrian and Lebanese tracks in
the peace process in light of the loss of confidence, Moussa said
a considerable corrosion of trust was eating into the peace
process as a result of Israeli measures on the Palestinian-Israeli
track.
</P>
<P>
"This affects the rest of peace tracks and the general
atmosphere surrounding the entire peace process," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
HELSINKI, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Finland will not join the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and any decision on that will
be made by Finland itself, Finnish Prime Minister Paavo Lipponen
said today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking before the summit between Russian President Boris
Yeltsin and U.S. President Bill Clinton, Lipponen said the summit
is "a recognition of current foreign policy" of Finland.
</P>
<P>
The Finnish newspaper of Helsinki Sanomat today reported that
Yeltsin rejects a membership of Finland in NATO.
</P>
<P>
In remarks to Yeltsin's statement, Lipponen stressed that any
decision concerning Finland should be made by Finland, which
upholds the "non-alliance policy" including that of independent
and credible self-defense.
</P>
<P>
Local news reports also quoted Finnish Foreign Minister Tarja
Halonen as saying that each country has its right to select its
own security policy.
</P>
<P>
As Yeltsin and Clinton are to meet here next week with the
alliance's expansion high on the agenda, smaller European
countries are fearing that Russia and the U.S. will build Europe's
security at the expense of small countries.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin will pay a working visit to Finland after the summit.
Lipponen expects the visit will help promote economic relations
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The summit, which was scheduled for Wednesday and Thursday, has
been postponed to Thursday and Friday due to Clinton's leg surgery
after his right knee tendon was torn. A planned visit by Clinton
to Demark was also postponed to July.

<HEADLINE> Cooperation Among Neighboring States Needed: Soeharto </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Soeharto
said today that cooperation among neighboring countries like
Indonesia and Singapore, is a must.
</P>
<P>
Inaugurating the Karimun Maritime Industrial Complex and Pt.
Karimun Sembawang Shipyard in Karimun Besar island of Indonesia's
Riau province, the president said that with close cooperation
among neighboring nations, a zone of peace, progress and welfare
could be created.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the ceremony, which was also attended by
Singaporean Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong, Soeharto said Indonesia
and Singapore should complement each other, Antara news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
The Karimun Marine and Industrial Complex was jointly built by
Indonesia's Salim Group and Singapore's Sembawang Corp. and JTC.
</P>
<P>
The first phase of the new industrial complex, located some 40
kilometers southwest of Singapore, was built on a 155-hectare land
at a cost of 90 million U.S. dollars. Most of the industries to be
constructed in this complex will be related to the marine and oil
industries.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Singaporean Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong said that
the two neighboring nations are entering a new area of economic
cooperation on this island, namely the marine and heavy
engineering sectors with projects such as ship repair,
ship-building and marine engineering.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Karimun offers easy access via the straits of
Malacca, deep waters capable of accommodating very large crude
carriers (VLCCs), low costs, and proximity to Singapore, the
region's shipping hub.
</P>
<P>
Karimun is located in Indonesia's fast-developing Riau
archipelago, where Singapore and Indonesia already have industrial
parks and resort projects in the islands of Batam and Bintan.
</P>
<P>
Singapore has been expanding its overseas investment to create
a large external wing for its economy, which would allow it to
overcome the constraints of being a small domestic market.
</P>
<P>
Latest official figures show that direct investments by
Singapore companies in Indonesia reached 4.03 billion Singapore
dollars (2.82 billion US dollars) in 1995, from 2.36 billion
Singapore dollars (1.82 billion dollars) the year before.

BAISE, GUANGXI, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Government departments
need to work hard to see that the Nanning-Kunming railway is

today.
</P>
<P>
Zou was in Baise, in southwest China's Guangxi Zhuang

railway starts in Nanning, the capital of Guangxi, and ends at
Kunming, the capital of neighboring Yunnan Province.

The 898.7-km-long railway that has to deal with a difference in
altitudes of more than 2,000 meters is a miracle of Chinese

construction leadership group.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Turkey Condemns Killing of Israeli School Girls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Turkey today condemned the
killing of seven Israeli school girls last Thursday by a
Jordanian soldier.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Foreign Ministry Spokesman Omer Akbel told a weekly
press conference that the Turkish government hoped that the sad
incident would not produce a negative impact on the ongoing
Middle East Peace Process.
</P>
<P>
He said Turkey believed that this would be seen as an
"individual act" instead of that of the Jordanian people and
armed forces.
</P>
<P>
Turkey appreciated the efforts made by the Jordanian side in
reestablishing peace in the region, Akbel said, adding that Ankara
would give strong support for all the measures aimed at bringing
stability to the region.
</P>
<P>
Last Thursday, a Jordian solider suddenly opened fire at a
group of Israeli school girls aged 13 to 14 in Naharayim in the
northern part of the Israeli-Jordanian border, killing seven girls
and wounding six others.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Jordanian King Hussein paid a condolence visit to
the bereaved families of the seven Israeli school girls.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Puts Forward Services Promotion Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Trade Development
Council (TDC) will put forward a 33-million-HK dollar (4.2 million
US dollars) program to further strengthen Hong Kong's lead as a
key regional services center.
</P>
<P>
The services sector contributed 83 percent to Hong Kong's
Gross Domestic Product in 1995 and accounted for 72 percent of the
total employment.
</P>
<P>
The "ambitious and comprehensive" program will be discussed at
the high level Services Promotion Strategy Group, to be formed
following Financial Secretary Donald Tsang's 1997-98 budget speech
last week, TDC's assistant executive director of services
promotion, Alan Wong, said today.
</P>
<P>
The think-tank group, of which the TDC will be a member, will
formulate policies on and coordinate Hong Kong's overall services
promotions.
</P>
<P>
"The TDC will put forward the program centering around eight
key promotional themes for the strategy group's discussion when
they convene next month," Wong said.
</P>
<P>
The eight promotional themes are Hong Kong as regional
headquarters, financial center, infrastructure integrator, design
and marketing center, entertainment distribution center,
communications hub, logistics center and licensing and sourcing
center.
</P>
<P>
And much emphasis should be put on the themes of Hong Kong as a
regional headquarters, financial center and infrastructural
integrator, Wong said.
</P>
<P>
Based on feedback from its network of advisory committees, the
TDC has developed a set of action plans for each theme. The plans
contain a balanced mix of promotions, including business
conferences, road shows, services industry missions, and
publications.
</P>
<P>
Wong continued that the program will emphasize synergy between
different but related services sectors.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on TDC's services promotion work over the past year,
Wong said: "Since we took up the challenge to promote Hong Kong's
services capabilities last year, there is already a growing
awareness in the international community on the excellence of our
services sectors."
</P>
<P>
"The government's initiative to set up the strategy group will
put the promotions on a track of greater success."
</P>
<P>
The TDC expanded its services promotion work last year, kicking
off a 10-point action plan, which included the set-up of four
services advisory committees forming a consultation network for
the industry.
</P>
<P>
The TDC also organized high-level international business
conferences, stages promotions at overseas trade fairs and those
on the Chinese mainland, launched worldwide publicity campaign and
enhanced the council's research and trade information services.

LHASA, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The Tibet Autonomous Region
reported total imports and exports worth 104 million US dollars in
1996, up 48.49 percent from the previous year, indicating foreign
trade there has shown good signs of development.
</P>
<P>
Foreign trade companies in the region are experimenting with a

stock.
</P>
<P>
The import of means of production and technology-intensive

industrial products for export grew from 15 percent in 1995 to 55
percent last year.

PYONGYANG, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The World Food Program (WFP)
signed an agreement here today with the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK) to provide another package of food aid
for the flood-hit country.
</P>
<P>
But the Korean Central News Agency did not say how much food
the Rome-based United Nations agency would give the DPRK, which is
affected by two years of flooding.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK needs 2.36 million metric tons of food and current
supplies could run out as early as April or May. Floods in 1995
and 1996 destroyed two million metric tons of grain and damaged
about 400,000 hectares of crop land.
</P>
<P>
The WFP's Executive Director, Catherine Bertini, on a four-day
visit to draw world attention to food needs in the DPRK, signed
the agreement with the DPRK's Deputy Foreign Minister, Choi Su

<HEADLINE> Britain's Labor Opposed to Early Monetary Union </HEADLINE>

<P>
LONDON, March 17 (Xinhua) -- British opposition Labor Party
leader Tony Blair said today it was not in Britain's interest to
join a European single currency scheduled to be launched on
January 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
"There are formidable obstacles to joining in the first wave,"
he told BBC radio. "I don't believe it is in Britain's national
interest to join up to a single currency, come what may."
</P>
<P>
How to deal with other European Union (EU) countries and when
to join the European Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) are the key
issues expected to dominate the election campaign until May 1, the
election day announced by Prime Minister John Major today.
</P>
<P>
Blair said his party, which took a strong lead in the polls
over the ruling Conservative Party, was united over the issue of
Europe in contrast to the Conservatives.
</P>
<P>
Since it won the 1992 election, the Conservative Party has
been badly split over whether Britain should have closer ties with
the EU.
</P>
<P>
The Tory's unpopularity stems from sterling's exit from the
European currency grid in September 1992.

<HEADLINE> Lee Kuan Yew to Ask Court to Remove Controversial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew
will ask the court to have the controversial remarks made about
the southern Malaysian state of Johor be removed from the record,
according to a local television report today.
</P>
<P>
The report said that Lee has asked his counsel, Davinder Singh,
to have the words removed. But Singh advised Lee that as the
statements were made in an affidavit filed in court, they cannot
be deleted without permission of the court.
</P>
<P>
Lee Kuan Yew apologized "unreservedly" last week to Malaysia
for the offense he has caused to the government and people of
Malaysia by his statement on Johor.
</P>
<P>
In a written statement distributed last Thursday, the press
secretary to Lee Kuan Yew said the Senior Minister "had no
intention to cause offense" in his sworn affidavit made on January
27 this year.
</P>
<P>
Lee made controversial remarks in the affidavit filed in a
Singapore court hearing defamation cases brought against
opposition Workers' Party member Tang Liang Hong by ruling
People's Action Party leaders.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Tang fled to Johor because he was concerned for his
safety, Lee Kuan Yew said: "I was baffled. He claimed his life was
under threat. But, of all places, he went to Johor. That place is
notorious for shootings, muggings and car-jackings. It does not
make sense for a person who claims to be fearful for his life to
go to a place like Johor."
</P>
<P>
According to the television report, Lee said his counsel would
apply to court for permission to delete what were called
"offending statements" so that they would no longer remain on the
record.
</P>
<P>
Lee said he would do so at the next application against Tang
Liang Hong which would be for the assessment of damages.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that Malaysian government leaders had expressed
their wish that the statements in his affidavit about Johor not
remain on the record.
</P>
<P>
Again, Lee repeated his unreserved apology in the signed
statement, adding that his counsel would explain to the court that
when the affidavit was made, it was intended for a hearing in
Chambers, not in open court, and that it had not been anticipated
that subsequent events would bring the affidavit into open court.
</P>
<P>
Lee also reportedly said that his counsel would state that it
was never his intention to cause offense. And that he had
instructed his counsel to seek the court's permission to have the
offending sentences deleted.

BEIJING, March 17 (Xinhua) -- China's Public Security Ministry
has begun its "Spring Action" campaign, a part of its "Strike Hard
Campaign," which will run from March through May.
</P>
<P>
The action is a follow-up to the "Winter Action," which started

</P>
<P>
According to statistics, the crime rate was down in 1996, and a

an official with Public Security says, the situation in public
security is still a serious one.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry has issued a circular on arrangements for public
security departments across the country for the "Spring Action"
campaign, he said, explaining that it will focus on cracking down
on serious crimes, such as bomb threats, bank robberies, and will
work toward eliminating social ills, including prostitution,
gambling, and drug addiction, and confiscating illegal weapons and

<HEADLINE> Khamenei Announces Makeup of Exigency Council </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Supreme Leader Ali
Khamenei today announced the new makeup of Iran's Exigency
Council headed by President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani.
</P>
<P>
The Council for Determination of Exigencies (CDE) is
composed of 25 members, including noted theologians and
high-ranking government officials, the state-run Tehran Radio
reported.
</P>
<P>
The council is one of the most important and powerful
political organs of the Islamic regime, which was first brought
into existence by the late Iranian spiritual leader Ruhollah
Khomeini in 1987.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that the decree announced by Khamenei
could be interpreted into a signal that Rafsanjani's position in
the Islamic regime is confirmed as No. 2 man just after Khamenei
even though Rafsanjani steps down as president after two-term
service in the office this August.
</P>
<P>
The announcement of the new composition of the CDE would also
pave the way for Parliament Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri to
have greater possibility of winning the 7th presidential election
scheduled for May 23.
</P>
<P>
The CDE has the responsibility of arbitrating disputes
between Parliament and the Guardian Council. It also decides
about the general outlines of Iran's domestic and foreign
policies as well as proposing solution for the country's major
problems.
</P>
<P>
In his decree, Khamenei announced his decision to expand the
present makeup of membership of the organ with additional
"officials, statesmen and prominent theologians" to respond to
the needs of Iran at the present time.
</P>
<P>
However, the report gave no details about how many new
members have entered the CDE and who have been removed from
it. The appointed 25 members will serve for a period of five
years.
</P>
<P>
Based on the decree, active in the organ are heads of the
three branches of the regime, ranking theologians of the
Guardian Council as well as ministers or directors of government
agencies.

HONG KONG, March 17 (Xinhua) -- China metallurgical products
export trade fair opened here today, eyeing a big bunch of
contracts to bring home.
</P>
<P>
The fair, the tenth of its kind, was co-organized by China Iron
and Steel Industry and Trade Group Corporation (CSGC), the core
member of China Iron and Steel Industry and Trade Group (Steel
China), and China metallurgic (HK) Company Ltd..
</P>
<P>
Participating in the fair, which runs through Saturday, are not
only CSGC and Steel China, but also some other large Chinese
enterprises engaged in the industry, including Anshan Iron and
Steel Company, Wuhan Iron and Steel Company and Panzhihua Iron and
Steel Company.
</P>
<P>
China produced over 100 million tons of steel in 1996, which
put it at the first position in the world.
</P>
<P>
The fair yielded record-high 110 million US dollars worth of
contracts in 1995, but the year 1996 saw the figure plunge to over
40 million US dollars due to sluggish global demand and fierce
competition, a senior CSGC official revealed.
</P>
<P>
He expected things to be much better this year.

TEHRAN, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Interior Ministry announced
here today that 1,083 people were killed in natural disasters
in the country in the current Iranian calendar year ending on

</P>
<P>
Vice-Minister Ali Zargar said that his country suffered a

<HEADLINE> China Making Frontal Assault on River Pollution (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 17 (Xinhua) -- China is increasing its efforts
to control pollution in the Huaihe River valley and has published
a list of the major polluters in the region which have to show
improvements before the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
The list, which was drawn up by a state group in charge of
water resource protection in the river valley, consists of 259
enterprises with serious pollution problems: 101 of them in Henan
Province, 55 in Anhui Province, 72 in Shandong Province, and 31 in
Jiangsu Province. A large number of them are in paper or alcohol
production.
</P>
<P>
"More than 70 percent of the waste water discharged in the
valley comes from paper mills and distillers," said an official
with the State Bureau of Environmental Protection (SBEP).
</P>
<P>
If the factories cannot meet government-set discharge standards
before a certain date, or if they illegally change their names, or
shift the pollution problems on to other enterprises, people can
report them to local environmental protection departments, the
bureau said.
</P>
<P>
"That action will increase the accessibility of law enforcement
in environmental protection," said an authority with the
SBEP. "And it will play a favorable role in urging the polluting
factories and local governments to step up pollution controls."
</P>
<P>
Local governments in the Huaihe River valley region have also
drawn up their own lists of polluting plants that need
improvement, according to a source in the bureau.

<P>
The Huaihe River is one of the country's seven major rivers.
The river valley covers an area of 270,000 square kilometers in
east China in the four provinces, covering one thirty-fifth of the
country.
</P>
<P>
It is one of China's important grain and energy bases, with a
cultivated area of over 13 million hectares, and a population of
150 million, both accounting for one eighth of the country's total.
</P>
<P>
In the past ten years, the valley has become heavily polluted,
with more than 180 towns and cities and thousands of factories
dumping a total of 2.4 billion tons of waste water annually. Of
the river's 191 tributaries, about half have become seriously
polluted, and are practically useless, greatly impairing people's
lives and retarding economic development.
</P>
<P>
The State Council has stated that all polluting factories in
the valley must meet government-set discharge limits by the end of
this year, and as the deadline approaches, the State Environmental
Protection Bureau says that it will increase its efforts to combat
pollution in the region.
</P>
<P>
Recent statistics show that China has closed 4,987 small
factories with serious pollution problems in the area, such as
paper mills and tanneries, and, according to one official,
"Pollution has been harnessed to some extent."
</P>
<P>
The bureau checked some major polluting sources in the region
early this February and urged them to increase pollution control
efforts.
</P>
<P>
A number of factories in the region have announced that they
will try to meet the discharge standards before this June, and the
SBEP believes that with concerted efforts of the central and local
governments, China can make the Huaihe River clean by the year
2000.

<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of Mozambicans illegally
living in South Africa are repatriated by force every week by
motor vehicles and trains, the Noticias newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
At the railway station in Mozambique's border town Ressano
Garcia, a train carrying hundreds of Mozambicans, most of them
young, arrives weekly under escort of South African police.
</P>
<P>
Some 150 Mozambicans are repatriated through roads every week
on the average.
</P>
<P>
Most of the repatriated are empty-handed because they had no
chance to collect their belongings after being seized by South
African police.
</P>
<P>
About 700 Mozambicans got off a train at the Ressano Garcia
town Thursday,, said Julio Manjate, an eye-witness and a
journalist for the paper.
</P>
<P>
Some repatriated then plan to sneak into South Africa again
from the town in night, said Manjate.
</P>
<P>
People from Mozambique, Tanzania, Zambia, Somalia, Malawi,
Ethiopia and Zimbabwe are wandering in the town in the evening
with dreams of returning to South Africa, local residents said,
complaining bad security there.
</P>
<P>
Unlike some other African countries, Mozambique puts no
punishment on the repatriated. Therefore, many Africans living
illegally in South Africa, once found by police, ask to be sent
to Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
As many as 11,000 people were repatriated from South Africa
into Mozambique, a majority of them then jumped over the barbed
wire along the border and entered South Africa again, said an
immigration officer in the town.
</P>
<P>
At least five people were killed by mines or South African
border security personnel when trying to across the border near
the town in January, he said.

RUF spokeswoman Agnes Deen Jalloh told Xinhua today that the

<HEADLINE> One-Third Mozambican City Residents Under Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, March 17 (Xinhua) -- One-third Mozambican city
residents now live under the poverty line while more and more
rural people are pouring into cities of the country, the Noticias
newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
Currently 25 percent of the 17 million population in the
southern African country live in cities, Gabriel Dava, an
official of the Ministry for Planning and Finance, said on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The city population will reach six million in the country by
2000, he said.
</P>
<P>
The rates of unemployment and semi-unemployment are high in
Mozambican cities due to the mass inflows from rural areas during
the 16-year-old civil war and the privatization which started in
1987 and caused more than 90,000 people lose their jobs.
</P>
<P>
The war has ended but many of the rural comers remain to stay
in the cities, he said.
</P>
<P>
The lack of money input in agriculture, the low agricultural
production capacity and the poor living conditions in the rural
areas can hardly attract the labor force and become a big factor
for the increase of urban population, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Mozambican government will raise investments for
undertaking agricultural infrastructure and thus increase the
agricultural output under its strategy drafted in 1995 with goals
to reduce poverty, he said.
</P>
<P>
The government will also spread primary education, provide
basic medical services and drinking water, he added.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine Asks Foreigners to Pay ID Tax </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine is to launch a tax
collection program which will require foreigners making money in
Ukraine pay for identity cards bearing their photos and personal
tax identification number.
</P>
<P>
Ukrainian tax officials told a press conference today that the
cards, designed by the Ukrainian mint, are part of a nationwide
campaign to boost tax collection rates.
</P>
<P>
Tax identification numbers would also be assigned to all
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
While Ukrainian citizens will receive ID cards bearing their
tax numbers free of charge, foreigners would have to pay. The
price of the cards would be set this spring by the ministerial
cabinet said Viktor Moroz, head of the individual taxation
department of the National Tax Administration (NTA).
</P>
<P>
So far, 2000 foreigners had registered with tax authorities.
Most of the rest were simply unaware that they had to, said tax
officials.
</P>
<P>
Since Ukraine has signed agreements with many countries
eliminating double taxation, foreigners working there can choose
which national budget they want to contribute to.
</P>
<P>
"But they must register their income with the NTA in any case,"
said Vasyl Lopata, deputy head of the NTA.
</P>
<P>
Tax officials warned that foreigners hiding income and dodging
taxes would be prosecuted under Ukrainian laws.
</P>
<P>
"All individuals working in Ukraine must be equal before the law
regardless of their nationality or skin color," said Moroz.
</P>
<P>
The Ukrainian parliament adopted a law at the end of 1996,
punishing tax evasion by a prison term of two to seven years.
</P>
<P>
The NTA has already registered 20 million taxpayers. Lopata
said the agency planned to collect 38 billion hryvnas (21 billion
U.S. dollars) in taxes this year, up from 30 billion hryvnas (16
billion U.S. dollars) in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Sino-Portuguese JLG to Quicken Working Procedure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, March 17 (Xinhua) -- China and Portugal have agreed to
quicken their working procedure within the Sino-Portugal Joint
Liaison Group (JLG) on the transitional affairs of Macao, a top
Chinese diplomat said here today.
</P>
<P>
Guo Jiading, chief representative of the Chinese side on the
Sino-Portuguese JLG, made these remarks at a press briefing today
after a formal meeting with his Portuguese counterpart, Antonio
Santana Carlos. The meeting is a final preparation for the 28th
plenary session which will begin here tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
"The two sides have agreed that both sides should start from
the common understanding recently reached between leaders of the
two countries, quicken the working procedure of the JLG and work
hard so that a vigorous progress could be scored on the
transitional affairs of Macao," said Guo.
</P>
<P>
Portuguese President Jorge Sampaio visited Beijing last month.
During his meeting with Chinese President Jiang Zemin, the two
sides reached a common ground that the transitional affairs of
Macao should be handled from a strategic point of view and for the
overall benefit of Sino-Portuguese friendly cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"So long as we start from the general interests of Macao, and
from a higher viewpoint instead of being stick to some minor
interests, problems in Macao's transition will be resolved one by
one," the Chinese chief representative said.
</P>
<P>
Guo stressed that the transitional issues should be solved in
accordance of importance and urgency, as there are so many issues
remaining to be addressed.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese ambassador refused to brief on the topics to be
discussed in the upcoming 28th session, saying it will be "same as
in the past".
</P>
<P>
Under the joint communique of the 27th session of the JLG held
in Beijing last December, topics discussed in that session
included the three leading issues of the transition -- the
localization of civil service, law and the progress of the use of
Chinese as an official language -- as well as issue of
nationality, pension of retired civil servants, transfer of
government archives and the continuation of a Portuguese-speaking
school after 1999.
</P>
<P>
Antonio Santana Carlos, the Portuguese ambassador, said that it
is the responsibility of both sides to make efforts for the
progress in the settlement of some unsolved issues since there are
only less than three years times left before the handover.
</P>
<P>
He said that the two sides have been making vigorous efforts
for the progress of Macao's transitional affairs.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 17 (Xinhua) -- A senior Palestine Liberation
Organizatin (PLO) official today set up a tent on a hill
overlooking Jabal Abu Ghanaim (Har Homa) for a sit-in protest
against Israel's decision to build a new Jewish settlement there.
</P>
<P>
PLO Executive Committee member Faisal Husseini said he will
stay there every day to monitor Israel's actions on the planned
settlement site, according to a report of JMCC, a Palestinian
press service based in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
"We decided to have a peace tent so that we may watch what is
going on in the mountain if the Israelis enter with their
bulldozers, we will enter," Husseini told reporters.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, "We want to confront this Israeli plan by
peaceful means."
</P>
<P>
Husseini noted: "Mr. (Binyamin) Netanyahu is trying to say
that you (Palestinians) are here not for negotiations. You are
here to have what we will dictate on you. But this will not be
acceptable and I don't think (Palestinian President Yasser)
Arafat will accept this."
</P>
<P>
"There is enormous anger among the Palestinian people. I can
smell the same smell of pre-intifada (uprising). There will be an
explosion, but I don't know when it will come. The Israelis are
everyday feeding this explosion with more and more materials,"
the PLO official warned.
</P>
<P>
When asked whether an Arafat-Netanyahu summit will solve this
crisis, Husseini said that the past experiences showed that it
did not help much. "At first it gave us hope and then Israel
returned to the same policy," he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, according to the state-run Israel Radio, Defense
Minister Yitzhak Mordechai has ordered the Israel Defense Forces
to reinforce the West Bank to cope with any violence when
the Har Homa construction begins in a day or two this week.
</P>
<P>
Israeli-Palestinian relations have plummeted into a deep crisis over
the Israeli decision to 6,500 apartments in Har Homa in East
Jeruslaem, the sector the Palestinians claim as their future
capital. but Netanyahu has said he is determined to start the
construction this week.

BEIJING, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Opera and ballet both from home
and abroad will dominate this year's Chinese stages as the
Ministry of Culture and the Ministry of Radio, Film and Television
jointly designated 1997 as the "International Opera &AMP; Ballet Year".

<P>
According to organizers at today's press conference, twelve
opera or ballet troupes, five from home and seven from foreign
countries including the Democratic Republic of Korea, Russia,

<P>
They are expected to tour Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin and
several other Chinese cities, and present classical operas or
ballets such as "Swan Lake", "Sleeping Beauty", etc..

<P>
China's leading ballet troupe, the Central Ballet of China,
will unveil the activity with its repertory "Swan Lake" on March

Experts from China's cultural circle believed this is the first
time in China's cultural life that so many high-level opera and
ballet troupes will treat the Chinese audiences with so wide range
a list within one year.

<HEADLINE> More S. African Women Demand Death Penalty for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The increasing rape cases
in South Africa in the past three years have prompted women, both
black and white, into demanding the reinstatement of the death
penalty for rapists, said a survey released in Cape Town today.
</P>
<P>
Research Surveys, the South Africa's largest consumer research
company, in its latest findings said 49 percent of black women
and 46 percent of the white choose the death penalty as a
suitable punishment for rapists this year.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, only 24 percent black women and 29 percent of white
women voted for the punishment.
</P>
<P>
Eighty-six percent of all South African women felt that the
punishments meted out to convicted rapists are ineffective and
inadequate, according to the 1997 survey.
</P>
<P>
The figure stood at 59 percent of black women in 1994,
compared with 84 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
When asked what the suitable punishment should be, almost half
of both black and white women demanded the death sentence to be
reimposed, while 30 percent opt for life imprisonment and 10
percent prefer castration to be used as a form of punishment.

<P>
HARARE, March 17 (Xinhua) -- A three-day experts meeting of
the intergovernmental conference on language policies in Africa
started here today.
</P>
<P>
At the opening ceremony, Director of UNESCO sub-regional
office for Southern Africa A.B. Shankanga said until not too long
ago, there have been people who doubted the capacity of African
languages to serve as media for expressing abstract thoughts and
concepts relating to life in today's world.
</P>
<P>
This conference must be to formulate proposals for realistic
policy frameworks with reference to a number of fundamental
questions, arising from the research and other experiences as
discussed earlier, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that communication and culture in the global
supra-technological society of the 21st century will more rely on
languages as a sharpened tool for achieving shared goals, for
development and reducing poverty and deprivation.
</P>
<P>
Languages are tools for enhancing peace and unity within and
among countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the meeting G. Machinga said the meeting would
make a solid contribution to the forthcoming ministers meeting
set for March 20-21 which should launch African countries on a
path to draft and implement language policies.

after Albanian government bodies and enterprises returned to work.
</P>
<P>
Central and local government organs throughout the country as
well as businesses began to run as normal today. The

<HEADLINE> Phase 2 of EU-China Dairy Development Project Launched </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The second phase of the biggest
cooperative project in agriculture between the European Union and
China -- the EU-China Dairy Development Project was launched today.
</P>
<P>
Endymion Wilkinson, ambassador of the Delegation of the
European Commission to China, said the second phase of the
project, from November, 1996 to 2000, will "directly support
(Chinese) farmers and strengthen their role in the project areas."
</P>
<P>
The project will help the farmers become efficient milk
producers and thereby provide them with a sound income base from
dairying, according to the ambassador.
</P>
<P>
While assisting Chinese dairy corporations in the process of
economic reform and enterprise restructuring, Wilkinson said, the
project will strengthen links between the EU and the corporations,
facilitate technology transfer and foster long-term business
relationships.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Vice-Minister of Agriculture Zhang Yanxi said the
project, which started from 1988, has "dramatically" improved the
supply of milk in liquid form in the project areas.
</P>
<P>
It has contributed a lot to the growth of China's dairy
industry and pushed forward the exchanges between the two sides in
dairy production, Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
The vice-minister said he believes the new phase of the project
will help promote a "sustained and stable" development of the
dairy industry in the project areas and the country as a whole.
</P>
<P>
Among those attending the launching ceremony were
representatives from the provinces and cities of Northeast,
Northwest, East, North, Southwest and Central China that are
covered by the second phase of the project.
</P>
<P>
The EU will contribute to the second phase 30 million ECU,
matched by China with an equal amount.
</P>
<P>
In the first phase of the project which covered 1988 to 1993,
the EU offered assistance in forms of milk and butter valued at 40
million ECU to help the dairy sector get started in China's 20
largest cities.
</P>
<P>
The EU put into the interim phase of the dairy project, from
1995 to 1996, 6.8 million ECU in cash.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The bombing attack against a mosque
in Paris early today has aroused indignation from local officials,
who described the attack as an act which can only create a climate
of anxiety and incite mutual intolerance.
</P>
<P>
Roger Madec, the mayor of the 19th district of Paris, where the
bombing took place against the Adda'wa Mosque, expressed his
solidarity with the local Muslim community and called on the
residents of the district to "foil this provocation and preserve
calmness of the district."
</P>
<P>
He said that the mosque had been used by worshipers for 20
years without any problem.
</P>
<P>
The president of the Socialist Party group in the Council of
Paris (local legislature), Bertrand Delanoe, said that "this
criminal aggression appeared well as the signing of extremism
which threatens the principles of liberty, tolerance and cultural
and social coherence."
</P>
<P>
One security guard of the mosque was slightly wounded and some
damages were inflicted in the bombing attack early today, for
which no one has claimed responsibility.

<HEADLINE> More Results of Nigerian Elections Out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The United Nigeria Congress Party
(UNCP) is emerging as the number one party in the political scene
of Nigeria, as more results of Saturday's local government
elections are coming out.
</P>
<P>
According to newspaper reports today, the UNCP's candidates
won the chairmanship contest in 114 of the 350 local government
areas in 16 states, where the results are already known.
</P>
<P>
In half of the 16 states, the party won an overwhelming
majority. In Abuja, the capital city of Nigeria, it won five of
the six chairman seats. In Akwa-Ibom State, it swept 15 of the 17
councils.
</P>
<P>
In Lagos State, it won in eight of the 20 councils and is
likely to get more in the run-off elections in seven councils,
where a stalemate is reported in the first round.
</P>
<P>
The Democratic Party of Nigeria is the runner-up, bagging a
total 65 chairman seats. It won majorities in Oyo, Kano and Imo
states.
</P>
<P>
The Congress for National Consensus held the third place with
22 chairman seats.
</P>
<P>
The Grassroots Democratic Movement and the National Center
Party of Nigeria sealed 12 seats each.
</P>
<P>
Stalemates are reported in 90 councils in 13 states, where a
run-off is to be held later.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a U.S. election monitoring group has described
Saturday's election as a success, saying that the West can no
longer ignore Nigeria's transition to civil rule program.
</P>
<P>
However, the group warned that the U.S. would continue to be
skeptical about the transition program until it sees elected
chairmen and councillors assume office and exercise
constitutional powers.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian Navy Chief Meets Chinese Fleet Commander </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Navy Chief Vice
Admiral Ahmad Ramli Mohamed Noor today called for more frequent
exchange of visits between the navies of Malaysia and China to
strengthen their friendship.
</P>
<P>
"We should work closely for the common interest of the region,"
he said while meeting here with Commander of the East China Sea
Fleet of the Chinese PLA Navy Vice Admiral Yang Yushu who is
visiting Malaysia at the command of two Chinese naval ships.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that if China, Malaysia and other ASEAN countries
can work together, we can be strong enough to match with others
politically, economically and militarily," he noted.
</P>
<P>
He said political masters in Malaysia put importance to the
development of Malaysian-Chinese relations.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese naval ships, a missile destroyer and a missile
frigate, arrived at the Lumut port on March 15 for a three-day
goodwill visit to Malaysia. Lumut, located in Malaysia's northwest
state of Perak, about 288 kilometers from Kuala Lumpur, is the
largest naval base in Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
Welcoming the Chinese naval ships to the country, the Malaysian
Navy chief also expressed his hope that Malaysia could send its
naval ships to Chinese ports some time to promote the relations
between the two navies.
</P>
<P>
Ramli said the visit of the Chinese naval ships "opened a new
page in the modern history of our relations" and with exchange of
more visits, "the relations will grow from strength to strength."
</P>
<P>
On the occasion, Commander Yang thanked the Malaysian Navy for
inviting the Chinese naval task group to visit Malaysia, saying
that with the rapid development of bilateral relations between
China and Malaysia, the ties between the two armed forces
especially the two navies are also developing fast.
</P>
<P>
He said the Chinese naval ships came for friendship, for
promoting mutual understanding and for strengthening the friendly
relations between the two countries, the two armed forces and
especially the two navies.
</P>
<P>
The exchange of visits, which would deepen mutual
understanding, is conducive to the smooth development of
relationship between the two armed forces.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese naval ships came to Lumut after visiting Sattahib,
Thailand, and will leave Lumut for Manila, the Philippines, the
last leg of the task group's three-nation Southeast Asia tour.

SEOUL, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Two former South Korean
presidential advisors were charged Monday with pressuring banks to
give improper loans to the financially shaky Hanbo Business Group.
</P>
<P>
Han Yi-horn and Lee Suk-chae, who served in 1995 and 1996 as
top economic advisors to President Kim Young-sam, went on trial
today with eight other people in connection with loans to the

<P>
Hong In-gil, a ruling New Korea Party lawmaker, testified in
the Seoul District Criminal Court that he had requested two former
presidential aides to ask bank chiefs to grant loans to the Hanbo
group.
</P>
<P>
Opposition parties claimed that the presidential office was
directly involved in the scandal. Hong's testimony appeared to
substantiate opposition charges.
</P>
<P>
Today's trial opened as the government was trying to contain a
growing controversy over whether one of the president's sons
peddled his influence in the largest loans-for-bribes scandal in

who they will hand over to the Ugandan authorities.

<HEADLINE> Forest Fire Wreaks Havoc in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 17 (Xinhua) -- A series of forest fires have
broken out around Kenya during the current dry season, destroying
large tracts of forests and grass.
</P>
<P>
A fire broke out near Wandare in the Aberdare National Park on
the night of last Saturday as another one which started at
Mutubio last week spread to the area.
</P>
<P>
A Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) official said that the fire was
spreading fast Sunday because of strong winds and more than 70
square kilometers of moorland have been destroyed by the inferno.
</P>
<P>
The KWS has sent some 120 men to stop the fire from spreading
to the forested areas which sustain 40 different mammals and 200
bird species.
</P>
<P>
The Aberdare National Park covers an area of 767 square
kilometers and has more than 3,000 elephants and 2,000 buffalo.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that thousands of acres of the Mount Elgon
forest on both sides of the Kenyan and Ugandan border have been
destroyed by fire which has been raging for the last three weeks.
</P>
<P>
A forest official said that the fire was uncontrollable
because there was no adequate staff and equipment to combat it.
</P>
<P>
Forest fires also broke out in the Rift Valley province,
destroying about 1,500 hectares of tree plantations and another
1,000 hectares of indigenous trees.
</P>
<P>
The province has about 60 percent of the country's forests and
the Kenyan government earns about 20 million U.S. Dollars from
the sale of forest products in the province.
</P>
<P>
The fires are mainly started by farmers who burn vegetation in
preparation for planting before the coming rainy season beginning
from this month.
</P>
<P>
The government has declared a fire season in seven districts
of the province, under which farmers are prohibited from lighting
fires to burn vegetation outside their houses.

TEHRAN, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Minister of Defense and
Armed Forces Logistics Mohammad Forouzandeh today condemned the
U.S. military presence in the Gulf region and warned against
Israeli raid on Iranian targets.
</P>
<P>
The minister made the statement in an interview carried by
English daily Tehran Times here today.
</P>
<P>
He said "the security in the Persian Gulf should be maintained
by the regional countries and the presence of foreign powers in
the region is construed as provocation and interference."
</P>
<P>
In his response to joint military maneuvers conducted by the
United States and some regional countries, he said, "conducting
military maneuvers is also a clear example of such provocation
and meddling."
</P>
<P>
He said that Iran has frequently condemned such presence and
has reiterated that security will be properly enhanced through
the withdrawal of the foreign troops and cooperation of the
regional countries.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the Israeli threats against certain targets inside
the Iranian territory, Forouzandeh said, "Iran will strongly
retaliate against any air raids and military actions."
</P>
<P>
"Israel had better not commit such foolish acts. But if it
does, similar targets will be hit inside Israel," he warned.
</P>
<P>
He said that Iran's armed forces are completely prepared to
immediately respond to any threat with military might and
retaliate against any hostile act.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Iranian FM's Saudi Tour Meets Cautious </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Ali
Akbar Velayati's outgoing visit to Saudi Arabia has met cautious
welcome from the oil-rich kingdom, despite Iran's desire to
improve the strained ties with the Gulf
Arab state.
</P>
<P>
Iran has been at odds with the Gulf Arab states since the its
Islamic revolution began in 1979.
</P>
<P>
During his two-day visit to the Arab powerhouse, the first of
its kind in the past four years, Velayati held talks with his
Saudi counterpart Prince Saud Al-Faisal Al-Saud on a wide range of
issues. He also conveyed an invitation from Iranian President
Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani to Saudi King Fahd to attend the 8th
meeting of the Organization of Islamic Conference due in Tehran in
December.
</P>
<P>
Velayati proposed setting up a cooperation committee on
removing mistrust between the two big Gulf oil producers.
Before leaving Riyadh Sunday, he said that Iran and Saudi Arabia
had agreed on the need to rebuild trust between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the Iranian minister expressed the desire to
negotiate on the long-standing territorial dispute on the three
islands of the Greater and Lesser Tunbs and Abu Moussa in the
Gulf, which are held by Iran but also claimed by the United Arab
Emirates (UAE).
</P>
<P>
The issue is believed to be a major problem obstructing the
improvement of the ties between Iran and the Gulf Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Velayati conveyed a message from Rafsanjani to
Saudi Crown Prince Abdallah Ibn Abdul Aziz on bilateral relations
and other issues of mutual interest.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Rafsanjani called for getting rid of the differences
existing between Iran and Saudi Arabia and for cooperation on the
annual Muslim pilgrimage to Mecca, a holy site to Muslims.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of regional security, Velayati's remarks echoed a
recent declaration in Washington by Saudi Defense Minister Prince
Sultan Ibn Abdul Aziz, who said the Gulf security rests with the
countries of the region.
</P>
<P>
Velayati claimed that the Gulf countries bear responsibility
for security in the region, saying that "Iran is convinced that
the security of the Gulf is the responsibility of its sons."
</P>
<P>
Saudi officials and the public opinion held
that all these have shown Iran's wish to "turn a new page" in
its ties with the kingdom through establishment of normal ties
based on "mutual respect and non-interference" with each other's
internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
Local reports said "Velayati's intentions are good and
acceptable, and this applies also to his proposals and wishes
for the future of bilateral ties."
</P>
<P>
The Gulf Cooperation Council members, namely, Saudi Arabia,
Kuwait, the UAE, Oman, Qatar and Bahrain, consider Iran an
important regional state and an integral part of the regional
security.
</P>
<P>
Observers here believe that only by removing several existing
thorny problems blocking the way, can substantial improvement of
the close relations be established between the two oil-rich nations.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic sources here said they did not see any sign that the
islands dispute with UAE will be resolved before great efforts
and substantial concessions are made by either of the two sides
because the issue is a matter of state integrity and sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
Besides, Tehran and Riyadh differ on the question of the
U.S. military presence and that of other Western states in the
Gulf. Iran is critical of the Western presence, including about
5,000 U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia, which Iran says contributes to
regional tension.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia and its Gulf Arab allies have accused Iran of
interfering with their internal affairs, and voiced concern over
its arms build-up. But Iran has denied the charges.
</P>
<P>
Investigation of the truck bomb explosion in Saudi Arabia
last June, which killed 19 U.S. airmen and wounded hundreds of
others, is still going on amidst allegations that the terrorist
accident had something to do with the Iranian-backed Lebanese
fundamentalist guerrilla of Hezbollah.

Their combined turnover went up by 15.0 percent to 374.85
trillion won (428.68 billion dollars), said the survey.

their profits," a DERI researcher said.
</P>
<P>
The 372 manufacturing firms out of the 508 companies registered
a 75.6 percent fall in their 1996 net profits, with a decreased

DAR ES SALAAM, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of livestock and
wild animals are dying of thirst in the Arusha Region, northern
Tanzania, where has been seriously hit by a long dry spell.
</P>
<P>
A report reaching here today quoted Arusha Regional
Commissioner Danile Ole Njoolay as saying in Arusha on Sunday
that all districts in the region have been affected.
</P>
<P>
The situation is seen worst in Monduli where all dams and
ponds have dried up and famine has set in.
</P>
<P>
Unconfirmed reports say that at least four children have died
of hunger in Monduli District.
</P>
<P>
However, Njoolay said his office has not yet received such
reports.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that a team of journalists visited Moita
Bwawani, Lendekenya, Simingori, Engikaret, Lashaine, Lepruki,
Lenikatan and Longido villages in Monduli District and witnessed
more than 20 carcasses of cattle, zebras and monkeys.
</P>
<P>
A member of the Moita Bwawani villlage government, Mhina
Simango, told the journalists that at least 80 heads of cattle
were dying of thirst there daily, forcing livestock keepers to
move away in search of water since September.
</P>
<P>
The regional commissioner said Monduli District did not get
short rains and it last rained in March last year.
</P>
<P>
"It had been dry ever," Njoolay noted.
</P>
<P>
He said as of last Thursday, 272,477 people in 189 villages in
the region were in need of emergency food relief, adding the
region needed 24,500 tons of cereals and 5,000 tons of pulses.
</P>
<P>
Njoolay said his office reported the problem to the Disaster
Relief Unit in the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) in January and
also approached several local and international non-governmental
organizations (NGOs) for assistance.
</P>
<P>
He said the World Vision, a NGO, has started distributing food
in the Simanjiro and Arumeru districts, which the PMO has
allocated the region with 3,000 tons of maize from the strategic
grains reserve (SGR) unit.

<HEADLINE> S. African Whites Still Get Plum Jobs: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 17 (Xinhua) -- South African whites are
still getting the best jobs and among the highest-paid employees
in the country, local daily The Star reported today.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted a survey by the University of Cape Town
as saying that most companies used the Paterson system of grading
for employees from bands A to F.
</P>
<P>
Employees are graded according to duties and responsibilities,
with A-band starting salaries around 1,700 Rands (386 U.S.
Dollars) while F-band ranges from 25,000 Rands (5,682 Dollars)
upwards.
</P>
<P>
The survey found that 12 percent of the whites, 82 percent of
the blacks, four percent of the colored and two percent of
Indians were not graded at all.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 96 percent of the whites in top management held
F-bands as opposed to three percent of the blacks, 0.36 percent
of the colored and 0.18 percent of Indians.
</P>
<P>
Black employees made up 90 percent of the A-band, against one
percent of the whites, seven percent of the colored and one
percent of Indians, the survey showed.
</P>
<P>
South African Labor Minister Tito Mboweni's spokesman Estelle
Randall said earlier there were major changes in staff
demographics of the public service, but the department could not
answer for the actions of companies in the private sector.
</P>
<P>
Black Management Forum consultant Cecilia Sithole was quoted
as saying that the new South Africa, which abolished apartheid
system in 1994, had failed to bring about equity in the
workplace.
</P>
<P>
The only movement is in terms of lower and middle mangement
while for senior positions many companies are operating under the
guise of qualifications and labor, Sithole said

<HEADLINE> African Leaders Warned by Ugandan President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Y. Museveni
has warned African leaders not to repeat the mistakes made by
their predecessors in the early 1960s and 1970s by confusing
nationalism with economic development.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks when opening a three-day Sub-Saharan
Africa regional ministerial conference on good governance for
private sector development and investment in nearby Entebbe on
Sunday, the New Vision newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
African leaders blundered in nationalizing the means of
production, mistaking it for nationalism that would lead to
speedy development, said Museveni.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, it stifled private enterprise, weakened the African
society and became a major factor in bad governance, he claimed.
</P>
<P>
Uganda will continue its structural adjustment programs (SAP)
whether the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund insist
on it or not, he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the continuation of SAP would foster the
macro-economic stability in the eastern African country.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan Minister of Public Service Apollo Nsibambi said
sustainable development and good governance are inter-linked.
</P>
<P>
He called for efficiency and effectiveness in the African
public sector which in turn will facilitate the development of
the sector itself.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 delegates from 18 African countries and the
donor community attended the opening ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The conference is jointly organized by the government of
Uganda, the Economic Institute, the Ugandan Manufacturers'
Association, the World Bank and the British Overseas Development
Association.

<HEADLINE> 245 Evacuated Turks from Albania Arrive in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Two hundred and forty-five
Turkish citizens, who were evacuated from Albania, arrived
peacefully this morning in Istanbul, the largest city of Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The evacuation was facilitated with the help of the Turkish
armed forces, the semi-official Anatolia News Agency reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The agency said that two Boeing 737 passenger planes of the
Turkish Airlines, which took the evacuees from the city of Bari,
Italy, late Sunday night, landed on the Ataturk Airport early
this morning.
</P>
<P>
The agency quoted Belcis Girengir, a Turk who just arrived in
Istanbul, as saying: "We stayed in Tirana together with other
Turks for two days. We planed to leave Tirana on Saturday. But,
the evacuation was delayed until Sunday due to many children and
families and weak security."
</P>
<P>
Many of the Turks caught in the midst of the anarchy sweeping
Albania fled via the Adriatic port of Dirac in boats after
leaving Tirana and Elbasan in buses accompanied by Albanian
policemen.
</P>
<P>
The Turks were taken on board a Turkish frigate waiting on
the coast to take the evacuees to Bari before being transported
back to Turkey.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: More Measures Taken, Situation Worsening in Albania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Albanian President Sali Berisha
today has strengthened his efforts to end the unrest in the
country by announcing amnesty to 51 prisoners, including the
opposition Socialist Party Chairman Fatos Nano.
</P>
<P>
The amnesty was seen as another good measure by Berisha to end
the unrest which has gripped the Balkan country since January.
</P>
<P>
Berisha is widely blamed for the unrest caused by the collapse
of pyramid investment schemes in which thousands of Albanians lost
their lifetime savings, and he is also faced with growing demands
for his resignation.
</P>
<P>
Nano was sentenced 12 years in prison in 1993 for alleged
economic crimes.
</P>
<P>
As soon as emerging from prison, Nano, described as the major
political rival against Berisha, said he would do everything in
his power to support the new coalition government led by his
comrade Bashkim Fino, who was appointed by Berisha as prime
minister of the national reconciliation government last week.
</P>
<P>
After their meeting Sunday, both Berisha and Fino vowed to
strengthen cooperation to overcome the present difficulties and
fully respect each other's constitutional power.
</P>
<P>
This was the first time that Berisha, who belongs to the ruling
Democratic Party, agreed to cooperate with the Socialist Party
which he once said he would never cooperate with.
</P>
<P>
However, the situation is still worsening, with more than 100
people killed and thousands wounded in the unrest.
</P>
<P>
After looting weapons from military depots, armed protesters
burnt and plundered wherever they went. Several cities in the
southern part of the country remain in the control of the armed
protesters.
</P>
<P>
Latest statistics show that up to 4,000 terrified Albanians
have crossed the rough Adriatic sea in recent days in an array of
old boats to escape the violence engulfing much of their
country. And more are still making efforts to leave for
neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has appealed
to Albania's neighbors, Italy and Greece, to shelter the refugees
from the violent Balkan state.
</P>
<P>
The European Union (EU), repeatedly urged by President Berisha
to provide military assistance to restore Albanian order, agreed
on Saturday to send military and police advisers, instead of
outright military intervention, into the nation because EU foreign
ministers are deeply divided at a meeting over whether troops
should be sent to Albania.
</P>
<P>
Italy, Greece, Denmark and France are in favor of military
intervention of some sort, while Britain, Germany and Sweden are
vehemently opposed to this action.

<HEADLINE> PNG Defense Force Chief Against Use of Mercenaries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The commander of Papua New
Guinea's (PNG) Defense Force today visited the governor-general
and asked him to dismiss the prime minister over his planned use
of foreign mercenaries against the secessionists in Bougainville.
</P>
<P>
According to reports from Port Moresby, capital of the South
Pacific island nation, the country's Defense Force Chief Jerry
Singirok denied his actions amounted to a military coup, saying
they were sparked by the government's decision to hire foreign
mercenaries.
</P>
<P>
He said over the local radio after meeting the governor-general
that he could not stand by and let the government spend so much
money on foreign troops while the country's own soldiers are left
without food, pay and supplies.
</P>
<P>
Singirok said he has lost confidence in Julius Chan's
government and he would refuse to lead troops into the conflict in
Bougainville. He also pledged to have the mercenaries expelled
from his country.
</P>
<P>
But constitutional experts said Governor-General Wiwa Korowi
lacks the constitutional authority to dismiss the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
According to earlier reports, the Chan government signed a
contract with the British firm Sandline International, which has
provided mercenaries to train PNG troops for use in the war in
Bougainville.
</P>
<P>
The mercenaries, numbering about 40, are now at a remote camp
near Wewak in the country's northwest coast, providing training
for up to 150 soldiers.

<HEADLINE> IRRI Completes Staff Restructuring Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The International Rice Research
Institute (IRRI) announced today that it has completed its staff
restructuring program, with 520 staff members laid off due to
large shortfalls in its funds.
</P>
<P>
The institute, located some 65 kilometers south of Manila, said
in a statement that the dismissed employees include 505 Filipino
staff members and 15 internationally recruited scientists.
</P>
<P>
Funding shortfalls in 1996 and 1997 forced the IRRI to carry
out the latest staff reduction, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The shortfalls -- 2 million U.S. dollars in 1996 and 6 million
in 1997 -- stem from the inability of several of IRRI's major
donors to maintain previous funding levels. This is part of a
trend which has seen a drop in funding for agricultural research
around the world," it added.
</P>
<P>
Established in 1960, the IRRI is a nonprofit international
agricultural research and training center that carries out rice
and rice-related research in an effort to maintain and increase
rice production worldwide.
</P>
<P>
This is the third major staff cut the IRRI has made since 1989.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the IRRI will devolve some of its research and
training activities on national rice research systems in
developing countries.
</P>
<P>
IRRI Director General George Rothschild expressed the belief
that his institute should end 1997 in a much better position.
</P>
<P>
"However, we need to generate more financial support for the
future if we are to continue our progress toward finding
scientific solutions that will help ease the looming severe
shortage in Asia of the region's number one basic food -- rice,"
he said.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Makes Progress in Child Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam has made big progress in
protecting and caring children, but is still facing great
challenges, Vietnam News Agency (VNA) reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
VNA quoted an representative of the United Nations Children's
Fund (UNICEF) to Vietnam as saying that Vietnam topped the
UNICEF's global national performance list last year since it has
reduced under-five children's mortality rate for the fourth
successive year.
</P>
<P>
Over 85 percent of the under-one children are immunized every
year since 1991 and 98 percent vaccinated against polio.
</P>
<P>
The rate of malnutrition among under-five dropped to 44 percent
last year from 54 percent in 1991.
</P>
<P>
More than 85 percent of children at school age went to schools
in 1995, compared with only 75 percent in 1991.
</P>
<P>
However, Vietnam is still facing great challenges in child
protection and education. At present there are more than 16,000
street children in Vietnam, many of whom are induced into
prostitution, drug abuse and robbery.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka, Delhi to Discuss Sharing of Teesta Water </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dhaka, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh and India will discuss a
permanent arrangement for sharing the Teesta water at a meeting of
the reactivated Joint Rivers Commission (JRC), due to be held here
in the first week of April, sources concerned said here today.
</P>
<P>
The two countries share 54 common rivers, but they have an
agreement only on the Ganges water.
</P>
<P>
Besides reviewing the progress of the Ganges water accord
reached last December, the JRC meeting will also discuss flood
management, problems of cross-border rivers, irrigation and
water-related issues.
</P>
<P>
This would be the 32nd meeting of the JRC, a forum constituted
in 1972 for consultation on water issues between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
However, the JRC has remained dormant for a long time and this
would be its first meeting in seven years. Its last meeting was
held here in June 1990.
</P>
<P>
The decision to reactivate the JRC was announced after the
official talks between Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina
and her Indian counterpart, H. D. Deve Gowda, here on January 6.
</P>
<P>
The planned talks on finding a permanent water sharing formula
for the Teesta River would be very crucial as both countries have
constructed barrages on the river, said the sources.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh began the Teesta barrage project in 1979 and
completed it in 1989.
</P>
<P>
The project, along with a 4,500-kilometer-long canal network
system for irrigation, is the largest irrigation project in the
country.
</P>
<P>
A permanent agreement with India on sharing the Teesta water
would allow uninhibited and optimum use of the Teesta barrage, the
sources added.

<HEADLINE> Power Supply in Bangladesh's 37 Districts to be </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Power supply in 37 northern and
southern districts, which was disrupted last Friday, may be
restored this evening, according to sources in the Power
Development Board (PDB).
</P>
<P>
Power supply to northern and southern Bangladesh snapped as two
grid towers on the east-west interconnector power transmission
line "mysteriously" collapsed in Pabna district Friday night.
</P>
<P>
A team of PDB engineers and officials is working round the
clock in Pabna to restore power supply in these affected
districts, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The government, who is suspecting "anti-state elements" might
have been involved in this accident, has formed a committee to
probe the collapse of the towers which weigh no less than 22 tons
each.
</P>
<P>
"We are trying to find out what is happening there," said Prime
Minister Sheikh Hasina on Sunday. She alleged that a vested
quarter was carrying out sabotage to disrupt normal public life
and urged people to be on the alert against such acts.
</P>
<P>
"They have indulged in the acts of sabotage being frustrated
after losing power," Hasina said, in an apparent reference to her
arch rival , the Bangladesh Nationalist Party headed by former
prime minister Khaleda Zia.
</P>
<P>
Hasina, who took power just nine months ago, told a meeting at
the institution of engineers that her government was trying hard
to overcome the present crisis in the power sector.
</P>
<P>
It takes time to set up a plant for generating power and the
government is taking steps to solve the problem as soon as
possible, the prime minister added.

<P>
BANGKOK, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Thai police need more sniff dogs
to help them crack down illegal drugs more efficiently, a senior
Thai official said.
</P>
<P>
Sniff dogs are absolutely necessary as drug dealers have
developed ingenious methods of concealment, Thai deputy interior
minister Chalerm Yoobamrung said last weekend.
</P>
<P>
The Thai Police Department now has only eight sniff dogs, and
only three of them work efficiently, he said.
</P>
<P>
The ministry is seeking the cabinet's approval to buy more than
200 sniff dogs to assist police in search for illegal drugs.

<HEADLINE> Legalization of Abortion Urged in Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Doctors and social workers in
Nepal have urged the authorities to legalize abortion, saying that
it will reduce maternal mortality significantly in the country.
</P>
<P>
Participants at a two-day seminar on "women's health and
termination of pregnancy", which opened here Sunday, said more
than half of the maternal mortality in Nepal are caused by induced
abortion.
</P>
<P>
Women from poor families are at risk of their lives when they
carry undesired pregnancy because abortion is illegal in the
country, they said.
</P>
<P>
Citing the example of the neighboring India, which has reduced
the maternal mortality from 7.8 to 0.66 out of one thousand after
the introduction of an act on medical termination of pregnancy,
the participants said Nepal should follow suit.
</P>
<P>
As Nepal's existing law bans abortion, private clinics and
traditional birth attendants often carry out abortion without
proper sanitation and care, according to them.
</P>
<P>
They also stressed the need to safeguard women's health while
liberalizing abortion.
</P>
<P>
Official figures show that about 100,000 Nepali women get
pregnancy every year and some 40 percent of them are at risk of
life because of pregnancy.

<HEADLINE> Strike Halts Cargo Handling at Bangladesh's Port </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 17 (Xinhua) -- cargo handling has remained stalled
since Saturday at Bangladesh's largest Chittagong port as dock
workers continued their protest against the handling of cargo by a
private shipping firm, according to port sources.
</P>
<P>
The workers went on a wild-cat strike at the call of their
collective bargaining agent (CBA) when the Q.C. shipping agency
was allowed to use its own equipment inside the port area to
handle the container cargo in its ship under a privatization
policy adopted recently.
</P>
<P>
A meeting was held on Sunday between the officials of the
Chittagong Port Authority (CPA) and CBA leaders, who demanded the
withdrawal of the order for use of forklifts inside the port.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Bangladesh Master Stevedores Association also
held a meeting with the CPA chairman and other port officials.
</P>
<P>
"We imported the equipment and took them to the port area after
obtaining permission from the relevant authorities," said the
association leaders, refusing to withdraw the equipment.
</P>
<P>
Chittagong Mayor A.B.M. Mohiuddin Ahmed was continuing his
efforts to end the work stoppage while union leaders have
threatened to lay a siege to the port today, said the port
sources.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that at least 23 ships have been stranded due to
the strike.

TIRANA, March 16 (Xinhua) -- The local authorities in Fier,
Albania today issued an emergent appeal for the quick return of 10
radioactive metal plates stolen by rioters, saying that they could
cause disastrous consequences if the return is delayed.
</P>
<P>
The 10 plates, 10cm in both length and width, are terribly
harmful to the health of the human being. They were stolen when
rioters ransacked a military depot in Fier, the Albanian Telegraph
Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
Unrest in this Balkan country started in January following the
collapse of government investment schemes that caused more than
one third Albanians to lose their savings. The situation has been
deteriorating with more than 100 people killed in the violence.
President Sali Berisha has taken a series of measures trying to
end the crisis.

BELGRADE, March 16 (Xinhua) -- The sponsor of the Dayton Peace

couldn't survive economically unless they operate as a whole
economic entity.
</P>
<P>
"That sounds funny, but Bosnia's interest today lies in the

<P>
He was responding to a question by the magazine if Bosnia could
survive. He said Sarajevo and Yugoslavia should start contact now
and cooperation between them is the only way for their survivals.
</P>
<P>
However, he added that it would be difficult for Bosnian
President, Alija Izetbegovic, to do that, because he was once
opposed to Serbians. But now, he said, it's the time for
conciliation.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Crack Down on Illegal Foreign Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The Thai immigration authorities
and police will start a crackdown on the illegal employment of
foreign laborers as the deadline for the registration of immigrant
workers has passed, a report said today.
</P>
<P>
The Thai government had agreed to allow the employment of
illegal immigrants in Thailand's 43 provinces provided the
employers registered them between September 1 and November 29,
1996. The deadline was extended to March 15 this year to allow the
officials to complete registration cards for the workers.
</P>
<P>
According to the Thai National Security Council, only half of
the estimated 700,000 illegal immigrants registered with the labor
and social welfare department despite the extended deadline.
</P>
<P>
As a result, strict legal action will now be taken against the
employers and the workers who have refused to register, the
council's deputy chief, Kachadpai Buruspat, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said the authorities concerned have been instructed to
strictly enforce the law governing the employment of illegal
immigrants.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the employers and their foreign workers, the
crackdown will also be directed at rackets smuggling foreign
laborers into Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Kachadpai said a large number of foreign laborers had been
brought into the country by these racketeers and drastic action
would be taken to prevent the problem developing into a threat to
national security.

<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Albanian President Sali Berisha
today announced amnesty to 51 prisoners, including Fatos Nano,
chairman of the Albanian Socialist Party.
</P>
<P>
Nano, who was transferred to a Tirana prison from Tepelena last
month, came out of the prison this month as the prison guards had
left during the unrest.
</P>
<P>
Nano, who was sentenced to 12 years in prison in 1993 on
charges of "economic crime," is described as a major political
rival of President Berisha.
</P>
<P>
The amnesty was seen as a good gesture shown by Berisha to the
Socialist Party under the present circumstances.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 people have been killed in the riots, which swept
the Balkan country after the collapse of government investment
schemes in which hundreds and thousands of Albanians lost their
savings.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of terrified Albanian refugees, despite of rough
seas, have crossed the Adriatic in recent days in an array of old
boats to escape the violence engulfing much of their country.
</P>

advisers but ruled out military intervention to end the worsening

<P>
KATHMANDU, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Nepali Prime Minister Lokendra
Bahadur Chand has registered a motion seeking a vote of confidence
for his newly formed government in the lower house of parliament.
</P>
<P>
The motion was registered at the parliament secretariat Sunday,
five days after Chand's three-party government assumed office to
replace a coalition government led by Sher Bahadur Deuba of the
Nepali Congress (NC) party.
</P>
<P>
Chand, a senior leader of the former ruling partner National
Democratic Party (RPP), formed the new government with the former
main opposition the Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxist
Leninist, CPN-UML) and another former ruling partner the Nepal
Goodwill Party (NSP).
</P>
<P>
The 18-month Deuba government fell down 10 days ago after
losing a confidence vote in parliament partly due to the ruling
partners' withdrawal from the coalition.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that the new government's confidence motion,
which needs a majority of at least 103 votes to pass in the
205-seat house, will be tabled and voted in the house on
Wednesday.

JAKARTA, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian companies are planning
to embark on major investment valued at 5 billion U.S. dollars in
the Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand-Growth Triangle (IMT-GT), Antara
news agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
A major part of the investment will go to plantation, industry

meeting held in Banda Aceh, Indonesia.

reasons behind the stagnation of some memorandums of understanding
(MOUs) signed within the framework of the cooperation, and seek a
solution, Antara said.
</P>
<P>
Out of 43 MOUs that have been signed by the three countries,
only 14 have been realized, according to official sources.

<HEADLINE> Retooling Required in Leather Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 17 (Xinhua) -- China's leather industry has to
undertake massive modernization to ensure sustained growth in the
future.
</P>
<P>
The production and export of leather products in 1996 remained
almost the same as 1995.
</P>
<P>
Today's China Daily attributed the industry's stagnance partly
to sagging demand on domestic and international markets.
</P>
<P>
A more important reason is that China's leather industry is
experiencing a transitional period and the industry needs
extensive technical renovation to make quality products for market
demand.
</P>
<P>
Since the late 1980s, the industry has experienced rapid growth
to make China one of the major leather producers and one of the
largest markets in the world.
</P>
<P>
The number of leather enterprises in the country increased to
20,000 in 1996 from 1989's 3,000 and the export value of leather
products reported double-digit increase each year during the
period.
</P>
<P>
But most Chinese leather enterprises are poorly equipped and
most of their products are low-grade.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said the industry still has a bright future when
the transition ends. China not only has cheap labor but also the
most abundant hide resources in the world.
</P>
<P>
Realizing the problem, many firms have begun to upgrade their
products as a new way to make profits, said the newspaper.

<HEADLINE> Italian PM Calls for Order Restoration in Albania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi
said today order should be restored in Albania as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Prodi was speaking in the southern port of Brindisi, where
thousands of Albanian refugees were seeking asylum from anarchy
back home.
</P>
<P>
Talking about the European Union's (EU) decision a few hours
ago to send military and police advisers to Albania, Prodi said
that it was the most serious solution at this time.
</P>
<P>
He underscored that the mission was of a civilian nature, not a
military operation. The mission would help in the social, economic
and political reconstruction of Albania, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Prime Minister also appealed to Albanians not to flee their
homeland, stressing that it was not through flight that they could
solve their country's problem.

<HEADLINE> Timepiece Industry Slumps </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The timepiece industry witnessed
stagnated sales and slumped profits last year after continuous
growth in previous years, said today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The total production of watches, including those processed with
imported materials and for export, increased moderately to 360
million and that of clocks reached 170 million in 1996.
</P>
<P>
But watch sales decreased ten percent and that of clocks
dropped seven percent during the year.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper attributed the slump partly to overgrowth of the
industry in the past five years.
</P>
<P>
Production of low- and medium-quality watches and clocks
ballooned in past years, saturating the domestic market.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, watches and clocks are no longer the only
timepieces. As new products such as beepers and computers spread
widely, people can rely on the time-telling function of these
products.
</P>
<P>
Sales of watches, once a favorite choice as gifts, are
challenged by new gift choices such as fresh flowers, small
household electric appliances and books.
</P>
<P>
Opportunities for timepiece makers mainly lie in children's
watches, high and medium wood clocks, and high quality table
clocks, the newspaper said.

Among them were old people, women, youth and children. They

<HEADLINE> Albanian President, Prime Minister Meet on Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Albanian President Sali Berisha
and Prime Minister Bashkim Fino met today and agreed to strengthen
cooperation on the current crisis.
</P>
<P>
Both Berisha, who belongs to the Democratic Party, and Fino,
who belongs to the Socialist Party, said they will cooperate to
overcome the present difficulties and fully respect each other's
constitutional power, sources of the Presidential Palace said.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time that Berisha agreed to cooperate with
the Socialist Party.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the two leaders agreed that the national
reconciliation program worked out by Berisha and other major
parties on March 9 was the only and best solution to the crisis,
the sources said.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Fino also met with major party leaders and said
after the meeting, "To restore order is the top priority at the
moment and there have appeared some optimistic signs following
mass mobilization."
</P>
<P>
Albania has been in the grip of unrest since January after the
collapse of pyramid investment schemes in which thousands of
Albanians lost their life savings.
</P>
<P>
The protest turned violent more than two weeks ago as rebels
looted weapons from army depots. Several cities in the southern
part of the country are now controlled by rebels.
</P>
<P>
Tirana itself has also witnessed growing unrest as mobs looted
a warehouse of 650 tons of flour last Thursday and raided security
force depots in search of guns.
</P>
<P>
President Berisha deployed tanks in front of the main
institutions in the country and called on the European Union (EU)
to provide military assistance to Tirana to restore order.
</P>
<P>
The EU agreed Saturday to send military and police advisers
instead of troops to Albania.

<HEADLINE> Afforestation Benefits River Basin Areas in Tibet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Large scale afforestation efforts
have created better conditions for agricultural production in
Tibet's main crop-planting areas.
</P>
<P>
The Yarlung Zangbo river basin's crops account for two thirds of
Tibet's total output. Tree-planting drives have been on-going
since the 1970's.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that to date nearly 10,000 hectares of shelter
forest has been planted on both sides of the sand-threatened
river, stabilizing dunes and reclaiming 25,000 hectares of
wastelands.
</P>
<P>
A survey estimates that the direct and indirect benefits of the
sheltering forest along Yarlung Zangbo river are worth 114 million
yuan (11 million US dollars).

<P>
WENZHOU, March 17 (Xinhua) -- An obscure Chinese city is now
the world's largest cigarette lighter producer and exporter.
</P>
<P>
Wenzhou, in east China's Zhejiang Province, last year produced
about 100 million lighters, of which 70 percent were exported to
markets worldwide. The lighters earned the city 500 million yuan
from export.
</P>
<P>
Consumers and lighter dealers now can find 2,000-odd lighter
varieties in the local market. "The overwhelming majority of
wind-proof lighters sold worldwide are manufactured here," a local
trader said.

<HEADLINE> Package Industry Seeing Regional Oversupply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 17 (Xinhua) -- China's packaging industry is
plagued by regional oversupply though it witnessed rapid growth of
an annual average of ten percent since 1980.
</P>
<P>
The industry completed output of 126 billion yuan-worth in
1996, up from 114.5 billion yuan in the previous year, according
to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Because local authorities widely regard packaging as a
profitable industry, about 15,000 such firms have emerged mainly
in coastal areas, which resulted in a regional glut.
</P>
<P>
The packaging industry should be adjusted, shifting from
coastal areas to the western inland, an high-ranking official from
the China Packaging Technology Association was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
In pop-top can production, for example, the existing 35 firms
are capable of a total annual output of 15 billion cans. However,
half of them are idle.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, China suffers huge losses caused by improper
packaging.
</P>
<P>
In spite of the fact that some entrepreneurs devalued the
importance of packaging for their products, the packaging industry
has grown explosively since China adopted economic reforms in the
late 1970s, said the official.
</P>
<P>
At present, the country packs 3,000 billion yuan-worth of
agricultural and industrial products and more than 100 billion US
dollar-worth of export commodities every year.

<HEADLINE> Liver, Gall Bladder Surgery Fund Established in Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, March 17 (Xinhua) -- A fund to pay for liver and gall
bladder surgery, named after Wu Mengchao, a medical specialist and
academician with the Chinese Academy of Sciences, has been
established in China's largest financial center.
</P>
<P>
China has a fairly high incidence of liver cancer, with 430,000
cases reported each year, or 45 percent of the world's total.
Liver cancer is the second major cause of death from cancer in
China, and about 30 to 50 billion yuan (3.6 to 6 billion US
dollars) is spent each year in treating people suffering from the
deadly disease.
</P>
<P>
The fund was started with a 400,000-yuan (48,000 US dollars)
donation by Professor Wu, who is at Shanghai's No. 2 Military
Medical University, part of which came from the Ho Leung Ho Lee
Prize, the country's largest non-governmental award for scientific
development, which he was given.
</P>
<P>
The fund also received three million yuan from the city's
Guanghua Education Foundation, 1.2 million yuan from Wang Yanfang,
a resident of Shanghai, and donations from other social
organizations and individuals.
</P>
<P>
The five-million-yuan fund will be used to award new
discoveries in liver and gall bladder disease research and to
support efforts to make China's scientific and technological
developments in this field on a par with the world's most
advanced.

<HEADLINE> Northeast China's Sandy Wind Being Put Under Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, March 17 (Xinhua) -- More than 900,000 ha of forests
that were planted in the midwestern part of northeast China's
Jilin Province over the past 20 years are still holding their own.
</P>
<P>
The sandy wind that used to devastate farmland here has
basically been put under control thanks to the man-made forests,
local officials say.
</P>
<P>
In this area, annual precipitation amounts to less than 400 mm,
but more than 1,300 mm evaporate, and when the central government
decided to set up a shelter-belt system in northern China in the
1970s, Jilin Province naturally became part of the plan.
</P>
<P>
Focus was on its midwestern section, which would cover 8.17
million ha, or 43.1 percent of the province's total area. So far,
70 percent of the province's afforestation plan has been completed.
</P>
<P>
A shelter-belt has basically taken shape, providing shelter for
more than 2.5 million ha of farmland and increasing annual grain
output by some 2.6 billion kg.
</P>
<P>
The area affected by wind and sand has decreased from 7.3
million ha in the 1970s to 310,000 ha, and the province started
the third phase of the afforestation plan last year and has
planted 45,000 ha of forests.

<HEADLINE> Alphand Wins Overall Title, Jagge Captures Slalom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Norway's Finn Christian Jagge
won the last race of the World Cup season while France's Luc
Alphand took the World Cup overall champion after the men's slalom
at Vail, Colorado today.
</P>
<P>
The 31-year-old Alphand achieved the victory when Kjetil Andre
Aamodt of Norway, his only rival for the overall title, failed to
finish first or second in the climactic slalom.
</P>
<P>
Alphand became the first French overall champion since
Jean-Claude Killy 29 years ago and is the first speed specialist
ever to win the crown.
</P>
<P>
Aamodt battled back on Sunday after standing 16th in the first
run. He skied the second fastest second leg but saw his faint
hope extinguished when Austrian Mario Reiter, the 15th of 21
skiers, bumped him out of second place to place him to the seventh
place at last with a time of 1:39.01.
</P>
<P>
Jagge led by a comfortable 0.73 of a second after a blistering
run through the 62-gate course on Vail Mountain. He skied a
combined time of one minute 37.94 seconds, 0.12 of a second faster
than Austrian Thomas Stangassinger.
</P>
<P>
Italian star Alberto Tomba finished third in 1:38.19,
three-tenths of a second better than Reiter.
</P>
<P>
Swiss giant slalom champion Michael von Gruenigen finished
fifth.
</P>
<P>
The victory boosted Jagge into third place in the final slalom
standings behind champion Thomas Sykora of Austria, who finished
ninth on Sunday, and second-placed Stangassinger.
</P>
<P>
Jagge sneaked past France's Sebastien Amiez into third place by
just one point, 374-373.
</P>
<P>
However, Amiez, slalom silver medalist at the world
championships, after missing a gate in his first run, skied back
to complete the leg to finish 18th.
</P>
<P>
Alphand finished the season with 1,130 points, built upon four
downhill and two Super-G victories. Aamodt had 1,096 points, 75
ahead of Austrian Josef Strobl.

<HEADLINE> East China Rural Areas Combat Pollution More Effectively </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, March 17 (Xinhua) -- "Please leave a blue sky, clear
water, and green land for our descendants," reads a banner on the
main street of Lijiazhuang Village, in east China's Shangdong
Province.
</P>
<P>
The village, which is part of Zibo City, is mainly involved in
the dying and chemical fibre business. It used to suffer a lot
from pollution, a head of the village said, but pollution control
now gets priority in developing the economy, and there are few
pollution problems now.
</P>
<P>
Before building a dying plant, which was a serious source of
pollution, the village spent over one million yuan (about 120,000
US dollars) on a waste water treatment plant.
</P>
<P>
The amount of waste water the plant puts out is well above
government standards, but now it can be re-used.
</P>
<P>
"Zibuo spent some 60 million yuan in combating township
enterprise pollution, and closed more than 100 oil refineries and
some 10 small tanneries and a number of other polluting plants and
production lines," said an official with the city's environmental
protection department.
</P>
<P>
Farmers' awareness of environmental protection has been
increased as well and pollution control work is much easier to do
now, he noted.

<HEADLINE> Algerian Security Forces Kill 41 Islamic Militants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALGIERS, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Algeria's security forces killed
41 Islamic militants within less than one week in "a blow of
force" against the extremists in different regions of the country,
said local press reports today.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-three Islamic militants were killed last Thursday in
Sour El-Ghozlane, in the wilaya (province) of Bouira 122
kilometers south of Algiers, in a vast operation launched by
security forces and the army, said the reports.
</P>
<P>
Security forces also "annihilated" 12 Islamic militants,
including one woman, in an operation last Thursday in the
Beaufraisier district of the capital Algiers.
</P>
<P>
The Algerian security forces have recently intensified
searching operations against the country's Islamic militants, as
Algeria is less than three months away from its general elections
scheduled for June 5.

<HEADLINE> Algeria Sharply Criticizes French PM for Interference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Algeria today sharply criticized
French Prime Minister Alain Juppe for "interference" in Algeria's
internal affairs in a television interview dedicated to Algeria
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In the interview, Juppe said that he would continue to "support
the democratic movement" in Algeria and called on Algeria to
organize its next general elections scheduled for June 5 in a way
which is "as transparent as possible."
</P>
<P>
The Algerian official press service APS said that Juppe
"thought himself obliged to give for the nth time, on a channel of
French television, his opinion on Algeria and thought himself
authorized to give unstingingly `useful advices' to an independent
state and a sovereign people."
</P>
<P>
Accusing Juppe of making an "aberration" by commenting on
Algeria's domestic situation, the APS questioned: "What is that
political need which prevents Mr. Juppe from seeing the democratic
camp of Algeria? Is the distinction not clear between those who
assassinate and those who defend the right to live?"
</P>
<P>
In the television interview, Juppe said that "extremism on the
one side just as on the other side is unbearable," and he asked:
"Where is the party of democracy in Algeria?"
</P>
<P>
Juppe also described Algeria as "a real headache" for France.
</P>
<P>
APS said that Algeria is capable of not only organizing the
elections (in a way) which is "as transparent as possible," but
also "completely transparent."
</P>
<P>
"For pity's sake, leave the problems of Algeria to Algerians
themselves.... This is a less great problem for the political
class of France, which has so much to do so that all would go
better in the kingdom of France," said APS.

<HEADLINE> Greek High-School Teachers End Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, March 16 (Xinhua) -- High-school teachers throughout
Greece will return to classrooms Monday after 44 days on strike.
</P>
<P>
Teachers' association representatives late Saturday night voted
38 against calling off the strike, 33 in favor and 12 blanks which
counted in favor of suspending the labor action.
</P>
<P>
The decision to end the strike, which has seriously disrupted
this year's course-work, came after an Athens court ruled Friday
that the teachers' labor action is illegal.
</P>
<P>
The court upheld a suit filed by four Athenian parents who
claimed their children were being denied their constitutional
right to a free education.
</P>
<P>
The problem now facing the government and the teachers is how
to compensate for classes lost in the spring term, though a
"flexible" catch-up plan has already been outlined, under which
the school-day will start 15 minutes earlier and finish 15 later.
Classes will be shorter and more condensed, most schools trips
will be cut and revision time will be trimmed.
</P>
<P>
The teachers went on strike eight weeks ago for higher pay and
smaller classes, which have been partly satisfied by the
government during the repeated negotiations in course of the
strike. The country's Education Minister Gerasimos Arsenis said a
teacher's net starting salary will be 250,000 drachmas (about
1,000 U.S. dollars) now and an extra 3,000 teachers will be hired
for the next school-year.
