<HEADLINE> Taliban, U.N. Likely to Finalize Security Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 22 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations and the
Taliban militia are likely to finalize an agreement Friday on the
security arrangement for the U.N. personnel in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The two sides, after four days of talks, have finalized more
than 95 percent of the "security agreement" and they will be in a
position to ink the accord Friday, said Taliban's representative
Saeed-ur-Rahman Haqqani here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, U.N. spokeswoman Sarah Russell said that the talks
are progressing well as an agreement is expected to be signed in
the next couple of days.
</P>
<P>
"The talks are going well and an agreement is likely to be
finalized by the end of the current week," Russell said, adding
that the two sides would meet again Friday.
</P>
<P>
The security agreement, presented by the U.N. Monday, lists a
number of assurances that the United Nations wants to seek before
it resumes relief activities in the war-shattered country.
</P>
<P>
The agreement calls for official protection for the world
body's premises and also promises of its implementing partners and
mobile mission.
</P>
<P>
It also asks guarantee that if any U.N. staff member is
detained they should be released in 72 hours in absence of formal
charges against them, and the U.N. staff would be allowed if they
want to visit any of its detained staff.
</P>
<P>
International aid agencies suspended their operations in
Taliban-controlled areas over a row on the relocation of their
offices by the Islamic movement in an old building on the
outskirts of Kabul.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. withdrew its expatriate staff from Afghanistan in
August following the killing of an Italian national working for
the U.N. in Kabul.

<HEADLINE> Swazi Police Destroy Dagga Factory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Swazi police have
uncovered a dagga processing and packaging factory in the capital
of Mbabane, and seized a large amount of dagga worth 2.4 million
U.S. Dollars, a report reaching here said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted police spokesman Lechinah Magagula as saying
that police raided the factory in the Sidwashini Industrial Area
after a tip-off from residents in the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
A white South African and a Swazi national were arrested,
Magagula said, noting this was the second of its operation since
August.
</P>
<P>
More than 20 million Rand (about 3.44 million U.S. Dollars) of
dagga were seized during the first operation, he added.
</P>
<P>
In the latest raid, the Swazi police found hundreds of blocks
of compressed dagga, and machinery for compressing dagga and
sealing cans, as well as a large number of tin cans into which
the dagga was being packed for export, said the officer.
</P>
<P>
Swaziland's dagga plants fetch more than 3,500 U.S. Dollars
per 2-kilogram block in some European countries, police said.

<HEADLINE> Pinochet to Make Legal Challenge for his Arrest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 22 (Xinhua) -- British lawyers acting for
former Chilean president Augusto Pinochet said here Thursday that
they would mount a legal challenge to his arrest.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for London Law firm Kingsley Napley was quoted by
Reuters as saying that an application would be made in London's
high court later Thursday for a habeus corpus to free him.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet's lawyers are also expected to seek a judicial review
of the decision to arrest the former Chilean leader, which has
sparked a political storm in Chile and given Britain a diplomatic
headache.
</P>
<P>
British Prime Minister Tony Blair's official spokesman said
early Thursday that the Pinochet case was a matter for the
judiciary and not for politicians to decide.
</P>
<P>
British police arrested Pinochet, 82, last weekend as he
recovered from back surgery in a private London hospital after it
received an extradition request from Spain wanting to question
Pinochet on charges of genocide and torture.

<HEADLINE> OAU Calls for Solution to Comorian Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, October 22 (Xinhua) -- The OAU urged interested
countries and the states of the Indian Ocean Region to continue
to back its initiatives and to step up efforts aimed at finding a
lasting solution to the current problems in the Comoros.
</P>
<P>
According to a press release of the Organization of African
Unity (OAU) issued here Thursday, the call was contained in a
communique issued at the end of the 52nd ordinary session of OAU
Mechanism for Conflict prevention, Management and Resolution at
ambassadorial level which was held here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The press release said, the Central Organ reiterated the
determination of the OAU to find a lasting solution to the crisis
in the Comoros which would take into account the legitimate
aspirations of all the islands in the Archipelago, within the
framework of respect for the unity and territorial integrity of
the Comoros.
</P>
<P>
The Central Organ welcomed the decision of the Anjouanese
separatists to postpone the legislative elections which they had
planned for October 15, 1998 and called upon all concerned to
undertake confidence building measures that will create a
propitious climate for the convening of the proposed Comorian
Inter-Islands Conference.
</P>
<P>
It stressed the importance of establishing a time frame for
ending the crisis in the Comoros through the convening of a
Comorian Inter-Islands Conference and a Round Table of Donors,

WASHINGTON, October 22 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton

Plantation, Maryland, where the summit enters the eighth day.
</P>
<P>
"We believe the difficult issues are now on the table," said

<P>
"And the time is now for the parties to make the tough

King Hussein of Jordan was not on hand but Lockhart said he was
available for consultations by phone or could even come later if

today," Clinton told reporters before boarding a helicopter.

<HEADLINE> Greece Desires Best Relations With Macedonia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Greece Thursday expressed its
willingness to better its relations with the Former Yugoslav
Republic of Macedonia (FYROM).
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press briefing, Greek government spokesman
Dimitris Reppas said that Greece desired the best possible
relations with the neighboring country to the mutual benefit of
both peoples.
</P>
<P>
Greece had taken specific steps to deal with problems in
bilateral relations, he said, adding that Greece hoped the new
government in FYROM would do the same.
</P>
<P>
As for the parliamentary elections in FYROM, he said that
Greece regarded the successful conduct of democratic elections in
the country as a positive development, but would wait for the
second round of voting before making any statement.
</P>
<P>
FYROM's Democratic Alternative bloc won the biggest share of
seats in the first round of the elections while the second round
will be held on November 1.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Greece and Macedonia have been strained for
years over the two countries' disputes on the latter's name.
</P>
<P>
Athens has disputed Macedonia's right to use the name of
Macedonia, saying that it implies that the Skopje government has
territorial designs on the Greek Macedonia, which is the name of
Greece's largest province.

<HEADLINE> Congo (K) Rebels, Govt. Troops Clash in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 22 (Xinhua) -- The rebels in the Democratic
Republic of Congo (DRC) claimed that their troops are fighting
the government troops in Mbuji-Mayi, the Rwanda News Agency (RNA)
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The rebels determined to topple Congolese President Laurent
Kabila said on Radio Goma Thursday that they pitted themselves
against the forces loyal to Kabila, RNA said, in a dispatch
faxed to Xinhua based in Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
The rebel-held Radio Goma monitored in Rwanda indicated that
the Congo (K) rebels are ready to stop fighting in order to avoid
bloodshed in the capital of the mineral rich eastern Kasai
Province if Kabila agrees to negotiate with them.
</P>
<P>
The rebel radio further accused Kabila of having deployed in
Mbuji-Mayi about 7,000 Hutu extremist "Interahamwe" militiamen,
led by former Rwandan army chief of staff, general Augustin
Bizimungu.
</P>
<P>
Kabila has amassed important war equipment, including 10 jet
fighters and three helicopters there, the radio claimed.
</P>
<P>
The fighting in Mbuji-Mayi was announced only a week after the
rebels had captured the most strategic airbase of Kindu in
Maniema Province, 1,200 kilometers east of Kinshasa.
</P>
<P>
The fighting in Mbuji-Mayi is reported only a day after
presidents of Angola, Namibia and Zimbabwe had a one-day summit
in Harare, Zimbabwe Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos
pushed for the meeting after the fall of Kindu, which Kabila used
to mount attacks on the rebels in eastern Congo (K).
</P>
<P>
Dos Santos, Namibian President Sam Nujoma and Zimbabwean
President Robert Mugabe were reported to have discussed how to
revamp their military strategy to launch a counter-offensive on
the positions held by the rebels in the east of the third largest
African country.
</P>
<P>
The ministers of defense and foreign affairs of the 14-member
Southern African Development Community (SADC) are scheduled to
hold a high-level meeting in Lusaka, Zambia next Monday to
discuss the Congo conflicts.
</P>
<P>
Delegates from the United Nations and the Organization of
African Unity (OAU) are expected to attend the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Not long after the Tutsi-led rebellion broke out in the
eastern part of Congo (K) in early August this year, Angola,
Namibia and Zimbabwe sent their troops to help President Kabila
in western Congo.

<HEADLINE> OAU to Meet on Ethio-Eritrean Conflict Next Month </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, October 22 (xinhua) -- The Organization of
African Unity (OAU) committee on Ethio-Eritrean conflict is due
to meet in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso in November, the Ethiopian
Foreign Ministry announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by the ministry here said that a Summit of
the OAU Committee on Peaceful Solution to the Ethio-Eritrean
Conflict "is expected to hold separate talks with leaders of the
two countries to forward its proposals later."
</P>
<P>
The OAU panel, which includes Burkina Faso, Zimbabwe and
Djibouti, was mandated by the 34th OAU Summit which was held in
June this year.
</P>
<P>
An ambassadorial delegation from the OAU panel visited both
Eritrea and Ethiopia from June 30 to July 9 and submitted a
report to their ministers which met on August 1-2 in Ouagadougou.
</P>
<P>
And the ministerial meeting had submitted its recommendations
to the heads of state of the members of the committee for
consideration and action.
</P>
<P>
During his visit to Egyptian capital Cairo last week,
Ethiopian Foreign Minister Seyoum Mesfin said that "relations
between the two countries have not witnessed any improvement and
chances of a peaceful settlement of the crisis are hazy."
</P>
<P>
"We hope that the OAU will come up with proposals to resolve
the issue next month as Ethiopia is committed to peace," he
added.

<HEADLINE> S. Tome &AMP; Principe to Hold Parliamentary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Nine political parties will
contend for the 55 seats in the National Assembly on November 8
in the Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe, a report
reaching here said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, former president Manuel Pinto da
Costa, also president of the ruling Liberation Movement of S.
Tome &AMP; Principe/Social Democratic Party (MLSP), said he was
confident that his party will win the majority of the seats and
the next presidential election as well.
</P>
<P>
MLSP now holds 27 seats in parliament.
</P>
<P>
Observers said that the Party of Independent Democratic Act
(ADI) led by Carlos Neves also has a chance to win the majority
in the national assembly.
</P>
<P>
The ADI party, reportedly established with the support of
President Miguel Trovoada in 1993, holds 14 seats in parliament.
</P>
<P>
In the forthcoming elections, the Democratic Convergency Party
(PCD) which also has 14 seats in parliament is expected to
maintain its position.
</P>
<P>
The PDC once won majority in the elections in 1991 and formed
a government, but its cabinet was dismissed by the president in
1994. However, the PDC forms part of the coalition government at
present.
</P>
<P>
Raul Braganca, head of the PDC, has insisted the parliamentary
polls be delayed on the ground that the national economy should
be strengthened first.
</P>
<P>
The Democratic Party (DP), a small political party founded in
1990, won only one seat in the elections held in 1991, and the DP
and other small parties are unlikely to have much influence in
the forthcoming elections, observers here said.
</P>
<P>
The coming elections is the third since the island country in
the Gulf of Guinea adopted the multi-party system in August 1990.
</P>
<P>
Each party seeks to rule by itself, abandoning the idea of a
national unity government commonly agreed on after an abortive
coup in 1995 which created split between the government and the
president, and worsened the ties between the ruling parties and
the opposition.
</P>
<P>
To defuse the crisis, President Trovoada called for the
formation of a national unity government to reconstruct the state
and urged the setting up of a coalition government between the
ruling parties and the opposition.

<HEADLINE> German Central Bank Leaves Interest Rates Unchanged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, October 22 (Xinhua) -- The German central bank, the
Bundesbank, Thursday decided to leave key interest rates unchanged
despite speculations that an expected economic slowdown would lead
to a change in the bank's tight-money policy.
</P>
<P>
Germany's benchmark discount rate and Lombard rate have
remained at 2.5 percent and 4.5 percent since April 1996. A third
key lending rate, the short-term repo rate, also remains unchanged
at 3.3 percent since October 1997.
</P>
<P>
The Bundesbank's decision came after the European Commission
Wednesday reduced its forecast for economic growth in the European
Union next year from three percent to 2.4 percent, mainly due to
the negative impact from the financial troubles in Asia and
Russia.
</P>
<P>
A day earlier, six leading German economic research institutes
also cut its forecast for German growth next year from 2.7 percent
to 2.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
Germany's incoming government, to be formed by the Social
Democratic Party (SPD) and the Greens, has been calling for a rate
cut in order to spur economic growth and job creation.
</P>
<P>
That view is apparently not shared by the politically
independent Bundesbank, which has insisted that German rates are
already at a record low and that an interest rate convergence in
the single European currency zone would in effect lead to a rate
reduction for the whole region.
</P>
<P>
The Frankfurt-based European Central Bank (ECB) on Tuesday
suggested that countries preparing to introduce the single
currency, the euro, are likely to bring their interest rates to a
level similar to the German short-term rate of 3.3 percent ahead
of the euro debut in January next year.
</P>
<P>
The current average lending rate across the 11 countries in the
euro zone is about 3.8 percent, with a gap of up to three
percentage points between the highest and lowest rates.

<HEADLINE> Annan Disappointed at U.S. Failure to Pay U.N. Debt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 22 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan on Thursday said he was disappointed the United States
had not paid over 1 billion U.S. dollars in arrears to the world
body, saying Washington should not expect "representation without
taxation."
</P>
<P>
In a regular news briefing on Thursday here, a U.N.
spokesperson announced Annan's disappointment which the U.N. chief
voiced at a press conference in Tokyo at the end of Annan's
three-day visit to Japan. He is in Seoul on a two-day visit to the
Republic of Korea.
</P>
<P>
Annan said that he was disappointed the United States failed
this week to pass legislation concerning payment towards the some
1.6 billion U.S. dollars that the United Nations says the United
States owes in back payments.
</P>
<P>
"This obviously is a disappointment to me," he said, adding
other member states were similarly "not pleased with the state of
affairs".
</P>
<P>
Annan recalled former British Foreign Secretary Malcolm
Rifkind's twist on American revolutionary hero Samuel Adams' cry
against "taxation without representation", in which Rifkind said
there can likewise be no "representation without taxation."
</P>
<P>
"I think most of the member states share this view," Annan
said.
</P>
<P>
Annan said he regretted a U.S. spending bill vetoed by
President Bill Clinton on Wednesday that would have provided 926
million U.S. dollars in delinquent payments was linked to "an
unrelated domestic issue of abortion".
</P>
<P>
Clinton, who has been pressing Congress for months to pay
U.N. back dues, vetoed the legislation on grounds that it was
improperly tied to a provision denying U.S. contributions to
international family-planning organizations that advocate
abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
The United States, which accounts for two-thirds of outstanding
U.N. arrears, was required to pay 347 million U.S. dollars to the
U.N. by January.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Charter stipulates that if at the beginning of the
year a country owes the same or more than its total gross
assessments for the previous two years, it automatically loses
its right to vote in the General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. is so strapped for cash that in order to cover its
regular budget expenses it has been periodically forced to borrow
from a separate peace-keeping fund.

<HEADLINE> UN Holds Experts Meeting on Tests of Iraq's Missile </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 22 (Xinhua) -- A meeting of technical
experts to review laboratory tests of samples taken from Iraq's
missiles had begun, UN Spokesman's office announced on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, called by the United Nations Special Commission in
charge of dismantling Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, would
last through Friday.
</P>
<P>
It would assess the final results of the tests from a French
laboratory to determine whether Iraq loaded nerve gas VX into
missile warheads before the 1991 Gulf War and complete the work of
the technical experts meeting held early this month.
</P>
<P>
A report on their final finding is expected to go to the
Security Council on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has said that although it produced some nerve gas VX, it
was never in a sufficiently stable form to load into weapons.
</P>
<P>
A U.S. army laboratory in Maryland reported in June that it
found traces of VX on some fragments of warheads collected from
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Similar tests on other samples were later carried out in French
and Swiss laboratories. The Swiss tests were negative but there
have been ambivalent reports about the French tests, which have
not yet been made public.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Plans to Boost Civet Output </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, October 22 (Xinhua) -- The Bako Rural Technology
Center of Ethiopia said Thursday that it is preparing to
manufacture equipment useful to boost civet production in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia loses over 5.6 million Birr (800,000 U.S. Dollars) in
hard currency yearly due to its failure to fully tap the civet
production, the Ethiopian News Agency quoted Olane Kebede, head
of the center, as saying.
</P>
<P>
Olane said the center discovered the low civet output in a
research it conducted over the past two years.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that although Ethiopia is the only country to
produce civet in Africa, its production in the country is still
by far low.
</P>
<P>
According to Olane, one kilogram of civet, which is used in
perfume, can be obtained annually from a civet cat. And one
kilogram of civet costs 400 U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
About 229 peasants in the Oromia National State have been
licensed to carry out the traditional civet production, according
to the news agency.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Meets Over Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 22 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security
Council on Thursday held closed-door consultations on the Serbia's
province of Kosovo, the session was adjourned without adopting any
resolution.
</P>
<P>
The 15-member Security Council discussed a draft resolution
jointly prepared by Germany, the United States, Japan and Sweden.
But the council is expected to convene consultations in the near
future to consider the draft resolution, U.N. sources said.
</P>
<P>
Shen Guofang, China's deputy permanent representative to the
United Nations, told Xinhua at the end of the council
consultations that China is against adopting a resolution which
rattles military threat to Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The international community should take an objective evaluation
of the current situation in Kosovo, and fully affirm the
flexibility by the Yugoslav Government in this regard, Shen said.
</P>
<P>
"We are against the use of military threat against Yugoslavia
because this is not in conformity with the current positive
atmosphere in the Kosovo issue, and not conducive to finding a
peaceful solution to the issue," he said.
</P>
<P>
China maintains its reservations on Security Council
Resolutions 1160 and 1199, he said, adding that the Chinese
delegation will put forward its proposal for revising the draft
resolution, he added.
</P>
<P>
Russia, a permanent member of the Security Council, has said
earlier that it will veto any resolution demanding the use of
military force against Yugoslavia, which sees the Kosovo issue as
its internal affair.
</P>
<P>
Conflicts broke out in February this year in Kosovo after
ethnic Albanians, who make up some 90 percent of the province's
population of 2 million, have been battling with Serbs for
independence.

<HEADLINE> Israel Tries to Stop Student Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Education Minister
Yitzhak Levy met with student representatives on Thursday in an
effort to stop the strike throughout the country's universities.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Levy proposed setting up a committee that
would suggest ways of lowing the cost of higher education.
</P>
<P>
He also pledged to raise the issue at the next cabinet
meeting. If necessary he would ask Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu to deal with the matter.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of students from the country's universities held
demonstrations in major cities on Wednesday to protest against
high tuition fees. Thirty-one students were arrested during the
clashes with the police.
</P>
<P>
After the clashes erupted, the students decided to launch the
strike on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
The students are demanding that tuition fees, currently about
9,500 shekels (about 2,200 U.S. dollars) a year, be reduced by
half.
</P>
<P>
Erez Eshel, head of Tel Aviv university student organization,
told Israel Radio on Thursday that they will not stop the strike
until their demand is met.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the current tuition is too high and most
students can not afford it.
</P>
<P>
But the Finance Ministry has turned down the demand, noting
that the tuition level was set by a joint commission established
after a student strike in 1996, which also includes student
representatives.
</P>
<P>
A senior official of the ministry told Israel Radio that the
students' demand is unreasonable. He said that the ministry
is providing financial aid to students who really need.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Welcomes Syrian-Turkish Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Foreign Minister Abdul
Ilah al-Khatib Thursday welcomed the security agreement reached
between Syria and Turkey to end their disputes over Syria's
alleged support for Turkey's Kurdish rebels.
</P>
<P>
Jordan expects the agreement to be the start of a new phase of
Syrian-Turkish relations which should be established on the basis
of good neighborliness and common interests, said al-Khatib in a
statement to Jordan's official news agency, the Petra.
</P>
<P>
In his statement, the foreign minister also reaffirmed Jordan's
consistent stand that peaceful means instead of military ones
should be adopted to solve various disputes, including that
between Syria and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the minister expressed Jordan's appreciation of the
constructive role played by Egypt to end the Syrian-Turkish
crisis.
</P>
<P>
During the tensions, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak conducted
shuttle diplomacy between Syria and Turkey to reconcile their
stands.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has accused Syria of supporting Kurdish rebels seeking
independence in southeastern Turkey and recently massed troops
along its border with Syria, sparking fear of a regional armed
conflict.
</P>
<P>
The tensions have been eased as shuttle diplomacy of Egypt and
some other countries helped the two sides reach an agreement
Tuesday under which Syria, admitting Turkey's outlawed Kurdish
Workers' Party a terrorism organization, promised to ban the group
on its territories.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Backs Greece's Objection to European </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus Thursday expressed its
support for Greece's objection to a proposal by the European
Commission to offer community funds for Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the commission's proposal on releasing EU funds
for Turkey, Cypriot government spokesman Christos Stylianides said
Thursday at his press briefing that "Greece has already outlined
its initial response to yesterday's move. This is within the
framework of EU institutions and we shall have to wait for the
outcome in this issue."
</P>
<P>
But he said that "it is clear that Greece is in the right
in this effort."
</P>
<P>
The European Commission proposed Wednesday to give Turkey 15
million ECU to put into effect a customs union agreement with
Turkey and provide an extra 135 million ECU (totaling 180 million
U.S. dollars) to promote economic and social development in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Greece has warned that Athens would be forced to have recourse
to the European Court of Justice if the European Commission did
not change its proposal on the release of community funds for
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1980s, Greece has been for years blocking about 405
million U.S. dollars of EU money destined for Turkey, which Greece
accuses of not meeting standards regarding human rights,
territorial claims and other issues.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also pointed out that the commission's decision
to circumvent the Greek veto was not related to Cyprus' course of
accession to the European Union.
</P>
<P>
"There has been no attempts to link this development with
Cyprus' accession course," Stylianides said.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus started accession negotiations with the EU in March.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkish troops
landed and took over the northern third of the island in the wake
of a failed pro-Athens coup by the Greek Cypriots.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, October 22 (Xinhua) -- The third round of
Burundi peace talks ended in the northern Tanzanian town of
Arusha Thursday with conflicting parties satisfied with
discussions at ending the five-year civil strife in the tiny
central African republic.
</P>
<P>
This round of peace talks winded up by setting up a crucial
committee for peace and security and nominating its chairman.
</P>
<P>
Hashim Mbita, spokesman for the peace talks
mediator Julius Nyerere, former Tanzanian president, said the
committee will be chaired by Mathias Zuppi, an Italian Catholic
priest.
</P>
<P>
Nomination of the vice-chairman is still under discussion,
reports reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
Other two committees which were set up earlier at the
closed-door talks are the committee for nature of Burundi
conflict, to be headed by Mozambique's Armandu Guebuza, and the
committee for democracy and good governance to be led by
Professor Nichola Hayson of South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Mark Bomani, an aide to Nyerere, told Xinhua over
telephone that each of the three committees will be consisted of
18 members, respectively from the government, the National
Assembly and various rebel groups.
</P>
<P>
Another achievement is the settlement of the issue regarding
the participants in the talks, Mbita said, adding that a woman
group from Burundi has been granted temporary observer status at
the face-to-face talks.
</P>
<P>
Mbita described the third round as very successful, adding
that "it was encouraging and positive," and even rebel groups
like Frodebu, Uprona, Palipehutu acknowledged it.
</P>
<P>
The talks, also attended by two former presidents of Burundi,
Sylvestre Ntibantunganya and Baptiste Bagaza, were facilitated by
the Nyerere Foundation and funded by international donors.
</P>
<P>
He said delegates have resolved to meet in Arusha again for
the fourth round on January 18 next year to deal with debate on
the reconstruction of Burundi and other issues.
</P>
<P>
More than 150,000 people, mostly civilians, have been killed
in a series of massacres and in armed conflicts between the

<P>
MOSCOW, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Russian State Duma (lower house
of parliament) Chairman Gennady Seleznyov Thursday said that the
Duma did not sanction the visit by parliament group leader of the
Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) Vladimir Zhirinovsky to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Seleznyov stressed that Zhirinovsky had not had the right to
make any official statements on behalf of the State Duma.
</P>
<P>
The lower house has recieved a statement from the embassy of
the People's Republic of China in Moscow, said Seleznyov, that
expressed doubt about Zhirinovsky's visit to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The Duma speaker said that in this connection the Duma will
adopt a resolution on Friday, in which "the State Duma will
dissociate itself from the visit of Zhirinovsky, because he went
there as a private individual."
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Seleznyov met with newly-appointed Chinese
ambassador Wu Tao in the Duma building and spoke of the position
that the State Duma adheres to the "one China" policy.
</P>
<P>
He told the Chinese ambassador that the State Duma did not send
a group, led by Vladimir Zhirinovsky, to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Seleznyov is expected to visit China on October 24-30.
</P>
<P>
In view of Zhirinovsky's visit to Taiwan Russian Foreign
Ministry's spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin as well stated on Tuesday
that Russia unconditionally recognized "one China" policy, that
its government is the only legitimate government in all of China,
which includes Taiwan.
</P>

the five-day trip to Taiwan last Sunday at the invitation of
Taiwanese high-ranking officials.

<HEADLINE> Germany, France Pledge Better Coordination in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Germany's designated finance
minister Oskar Lafontaine and French finance minister Dominique
Strauss-Kahn Thursday agreed to seek better coordination in the
two country's financial policies.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting in the western German city of Saarbruecken on
Thursday, Lafontaine and Strauss-Kahn agreed to coordinate budget
policies, to strive for a hamonization of taxes in Europe as well
as to work together to seek greater regulation of international
financial markets, German press reported.
</P>
<P>
The current financial crises had highlighted the need to bring
the global markets under a system of order, Lafontaine said.
</P>
<P>
According to the local press, both officials on Thursday
expressed support for more stable exchange rates of key
currencies, especially between the U.S. dollar and the planned
single European currency, the euro.
</P>
<P>
Lafontaine has previously called for linking the exchange rates
of key currencies in a system similar to the European Union's
exchange rate mechanism that allow capital to flow freely and yet
still provide exchange rate stability.
</P>
<P>
This, however, should not be understood as a call for fixed
exchange rates, Lafontaine stressed on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
It is the first meeting between the French finance minister and
Lafontaine after Germany's Social Democratic Party (SPD) defeated
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's conservative alliance in general
elections on September 27.
</P>
<P>
The SPD is due to formally set up a center-left coalition
government with the Greens at the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
Political observers suggest that the change of government in
Bonn would provide the opportunity for the large majority of
leftist governments in Europe, especially Bonn, Paris and London,
to move together to tackle economic issues.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Calls for World Cooperation Against Terrorism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Egypt urged the International
Criminal Police Organization (INTERPOL) Thursday to help promote
cooperation worldwide in fighting against terrorism.
</P>
<P>
It is "important" that the INTERPOL stresses in its strategy
that it "intends to promote cooperation" among the member states
against international terrorism, Egyptian Interior Minister Habib
el-Adli told the inaugural session of the 67th INTERPOL General
Assembly here.
</P>
<P>
Combating against terrorism is "the responsibility of the world
community as a whole" other than "the cause of one country or a
group of countries," el-Adli said.
</P>
<P>
He called on the INTERPOL member states to adopt a unified
stand against any country sheltering or sponsoring terrorists.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has been hit heavily by terrorism since 1992 after Muslim
extremists began a violent campaign to try to overthrow Egypt's
secular government and replace it with strict Islamic rule. More
than 1,200 people have been killed in the insurrection.
</P>
<P>
Egypt accuses some countries of harboring members of terrorist
groups behind the violence.
</P>
<P>
El-Adli expressed confidence that the Cairo conference will,
through the support of the member states, make a headway for
signing bilateral agreements on security cooperation and
extradition of criminals.
</P>
<P>
The six-day conference is to review and update INTERPOL's
strategy in grappling with money laundering, terrorism, illegal
immigration and counterfeiting.

<HEADLINE> Oil Production in Russia Drops by Seven Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 22 (Xinhua) -- The Russian oil production
declined by 7 percent in the last six months, the Itar-Tass news
agency reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
No matter what steps may be taken now, oil prices are bound to
drop by 5-10 percent next year and domestic oil consumption will
be about 210-215 million tons, deputy board chairman of the
YUKOS oil company Vasily Shakhnovsky was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Shakhnovsky, pessimistic about the situation, warned that if
the government increases tax pressure on oil companies, Russia
will turn from an oil exporter into an oil importer in two years.
</P>
<P>
In his opinion, in conditions of the severest economic and
political crisis in the country, the state should increase its
influence, but must not go to extremes.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> COMESA Urged to Remove Barriers to Free Movement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Zambian Home Affairs Minister
Katele Kalumba warned here Thursday that the free trade area in
the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) will
not become a reality if the barriers to free movement of people
are not removed.
</P>
<P>
Kalumba, quoted by Zambia News Agency ZANA, said at the
opening of COMESA chief immigration officers' seminar that the
removal of barriers to the free movement of people contributes
directly to the rapid removal of tariff barriers to trade in the
sub-region.
</P>
<P>
COMESA, a regional grouping which replaced the Preferential
Trade Area for Eastern and Southern Africa (PTA) in 1994, aims to
achieve a full free trade area by the year 2000 and freedom of
movement of people.
</P>
<P>
The minister also advised the attendants to ensure that only
genuine business people are allowed free movement in the COMESA
region to prevent cross-border crimes.
</P>
<P>
He said this could be done through constant exchange of
information among immigration officers working on the borders.
</P>
<P>
Kalumba said that Zambia had implemented some of the
provisions in the COMESA protocol on the relaxation of visa
requirements, saying accordingly 400,000 entries from nationals
of member states were recorded between January and December 1997.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the seminar, COMESA Acting Secretary General
Sindiso Ngwenya said the free movement of business people should
be encouraged to boost cross-border trade and investment in the
sub-region.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon, Iran Sign Economic Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon and Iran Thursday
signed three agreements on economic cooperation in order to
establish closer ties between the two countries, the official
National News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The agreements include agricultural cooperation, avoidance of
double taxation and the resumption of air transport between Beirut
and Tehran.
</P>
<P>
Visiting Iranian Minister of Housing and Urban Development Ali
Abdolalizadeh and Lebanese Minister of Agriculture Shawki
Fakhoury and Minister of State for Financial Affairs Fuad
Sinyoura singed the pacts on behalf of their governments.
</P>
<P>
After the signing ceremony, Sinyoura told reporters that the
pact on avoiding double taxation would create more investment
opportunities for businessmen from the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He said under the agreement on air transport, Lebanon's Middle
East Airlines will start direct flight between Beirut and Tehran
from early 1999 and one of the Iranian's airlines will also make
flights in a later time.
</P>
<P>
He said these pacts will pave the way for closer ties and
cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Abdolalizadeh called on businessmen from both
countries, especially those in the private sector, to boost
cooperation in more fields and projects.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Iran would continue supporting Lebanon in its
resistance movement against Israeli occupation of south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-declared security zone in south Lebanon in
1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from
cross-border attacks by Lebanese guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Abdolalizadeh, accompanied by a large high-level economic
delegation, arrived here on Tuesday. During his visit, he has
held talks with Lebanese President Elias Hrawi and Prime Minister
Rafik Hariri on bilateral ties and regional affairs.

<HEADLINE> Mozambique to Cooperate With British Voluntary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Voluntary Office
Service (VSO) Chairman Lord Carrington said here Thursday the VSO
will enhance its relations with Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
The VSO will encourage about 40 volunteers to come to
Mozambique to offer service to the education sector and other
spheres, he said.
</P>
<P>
Carrington, former British Minister for International
Development, said this at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the VSO has been solicited volunteers at the
request of the Mozambican government. At the moment, there are 17
VSO volunteers working in Mozambique, mainly teaching English and
training English teachers, especially in the rural areas.
</P>
<P>
The VSO came to Mozambique in 1995. Currently, it has sent
about 2,000 volunteers to nearly 60 countries.
</P>
<P>
Carrington arrived here Monday for a five-day visit to
Mozambique in a bid to know how the volunteers conduct their work
in this southern African country.
His next leg is Zimbabwe.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Receives No Oil Spare Parts: Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Iraq said on Thursday that so
far it had not received any spare parts badly needed for its oil
sector, blaming the United States for the delay of the approval of
contracts it signed with foreign companies.
</P>
<P>
In a statement carried by the Iraqi News Agency INA, an
unnamed Oil Ministry spokesman said Iraq had signed 450 contracts
with foreign companies, but no oil spare parts, which are needed
to increase its oil production and export, had arrived in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the U.N. Sanctions Committee so far had
approved only 55 out of the 197 contracts registered in the
committee.
</P>
<P>
He said the U.S. representative in the committee had suspended
61 contracts to purchase oil spare parts.
</P>
<P>
At the suggestion of a U.N. oil experts team which visited Iraq
last March to evaluate the country's oil production and export
capacity, the U.N. Security Council agreed last April to earmark
300 million U.S. dollars from Iraq's oil proceeds for the purchase
of oil spare parts and equipments to repair its oil facilities.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council agreed to more than double the amount of
oil that Iraq can sell every six months to 5.2 billion
U.S. dollars from the fourth phase of the oil-for-food program.
</P>
<P>
However, Iraq has repeatedly said it can not meet the ceiling
because of the lack of oil spare parts and the low prices on world
markets, and that it can not export more than 4 billion dollars
worth of oil in the fourth phase which began in June.
</P>
<P>
Last month, Iraq announced that it would just be able to
export 3 billion dollars worth of oil in the current phase due to
the severe lack of oil spare parts.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. imposed economic sanctions on Iraq in August 1990
following its invasion of Kuwait which led to the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions on Iraq can not be lifted unless U.N. weapons
inspectors verify that it is free of weapons of mass
destruction.

<HEADLINE> Reppas: Greece Will React Strongly for Releasing EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Greece threatened Thursday to
react strongly if the European Commission's decision to release a
155- million-dollar package of economic aid to Turkey was approved
by the European Union (EU) Council of Ministers.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press briefing, Greek government spokesman
Dimitris Reppas attributed the commission's decision to
"expediencies." Greece's reaction would be without delay, he
added.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that Greece would increase its bilateral
contacts in order to promote the country's national interests in
the most effective way.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission's proposal for the release of the EU
funds to Turkey, which was raised by External Affairs Commissioner
Hans Van Den Broek, was approved Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The commission's plan will prevent Greece from exercising its
right to veto by introducing a new regulation terming Turkey a
developing country, which requires only a special majority for
approval by the EU Council of Ministers.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, Greece blocked an aid package worth 450 million
dollars accompanying the EU-Turkey customs union.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, Greece warned that it would refer the
European Commission to the European Court of Justice.
</P>
<P>
Greece has said that it supports Turkey's European vocation but
Ankara must improve both its human rights record and its relations
with Athens.

<HEADLINE> Democrats, Republicans Remain at Odds over Judges, as </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 22 (Xinhua) -- The Republican-controlled
Senate confirmed 65 of U.S. President Bill Clinton's nominees to
be federal judges this year, but Democrats still complained about
the pace of confirmations.
</P>
<P>
Partisan foot-dragging is putting a further strain on
short-staffed federal courtrooms already overloaded with cases,
Senator Patrick Leahy, a Democrat, said Wednesday as the Senate
confirmed 17 judges shortly before adjourning for the year.
</P>
<P>
Fifty of the government's 834 federal judgeships remain vacant,
Leahy said.
</P>
<P>
"In order to understand why a judicial vacancy crisis is
plaguing so many federal courts, we need only recall how
unproductive the Republican Senate has been over the past three
years," he said in a statement. "At each step of the process,
judicial nominations are being delayed and stalled."
</P>
<P>
Republicans insist there is no partisan slowdown.
</P>
<P>
"This Congress has taken steps to significantly reduce the
federal judicial vacancy rate to its lowest rate in almost a
decade," said Senator Orrin Hatch, a Republican and chairman of
the Senate Judiciary Committee. The committee takes the first look
at presidential nominations and votes whether to reject them or to
send them to the Senate for a vote.
</P>
<P>
However, Attorney General Janet Reno thanked Leahy and Hatch
for speedy work at the close of the congressional session.
</P>
<P>
"We intend to work very hard to begin the 106th Congress with
as many candidates for nomination as possible, so that we can
continue to work with the Senate to ensure a full bench," Reno
said at her weekly news conference.
</P>
<P>
Appointed by the president, federal judges have lifetime tenure
and can exert influence long after the appointing president leaves
office.
</P>
<P>
The Senate left town without passing judgment on four
candidates approved by the Judiciary Committee, including Judge
Richard Paez, who was first nominated to 9th U.S. District Court
of Appeals in San Francisco in January 1996. Those nominations --
and two dozen never voted out of committee -- died when the Senate
adjourned. Clinton will have to resubmit them or substitutes when
a new session of Congress reconvenes in January.
</P>
<P>
Democrats say that in 1994, the year before Republicans
regained control of the Senate, 101 judges were confirmed. And the
confirmation process is taking longer, they say.
</P>
<P>
Hatch said that during the 104th Congress' two-year session,
when Republicans took control of both Houses for the first time in
40 years, 75 Clinton judges were confirmed. Republicans say that
compares favorably with the 71 confirmed by the 101st Congress,
when President Bush was in the White House and Democrats ruled the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
"Even if we were to stop holding nomination hearings -- and we
have not -- I think you will see that our efforts compare quite
favorably to other Congresses in terms of the number of judges
confirmed at this point in the year, especially if you look at
recent Democrat-controlled Congresses," Hatch said.

<HEADLINE> Implant Transmits Brain Signals to Computer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 22 (Xinhua) -- U.S. researchers have
recently implanted into the brain of a stroke patient a tiny glass
cone that enables direct communication between the brain and a
computer.
</P>
<P>
This breakthrough, experts say, may allow a paralyzed, mute
stroke victim to use his brainpower to move a cursor across a
screen and convey messages like hello and goodbye.
</P>
<P>
According to The New York Times Thursday, researchers at the
Emery University planted the device into a 53-year-old patient's
brain.
</P>
<P>
The little device in the brain could amplifies brain signals.
The signals are then transmitted to a laptop computer through an
antenna-like coil placed on the head. Like a computer mouse, the
brain signals can move a cursor across the computer screen and
point at icons with messages like "See you later. Nice talking
with you." The patient can also use the cursor to tell others that
he is hungry or thirsty.
</P>
<P>
The researchers said the cone in the brain could encourage
nerves to grow, and prompt the brain's nerves to link up to
electrodes in cone, forming a little brain inside the cone. The
electrodes can transmit electrical impulses produced by the brain
to a computer.
</P>
<P>
Eventually They hope to use the technology to teach patients
to write letters, send E-mail and turn lights off and on via
computer.

LONDON, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Britain's FTSE 100 index closed
marginally higher Thursday, helped by some reassuring noises from
some leading companies, while continental European markets had a
negative end to the day depressed by the Dow's poor opening in New
York.
</P>
<P>
In London, the session brought a positive statement on its
trading outlook from global news and information company Reuters,
strong new business growth numbers from insurer Legal &AMP; General

Dealers said all three companies added to the gradual recovery
in investor confidence since the U.S. Federal Reserve cut interest
rates earlier in the month.

<P>
By the close, the bluechip index had risen 23.3 points or 0.5
percent to 5,229.9.
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, share prices closed lower as a result of
profit-taking and a technical correction.

The Xetra Dax closed at 4,449.12, down 85.43 points and the Dax

Car shares fell after remarks by Daimler-Benz chairman Juergen

CAIRO, October 22 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Egyptian Minister of Tourism Mamdouh Al Biltagi has
said that Egypt is expected to raise its hotel accommodation
capacity from the current 17,000 rooms to 200,000 rooms in five
years.
</P>
<P>
Biltagi said that tourism is on the rise in recent years due to
the government's big success in carrying out ambitious
infrastructure projects at a total cost of 216 billion pounds
(about 63.6 billion U.S. dollars), the Arabic Alam Al Yom reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- A number of Egyptian companies will take part, for the
first time, in the world electricity exhibition, which is to be
held in Paris from December 7-11.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian Arbic daily Alam Al Yom reported Thursday that
Egypt imported 103 million dollars worth of French-made
electricity equipment last year, making up some 20 percent of
France's total exports of electricity appliances to the Middle
East.
</P>
<P>
AMMAN -- The overall receiving and delivery operations at
Jordan's Red Sea port of Aqaba rose by 6 percent during the first
nine months this year, compared with that during the same period
last year, the weekly newspaper Star reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The paper attributed the rise to a 23 percent increase of
the kingdom's imports through the port.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Germany will offer Egypt 160 million German marks
(88.89 million U.S. dollars) to finance its development projects,
Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Under a protocol between the two sides for financial and
economic cooperation for the year 1998/1999, the fund will
comprise a non-refundable grant of 84 million marks (46.67 million
dollars) and a soft loan of 76 million marks (42.22 million
dollars) to be repaid in 40 years with a 10-year grace period.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Germany will extend additional 42 million marks
(23.33 million dollars) to finance Egypt's infrastructure projects

<HEADLINE> Security Council Calls for Peace in Congo (K) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 22 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security
Council on Thursday called for "an immediate end to military
offensives and hostilities generally, for the standstill of all
troops in the country, and for respect for the sovereignty and
territorial integrity of the Democratic Republic of Congo."
</P>
<P>
In a statement read to the press after the council's
closed-door consultations, the president of the 15-member
council, Jeremy Greenstock, said that the council member states
"urged all parties involved not to take action which would lead
to escalation of the conflict."
</P>
<P>
The Security Council expressed "full support" for efforts by
the Organization of African Unity, the Southern African
Development Community and other regional initiatives towards a
ceasefire, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
In this regard, the Security Council welcomed the planned
meeting of foreign and defense ministers of a number of countries
in Lusaka, Zambia, on October 26, and it welcomed a decision by
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan to send a senior representative
to participate in the upcoming meeting, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The council members "urged all parties involved to attend the
talks and to use this major opportunity in a spirit of realism and
compromise to help bring a destructive cycle of violence in the
region to an end," it said.
</P>
<P>
Council members took note of communications from the Government
of Rwanda and Congo (K) to the U.N. secretary-general, informing
him that steps are being taken to investigate the allegations
contained in the secretary-general's investigative team's mandate,
the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Council members recognize that the current situation will have
created difficulties in pursuing these allegations, but they want
to request the governments concerned to report again to the
secretary-general on the progress of their investigation, the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
Council members stressed the ending "cycle of human rights
violations and the culture of impunity" is a necessary element
for any lasting settlement to the crisis in the region, it said.
</P>
<P>
"Council members expressed their intention to return to the
issue once the results of the Lusaka meeting are known and, if
necessary, to consider urgently what further role the U.N. might
play in encouraging a peaceful and lasting settlement," the
statement added.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the Tutsi-led rebellion broke out in eastern
Congo (K) in early August this year, Angola, Namibia and
Zimbabwe sent their troops to help President Laurent Kabila wipe
out the rebels.

<HEADLINE> Racist Serial Killer Sentenced to Life Terms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 22 (Xinhua) -- A racist serial killer
already on one state's death row received a life sentence in
Cincinnati of the United States Thursday for each of the 1980
sniper murders of two black teens.
</P>
<P>
Joseph Paul Franklin has been involved in up to 18 killings
across the nation.
</P>
<P>
Franklin, who is now been convicted of nine murders from
Tennessee to Utah, has said he tried to start a race war by
traveling around the country shooting blacks and interracial
couples from 1977 to 1980. He will be returned to Missouri, where
he was sentenced earlier to be executed, The Associated Press
reported.
</P>
<P>
Franklin, 48, was convicted Wednesday in Hamilton County common
pleas court of two counts of aggravated murder for killing cousins
Darrell Lane, 14, and Dante Evans Brown, 13, of Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutor Joseph Deters had said he would ask the judge to
impose two consecutive prison terms of 20 years to life. Franklin
could not get more than life because Ohio had no death penalty at
the time of the shootings.
</P>
<P>
After the jury's verdict Wednesday, Franklin told the judge he
preferred to be sentenced right away. But Winkler said he would
wait until Thursday in order to hear first from the victims'
families.
</P>
<P>
Franklin is on Missouri's death row for the 1977 sniper killing
of a Jewish man who was leaving a synagogue. He also has been
sentenced to life in prison in other states for racially motivated
shootings.
</P>
<P>
Franklin also has admitted to wounding civil rights leader
Vernon Jordan, now a Washington lawyer and friend of President
Bill Clinton's, in 1980 and Hustler magazine publisher Larry
Flynt, who enraged Franklin by publishing pictures of interracial
couples, in 1978.

<HEADLINE> Arab League Welcomes Syrian-Turkish Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 22 (Xinhua) -- The Cairo-based Arab League
Secretary General Ahmed Esmat Abdel-Meguid expressed welcome
Thursday to the Syrian-Turkish agreement aimed at defusing
tensions.
</P>
<P>
Abdel-Meguid told reporters that the agreement has testified to
Syria's keenness on settling its disputes with Turkey, which
marred their relations, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Syria and Turkey signed the agreement Tuesday, easing a
weeks-long standoff which sparked fears of a regional conflict
after Ankara suggested it might resort to force to stop what it
denounced as Damascus' support for Kurdish rebels.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Syria pledged to shut down camps of
Turkey's outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) in its territories
and the Syrian-controlled Bekaa Valley in Lebanon. It also agreed
not to allow PKK rebels to launch cross-border attacks on Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The PKK has been fighting since 1984 for an independent state
in southeastern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Abdel-Meguid called on the Turkish government to reconsider
its stances toward Israel and steer clear of military cooperation
with the Jewish state which occupies Arab territories, including
the holy city of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that Ankara would maintain cooperation
with Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
Turkey maintains close military ties with Israel through two
agreements signed in 1996 on military training and defense
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The Arab world, especially Syria situated between Turkey and
Israel, has voiced opposition to the military alliance, urging
Ankara not to betray the interests of the Muslims.
</P>
<P>
Syria has disputes with Israel over the future of the Golan
Heights captured by Israel from Syria in the 1967 Middle East
War.

<HEADLINE> British Clinic Gets license to Freeze Human Eggs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 22 (Xinhua) -- A clinic in west London has been
awarded the first license in the UK to freeze human eggs.
</P>
<P>
The service became available from the Assisted Reproduction and
Gynaecology Center this week and will be open to women aged under
35, the BBC reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
It will also be useful for women who have been diagnosed with
cancer and are likely to be made sterile by the chemotherapy or
radiotherapy they will receive.
</P>
<P>
The service will cost 2800 pounds ( 4760 U.S. dollars) a year
for a woman who want to have her eggs stored.
</P>
<P>
The eggs, which are stored in liquid nitrogen, are not intended
to be kept for more than five years, although this may be extended
in the future, Mohamed Taranissi, director of the clinic, was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Frozen sperm and test-tube embryos have been used in fertility
treatment but freezing human eggs, which are very delicate, has
been difficult.
</P>
<P>
Only a few clinics worldwide are allowed to freeze, store and
thaw human eggs. So far no more than eight babies worldwide have
been born from embryos created from frozen eggs.

<HEADLINE> Canada to Assist Cote d'Ioire in Municipal Tax Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Canada announced Thursday that
it will assist with a project to support municipal tax reform in
the Republic of Cote d'Ivoire.
</P>
<P>
"Cote d'Ioire is the first West African country to propose
municipal tax reform. This innovative project, the first to emerge
from Canada's new assistance program in Cote d'Ioire, will
significantly improve the living conditions of thousands of
Ivoiriens," said International Cooperation Minister Diane Marleau
in a release.
</P>
<P>
The project will help the leaders of 20 major cities of Cote
d'Ivoire to strengthen the municipal level of government by
developing local taxation, including property assessment. By doing
this, these cities will bring in regular revenues, which will be
returned to citizens by providing municipal services, such as
waste management and a potable water supply.
</P>
<P>
Canada, through the Canadian International Development Agency,
will contribute close to 5 million Canadian dollars (3.25 U.S.
dollars) over four years to implement this project.

<HEADLINE> ECOWAS to Hold Ministerial Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian government officials
said Thursday that a ministers meeting of west African countries
will be held Friday in Nigerian capital Abuja to make preparations
for the forthcoming ECOWAS summit.
</P>
<P>
The six-day meeting for national planning is to prepare an
agenda for the 21st summit of the Economic Community of West
African Nations (ECOWAS) scheduled for October 30-31, the News
Agency of Nigeria (NAN) quoted the officials as saying.
</P>
<P>
They disclosed that the issues to be discussed at the
ministerial meeting include finding a lasting solution to the
renewed fighting in Guinea Bissau, the introduction of ECOWAS
travellers' check to smoothen payment system in the west African
sub-region and lack of funds which has rendered ECOWAS inactive.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that ECOWAS member states currently owe the
body 44 million U.S. Dollars and only Nigeria, Benin and Cote
d'Ivoire are up-to-date in their dues.
</P>
<P>
During a tour of the ECOWAS headquarters complex in Abuja
Tuesday, Nigerian Head of state General Abdulsalam Abubakar,
current ECOWAS Chairman, said the situation was so bad that the
Nigerian government had to rescue the sub-regional body by
providing the September salaries of ECOWAS workers.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a statement issued Wednesday by the ECOWAS
Secretariat said Abubakar had sent a special envoy to Guinea
Bissau following renewed fighting between forces loyal to
President Joao Vieira and sacked Army Chief General Ansumane
Mane.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the envoy would "bring the two parties to
reason" so that they would respect the August 26 ceasefire signed
in Praia, Cape Verde.
</P>
<P>
The decision to send the envoy followed consultations between
Abubakar and the five-nation Contact Group of Portuguese Speaking
Countries.
</P>
<P>
Peace talks between the two parties under the aegis of the
contact group and the Committee of Seven on Guinea Bissau are
expected to resume after last month's failed attempt to get the
two parties to sign an agreement in Abidjan.
</P>
<P>
A meeting of ECOWAS administration and finance commission was
held in Abuja on October 12 to 22 and the Council of Ministers of
Foreign Affairs will meet on October 26-28.
</P>
<P>
The 16-nation ECOWAS was established in 1975 to foster
economic integration and socio-political development of the west
African sub-region.

CAIRO, October 22 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Egyptian Minister of Tourism Mamdouh Al Biltagi has
said that Egypt is expected to raise its hotel accommodation
capacity from the current 17,000 rooms to 200,000 rooms in five
years.
</P>
<P>
Biltagi said that tourism is on the rise in recent years due to
the government's big success in carrying out ambitious
infrastructure projects at a total cost of 216 billion pounds
(about 63.6 billion U.S. dollars), the Arabic Alam Al Yom reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- A number of Egyptian companies will take part, for the
first time, in the world electricity exhibition, which is to be
held in Paris from December 7-11.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian Arbic daily Alam Al Yom reported Thursday that
Egypt imported 103 million dollars worth of French-made
electricity equipment last year, making up some 20 percent of
France's total exports of electricity appliances to the Middle
East.
</P>
<P>
AMMAN -- The overall receiving and delivery operations at
Jordan's Red Sea port of Aqaba rose by 6 percent during the first
nine months this year, compared with that during the same period
last year, the weekly newspaper Star reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The paper attributed the rise to a 23 percent increase of
the kingdom's imports through the port.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Germany will offer Egypt 160 million German marks
(88.89 million U.S. dollars) to finance its development projects,
Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Under a protocol between the two sides for financial and
economic cooperation for the year 1998/1999, the fund will
comprise a non-refundable grant of 84 million marks (46.67 million
dollars) and a soft loan of 76 million marks (42.22 million
dollars) to be repaid in 40 years with a 10-year grace period.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Germany will extend additional 42 million marks
(23.33 million dollars) to finance Egypt's infrastructure projects
and small- and medium-sized businesses.

<HEADLINE> Investigation Shows Black Churches Major Target of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Statistics released two
years after Southern black churches became the most visible
targets in a startling national rash of church burnings in the
United States show that black churches are making up about
one-fourth of those attacked.
</P>
<P>
"Right now we have found no evidence of a national conspiracy"
based on race or anti-religious motives, said Bill Lann Lee,
acting assistant attorney general for civil rights. In some cases,
clusters of church attacks revealed "local coordination" among
arsonists, Lee said.
</P>
<P>
A national task force tracks arson attacks on churches,
investigations and arrests since 1995. The task force was created
after highly reported attacks on black churches in the South
between 1995 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
Of 670 suspicious church fires, bombings or attempted bombings
tracked by the task force since January 1995, 225 targeted black
churches. That one-in-three figure is out of proportion to the
black population, which is roughly 13 percent of Americans.
</P>
<P>
The task force's second report shows that in 1996, when church
fires nationwide reached a peak of 297, 119 were black churches.
In 1997, the task force tallied 53 attacks on black churches and
155 attacks on other churches. For the first eight months of 1998,
the figures are 28 black churches and 86 other churches, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
The numbers look different when only Southern churches are
counted. The task force counted 163 attacks on black churches in
the South and 192 attacks on other churches. Forty-two percent of
blacks live in the South.
</P>
<P>
Most of the fires remain unsolved, although arrests were
reported in 34 percent of church fires, more than twice the
national rate for all arson cases, about 16 percent.
</P>
<P>
The task force of Justice Department and Treasury enforcers
reported 243 investigations closed and 427 open.
</P>
<P>
Of 308 people arrested in all church attacks, 254 are white, 46
are black and eight are Hispanic, the report said. Looking only at
attacks on black churches, the arrests were 68 white, 37 black,
and one Hispanic.

<HEADLINE> UN Official: Clash Is Expected at Global Warming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Clash was expected at
the upcoming global warming conference to be held next month in
Buenos Aires, Argentina, a U.N. climate official said here on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Michael Zammit Cutajar, U.N. administrator of the 1992 global
warming treaty, said as the Untied States pushed to extend limits
on greenhouse gas emission to poorer countries, north and south
might clash from the first day of the conference.
</P>
<P>
Argentine delegation is expected to try to add to the agenda of
the conference a discussion of ways to make voluntary emissions
quotas for some developing countries part of the formal treaty
structure.
</P>
<P>
 Zammit Cutajar said, "That is when a row could blow up. The
Argentine proposal is supported by some and opposed by many."
</P>
<P>
 But the meeting would mark the beginning of a new phase of
negotiations that might last three or four years, he added
</P>
<P>
 Last December in Kyoto, Japan, governments agreed to a
treaty protocol that would, for the first time, legally mandate
emission reductions by the United States, Japan, the 15-nation
European Union and 21 industrial nations.
</P>
<P>
 They are to cut their output of carbon dioxide and other
greenhouse gases blamed for global warming. The agreement merely
asks poorer nations to do their best to restrain emissions.
</P>
<P>
The Buenos Aires conference was planned to work out details
of such treaty mechanisms as a system of trading emissions quotas
among industrial nations.

<HEADLINE> N.Irish Political Leaders: Arms Row Not to Wreck </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of Northern Ireland's
largest Catholic nationalist party said on Thursday they would not
let a row over guerrilla arms wreck Northern Ireland's peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Social Democratic Labor Party leader John Hume and Seamus
Mallon, Northern Ireland's deputy first minister, said all parties
in the British province's newly proposed devolved assembly were
determined to find a solution to the arms dispute.
</P>
<P>
The question of whether Northern Ireland's guerrilla
organization should hand in, or "decommission" their stocks of
guns and bombs has threatened to wreck last April's historic peace
accord intended to end 30 years of violence.
</P>
<P>
"None of the parties in this assembly want the agreement to
fall on this issue of decommissioning," Reuters quoted Mallon as
telling reporters after talks with British Prime Minister Tony
Blair.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that there is a determination that we will work this
agreement," he said.
</P>
<P>
Blair will meet Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern on the
fringes of a European Union meeting in Austria this weekend to
discuss the arms issue, according to Reuters.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Test Mismatched Bone Marrow Transplants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Scientists from Israel and
Italy said that mismatched boon marrow transplantation could be as
effective as those in which the donor and recipient are fully
matched in treating leukemia, according to a report by the New
England Journal of Medicine Thursday.
</P>
<P>
For many leukemia sufferers, bone marrow transplantation is
their only hope. Unfortunately in about 40 percent of terminal
cases, patients fail to find a perfectly matched donor among
relatives or in any of the donor registries.
</P>
<P>
Normally a donor and recipient are considered compatible when
they are matched for all six immunological markers on their
chromosomes: three inherited from the mother and three from the
father. However, in the method developed by scientists from the
Weizmann Institute of Science of Israel and Perugia University of
Italy, the donor and the recipient need to be matched for only
three markers.
</P>
<P>
Such a partial match is always found between parents and
children, and there is a 75 percent chance of finding it between
siblings. Even among the extended family the chances are fairly
good.
</P>
<P>
A key element of the new method is the use of extremely large
doses of donor marrow. The donor receives growth hormone that can
trigger the release of large numbers of marrow cells into the
bloodstream. These cells are then strained from the donors' blood.
The marrow is cleansed to remove blood cells that can trigger a
rejection.
</P>
<P>
After 18 months, 12 of the 43 patients treated this way were
alive and free of disease. However, doctors cautioned that
rebuilding of the patients' immune systems was poor, and
infections were a common cause of death.
</P>
<P>
They said that these results are similar to the success rate
obtained with perfectly matched transplants in this category of
patients.

<HEADLINE> Robin Cook Visits Romania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Romania and the United
Kingdom were of opinion that a solution had not yet been found to
the Kosovo crisis and "we are just about to start a process,"
Romanian Foreign Minister Andrei Plesu said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Plesu made the remarks at a joint press conference after talks
with the visiting British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook.
</P>
<P>
According to Plesu, regional situation as well as the
cooperation in all fields between the two countries were briefly
reviewed during the talks.
</P>
<P>
At the press conference, Robin Cook evaluated the relations
between the two countries as very good and pointed out his
country's commitment to the enlargement of the European Union
towards countries in central and eastern Europe, including
Romania.
</P>
<P>
The United Kingdom wanted to strengthen ties with Romania and
help it with its aspiration to access to the Euro-Atlantic
structures, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
London authorities firmly assert that NATO must stay open,
while states like Romania should prepare themselves to become
members of the Alliance, Cook said, adding that a substantiaL
military cooperation program between the two states, which
includes upgrading of Romanian army, was about to be implemented.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Cook had also called on Romanian President
Emil Constantinescu and Prime Minister Radu Vasile.
</P>
<P>
Cook arrived here Wednesday evening on an one-day official
visit. Bucharest was the last leg of his Balkan tour which also
included Bulgaria and Macedonia.

<HEADLINE> UK Claims No Political Decision on Pinochet Extradition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 22 (Xinhua) -- British Home Secretary Jack
Straw said Thursday that his government would not take a political
decision on a Spanish request to extradite former Chilean
president Augusto Pinochet.
</P>
<P>
Straw said in a written statement to the parliament that he
would take only a judicial view of the extradition request from
Spanish judge Baltasar Garzon, who wants Pinochet to face charges
of genocide and torture.
</P>
<P>
"This will not be a political decision," Straw said, adding
that the provisional warrant issued by a British magistrate on
October 16 cited the offense of murder for the arrest of the
Chilean leader, who is receiving medical treatment in London.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that he would have to consider whether the formal
extradition request, which must be filed within 40 days of
Pinochet's arrest, matched the requirements of British extradition
law.
</P>
<P>
Among issues to be considered were "whether the offenses are
extradition crimes, whether the request is properly authenticated,
whether the offenses are of a political character and any
compassionate circumstances."
</P>
<P>
Early Thursday, lawyers for Pinochet launched a legal challenge
to Pinochet's arrest in a bid to free him and two High Court
judges adjourned until Monday the hearing of the challenge to the
warrant under which Pinochet was arrested.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Emphasis should be
placed on transparency in outer space activities and on the
equitable sharing of space benefits between the developed and
developing countries, a U.N. committee was told Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The peaceful use of outer space could only be achieved through
further development of international space law and strengthening
of international cooperation, Malaysian representative Abdul
Khalid Othman said during a debate at the Committee on the
Peaceful Uses of Outer Space.
</P>
<P>
Tunisian representative Mohamed Salah Tekaya said there
remained a wide gap between the developed and developing countries
in space technology, preventing the developing countries from
benefiting fully from the uses of outer space.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on behalf of the European Union, Austrian
representative Ulrike Butschek said the question of space debris
was particularly urgent as space debris constituted an increasing
problem for space flight.
</P>
<P>
A U.N. report said the U.N. and the European Space Agency are
providing assistance in implementing a pilot program to enable
scientists from Africa, Asia and Latin America to receive and
utilize European Remote Sensing Satellite data in sustainable
development projects.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Urged to Cooperate With Int'l Tribunal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 22 (Xinhua) -- The president of the
International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia Thursday
voiced her concerns over the failure of an accord between
Yugoslavia and NATO to contain any provisions on Belgrade's
obligation to cooperate with the international tribunal.
</P>
<P>
The tribunal president, Judge Gabrielle McDonald, voiced her
concerns in a letter to the president of the U.N. Security
Council, Jeremy Greenstock of the United Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
"This is of particular concern to the international tribunal
considering the history of its relationship with" Yugoslavia,
"characterized by near-total non-compliance," she said.
</P>
<P>
In the letter, Judge McDonald said she wants the tribuanl's
competence to be "unambiguously reaffirmed" by the 15-member
Security Council and the obligation of the Yugoslav government to
cooperate with the international tribunal to be "made an explicit
part of any resolution of the situation in Kosovo."
</P>
<P>
In its two resolutions on Kosovo, the Security Council has
confirmed that Yugoslavia is bound under international law to
comply with the international tribunal.
</P>
<P>
"The obligation to cooperate and comply is incontrovertible,"
she said. "It is not subject to alternation, negotiation or
abrogation by any individual or government."
</P>
<P>
The agreement, signed by Yugoslavia, NATO and the Organization
for Security and Cooperation in Europe, paved the way for sending
2,000 international observers to verify Belgrade's compliance
with relevant U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic said he is committed to
the agreement. The statement was echoed by Vladislav Jovanovic,
charge d'affaires of the Yugoslav mission to the United Nations,
who told a press conference Wednesday, "We are implementing the
agreement in good faith."

<HEADLINE> Indians to Replace Norwegians for U.N. in Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 22 (Xinhua) -- An Indian infantry
battalion is scheduled to join the U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon
(UNIFIL) to replace a Norwegian battalion, which is being
withdrawn at the end of November, according to an exchange of
letters made public here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council approved the move after being notified in
a letter from Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
</P>
<P>
The UNIFIL consists of 4,450 soldiers, including the 612-strong
Norwegian battalion, and it is the largest U.N. peacekeeping
operation. Its commander is Maj. Gen. Jioje Konrote of Fiji.
</P>
<P>
The UNIFIL was set up in 1978 to restore the Lebanese
government's authority over the southern part of the country after
an Israeli incursion against Palestinian guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Israel withdrew its troops after a 1982 invasion but retained a
so-called security zone along the Lebanese side of the border,
aided by the pro-Israeli South Lebanon Army militia, to block
attacks against northern Israel.
</P>
<P>
Other countries with troops serving in the UNIFIL, apart from
Norway, are Fiji, Finland, France, Ghana, Ireland, Italy, Nepal
and Poland.

WASHINGTON, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Israel and Palestine
Thursday are finishing their talks and close to a deal on security
issues which are the major obstacles in the Middle East summit,
reports reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
The only disputed major issue in security now is that Palestine
still refused to meet Israel's demand to reconvene a session of
the Palestine National Council (PNC), or the parliament, to cancel
the anti-Israel provisions in the Palestine Charter.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians insisted that the provisions have been removed
in 1996 and it is unnecessary to reconvene the 600-member PNC.
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the talks said that it is possible to reach an
agreement very soon, but it appears it still needs more work.

LONDON, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Argentine President Carlos Menem
has expressed regrets over the loss of lives during the Malvinas
(Falklands) war in 1982.
</P>
<P>
President Menem, who is due to pay a state visit to Britain
next week, made the remarks in Britain's top-selling Sun tabloid
to be published Friday.
</P>
<P>
Menem wrote in the newspaper, "1982 was a sad and traumatic
blot in the history of our relations. Some brave young Argentine
and British soldiers lost their lives in a conflict that should
never have happened and that we deeply regret."
</P>
<P>
Sun editor David Yelland told Sky Television, "Basically he
said sorry, which is a very significant and to some extent
historic thing for him to say."
</P>
<P>
"He has not said `We don't have any claims over the Falklands'
(Malvinas), he has just said `The war should never have happened,
people should not have died and there will be no more military
action,'" Yelland said.
</P>
<P>
However, the British government has made it clear that while
reconciliation is high on the agenda, there can be no substantial
talks about sovereignty of the islands.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Urges Netanyahu, Arafat to Take Tough Decisions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 22 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
met Israeli and Palestinian leaders for the sixth time in eight
days in Maryland Thursday, urging them to take tough decisions as
soon as possible for an agreement.
</P>
<P>
"With respect to ta sense of urgency,... the day began with a
good tone and a good effort on both parties' part," said State
Department spokesman James Rubin at a regular briefing.
</P>
<P>
The United States said that it hopes Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian President Yasser Arafat could
complete the talks by the end of the day.
</P>
<P>
"Part and parcel of the American initiative has been a
comprehensive, systematic approach to fight terrorism in all its
aspects in all the effective ways," Rubin noted.
</P>
<P>
"We believe the difficult issues are now on the table," White
House spokesman Joe Lockhart told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"And the time is now for the parties to make the tough
decisions. The president wants the parties to make the important
decisions today," said Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
Clinton had separate talks with Netanyahu and Arafat and later
joined a crucial meeting between the two leaders.
</P>
<P>
King Hussein of Jordan also flew to the secluded summit site,
Wye Plantation, which is 110 km east from Washington.
</P>
<P>
Israeli spokesman Aviv Bushinsky called the meeting "decisive"
and said the central question was Israel's demand that Arafat
convene a 700-member Palestinian council to change a charter which
calls for destroying the state of Israel.
</P>
<P>
However, a Palestinian negotiator said Palestinian interest was
in maps of the next Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank, the
withdrawal to come after that and in Palestinian prisoners.
</P>
<P>
"The council will not be reconvened to amend the charter
because this was done two years ago. If Israel insists on this
condition, then it does not want peace," he added.
</P>
<P>
Bushinsky said, "The issue could be completed in the coming
hour or it is possible that it will need the king's intervention,
in which case it will take longer."
</P>
<P>
While the three leaders talked, the Israeli and Palestinian
delegations worked on the text of a possible agreement in case
Arafat and Netanyahu are able to reach an accord.
</P>
<P>
The atmosphere of the talks was "cordial and businesslike,"
said Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
"The hardest decisions, now, at last, are on the table. Israel,
the Palestinians, the region and the world have very much at stake
today," Clinton told reporters before boarding a helicopter.
</P>
<P>
"I hope the parties will seize this opportunity, and not
retreat from the clear moment to capture the momentum of peace and
keep it moving forward," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday night, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu,
who had packed his bags and ordered his plane on standby, agreed
to stay and work with Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and
CIA Director George Tenet on a West Bank security proposal that
Israel could accept.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Needs More Consultations on Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 22 (Xinhua) -- The president of the
U.N. Security Council, Jeremy Greenstock of Britain, Thursday said
the council would continue consultations on Kosovo to achieve an
early pass of a resolution.
</P>
<P>
"We would hope for a resolution adopted as soon as possible.
Good progress has been made -- more work still to do," Greenstock
told the press here after the council's closed-door consultations
on Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The 15-seat Security Council considered the draft resolution
Thursday but Russia, which has veto power on the council, spelled
out objections it had raised in private meetings of the Contact
Group of major powers throughout the week.
</P>
<P>
Russia objected strongly Thursday to key points in a U.N.
Security Council resolution that would allow NATO to intervene if
European monitors in Kosovo were endangered, diplomats said.
</P>
<P>
The Contact Group -- Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Russia
and the United States -- wants a resolution that would back the
week-old agreement worked out by U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke and
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
The resolution would endorse the accord that calls for
Yugoslavia to withdraw security forces from its Kosovo province
and allows 2,000 observers from the OSCE, the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe, to verify that Belgrade kept
its promises. NATO would monitor compliance from the air.
</P>
<P>
At the heart of Russia's objections is a NATO decision to
conduct punitive bombings if Milosevic reneged on his agreements
with Holbrooke, diplomats here said.
</P>
<P>
NATO has set an Oct. 27 deadline for a meaningful military
withdrawal of Serbian security forces in the largely ethnic
Albanian province.
</P>
<P>
Russia's ambassador Sergei Lavrov mainly objected to a
provision in the draft that allows OSCE and NATO member countries
to intervene to "ensure the freedom of movement and safety" of
OSCE and NATO verification missions.
</P>
<P>
Instead Moscow wanted the council to say that Belgrade would
assure the safety of the unarmed OSCE monitors and in an emergency
they would be "ready to consider" other arrangements, the
diplomats said.
</P>
<P>
Russia, a traditional ally of the Serbs, was supported by China
and Brazil. The OSCE wants a Security Council resolution to give
its actions in Yugoslavia legitimacy and make sure its unarmed
observers can be protected.
</P>
<P>
Greenstock said the OSCE agreement for Kosovo called for a
resolution before the group could act.
</P>
<P>
Shen Guofang, Chinese deputy permanent representative to the
United Nations, told Xinhua Thursday afternoon that China is
against the use of military force against Yugoslavia and it is
unacceptable to cite Chapter VII of the U.N. Charter to justify
such a threat.
</P>
<P>
Chapter VII makes it mandatory but does not necessarily
authorize the use of force.
</P>
<P>
Conflicts broke out in Kosovo in February, where ethnic
Albanians, who make up a majority of the province's population of
2 million, have been battling with Serbs for independence.

<HEADLINE> Buenos Aires Meeting to Address Emissions Cuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 22 (Xinhua) -- A ministerial level
meeting of governments in Buenos Aires, Argentina, next month will
pay the way for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, a senior U.N.
climate official said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The emissions cuts were required by the Kyoto Protocol to the
U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change, said Michael Zammit
Cutajar, the convention's executive secretary at a press briefing.
</P>
<P>
The Kyoto conference on climate change last December was a
high-profile event as it was the first time industrialized nations
adopted legally-binding emissions-reduction targets, he said.
</P>
<P>
In Buenos Aires, governments will try to set up "rules of the
game" for achieving the targets, he added.
</P>
<P>
High on the agenda in the conference is the need to flesh out
the protocol's mechanisms intended to help developed countries
reduce the costs of reaching their combined 5 percent
emissions-reduction target by the five-year period 2008-2012.
</P>
<P>
Under the protocol, an international "emissions trading" regime
will allow developed countries that reduce emissions beyond their
agreed target to sell the excess emissions credits to others.
</P>
<P>
The developed countries are required to cut their output of
carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases to 5 percent below their
1990 level in the said period.
</P>
<P>
A Clean Development Mechanism will also enable industrialized
nations to finance emissions-avoiding projects in developing
countries and receive credit for doing so.
</P>
<P>
This is an important new avenue through which governments and
private corporations can transfer and promote clean technologies,
Cutajar said.
</P>
<P>
But he indicated that a proposal by the host country to put
"voluntary commitments" by developing countries on the agenda is
likely to generate some debating at the conference from November
2-13.
</P>
<P>
Many developing countries feel that it is not fair for them to
take on the responsibility of mandatory energy restraints at this
stage when the rich nations should be responsible for much of the
emissions.

<HEADLINE> Chelsea Chairman Calls for "International" Split </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 22 (Xinhua) -- English Premier League club
Chelsea's chairman Ken Bates called on UEFA and FIFA to end
"meaningless matches" at both national and club level by
segregating teams from smaller countries into pre-qualifying
competitions.
</P>
<P>
Bates, writing in the match program before holders Chelsea
meet FC Copenhagen of Denmark in the first leg of their European
Cup Winners' Cup second round tie, also called on FIFA to end
"pointless competitions" such as the Confederation Cup, scheduled
for Mexico in January.
</P>
<P>
Bates says that UEFA's proposals to change the format of their
competitions with an expanded Champions League and a merger of
the UEFA and Cup Winners' Cups do not go far enough.
</P>
<P>
"The continued emergence of newly independent states joining
UEFA is beginning to cause a nightmare scenario," writes Bates.
</P>
<P>
"It is because so many clubs are being admitted to European
competition that entrants are having to play so many matches, the
early ones of which often make no money.
</P>
<P>
"What should happen... is that the seeding system already in
place should be used to split the competition with the lower
seeds having a junior competition, the most successful of which
would join the senior competition the following year.
</P>
<P>
"This would result in smaller clubs playing at their own
level, the bigger clubs would have more attractive opposition and
that would require less games to be played.
</P>
<P>
"While doing it for the club competitions, why not go the
whole (way) and do it for the countries as well. This would again
help ease fixture congestion and reduce the number of
meaningless, almost 'friendly' matches."
</P>
<P>
Bates' comments echo those of Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger
who earlier this week said that there were too many one-sided
matches being played at international level and that as a result
some club teams were now stronger than their national teams.

<HEADLINE> Israel, Palestine Agree on Changing Palestine's Charter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Israel Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat reached
agreement Thursday on revising anti-Israel provisions in the
Palestinian charter.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the Palestinian National Council would
meet with other Palestinian groups and take formal action to annul
clauses of the 1964 document that promotes Israel's dismantling as
a Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
The dispute between Israel and Palestine on changing the
charter almost made the whole summit fail on Wednesday night after
Israel threatened to walk out of the summit unless Palestine met
its demand.
</P>
<P>
However, the two sides still differ on the release of
Palestinian prisoners held by Israel and the safe passage between
Gaza Strip and the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The critical agreement was reached after U.S. President Bill
Clinton pushed the talks in a full gear for the whole day in the
Wye Plantation, Maryland.
</P>
<P>
Clinton had separate talks with Netanyahu and Arafat and later
joined a crucial meeting between the two leaders.
</P>
<P>
King Hussein of Jordan also flew to the secluded summit site,
which is 110 kilometers east of Washington.
</P>
<P>
While the three leaders talked, the Israeli and Palestinian
delegations worked on the text of a possible agreement in case
Arafat and Netanyahu are able to reach an accord.

<P>
STOCKHOLM, October 22 (Xinhua) -- The Swedish government
decided on Thursday to contribute 80 personnel to the verification
mission which the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe (OSCE) is now to establish in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"A speedy establishment of the mission is essential to promote
the peace efforts and to make it easier for refugees to return to
their home villages," Swedish Foreign Minister Anna Lindh said.
</P>
<P>
The OSCE mission will consist of up to 2,000 unarmed personnel
including police officers, military personnel involved in civil
operations and special experts on democracy and human rights.
</P>
<P>
It will undertake the task of verifying compliance with
U.N. Security Council Resolution 1199, of establishing a presence
in different parts of Kosovo, of assisting international
organizations and of supervising elections in the Serbian province
of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The Swedish contribution is primarily planned to cover a period
of six months.

<HEADLINE> Six Refs to Get Professional Terms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Soccer match referees could be
as professional as players from the next season in England.
</P>
<P>
Six referees are set to be employed on a professional basis by
the Premiership from the start of next season.
</P>
<P>
The officials will be paid for working full-time under an
experimental scheme to improve the standard of decision-making on
the pitch.
</P>
<P>
And if the plan proves a success it will be expanded and
implemented permanently.
</P>
<P>
Philip Don, the Premier League's referees' officer, is
finalizing a plan to go before the December meeting of the 20
top-flight chairmen.
</P>
<P>
"We're looking at next season," Don revealed. "There would be
a maximum of six full-time refs initially and we would take it
from there.
</P>
<P>
"We are likely to have a full-time group of referees next
season if everything goes through. They will be employed by the
Premier League and paid a salary, though I can't say what that
would be."
</P>
<P>
However, he admitted not every Premiership official would want
to abandon the other jobs that do in tandem with their refereeing.
</P>
<P>
"It may not be the best course of action, there may be some
who would be quite happy doing what they are doing at the moment.
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't like to deny these people the opportunity of
refereeing at the highest level."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, one of the League's leading officials, David
Elleray, said he had reservations about the scheme.
</P>
<P>
He confirmed he would not be applying for a full-time post and
would instead continue with his job as a public school teacher.
</P>
<P>
"I don't believe it will make the fundamental difference that
many people think it will make," Elleray told BBC's Radio 5 Live.
</P>
<P>
"There's a worrying tendency in football these days to expect
referees never to make mistakes.
</P>
<P>
"And I'm concerned that when referees go full-time people will
think that because they are being paid fairly large salaries they
will overnight become infallible.
</P>
<P>
"But when you pay Alan Shearer whatever it is you pay him,
that doesn't guarantee he'll score with every shot."
</P>
<P>
The Premier League confirmed the plan and a spokesman said:
"It would be wrong to comment before the meeting but full-time
referees next season is certainly a possibility."

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 23 (Xinhua) -- China's civil aviation industry
has grown nearly 30-fold in annual turnover over the past two
decades, according to the Civil Aviation Administration of China.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, total turnover in the industry stood at 8.67 billion
tons/km, compared to 1978's 300 million tons/km, while the number
of passengers carried by China's airlines reached 56.3 million,
compared to 1978's 2.3 million.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, China's airlines had 485 aircraft and the country had
141 airports. In 1978, there were 80 aircraft and 78 airports.
</P>
<P>
Chinese airlines now operate nearly 1,000 domestic and
international routes covering a total length of 1.8 million km,
compared with 162 routes and 240,000 km in 1978.
</P>
<P>
Industry safety and service have improved over the past several
years. Since 1994, the industry has recorded 1,023 days of safe
flying, the longest in China's civil aviation history.

<HEADLINE> MPs Demand Action on Murdoch's Takeover of Man United </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 22 (Xinhua) -- British Trade Secretary Peter
Mandelson has been urged by a cross-bench group of 46 MPs to
investigate BSkyB's proposed takeover of English Premier League
club Manchester United.
</P>
<P>
An Early Day Motion (EDM) tabled in the House of Commons
Thursday called on Peter Mandelson to refer the bid to the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
</P>
<P>
The EDM says the deal would "create an unacceptable situation"
which would "not be in the best public interest of fans, clubs or
television viewers and sport in general".
</P>
<P>
The MPs also demanded the setting up of "a full inquiry into
the funding of football by television, in all its aspects".
</P>
<P>
Most of the motion's supporters came from the Labour benches,
but four Conservatives and three Lib Dems added their support.
</P>
<P>
The move comes the day after Manchester United thrashed
Brondby 6-2 in the European Champions' League.
</P>
<P>
It also follows BSkyB's purchase of 12 million pounds of
Manchester United shares.
</P>
<P>
This means about 11 percent of the club is now in the hands of
media mogul Rupert Murdoch.

<HEADLINE> Owen Feels Fine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 22 (Xinhua) -- England wonder boy Michael Owen
has dismissed fears that he may be in danger of burning himself
out because of too much football.
</P>
<P>
The 18-year-old Liverpool striker was rested from the starting
line-up for Tuesday's UEFA Cup game against Valencia, but insists
he is fully fit and eager to return to the team.
</P>
<P>
"It was not as if the manager said I was not playing well
enough -- it was an entirely different reason. He assured me it
was for the benefit of myself and I accept that.
</P>
<P>
"Obviously it's not good being left out and I want to play the
next game. I feel fine. If the manager thought I needed a rest,
then fair enough, he rested me for a good reason," said Owen.
</P>
<P>
He enjoyed a meteoric rise to fame after becoming a first-team
regular at Anfield last season and was a leading member of
England's team at the World Cup finals.
</P>
<P>
Despite that, Owen says he had sufficient rest before the
start of the new season.
</P>
<P>
"I had a few weeks off after the World Cup and after that I
hardly trained at all. On the pre-season tour I wasn't training
and came on as sub in a couple of games and started one match."
</P>
<P>
He added: "It has been a big year for me, domestically and in
internationals. The World Cup was a great experience for me. It
was the highlight of my career so far."

<HEADLINE> Forest Seek van Hooijdonk Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Nottingham Forest officials are
willing to meet Pierre van Hooijdonk in a bid to break the
deadlock over his three-month strike.
</P>
<P>
The Dutch forward has refused to play for the club this season
after claiming they lack ambition but recently suggested he might
return if the club's football consultant Irving Scholar contacted
him.
</P>
<P>
Nigel Wray, chairman of Nottingham Forest plc, is willing to
talk but insists the first move must come from the player.
</P>
<P>
"Pierre has to do something. He just has to say something
conciliatory. It hasn't got to be on bended knee, begging
forgiveness. We don't want to rub his face in it or ask him to
eat humble pie - that would be a silly position to put him in.
</P>
<P>
"If he admits he has made mistakes and says he wants to talk,
we're more than willing to meet halfway," said Wray.
</P>
<P>
Van Hooijdonk has scored 30 times in 50 league appearances for
Forest, who he joined from Scottish club Celtic for 4.5 million
pounds in 1997.
</P>
<P>
He has been badly missed this season with Forest third bottom
in the Premier League, having scored only six goals in nine games.
</P>
<P>
Despite that, Wray insisted: "What we're not going to do is
rush over to Holland, cap in hand, and ask him to come back. That
would be sacrificing the club's integrity and we're not prepared
to do that."
</P>
<P>
The 28-year-old is likely to receive a frosty reception in the
dressing room. Midfielder Steve Stone says van Hooijdonk has
"betrayed his teammates, but still wants him to return.
</P>
<P>
"Everybody thought we could sell him but it hasn't happened.
So the best way to do it is to get him back here, put him in the
team for six games and then watch the bids come in.
</P>
<P>
"I honestly believe that's what would happen and it's got to
be worth a go," said Stone.
</P>
<P>
Van Hooijdonk played for The Netherlands during the summer
World Cup finals, scoring in their first round win over South
Korea.

<HEADLINE> India Still Has Reservations in Signing CTBT: PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister Atal Behari
Vajpayee has said that India still has serious reservations in
signing the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) in its present
form.
</P>
<P>
In an interview to "India Today" weekly magazine, which is to
be published in its coming issue here, Vajpayee said that New
Delhi has been communicating its views forcefully in talks with
the United States and other countries. For example, one of India's
major concerns is about its ratification. "Will every signatory to
the treaty give an undertaking about ratification by their
respective legislatures within a stipulated time?" he asked.
</P>
<P>
When asked what had changed between May 11 when India conducted
nuclear tests and now which have caused India changed its position
on signing the CTBT, Vajpayee said "our opposition to signing the
CTBT has never been blind. We have achieved what we wanted to by
exercising the nuclear option with the nuclear tests on May 11.
There is a qualitative change in the situation after this historic
event."
</P>
<P>
"We are now a de facto and de jure nuclear power. India's
nuclear status is a reality and not a conferment given by others,"
he further said.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Investors Sell Record Foreign Securities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Canadian investors sold a record
amount of foreign securities in August, Statistics Canada said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
However, this only represented a fifth of their purchases over
the first seven months of this year, the statistics agency said.
</P>
<P>
In August, Canadians sold 2 billion dollars' (1.3 billion U.S.
dollars) worth of foreign bonds and 800 million dollars in stocks
in August.
</P>
<P>
"Sales of bonds (U.S. treasury securities) reduced the
year-to-date net acquisition of foreign bonds to a negligible
amount," the agency said.
</P>
<P>
Canadians' sell-off of foreign equities was restricted to
overseas stock in August. This compared with purchases of almost
11 billion dollars in the first seven month, largely U.S. stocks.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, foreigners sold a record 2 billion dollars'
worth of Canadian stocks.
</P>
<P>
This stood in contrast to the 15 billion dollars foreigners
invested in Canadian stocks over the preceding 13 months.
</P>
<P>
The latest selling came from U.S. and Asian investors, when the
Canadian stock market prices dropped by 20 percent in August, the
agency said.
</P>
<P>
In August, foreigners also sold 800 million dollars' worth in
Canadian bonds, the first time in four months.

<HEADLINE> Good Start for HK Yachting Extravaganza in China Race Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Taking advantage of favorable
October weather, Hong Kong's own yachting extravaganza China Race
Week started in brisk northerly winds on Friday, with four fleets
competing in the waters to the east of the Special Administrative
Region.
</P>
<P>
In the Racing (CHS) division, 12 boats got away at 10:30 in a
breezy 20 knots to complete a near-perfect windward/leeward before
lunch. The winner was the Sydney 46 named Hi Fidelity, helmed by
Neil Pryde.
</P>
<P>
The second windward/leeward started at 13:00, which was won by
Hi Fidelity. Almost match racing in both races were the two
runners-up Hocux Pocux and Intrigue. Hocux Pocus finished second
and Intrigue third in the first race while in the second race,
Intrigue was second and Hocus Pocus finished third.
</P>
<P>
In the Cruising (HKPN) division, the fleet started in Port
Shelter and set off on an islands course around By, Bluff and
Steep Islands, with the finish at Bay.
</P>
<P>
Frank Pong's big Custom 76-footer, Jelik, led throughout the
race to take line honor, followed by Andy Sorian's Swan 68,
Irvmiren. Third on the water was the French catamaran, Atmosphere,
piloted by Benoit Lesaffre.
</P>
<P>
In the lightening afternoon breeze, race officer Lawrence Fan
had to shorten course as some of the heavier boats would not have
made the cut off. On handicap, Bewitched took first in HKPN, with
Windseeker second and Temmujin third.
</P>
<P>
Along with the cruising boats, another 17-strong fleet competed
around the islands - the one designs. These included Magic 25s,
Etchells, Dragons, Impalas and Sonatas. First home was Magic 25,
Fly By Wire, helmed by Roger Eastham.
</P>
<P>
But on handicap the Etchells, Wanchai Belle, too first,
followed by Fly By Wire with Good Vibrations in third. The one
designs really came into their own in the 10-15 knot winds.
</P>
<P>
The fourth fleet to take the water was the multihulls, with
some 50 crews from Australia, Papua New Guinea, Thailand and Hong
Kong SAR. Three races were run back to back with the new Hobie 20
piloted by Chris Steilberg taking line honors in all three.
</P>
<P>
Race officials will be keeping a close watch on Typhoon Babs as
it nears Hong Kong on Saturday. A No.3 signal in the evening could
mean racing is canceled on Sunday and in the words of race officer
Brian Littlechild, "I hope it turns right and goes to Japan."

<HEADLINE> Singapore Airlines Registers Sharp Drop in Half-Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, October 23 (Xinhua) -- The Singapore Airlines (SIA)
announced Friday evening that it has registered a 44.2 per cent
drop over a year ago in its half-year profits.
</P>
<P>
SIA said in a press release that the company's operating profit
for the six months ending on September 30, 1998, fell 195 million
Singapore dollars (120 million U.S. dollars) to 246 million
Singapore dollars (150 million U.S. dollars) compared with the
same period in 1997.
</P>
<P>
SIA said its revenue declined by 87 million Singapore dollars
(53 million U.S. dollar) to 3,432 million Singapore dollars (2,118
million U.S. dollars) while expenditure rose by 108 million
Singapore dollars (67 million U.S. dollars) to 3,186 million
Singapore dollars (1,966 million U.S. dollars), registering a 2.5
per cent drop and a 3.5 per cent hike respectively over a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
SIA also said in the period, its capacity grew by 6.4 per cent
to 7,693 million tone-kilometers from frequency increases to some
existing destinations and the effect of additional and new
services introduced during 1997-1998.
</P>
<P>
But traffic increased at a lower rate of 2.6 per cent to 5,225
million tone-kilometers. As a result, overall load factor dropped
2.5 percentage points to 67.9 per cent and passenger seat factor
was 3.0 percentage points lower at 71 per cent while cargo load
factor fell 1.8 percentage points to 66.4 per cent.
</P>
<P>
According to SIA, as the company's average staff strength
increased by 445 (3.3 per cent ) to 13810, the company's staff
productivity, measured by the average changes in capacity
produced, load carried, revenue earned and value added per
employee, dropped by 3.5 per cent.
</P>
<P>
As at September 30, 1998, SIA's fleet comprised 91 aircraft --
37 B747-400s, 4 B747-300s, 2 B747-300 Combis, 14 A340-300s, 6
B777-200s, 4 B777-200s, 17 A310-300s and 7 B747-400 freighters.
</P>
<P>
SIA also said it has concluded an agreement to sell two B747-300
Combis and two B-747-300 passenger aircraft in the next financial
year.
</P>
<P>
SIA attributed the decline in its profits to adverse affects by
the economic downturn in Asia. "Under the circumstances the
decline in profits is not unexpected, and it could have been
worse," SIA Deputy Chairman and CEO Cheong Choong Kong was quoted
as saying.

<HEADLINE> Mideast Agreement Reached, But Then Snagged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 23 (Xinhua) -- The land-for-peace deal
ready to be signed by Israel and Palestine hit a last-minute snag
Friday.
</P>
<P>
"We're working hard to work through the issues to put the
agreement back together," White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
Though Lockhart wouldn't discuss the snag, a senior Israeli
official said the dispute focused on the release of Jonathan
Pollard, an American serving a life sentence for spying for
Israel.
</P>
<P>
An Israeli official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
the West Bank agreement between the Israelis and the Palestinians,
reached after nine days of marathon negotiations, was on hold
while the Israelis considered their next move.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli official said the U.S. had reached an understanding
with Israeli negotiators for Pollard's release. However, the U.S.
then changed its mind after meeting opposition from the U.S.
intelligence. There was no comment from the U.S. official on the
matter.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton huddled this morning with his
negotiating team in a hastily arranged meeting, conferring in the
same room where the agreement had been sealed hours earlier.
</P>
<P>
His departure from the conference site was delayed for several
hours and a signing ceremony with Netanyahu and Arafat was put on
hold.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the White House disclosed that the agreement will be
announced by President Bill Clinton and be signed at a ceremony at
the White House at 11:30 local time (GMT 1630).
</P>
<P>
Pollard was convicted of giving Israel classified information
on Arab countries and jailed for life in 1985.

<HEADLINE> China Beat XNBA in Scuffle-Plagued Friendly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 23 (Xinhua) -- China's national basketball
team beat the XNBA Legends Team 85-70 in the last game of a
four-game series Friday night here though the match was marred by
scuffles, break-ups and foul-outs.
</P>
<P>
The hosts won the four-game series 3-1 as they defeated the
Americans 98-96 in the first game in Shanghai and 75-71 in the
third in Hefei, Anhui Province. XNBA Legends only won the second
game 86-73 in Shanghai last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
As the greatest players retired from the National Basketball
Association (NBA), the Americans found Friday's match harder than
that when they were active in the NBA.
</P>
<P>
The XNBA team coach Oscar Robertson called a walk-off half way
into the second half after Jay Humphries was fouled out as he
pushed Wang Nan. The players came back to the court five minutes
later.
</P>
<P>
Among the boos from the 8000-strong local fans, Robertson
called a second break-up just two minutes later, and this time it
lasted two minutes.
</P>
<P>
Six players were fouled out in the second half, with four from
the ten-man American team.
</P>
<P>
Robertson refused to answer any questions after the game,
while forward Alex English said, "We'll come back next year."
</P>
<P>
"I think the call is OK," said Wang Fei, head coach of the
China's team.
</P>
<P>
Relying on solid defence and pivot playing, the Legends led
most of the first half and finished 43-38 before the break.
</P>
<P>
But the hosts fought back in the second half and led all the
way after guard Li Xiaoyong made four-successive free-throws,
including two technicals, to be up at 49-47.

<HEADLINE> Election to Be Completed in Swaziland Saturday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 23 (Xinhua) -- The Swaziland electoral
office confirmed Friday that the general election, which was
adjourned last Friday due to heavy rains, will go ahead Saturday,
rain or shine.
</P>
<P>
Chief electoral officer Robert Thwala said in Swazi capital
Mbabane that facilities were in place at the polling stations,
and roads and bridges damaged during last Friday's storm had been
repaired to enable voters to cast their votes, South African
Press Association (SAPA) reported.
</P>
<P>
SAPA quoted Thwala as saying that he was optimistic that most
of the 200,000 registered voters would have cast their votes by
the time polling stations closed at 5 p.m. (1500 GMT) Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The votes that were cast last weekend are still valid, and the
ballot boxes, held in police stations for safe keeping, will be
returned to the polling stations.
</P>
<P>
Thwala said he expected no trouble from anti-government
political groups which had been campaigning for a boycott of the
election.
</P>
<P>
The groups are demanding the election be abandoned until the
ban on political parties is lifted.
</P>
<P>
Political parties are banned in the tiny, landlocked kingdom
and King Mswati III is an absolute monarch in the country who
decides on selection of the cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Some 350 candidates, all nominated by the king, are standing
as individuals for 55 seats in the national assembly.
</P>
<P>
Armed security forces are expected to be present outside the
polling stations Saturday to ensure a smooth voting process.
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, police clashed with the opposition groups whom
police said were "intimidating and harassing" voters.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, October 23 (Xinhua) -- NATO Military Committee
Chairman Klaus Naumann and Supreme Allied Commander in Europe
Wesley Clark are scheduled to go to Belgrade on Saturday before
the alliance's air strike ultimatum expires early next week.
</P>
<P>
The two senior officials are to deliver a message to Yugoslav
authorities that they must comply with United Nations Security
Council Resolution 1199 or face military intervention, a NATO
official told reporters on Friday.
</P>
<P>
They are expected to return to NATO headquarters on Sunday and
to brief NATO of the situation in Kosovo next Monday.
</P>
<P>
Although some Yugoslav army and police units have withdrawn
from Kosovo, they did not return to their original barracks or the
positions they had occupied before March this year, the offical
said.
</P>
<P>
Full compliance with the U.N. resolution and the committee's
demands are not negotiable, said the official. He also said the
activities of the Kosovar Liberation Army should not be used as an
excuse for continued conflict in the Yugoslav province.
</P>
<P>
NATO will keep watching whether Belgrade moves the military and
police units back to their barracks, stores away the heavy weapons
in the hands of police units, observes the cease-fire and
refrains from renewed conflict on the excuse of ethnic Albanian
provocation, he added.
</P>
<P>
NATO announced on October 13 the activation order for air
strikes with a four-day ultimatum. Later, the ultimatum grace
period was extended by 10 more days until October 27 to give
Belgrade time to comply and organize outside surveillance of the
compliance.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Israelis and the
Palestinians reached early Friday a breakthrough agreement on
land-for-peace after nine days of intense bargainings, marking an
important milestone in the Mideast history.
</P>
<P>
The agreement will be announced by U.S. President Bill Clinton
and be officially signed at the White House at 11:30 local time

Israel also pledged a third withdrawal from the West Bank, but
the timing and size need to be decided in further talks.
</P>
<P>
A Israeli negotiator told reporters that "unprecedented
achievement has been reached relating to fulfillment of
Palestinian responsibilities" and talks on "final status" issues
including refugees, borders, the status of Jerusalem will begin
soon.

The breakthrough deal is designed to bring closure to all
interim issues and allow final-status talks to begin.
</P>
<P>
The sensitive issues to be worked out in final talks include
the status of Jerusalem and the borders for a possible Palestinian
state. Those talks are scheduled to end on May 4, 1999, when the

<HEADLINE> Nigeria's Fire Disaster Area Residents Relocated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Residents of Jesse town and
environs are now relocating to escape an impending outbreak of
epidemic in the Saturday pipeline fire disaster area, New
Nigerian reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Lilian Mujakpero, Chairman of Sapele Division of the Nigeria
Red Cross Society, said that the presence of decomposing bodies
in river Ethiope and adjoining bushes could lead to an outbreak
of epidemic disease.
</P>
<P>
Following a pipeline fire tragedy resulting in a death toll of
more than 700, about 150 bodies were recovered between Wednesday
and Thursday in a mopping-up operation in the disaster area.
</P>
<P>
Mujakpero was quoted as saying that they decided to revert to
cremation of the recovered bodies in view of the intense heat
from the burning burst pipe.
</P>
<P>
As the mop-up operation is going on in the disaster area,
another Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation pipeline at
Iguosagie, Edo State, has been vandalized, resulting in
widespread leakage of petroleum products, according to a Daily
Times report Friday.
</P>
<P>
It was learned that security personnel had already been sent
to the village to stop further illegal exploitation of the
spilled products.
</P>
<P>
The State Administrator, Navy Commander Anthony Onyearugbulem,
who visited the area Thursday, expressed shock and displeasure at
the development, saying that the vandalization of the pipeline
valve pit, just like that of Jesse, was a coordinated sabotage
between skilled personnel and their collaborators.

<HEADLINE> U.N. to Grant Angola $80M Per Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, October 23 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations will provide
Angola with 80 to 100 million U.S. Dollars in aid per year to
help the war-torn country implement its socio-economic
development plan, a U.N. representative to Luanda said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Coordinator of the U.N. Office in Angola Bernanardo Ntegeye
disclosed this at a press conference here marking the 53rd United
Nations Day which falls on October 24.
</P>
<P>
The figure does not include humanitarian funds, said Ntegeye.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. official stressed that the implementation of the
socio-economic development depends upon what the Angolan
government regards as priorities, hinting whether it can keep
cooperating with the U.N. to carry out the 1994 Lusaka Peace
Protocol.
</P>
<P>
"As far as Angola is concerned, the top priority is to achieve
the longed-for peace and provide welfare to the people," Ntegeye
said. "We have got a plan for this, but that does not mean it
will be carried out smoothly."
</P>
<P>
However, the U.N. coordinator did not explain the details
about the U.N. aid program, only to give an example that the
World Bank decided to finance 7 million U.S. Dollars to build a
running water plant in Kifangondo in suburban Luanda.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the U.N. Development Program (UNDP), the
U.N. Children's Fund (UNICEF) and the World Bank will invest in
many projects in the southern African country.
</P>
<P>
Because the opposition movement National Union for Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA) refused to implement part of the
Lusaka peace accord, the Angolan government in September cut off
its links with UNITA President Jonal Savimba, and declared
recognition othe breakaway group UNITA Renovation Committee as
the sole dialogist in the peace process, thus bringing the U.N.
mediation to a halt.

Chris Ugokwe, chairman of the commission made the remarks in
Abuja while briefing the media on an international conference
scheduled for October 27-29 in Abuja on Nigeria's 1991 census.
</P>
<P>
According to the chairman, the figure is based on an
population of 88.9 million in 1991 and an annual growth rate of
2.83 percent.
</P>
<P>
By the growth rate, he predicted that Nigeria's population
will double to 178 million by the year 2015.
</P>
<P>
According to the results of the 1991 census, 36 percent of the
population live in urban centers, compared with 19 percent in the
1963 census.
</P>
<P>
Children under the age of 14 account for 45 percent of the
population, while elder people above the age of 65 account for
3.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
The overall literacy rate of the population is 57 percent, or
66 percent for males and 48 percent for females.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the coming conference, Ugokwe said that it will
serve to present the 1991 census, which is the most successful
and scientifically conducted census in Nigeria, to the
international society.
</P>
<P>
It will also help to forestall wrong projections of Nigeria's
population that have been attributed to the international
organizations, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to him, Nigerian Head of State General Abdulsalam
Abubakar, United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan, as well as
scholars and policy makers from the international organizations
and many foreign countries will attend the conference.

<HEADLINE> Six Arrested for Illegal Assembly in Malaysia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Six people were arrested
by police for taking part in an unlawful assembly here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Police will get a court order Saturday to remand them in
custody for further investigation, the Malaysian national news
agency Bernama quoted Kuala Lumpur Police Chief Kamarudin Md Ali
as saying.
</P>
<P>
Offenders could be jailed up to one year or fined between 2,000
ringgit (526 U.S. dollars) and 10,000 ringgit (2,631 U.S. dollars)
or both.
</P>
<P>
The unlawful assembly was believed an attempt to influence
members of the public to march to Parliament where Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad presented the 1999 Budget this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The police had to use water cannons after those taking part
ignored orders to disperse.
</P>
<P>
Police also succeeded in preventing several groups on
motorcycles from trying to create disturbances near the Parliament
building during the tabling of the budget, Kamarudin said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the police were forced to detain a Malaysian
cameraman, working for an Australian television station, under

<HEADLINE> UNSCOM Refuses Photographers' Escort in Inspections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, October 23 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Special Commission on
disarming Iraq has refused to allow photographers of a number of
world TV channels to accompany its two inspection teams despite
Iraqi authorities' consent.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi News Agency reported Friday that Nils Carlstrom,
director of U.N. Baghdad Monitoring and Verification Center, said
the refusal of two UNSCOM teams on Thursday was due to the
secretiveness of the work they were doing.
</P>
<P>
However, director-general of Iraqi National Monitoring
Directorate Husam Mohammed Ameen considered UNSCOM rejection as
evasion of exposure of truth.
</P>
<P>
"Our sole interpretation of UNSCOM conduct is that the
commission does not want to be embarrassed when the truth is
exposed and that media would not be given an opportunity to
unveil its manners of work which exceeded limits," said Ameen.
</P>
<P>
On the claimed secretiveness of UNSCOM work, Ameen dismissed
such justifications, saying "we believe that the main reason
behind UNSCOM refusal is not to let their manners of work be
exposed now that their work in Iraq has become unacceptable."
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi official alleged that "a large number of U.N. arms
inspectors' work in Iraq is in service of their own ends which are
connected to espionage objectives, rather than of U.N. goals."
</P>
<P>
Carlstrom confirmed on Thursday that an American arms inspector
shot pictures of an Iraqi missile site with his own camera on
October 8, a conduct considered as violating the rules of UNSCOM.
</P>
<P>
UNSCOM withdrew the American arms inspector, whose name was
not disclosed, four days after Iraq protested over his conduct,
said Carlstrom.
</P>
<P>
In a statement carried by INA on Thursday, Ameen said that a
pilot within UNSCOM, who is a Chilean, tried to shoot pictures
from his helicopter of an Iraqi test field on October 20.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been accusing some U.N. arms inspectors of spying on
Iraq's important military installations, and has demanded that
the U.N. open an investigation on UNSCOM relations with Israeli
intelligency.
</P>
<P>
In Thursday's statement, Ameen said it was well known that the
American inspector Scott Ritter had frankly admitted on TV
channels of spying in the interests of the American and Israeli
intelligence and delivering to them information concerning Iraq's
security and its sensitive sites.
</P>
<P>
Ritter, who served as a marine officer during the 1991 Gulf
War, resigned last month from his post as an important
U.N. weapons inspector, complaining that the U.S. and UNSCOM
failed to take a tough stance toward Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Iraq on August 5 decided to suspend cooperation with UNSCOM and
the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), accusing them of
being dominated by the U.S. and adopting procrastination policy
regarding their disarmament mission in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
So far, Iraq has not announced its revocation of the decision,
though it is widely expected that Baghdad will resume cooperation
with UNSCOM and IAEA soon.
</P>
<P>
The crippling U.N. economic sanctions imposed on Iraq after its
invasion of Kuwait in 1990 will not be lifted unless U.N. arms
inspectors verify that it has been free of weapons of mass
destruction.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Airlines Registers Sharp Drop in Half-Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, October 23 (Xinhua) -- The Singapore Airlines (SIA)
announced Friday evening that it has registered a 44.2 per cent
drop over a year ago in its half-year profits.
</P>
<P>
SIA said in a press release that the company's operating profit
for the six months ending on September 30, 1998, fell 195 million
Singapore dollars (about 120 million U.S. dollars) to 246 million
Singapore dollars (about 150 million U.S. dollars) compared with
the same period in 1997.
</P>
<P>
SIA said its revenue declined by 87 million Singapore dollars
(about 53 million U.S. dollar) to 3,432 million Singapore dollars
(about 2,118 million U.S. dollars) while expenditure rose by 108
million Singapore dollars (about 67 million U.S. dollars) to 3,186
million Singapore dollars (1,966 U.S. dollars), registering a 2.5
per cent drop and a 3.5 per cent hike respectively over a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
SIA also said in the period, its capacity grew by 6.4 per cent
to 7,693 million tone-kilometers from frequency increases to some
existing destinations and the effect of additional and new
services introduced during 1997-1998.
</P>
<P>
But traffic increased at a lower rate of 2.6 per cent to 5,225
million tone-kilometers. As a result, overall load factor dropped
2.5 percentage points to 67.9 per cent and passenger seat factor
was 3.0 percentage points lower at 71 per cent while cargo load
factor fell 1.8 percentage points to 66.4 per cent.
</P>
<P>
According to SIA, as the company's average staff strength
increased by 445 (3.3 per cent ) to 13810, the company's staff
productivity, measured by the average changes in capacity
produced, load carried, revenue earned and value added per
employee, dropped by 3.5 per cent.
</P>
<P>
As at September 30, 1998, SIA's fleet comprised 91 aircraft --
37 B747-400s, 4 B747-300s, 2 B747-300 Combis, 14 A340-300s, 6
B777-200s, 4 B777-200s, 17 A310-300s and 7 B747-400 freighters.
</P>
<P>
SIA also said it has concluded an agreement to sell two B747-300
Combis and two B-747-300 passenger aircraft in the next financial
year.
</P>
<P>
SIA attributed the decline in its profits to adverse affects by
the economic downturn in Asia. "Under the circumstances the
decline in profits is not unexpected, and it could have been
worse," SIA Deputy Chairman and CEO Cheong Choong Kong was quoted
as saying.

<HEADLINE> Africa Joins Efforts in Tackling Climate Change </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 23 (Xinhua) -- African countries decided
Friday to enhance joint efforts and inter-governmental
cooperation to tackle climate change.
</P>
<P>
A resolution to this effect was agreed upon here by
environmental ministers and experts who ended a two-day meeting
in the Kenyan capital Friday.
</P>
<P>
They also agreed that there is need to intergrate the
international environmental agreements into the governmental
activities, putting priority to a mechanism mainly focusing on
ozone emission and involved in almost all African states.
</P>
<P>
The African Ministerial Conference on Environment (AMCEN) was
attended by at least 15 African environmental ministers and
dozens of delegates across the continent at the headquarters of
the U.N. Environment Program (UNEP) here.
</P>
<P>
Africa is projected to warm more than most regions of the
world, and many parts of Africa might experience a decrease in
precipitation, Robert Watson, chief of the Inter-Governmental
Panel on Climate Change, told the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The changes in climate are expected to result in the arid and
semi-arid areas of Africa becoming even drier, a decrease in
agricultural productivity, and an increase in the incidence of
vector-borne diseases, particularly malaria and dengue fever, he
said.
</P>
<P>
It will also cause the disruption of natural ecological
systems and the displacement of peoples living in low-lying
coastal regions, he warned.
</P>
<P>
Watson urged the African states to work out strategies that
could make them less vulnerable to both natural climate
variability and long-term human-induced climate changes in
agriculture, forestry, water, health, natural resource management
and other areas.
</P>
<P>
The continent also faces challenges to identify energy supply
and energy demand projects that are eligible for the Clean
Development Mechanism (CDM) -- a key role in their attempts to
gain sustainable development goals, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The CDM, highlighted by the ministers at this meeting, aims to
help African states win socio-economic development through
technical and financial transfers and assistance without
endangering the climate and the environment.
</P>
<P>
"The CDM may provide ample opportunities for early and
substantial (ozone) emission reductions which can involve all
parties, irrespective of their regional or economic affiliations,
in collaborative, cost-effective emission reduction and climate
control," said UNEP chief Klaus Toepfer at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Ghanaian Minister of Environment, Science and Technology J.E.
Afful stressed that the CDM "should provide enough flexibility to
ensure that the different objectives of the developed and
developing world to meet."
</P>
<P>
"For Africa, the mechanism must be appropriately designed and
implemented with the support of all major stake-holders in order
to facilitate the continent's quest for sustainable development,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
A series of inter-governmental meetings over the ozone layer,
desertification and climate change will be held by African
countries later this year.

<HEADLINE> Violences Paralyze Oil Town in S. Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Violent clashes between two
ethnic groups has paralyzed the oil town of Warri in south
Nigeria's Delta State, leading to torched houses and unknown
casualties.
</P>
<P>
Media reports Friday said the trouble started in the early
morning of Thursday when a village of the Itsekri ethnic group
called Orugbo near Warri was torched by opponent Ijaw youths.
</P>
<P>
About 100 workers of the Shell oil company, Texaco and
Westminster Dredging traveling in four staff buses were taken
hostage in the early morning at Ekurode, an Itsekiri area in the
city.
</P>
<P>
The workers were later released, but without their buses.
</P>
<P>
By Thursday noon, the trouble had spread to the downtown area,
with some major houses set on fire.
</P>
<P>
Youths of the two clashing groups reportedly occupied two
separate buildings of the port authority and exchanged gun fires.
</P>
<P>
The violences set the whole city into panic, with people
fleeing from markets and all shops and offices closed.
</P>
<P>
The government later drafted soldiers to the troubled spots to
maintain order. Several streets were reportedly closed to
traffic and the soldiers kept shooting into the sky.
</P>
<P>
By early evening, the situation had calmed down, as residents
began to move freely, but most of the shops remained closed,
reports said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Military Exchanges Embrace "Peak Week" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Following the first Swiss
defense minister's visit to China and a Chinese People's
Liberation Army (PLA) delegation's visit to South America led by
PLA Chief of General Staff General Fu Quanyou last week, this week
continued to witness the visits of defense ministers from Zambia,
Armenia and Russia, plus the second Sino-US defensive
consultations.
</P>
<P>
To sum it up, China has embraced a virtual "peak week" in
military exchanges.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here commented that it's rare throughout the history
of China's military exchanges for so many defense ministers to
visit China within a single week. And the holding of the second
Sino-US defensive consultations and the visit by Russian defense
minister have endowed the week with special meaning, making
the seven days extraordinarily eye-catching in the year.
</P>
<P>
Chinese strategist argued that the consultations, the third of
its kind to implement the agreement reached between Chinese and US
leaders during Chinese President Jiang Zemin's visit to the US
last Autumn, speaks for the normalization of the exchange
mechanism between the two armies, as well as the initial
establishment of mutual understanding and mutual trust.
</P>
<P>
Both sides exchanged views regarding such regional security
issues as that in the Korean Peninsula, and mapped out a rough
outline for next year's high-level exchange of visits,
cooperation in all levels and attendance in multi-lateral security
forums.
</P>
<P>
The US Under-Secretary of Defense Slocombe declared that the US
has decided to make forceful endeavors to promote the development
of Sino-US constructive strategic partnership oriented toward the
21st century.
</P>
<P>
Two days later, Russian Defense Minister Sergeyev in his first
trip to China emphasized his hope to "further accelerate the
comprehensive development of Sino-Russian strategic cooperative
partnership oriented toward the 21st century."
</P>
<P>
During a two hours' talk between Chinese and Russian defense
ministers, both discussed about the security issues in mid-Asia
and in Kosovo, with conclusion reached that both held the same or
similar views toward international affairs.
</P>
<P>
What is attracting the greatest attention from the press
community is that both countries focused discussions on certain
countries' intention of developing a theatre missile defensive
system, and ended up with the agreement that "such intention might
provoke a new arms race and threaten global peace and stability."
</P>
<P>
Analysts here pointed out that China's military exchanges with
the US and Russia are "parallel, non-interfering and not directed
at the third country", that they are not only non-contradictory,
but could on the other hand "motivate each other". Analysts
summarized that China's military ties with both these two powers
are of "positive importance" toward maintaining regional and even
world peace and stability at large.
</P>
<P>
China's military exchanges with neighboring countries are also
very busy during this week. A Vietnamese military strategic
institute delegation visited China, which coincided with
Vietnamese prime minister's China trip, and PLA sent out a
delegation Friday afternoon to visit Pakistan and Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
Both are considered concrete steps to implement China's key
policy on consolidating military relations with neighbors with a
view of seeking stability in border areas and neighboring
regions.
</P>
<P>
Officials of relevant departments explained that the reason why
China's military exchanges have been so busy is because of time
arrangement. However, those exchange activities have to some
extent exhibited the characteristic of "comprehensive development"
in China's military exchanges with other countries.

<HEADLINE> Trade Unions Help State-owned Enterprises Out of Difficulties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Chinese trade unions of
state-owned enterprises are making efforts to encourage workers to
help their enterprises out of difficulties, according to deputies
of the 13th National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions.
</P>
<P>
Fang Weijie, trade union chairman of the China No.1 Automobile
Group Corporation said, "We are always concerned about not only
workers' legal rights, but also the future of the enterprises,
because workers' interests can't be protected unless the
enterprise has good profits and benefits."
</P>
<P>
According to Fang, his trade union has offered workers many
opportunities to receive professional training, which not only
enables them to contribute more for the enterprises, but also
makes them more competitive in case they are laid off.
</P>
<P>
Fang said that his corporation is the largest in the country's
auto sector, due to heated competition and some other factors, it
has had to reduce staff in order to maintain development.
</P>
<P>
He said the corporation is reducing the number of workers by
about 5,000 a year. Some of them have been reemployed in the
group's service businesses and many other skilled laid-off workers
have been welcomed by other companies.
</P>
<P>
"At this point, enhancing the workers' quality is also a way to
protect their long-term interests," he said.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that the central government plans to help most
state-owned enterprises out of difficulty within three years, and
trade unions will play a more important role in stirring the
workers' initiative and helping laid-off workers reemployed.
</P>
<P>
Wen Baoman, trade union chairman of Anshan Iron and Steel
Co. Ltd. which is an industrial giant in northeast China's
Liaoning Province, said that the corporation has 170,000 workers
at present, but it aims to reduce that number to 50,000.
</P>
<P>
So far, he said, 20,000 workers have been reemployed by service
businesses set up by the trade union, which is expecting to hire a
total of 50,000 laid-off workers from the corporation.

<P>
WASHINGTON, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Israel and the Palestinian
Authority reached early Friday a breakthrough agreement on
land-for-peace after nine days of intense bargainings, marking an
important milestone in the Mideast history, the White House
confirmed.
</P>
<P>
"An agreement has been reached between the two parties. The
President(Bill Clinton) will announce that agreement upon his
return to the White House this morning. He expects all parties to
join the President at the White House later today," White House
Spokesman Joe Lockhard said.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached after 21 hours of face-to-face talks
between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat with presence of President Clinton. The
president left the Wye River Conference Center, Maryland, for the
White House as the first glow of dawn rose above the Chesapeake
Bay marshes.
</P>
<P>
Clinton was expected to announce the agreement at the White
House and a signing ceremony would follow around Friday noon.
</P>
<P>
Among the critical issues resolved in the early hours of Friday
were the release of Palestinian prisoners from Israeli jails, the
convocation of the Palestine National Council to revoke its
anti-Israeli charter provisions and a package of security measures.
</P>
<P>
An Israeli negotiator told the press that "unprecedented
achievement has been reached relating to fulfillment of Palestinian
responsibilities" and talks on "final status" issues including
refugees, borders, the status of Jerusalem will begin soon.
</P>
<P>
Israel in return agreed to withdraw troops from 13.1 percent of
the West Bank and let the Palestinians control 40 percent of the
territories.
</P>
<P>
Clinton spent about 78 hours over seven days at the secluded
Conference Center to press both sides to make "the hardest

<HEADLINE> Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region's Anniversary Hailed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 23 (Xinhua) -- People's Daily, China's leading
newspaper, hails the 40th founding anniversary of the Ningxia Hui
Autonomous Region in its Saturday editorial entitled "Unite and
Work Hard to Create New Glory."
</P>
<P>
The northwest China's autonomous region has experienced
tremendous changes since it was founded on October 25 1958,
especially since the country initiated the reform and opening
drive in the late 70s, the editorial says.
</P>
<P>
Over the past four decades, the relationship of equality,
solidarity and mutual assistance among different ethnic groups in
Ningxia has been consolidated and developed, while the people of
these groups have further realized their right to be their
own master, the paper says.
</P>
<P>
The autonomous region has achieved overall progress in both
economic and cultural areas, the paper says, noting that "vitality
and prosperity can be seen everywhere in today's Ningxia."
</P>
<P>
Hui people, a Muslim ethnic group mainly living in Ningxia, has
a glorious tradition and has made great contributions to the
country's revolution and construction, together with the Han
people, the majority in China, and other minority groups,
according to the editorial.
</P>
<P>
To push forward the current reform and opening drive in the
autonomous region, closer cooperation among various ethnic groups
as well as a stable and united political situation are needed, the
paper says.
</P>
<P>
Compared with other parts of the country, Ningxia has a
relatively weaker economic foundation, therefore it must
concentrate on accelerating the economic drive in
order to speed up development, the editorial says.
</P>
<P>
The People's Daily urges local officials at all levels in
Ningxia to develop a sense of urgency and mission in a bid to
correctly understand the local situation and further bring
Ningxia's advantages into play.

<P>
BEIJING, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Nina Karpachova, Ukrainian
National Ombudsman on Human Rights, today told a news conference
that it is imperative to promote exchanges on human
rights because different national backgrounds and values cause
different views on human rights.
</P>
<P>
Karpachova is here for a two-day international symposium on
world human rights, which closed in Beijing on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
She said that the visit enabled her to see the enormous efforts
China has made to safeguard human rights. "Obviously, reports by
Western media on China's human rights conditions are biased," she
added.
</P>
<P>
This year marks the 50th anniversary of the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights, said Karpachova, and the symposium
opened "a good channel of dialogue" for the West and the East to
discuss the human rights issue.
</P>
<P>
She said that she held discussions with people in China's legal
and women's sectors and visited prisons, and that during Ukrainian
Foreign Minister Boris Tarasyuk's impending visit to China the two
countries could reach agreement on prisoner extradition.

SINGAPORE, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Singapore and South Africa

<HEADLINE> Pak FM Calls for Reliable Global Financial Mechanism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Foreign Minister Sartaj Aziz
Friday called for a reliable international financial mechanism,
saying the vision of universal prosperity through globalization
will remain a dream unless urgent remedial measures are taken.
</P>
<P>
"We need to develop a reliable international financial
mechanism, reduce the gap between the rich and the poor, ensure
equitable flow of resources for poverty alleviation programmes,
and substantially increase external aid for social and human
development," he said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the flag raising ceremony on the United Nations
Day, Sartaj believed that "unless urgent remedial measures are
taken, the vision of universal prosperity through globalization
would remain a dream, which could easily turn into a nightmare
especially for the underdeveloped and less privileged."
</P>
<P>
Reducing poverty and redressing iniquities, he stressed, must
remain "our principal goals" as we prepare to enter the next
century.
</P>
<P>
"As we survey the global socio-economic horizon, we cannot but
be struck with the enormity of the challenges that we confront.
</P>
<P>
"Extreme poverty, hunger, and human suffering, which have
haunted the collective human conscience for many centuries, still
remain pervasive," the foreign minister said.
</P>
<P>
Aziz emphasized that just as the right to life, property,
speech, and freedom are fundamental human rights, the right to
food, development, and employment, are equally important rights,
which "we must seek to promote and protect."
</P>
<P>
The world economy, he said, stands at an important crossroad.
"There are tremendous opportunities for economic development being
offered by globalization, liberalization, and enhanced
inter-dependence.
</P>
<P>
"Yet, these opportunities conceal risks and problems as is
being witnessed in East Asia," he added.
</P>
<P>
The globalization, he said, led to enormous growth, but at the
same time "it sharpened inequalities in the global economy."

<HEADLINE> KLA Leader Says Tanjug Journalists Safe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRISTINA, Yugoslavia, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Two Serb
journalists who reportedly disappeared last Sunday were in the
hands of the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) and will be released
soon, a KLA leader said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Adem Demachi, the political representative of the KLA, told
Xinhua in Pristina that the two missing journalists working for
the Yugoslav Tanjug news agency, Nebojsa Radosevic and Vladimir
Dobricic, were detained by the KLA near the town of Magura, some
20 kilometers southwest of the province's capital Pristina.
</P>
<P>
"They are safe, in good condition and well treated," said
the representative of the KLA, an outlawed guerrilla group
that fights for Kosovo's independence.
</P>
<P>
He added that they were under investigation since they lied
about their identities when detained for questioning. Steps are
being taken to gain the release of the two journalists if and when
they are exonerated from all charges.
</P>
<P>
Demachi, who earlier rejected any deal with the Serbian
government, said that the KLA was now close to the position
of the League of Democracy of Kosovo (LDK) in talks with the
Yugoslav authority.
</P>
<P>
Fehmi Agani, LDK's chief negotiator, has agreed that Kosovo
could stay in Yugoslavia for a transitional period of three years
and then a self-determination could be granted to the people of
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"We are not far from accepting Agani's proposals on the
future of Kosovo and an agreement could be signed with a
three-year transitional period in Yugoslavia," Demachi
said.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Commemorating Late Marshal Peng Dehuai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President and General
Secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee
Jiang Zemin today praised late Marshal Peng Dehuai as an older
generation revolutionary, statesman and military strategist as
well as an outstanding leader of the Party, the State and the army.
</P>
<P>
Peng dedicated his life to the Chinese people's
liberation and socialism and performed great historic
merit, he said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang made these remarks at a forum to mark the centennial of
Peng Dehuai's birth, held by the Central Military Commission, of
which Jiang is also the chairman.
</P>
<P>
Peng, born in central China's Hunan Province on Oct. 24, 1898,
joined the Party in 1928. He was one of the top military
leaders of the CPC-led revolutionary armed forces.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the forum, Jiang spoke highly of Peng's
adherance to the truth and great contributions to the Party and the
people.
</P>
<P>
According to Jiang, the late marshal played a great role in the
fight against the Kuomintang troops in the 1930s and the 1940s,
and from 1951 to 1953, he served as the commander-in-chief of the
Chinese People's Volunteers, and in 1955 was granted the rank of
marshal.
</P>
<P>
In the 1950s, Peng was in charge of the routine work of the
Central Military Commission.
</P>
<P>
The late marshal was wrongly criticised in 1959 and prosecuted
by Lin Biao and the "Gang of Four" during the Cultural Revolution
(1966-76) and passed away in 1974.
</P>
<P>
Jiang cited Peng as a brilliant model, saying: "we should learn
from him his boundless loyalty to the Party and the people .. as
well as his unshakable and firm belief in the the Communist
cause."

<HEADLINE> China to Crack Down On Vehicle-related Crimes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 23 (Xinhua) -- China will launch a nationwide
four-month campaign to crack down on the crimes of smuggling,
burglary and robbery involving motor vehicles, said a senior
official with the Ministry of Public Security (MPS) here today.
</P>
<P>
Bai Jingfu, MPS deputy minister, said during a telephone
conference that such crimes have become very severe in recent
years. Statistics show that more than 100,000 automobiles were
smuggled into China in 1997, and about 120,000 vehicles were
burglarized or stolen in the same period.
</P>
<P>
"Because these crimes usually feature stealing in one place and
disposing in another place," Bai said," a nationwide campaign is
necessary, with joint effort and cooperation among local public
security forces across the country."
</P>
<P>
Through this campaign, from now until next February, all of
society will become aware that buying smuggled or stolen vehicles
is illegal.
</P>
<P>
A ministry data base has collected 420,000 items of information
on all burglarized and stolen vehicle cases over the past five
years.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the ministry has set up a computer system
linking public security bureaus and stations nationwide for
exchanges of information and consultation.

</P>

The New York Times:
</P>
<P>

East peace talks in Maryland of the United States, as U.S.
President Bill Clinton pushed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu and the Palestinian leader Yasir Arafat to close a deal.
</P>
<P>
-- The FCC issued proposed rules intended to settle a dispute
over high-tech wiretapping between the FBI and the
telecommunications industry and privacy advocates.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- In a confrontational end to the first week of the

Communications Corp. of having "invented or imagined" its
allegation that Microsoft proposed illegal collusion to divide the
market for Internet "browsing" software.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 23 (Xinhua) -- A senior Hong Kong official
reaffirmed Friday the government's determination to implement the
Enhanced Productivity Program (EPP) announced recently by Chief
Executive Tung Chee Hua in the policy address.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the 25th anniversary of the Hong Kong Branch of the
Association of International Accountants, Denise Yue, secretary
for the Treasury, described the EPP as a determined and structured
government effort to provide more and better public services from
within the level of expenditure affordable to the Hong Kong
community.
</P>
<P>
She said: "We must provide the community with improved value
for money from our available resources; we must direct those
resources to achieving the best possible results; we must satisfy
ourselves that we still need to do all the things we are now
doing; and we must examine critically the way in which public
services are delivered."
</P>
<P>
Yue noted that Hong Kong is going through a period of severe
economic adjustment.
</P>
<P>
Although the accumulated reserves of 450 billion HK dollars
(57.69 billion U.S. dollars) gave Hong Kong the financial strength
 to tide over present difficulties, the government must find the
resources to continue to invest in the future, and to provide the
modern infrastructure in support of Hong Kong's role as a major
economic player on the world stage, she said.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Government Will Not Fix Rupiah: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 23 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government has
no plan to hold down the rupiah at the 7,000 level against the
U.S. dollar as its exchange rate should be determined by the
market, Antara News Agency Friday quoted a minister as saying.
</P>
<P>
"I never stated that the rupiah's exchange rate against the
dollar should not go beyond the 7,000 level. I just said that at
the 7,000 level, private corporate debtors would be able to settle
their debts by taking into account the export sector and the
regional currencies," Coordinating Minister for Economy, Finance
and Industry Ginandjar Kartasasmita said.
</P>
<P>
The minister admitted that he might have said that the rupiah's
exchange rate against the U.S. dollar at about 7,000 to 8,000 was
good.
</P>
<P>
However, this does not mean that the U.S. dollar could not go
beyond that level.
</P>
<P>
"This is a natural correction as other regional currencies are
not as strong as ours," he said, noting that there are indications
that the crisis-hit economy is beginning to recover.
</P>
<P>
Ginandjar said that to get the real economy moving, it is
important to make sure the rupiah continues to stabilize, resolve
debt problems in a way that would allow the corporate sector to
regain access to funds, and restructure the banking industry.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Bank Indonesia Director Miranda S. Goeltom also said
the government will not issue a policy to stop the strengthening
of the rupiah.
</P>
<P>
"We don't have any intention of pegging the rupiah at that
level (7,000), or of stopping it from getting stronger than
7,000," she said.
</P>
<P>
According to Goeltom, an exchange rate at the 7,000 level
against the U.S. dollar is very attractive to private corporate
debtors who could begin settling their foreign debts.
</P>
<P>
"However, we should also take into account the competitiveness
of Indonesia's export commodities and other regional currencies
that have not appreciated (as much as the rupiah has)," she added.
</P>
<P>
Indonesian rupiah has been advancing significantly during the
past couple of weeks, closing at 7,700/7,900 to the U.S. dollar on
the Jakarta inter-bank spot market Friday. The currency was
hovering at a range between 10,000 and 11,000 rupiah last month.
</P>
<P>
The rise of the rupiah in the past few days may be attributed
to declining pressure from U.S. dollar demand, Goeltom said,
adding that the U.S. dollar supply is also increasing.
</P>
<P>
"I disagree with people who say the strengthening of the rupiah
is temporary," she said.
</P>
<P>
Goeltom said offshore markets, particularly Singapore, expects
the rupiah to continue strengthening as exporters begin converting
their U.S. dollars into rupiahs.
</P>
<P>
"It is not true if people say Bank Indonesia has intervened (in
the foreign exchange market)," she said.
</P>
<P>
There is also room for the rupiah to go to about 6,500 so long
as there are no external shocks, she added.

In an apparent attempt to persuade people to vote despite that
some prominent moderate candidates were disqualified even before
the race began, Khatami said "There are more competent and
eligible people than these, however, choices are there and there
is relative diversity."
</P>
<P>
"The people and the youth in particular must select their
candidates carefully," he said.
</P>
<P>
A total of 167 candidates were running for the 86 seats in the
Assembly of Experts, believed to be a bastion of conservatives.
</P>
<P>
The assembly, with a term of eight years each, under
constitution has the power to determine and supervise the supreme
leader.
</P>
<P>
The polling started at 8:00 a.m. (0430 GMT) and will last until
4:00 p.m. (1230 GMT). According to election regulations, the
deadline would be extended if necessary.
</P>
<P>
Despite the government encouragement for people to turn out
massively to vote, people in Tehran, particularly those in the
wealthy northern part of the city, failed to show due enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
An election inspector, who asked not to be named, told Xinhua
that "we can not expect an enthusiastic turnout today as in the
presidential election."
</P>
<P>
Nearly 90 percent of eligible voters cast their ballots in May
last year, which brought about a landslide victory for Khatami, a
moderate cleric, over his hardline rival.
</P>
<P>
However, the inspector explained that so far the turnout,
predicted as low as 40 percent, was much better than the previous
two elections of the assembly, which was formed in 1983 under the
order of late spiritual leader Ayatollah Musavi Khomeini.
</P>
<P>
Like Khomeini, father of the 1979 Islamic Revolution which
topple the late shah's regime, the current supreme leader,
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has the final say in virtually everything
in the country.
</P>
<P>
The election of the assembly is seen as a battle between the
entrenched hardliners, who dominated almost all but the
administrative power, and the moderates, represented by the
president.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that many people were reluctant to turn up at
polling stations because some prominent moderate candidates were
eliminated by the conservative Council of Guardians, which
screened the qualification of applicants.
</P>
<P>
The council was accused of taking side while carrying out its
duty, after it rejected some of the prominent candidates of the
left-wing and moderate factions.

BEIJING, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Vice-Chairman of China's
Central Military Commission (CMC) General Zhang Wannian met today
with visiting Russian Defense Minister Marshall Igor Dmitriyevich
Sergeyev.
</P>

<P>
WASHINGTON, October (Xinhua)-- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat early Friday
reached a breakthrough agreement on land-for-peace after nine days
of intense negotiations, the White House confirmed.
</P>
<P>
White House Spokesman Joe Lockhard said that the agreement was
reached between the two parties after a 21-hour talks Friday
mediated by President Bill Clinton. The president left the Wye
River Conference Center, Maryland, for the White House as the
first glow of dawn rose above the Chesapeake Bay marshes.
</P>
<P>
Clinton was expected to announce the agreement at the White
House, where the Israelis and Palestinians will join him, Lockhart
said.
</P>
<P>
The president spent about 78 hours over seven days at the
secluded Conference Center to press both sides to make "the
hardest decisions." Jordanian King Hussein traveled twice to the
conference site to help.
</P>
<P>
"I hope the parties will seize this opportunity and not retreat
from the clear moment to capture the momentum of peace and keep it
moving forward," Clinton said on his way to the rural Maryland
talks on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
A signing ceremony is expected to be held at the White House
Friday noon, marking the end of another marathon Mideast talks in
history.
</P>

peace deal between Israel and Egypt.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Zemin Meets South African National Assembly Speaker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Sino-South African relations,
based on mutual trust, will become even closer, Chinese President
Jiang Zemin said today.
</P>
<P>
Jiang made this remark in a meeting this afternoon with
visiting South African National Assembly Speaker Frene Ginwala.
</P>
<P>
Describing Ginwala as an old friend of China who took part in
the Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing in 1995, Jiang
said the Speaker has made positive contributions to the
establishment of diplomatic ties at the beginning of this year.
</P>
<P>
As Ginwala is the first prominent leader of the National
Assembly to visit China this year, he continued to say that her
ongoing China trip will serve to further relations between the
Chinese National People's Congress and the South African Assembly,
thus promoting the overall development of friendly cooperative
ties between the two nations.
</P>
<P>
Jiang noted that the Chinese and South African people cherish a
deep friendship and, since the two nations forged diplomatic ties,
bilateral relations are proceeding on a rapid and smooth track and
contacts in various fields are continuing to increase.
</P>
<P>
"Our two developing nations share extensive common interests
and prospects for development," he said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang asked Ginwala to convey his best regards to President
Nelson Mandela when she returns home, and welcomed the president
to visit China at a convenient time next year.
</P>
<P>
Jiang also briefed the guest on China's efforts fighting this
year's heavy summer floods.
</P>
<P>
Ginwala said she is glad to visit China again as an old
friend. In recent decades, the Chinese people have rendered great
support to the South African people in their struggle for racial
equality and the fight against apartheid.
</P>
<P>
This has laid a sound basis for friendly cooperative relations
between the two countries, she said.
</P>
<P>
Since the two countries forged diplomatic ties, she
said, friendly contacts between the two governments, parliaments
and peoples are on rise, and bilateral relations have entered a
new phase.
</P>
<P>
China and South Africa can be good partners, she assured.
</P>
<P>
Ginwala also expressed her sympathy for the heavy losses caused
by the recent flooding in China, saying she appreciated the brave
spirit of the Chinese people and soldiers in their fight against
the flooding.

<HEADLINE> Injured Boy May Receive Huge Injury Compensation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, October 23 (Xinhua) -- An eight-year-old boy who was
disabled in a trolley-bus accident three years ago in Chongqing
Municipality in southwest China is likely to get a compensation
of over 2.028 million yuan (about 250,000 U.S. dollars), the
largest sum ever paid to an injured individual in the
country.
</P>
<P>
The court of the first instance of the Chongqing Intermediate
People's Court announced a ruling today that the Chongqing
Trolley-Bus Company, the Chongqing Yuzhong District Power Supply
Bureau and the Chongqing Municipal Bureau of Power Industry pay
Liao Keli 2.028 million yuan in compensation, including 343,100
yuan (about 43,000 U.S. dollars) for the distress he has suffered
from the accident.
</P>
<P>
One afternoon in September 1995, the boy and his father Liao
Junguang took trolley No.405 on their way home. All of a
sudden, the travelling arms connecting the trolley to power line
ran lose and fell onto the high-voltage cable of a transformer on
the roadside.
</P>
<P>
At a loss, the driver opened the doors of the trolley, the
wrong thing to do in such cases. When Liao Junguang took his son
and they rushed to get out, they both were shrouded by dazzling
flashes and seriously electrified.
</P>
<P>
During the following two and a half years, the boy underwent 13
operations on his head and stomach and lost his right arm. Worse
still, the usually likable boy became uncommunicative and tended
to shut himself indoors, even refusing to go to school.
</P>
<P>
Lu Lie, a lawyer who volunteers free legal aid to the family,
insisted that mental pain can bring more damage to an injured
person than physical injuries and that is why he asked for the
huge sum for the boy's distress, to "protect his personal
dignity.".
</P>
<P>
"The disaster leaves permanent scars on our family life, even
huge compensation will not bring my son back to me unaffected,"
said Wang Yuanqian, the boy's mother.
</P>
<P>
It is not clear whether or not the three defendant parties will
accept the ruling or lodge an appeal.

SINGAPORE, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Share prices closed
marginally lower on Singapore Stock Market Friday as the benchmark
Straits Times Index (STI) shed off 3.91 points to end at 1113.59
points.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said share prices once plunged to an intraday low of
1081.6 as heavy profit-taking in the wake of the recent rally

circulating in the afternoon.

Selective buying in blue chip stocks helped to narrow the
losses.
</P>
<P>
The total turnover declined to 289.61 million units worth
423.78 million Singapore dollars (261.59 million U.S. dollars).
Losers edged out gainers by 176 to 63 with 183 counters
unchanged..

The larger block was a 42.16 million units parcel of Ultro
which topped the active chart. SembCorp was the second most
heavily traded stock on the exchange with a turnover of 15.82
million units. KepLand was next with 13.20 million counters
changing hands.
</P>
<P>
Delifrance led the ascent of the day as it rose by 55 cents to

BEIJING, October 23 (Xinhua) -- The China Environmental
Monitoring Center today released its weekly air quality report for
major Chinese cities.
</P>
<P>
Beijing, Xi'an and Urumqi reported moderate air pollution for
October 16-22. The major problems there were nitrogen oxide and
suspended particles. The report says that cities in northwest
China entered the annual season for heating by coal burning
last week, which caused an increased amount of air pollutants. During
the period, little rain fall and clouds in these cities were
not good for dispersing pollutants.
</P>
<P>
Changsha, Zhengzhou, Hohhot, Wuhan, Tianjin, Shenyang and six
other cities recorded slight air pollution. The major problems
there were sulfur dioxide and suspended particles.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai, Shijiazhuang, Hangzhou, Changchun, Harbin, Guangzhou,

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh, India to Hold Border Coordination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh and India will hold a
director general-level border coordination conference next Monday,
The Independent daily newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh will formally raise the issue of migration of Indian
tribesmen into the hill regions of Bangladesh following the
Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT) Peace Agreement during the 3-day
meeting to be held in Dhaka between the Bangladesh Rifles (BR) and
the Indian Border Security Forces (BSF), an official source was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the home, foreign, water resources and land
ministries from both sides will also participate in the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Director General of the BR Major General Azizur Rahman and
Director General of the BSF Sree EN Rammohan will lead the
delegations on behalf of their respective countries, the official
source said.
</P>
<P>
The 15-point agenda of the meeting includes demarcation of
undemarcated areas, repairing and maintenance of border pillars,
trafficking of women and children, smuggling of arms and
security-related issues.
</P>
<P>
After the CHT peace accord signed in December last year, more
than 20,000 Chakma tribesmen from India have crossed the border
into Bangladesh along with the Bangladeshi refugees, the official
source stated.
</P>
<P>
The Bangladeshi government officially protested the influx of
Indian Chakmas but there was no discussion on the issue as the
Indian side did not agree to discuss the matter, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The whole gamut of bilateral border-related issues would be
discussed during the meeting, he added.

<HEADLINE> California Wildfires Continue To Blaze </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Three wildfires, which
started last weekend and scorched more than 15,000 acres of brush
and trees in California, continued to blaze Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The first fire in Fillmore, Ventura County about 70 miles north
of Los Angeles, has consumed 11,300 acres. Latest reports said
nearly 90 percent of the fire had been contained by more than
1,400 fire fighters, who expected to totally contain it by Friday
evening.
</P>
<P>
The second fire in dense brush in remote Los Padres National
Forest, some 120 miles northwest of Los Angeles, has also consumed
4,000 acres of brush and trees.
</P>
<P>
Local officials said that 1,300 firefighters, supported by
water-dropping aircraft, had just contained some 55 percent of the
fire during the past 5 days and could brought it to an end by
Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
The third wildfire, of which 80 percent is under control, has
already burned 1,000 acres in Sierra National Forest in northern
California. Forest Service spokeswoman Sue Exline said it was
expected to be surrounded during Thursday, because it was burning
towards the rugged Kings River Canyon, one of deepest canyons in
North America.
</P>
<P>
Experts said the weather is so far cooperating with efforts to
get three California wildfires under control, with calming winds
and moist air helping firefighters gain the upper hand against the
blazes.
</P>
<P>
Analysts estimate the cost of fighting the blazes was more than
four million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
October traditionally sees the start of the California fire
season as hot winds known as Santa Anas blow in from the desert.
</P>
<P>
But officials fear that this year's fire season might be worse
than usual because storms spurred by the El Nino weather
phenomenon that soaked the area earlier this year have spurred
lush growth of thick underbrush.

<HEADLINE> Boeing Reports Profit in Third Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Boeing Co., the world's
biggest aircraft maker, Thursday reported a remarkable profit in
the third quarter, despite lingering production troubles and the
Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
News release from the company said net profit of the quarter
was 347 million U.S. dollars, compared with a loss of 696 million
dollars a year earlier when it spent about one billion
U.S. dollars after taxes on production problems.
</P>
<P>
Revenues also rose 12 percent to 12.72 billion U.S. dollars
from 11.37 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Executives and industry analysts said the results announced by
the company were better than Wall Street expected, and reflected
the company's continuing recovery from the production problems,
which have cost the company about three billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
"We have made good progress, but we still have a long way to
go," Boeing chairman Phil Condit told analysts in a conference
hall.
</P>
<P>
During the quarter, Boeing delivered 123 commercial jets, up
from 89 a year ago. So far this year, Boeing has delivered 368
planes, and says it still expects to deliver 550 by the end of
this year.
</P>
<P>
Boeing is forecasting 56 billion U.S. dollars in revenue and
just over one billion in net earnings for 1998, Condit said,
adding that revenues should be about the same in 1999, but profits
should be about 2 billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> Zambia's Inter-Party Dialog Chairmanship to Be in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's opposition parties
will discuss the issue of chairmanship of the inter-party meeting
according to Times of Zambia.
</P>
<P>
The local newspaper Friday quoted acting chairman of the
National Patriotic Alliance (NPA), Chibeza Mfuni, as saying that
presidents of the 10 parties of the umbrella group will not take
a radical stand on the issue but leave it for discussion when
they meet in camera.
</P>
<P>
He said that the impression is that the opposition has taken
an adamant stance on the issue of the chairmanship.
</P>
<P>
But former president, leader of The opposition United National
Independence Party (UNIP), Kenneth Kaunda was quoted as saying
that the ruling Movement for Multi-party Democracy (MMD) should
allow a neutral person such as the chief justice or the church to
chair the talks in the interest of democracy.
</P>
<P>
Kaunda, whose party is also a member of the NPA, said that
President Frederick Chiluba should emulate the example set in
1991 when the church was given the chance of chairing the talks
between the ruling UNIP and oppositions at the that time.
</P>
<P>
Kaunda also said that the country's multi-party system will
only work with a strong opposition.
</P>
<P>
An agenda for the presidents meeting was mapped out at a
meeting held here Wednesday attended by party secretaries but
chairmanship of the meeting has not been decided because of
disagreement.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria's Fire Disaster Area Residents Relocated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Residents of Jesse town and
environs are now relocating to escape an impending outbreak of
epidemic in the Saturday pipeline fire disaster area, New
Nigerian reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Lilian Mujakpero, Chairman of Sapele Division of the Nigeria
Red Cross Society, said that the presence of decomposing bodies
in river Ethiope and adjoining bushes could lead to an outbreak
of epidemic disease.
</P>
<P>
Following a pipeline fire tragedy resulting in a death toll of
more than 700, about 150 bodies were recovered between Wednesday
and Thursday in a mopping-up operation in the disaster area.
</P>
<P>
Mujakpero was quoted as saying that they decided to revert to
cremation of the recovered bodies in view of the intense heat
from the burning burst pipe.
</P>
<P>
As the mop-up operation is going on in the disaster area,
another Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation pipeline at
Iguosagie, Edo State, has been vandalized, resulting in
widespread leakage of petroleum products, according to a Daily
Times report Friday.
</P>
<P>
It was learned that security personnel had already been sent
to the village to stop further illegal exploitation of the
spilled products.
</P>
<P>
The State Administrator, Navy Commander Anthony Onyearugbulem,
who visited the area Thursday, expressed shock and displeasure at
the development, saying that the vandalization of the pipeline
valve pit, just like that of Jesse, was a coordinated sabotage
between skilled personnel and their collaborators.

<HEADLINE> Belarus to Get One Million Tons of Coal from Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Belarus will get one million
tons of coal from Russia's Kuznetsk Coal Fields as early as next
year, Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko said Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
Meeting with Kemerovo Region Governor Aman Tuleyev and other
leaders of the local enterprises, Lukashenko said that Belarus
viewed the one- million-ton mark as only the first step of
long-term cooperation between Belarus and the Siberian region of
Russia.
</P>
<P>
According to experts' estimation, the requirements of Belarus
for coal are at approximately 2.3 million tons a year.
</P>
<P>
Lukashenko told the local leaders that Belarus had managed
"practically to edge unscrupulous intermediaries out of the fuel
market." All this will enable his country to have cheaper raw-
material resources, he said.
</P>
<P>
Tuleyev held that the region should continue to strengthen
contacts with Belarus, for this is mutually beneficial.
</P>
<P>
Lukashenko is expected to address regional leaders and business
executives here and attend a signing ceremony of an agreement on
economic cooperation between the government of Belarus and Kuzbass.
</P>
<P>
The president arrived in Kemerovo Thursday night from Omsk,
where he met with Belarussian compatriots living there. He is due
to leave for Minsk on Friday night.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Unveils Deficit Budget for 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia Friday unveiled a
deficit Budget for 1998, the country's first deficit budget in
more than 10 years.
</P>
<P>
Presenting the 1999 budget in parliament here, Malaysian Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad proposed the 1999 budget expenditure
totaled 65.095 billion ringgit (about 17.13 billion U.S. dollars)
against estimated revenue at 47.16 billion ringgit (about 12.41
billion U.S. dollars) for 1999, leaving a gap of 17.935 billion
ringgit (about 4.719 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
This is the first budget presented by Mahathir himself who
became the first finance minister after his deputy and finance
minister Anwar Ibrahim was sacked early September.
</P>
<P>
Out of the total amount, which represents a reduction of 9.3
percent from 1998 allocation, a sum of 47.042 billion ringgit
(about 12.379 billion U.S. dollars) is for operating expenditure
and the rest 18.053 billion ringgit (about 4.75 billion U.S.
dollars) for development expenditure.
</P>
<P>
For the development expenditure, priority is given to projects
that can generate economic activity, enhance efficiency and
competitiveness as well as reduce the outflow of reserves.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said: "The Malaysian economy is still mired in the
regional financial crisis. It is expected to recover by the end of
1998. However, there still exists risks which could lead to
renewed volatility in regional financial markets, indeed the
global markets."
</P>
<P>
Based on the outlook on economic performance and risks that may
emerge in 1999 as well as the challenges that need to be
addressed, Mahathir said the 1999 budget strategy is aimed at
reviving economic activities and insulating the economy from the
contagion effects of the regional financial crisis to stabilize
the financial market and the value of the ringgit, strengthening
the resilience and competitiveness of the nation's economy,
restructuring the financial sector and improving governance in the
private and public sectors, strengthening further the balance of
payments, and ensuring social well being.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's economic prospects for 1999 will be determined by
the speed of implementation of economic recovery measures and the
nation's economic performance will also be dependent on
developments in the economies of its major trading partners and
overall growth of world trade, Mahathir said.
</P>
<P>
He said Malaysia projects to register growth of one percent in
1999 based on the assumption the domestic demand will improve in
line with fiscal and monetary measures that have been implemented
by the government.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia also expects the economies of its major trading
partners, in particular, East Asia, to recover and regional
financial markets to stabilize.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's economy is envisaged to contract by 4.8 percent in
1998.

<HEADLINE> Feature: A Hopeful Project for Poor in Southeast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Many residents in Mardin, a
place in Turkey's backward southeastern region bordering Syria,
found their income doubled in just two or three years, to a
relatively comfortable average of 200 U.S. dollars a month now.
</P>
<P>
This was because local farmers, 37,000 of them, have turned to
be salary employees at an industrial zone involving foreign
investments.
</P>
<P>
The Mardin Free Trade Zone is a major showcase of Turkey's
Southern Anatolia Project, known as GAP, designed to lift the
southern provinces from economic backwardness.
</P>
<P>
Launched in early 1980s, the ambitious GAP development project
covers an area of 74,000 square kilometers, about one-tenth of the
country's total territory, and a population of 5.27 million, or 9
percent of the nation's total.
</P>
<P>
The project was comprehensive and effective enough to have
brought a diversity of industries to the traditionally
agricultural regions, creating opportunities for farmers like
those in Mardin to improve their life.
</P>
<P>
Guiding a group of foreign reporters on a visit to GAP
projects, Yusuf Yildiz, director of Mardin Free Trade Zone was
excited when boasting the water projects. Pointing at the
magnificent Ataturk Dam in the distance, he said the dam and other
12 water projects, seven of them lie in the Euphrates river basin
and the remaining in the Tigris river basin, ensure irrigation of
1.7 million hectares of farmland and generate 23,000 Gwh of
electricity per year.
</P>
<P>
In the three-year-old Mardin trade zone, reporters saw
factories and workshops engaged in textile, construction
materials, detergents and light industry products.
</P>
<P>
President of the Karaboga Industrial Co. Ltd. Bedrettin
Karaboga poured out the story of how his company has developed
from a small transportation firm into one handling businesses
ranging from livestock fodder to tourism, thanks to the
opportunities provided by GAP.
</P>
<P>
So far, 12.6 billion U.S. dollars has been injected into GAP.
About 2.1 billion of it was in loans from the World Bank, U.S. and
European banks and European governments, earmarked for various
projects such as dams, power stations, plants, agriculture
research and health facilities.
</P>
<P>
Yildiz accounted the convenient transport network, no- or
low-tax principles and land rental rates as low as 2 U.S. dollars
per square meter as the lures for foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
Attracted by the preferential policies, foreign companies
including Korea's auto giants Hyundai and Daewoo, Israeli company
OZCOT, Italy's Lafel and some French and German companies have
recently decided to invest in the GAP region.
</P>
<P>
He was confident that more and more joint ventures and
foreign-funded companies will be established in the GAP region to
bring more benefit to the local people in the future.
</P>
<P>
"The central and local governments will pour more funds into
infrastructure construction to make GAP a more attractive place
for overseas investors," he said.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania's Sugar Import Duty Up by 24 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, October 23 (Xinhua) -- All sugar imports to
Tanzania will be charged with an 80 percent tax, an increase of
24 percent over the previous duty, beginning from October 21,
local media reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the Tanzania Revenue Authority were quoted as
saying that the new rate was inclusive of a 20 percent "suspended
duty" in an effort to protect the national sugar industry.
</P>
<P>
The new rate, which will run for a year and then be reviewed
by the government, was applied alongside a 390 U.S. Dollars per
ton minimum dutiable value imposed on all sugar imports, they
said.
</P>
<P>
In September, effective import duty on sugar was raised to 56
percent from 26 percent after local sugar manufacturers
complained that cheap sugar imports flooding the country were
strangling their production.
</P>
<P>
The new rate will apply to sugar already on the high seas and
in warehouses at the Dar es Salaam port.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania's sugar millers complain that cheap imports have
severely undermined their sales as a threat to further
privatization of the sugar sector.
</P>
<P>
Officials said that Tanzania expects to produce 118,750 tons
of sugar in the 1998/99 (July/March) milling season, a 47
percent increase on the 80,848 tons produced in the previous
season.
</P>
<P>
As of early September, a total of 42,500 tons had been
produced but only 2,160 tons so far had been sold.

<HEADLINE> Police, FBI Raid Bomb Making House in Tanzanian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian police forces
and the U.S. Federal Bureau Investigation (FBI) agents have
raided a house in Dar es Salaam believed to be the making place
of the bomb that was used in attacking the U.S. embassy in August.
</P>
<P>
The owner of the house which lies in Ilala Bungoni area is a
woman identified as Mariam, whom the police and FBI agents are
still hunting for.
</P>
<P>
The local Criminal Investigation Department and FBI Thursday
took away several items from the house for analysis, local press
reports said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Neighbors said the woman has rented the house to a Zanzibar
resident Khalfan who disappeared soon after the bombing incident
took place.
</P>
<P>
The terrorist attack on U.S. embassy on August 7 killed 11
people and injured more than 70 others.
</P>
<P>
Two suspects, a Egyptian and a Tanzanian, have been brought to
court in Dar es Salaam, accused of murdering 11 people.
</P>
<P>
The neighbors also claimed that the house were frequently
visited by four visitors of Arab or mixed origin at night using
different vehicles.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the police and FBI are still searching for a white
1989 Suzuki Samurai which was used to transport explosives by
bombing suspects.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Adults Go From Sceptics To Disco Fans (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Many senior citizens in the
Chinese capital who were dead set against disco dancing 20 years
ago, have now made it an important part of their lives.
</P>
<P>
Disco fever has hit Liu Yusen, 67, for example, who usually
dances an hour or two every day with other senior citizens and
even says, "I feel uneasy if I don't dance."
</P>
<P>
Like many other senior citizens, Liu's attitude toward disco
was totally different 20 years ago, when China started its reforms
and opening up. One of the things it opened up to was disco and
jeans which were warmly welcomed by young people.
</P>
<P>
But, Liu told a Xinhua reporter while he was dancing at an
outdoor arena at the Temple of Earth in the northern part of
Beijing, "I felt very uneasy when I saw young people dancing
disco, and I certainly wouldn't dance it myself."
</P>
<P>
Beijing now has 1.7 million senior citizens at or above the age
of 60, and a number of them who are retired workers, just like
Liu, have become disco fans and there are nearly 1,000 outdoor
arenas for the 300,000 or so senior fans.
</P>
<P>
In addition to disco, Yangko (a kind of folk dance), Taijiquan
(traditional Chinese shadow boxing), Taiji with sword, and travel
have become favorites among Beijing's senior citizens.
</P>
<P>
Singing and watching opera performances are, of course,
perennial favorites. Every morning, hundreds, sometimes even
thousands, of people gather in central Beijing's Jingshan Park for
a song feast.

<TEXT>
<P>
Some gerontologists point out that the greatest change the 20
years of reforms have brought to senior citizens is a change in
their mode of thought and psychology, which is a result of more
open minds and their attitude toward disco is a manifestation of
this.
</P>
<P>
One researcher, Shao Daosheng of the Chinese Academy of Social
Sciences, says that this change has greatly freed the vigor of the
elderly and allowed them to act according to their own wishes, and
their lives are more colorful.
</P>
<P>
Some of them have begun to spend more money on health care, get
involved in interior decoration, and improved their overall
standard of living instead of being overly cautious about spending
money. Some are wearing more colorful clothing and some, without
husbands or wives, have taken the bold step of advertising for a
spouse in newspapers or on TV.

Many senior citizens have decided to make a contribution to
society in their remaining years by attending senior citizens'
colleges and various social activities.

Zhou Maosen, 73, began to study painting when he retired more
than a decade ago and recently held an exhibition at his home,
winning him a great deal of praise from visitors. "I learned to
paint not for fame, but to make my life colorful," Zhou explains.
</P>
<P>
And, the Beijing Retired Personnel Development Center, the
largest organization of its kind in Beijing, has had 200,000
senior citizens looking for jobs since it opened 11 years
ago. More than 40,000 people have found work in more than 5,000

<HEADLINE> Chinese Coal Industry's Nine-Month Decline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 23 (Xinhua) -- China's coal industry has fared
worse in the first three quarters, with output, sales and profits
down, according to a recent issue of China Coal Industry News.
</P>
<P>
In the nine-month period, coal output shrank by nearly 100
million tons as compared with the same 1997 period, and sales were
down 13.2 percent to 771 million tons. Stockpiles held 200 million
tons.
</P>
<P>
Sources at the State Coal Industry Bureau say that major
state-owned coal mines suffered from mounting losses of as much as
3.75 billion yuan and those in the Northeast were the worst, with
93 percent of the major state-owned coal mines suffering losses of
1.8 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Unpaid bills of major state-owned coal mines rose 6.3
billion yuan from the beginning of the year to 34.4 billion yuan
at the end of September, seriously affecting companies' ability to
pay workers' salaries and pension funds.
</P>
<P>
In the nine-month period, the major state-owned coal mines laid
off 422,000 workers, but they could only pay subsidies to 58
percent of them because of a shortfall of 580 million yuan, the
newspaper says.
</P>
<P>
The poor performance in the industry has to do with slowed
national growth, structural adjustments, and the Asian financial
crisis, bureau officials say.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Government Puts Ailing Bank Under State Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, October 23 (Xinhua) -- The Japanese government decided
Friday to nationalize the ailing Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan
(LTCB) to avoid severing credit lines to its longtime corporate
borrowers and to avert a default on its obligations to creditors.
</P>
<P>
Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi, in announcing the
decision, assured LTCB customers that their deposits, bank
debentures and other claims on the bank will be fully protected
even after LTCB is temporarily put under state control.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi, who is empowered under new legislation to determine how
to handle failed or failing banks until an independent panel is
formed in December, said the government made the decision in view
of the possibility that LTCB might default on its obligations to
creditors.
</P>
<P>
LTCB made an application to the government for temporary
nationalization earlier in the day. It became the first Japanese
bank to be nationalized since the end of World War II, and also
the first to be put under state control under the financial system
law that passed the Diet (parliament) on October 12.
</P>
<P>
In an announcement timed to coincide with Obuchi's statement,
the Financial Supervisory Agency (FSA) unveiled the outcome of its
inspection into LTCB's balance sheets, saying that the bank's
debts exceeded its assets by 340 billion yen (about 2.9 billion
U.S. dollars) at the end of September.
</P>
<P>
Bank of Japan Governor Masaru Hayami vowed to take every
possible step to ensure a smooth purchase of LTCB shares by
Deposit Insurance Corp. and to maintain stability in the financial
system.
</P>
<P>
Hayami said LTCB will continue its daily operations as "a
temporarily nationalized bank."
</P>
<P>
Following the government's decision to put LTCB under state
control, the Tokyo Stock Exchange said the bank's stock will be
de-listed Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Seeks PKK Leader's Extradition from Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Prime Minister Mesut
Yilmaz has said that Turkey will seek Russia's cooperation for
the extradition of Abdullah Ocalan, leader of the outlawed
Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK), the Daily News reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a cabinet meeting Thursday, Yilmaz said that
Turkish intelligence has confirmed that Ocalan "is in Moscow now,"
and that Turkey is making necessary diplomatic efforts to have him
extradited.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that Moscow will prevent Ocalan from pursuing
anti-Turkish activities on Russian soil and hand him over to
Turkish authorities as soon as possible," Yilmaz said.
</P>
<P>
He said that it is "a great success" to see Ocalan being forced
to leave Syria, which has long been accused by Ankara of
supporting the Kurdish rebels.
</P>
<P>
Russian Ambassador in Ankara Alexander Lebedev said in the
same day that Ocalan might have entered Russia by using a fake
passport.
</P>
<P>
"Moscow is investigating the issue with great care. I hope we
will achieve a result soon," said the ambassador, who denied early
this week that the PKK leader was in Russia.
</P>
<P>
As for the Turkish-Syrian agreement signed Tuesday on the PKK
issue, Yilmaz said that Turkey had reaped the products of the
recent pressure it exerted on Syria in order to cut off the
support to the illegal organization.
</P>
<P>
However, he stressed that Turkey will continue watching
whether the Syrian authorities complies with what it has promised
to Turkey regarding terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has massed heavy troops along the Syrian border and
issued an ultimatum, threatening to uproot the PKK bases in Syria
if Damascus continues its support to the Kurdish rebels.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Sends More Troops to Eastern Congo (K) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe has sent 2,000 more
troops with air support to the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)
since last weekend to bolster its estimated 3,000 soldiers
already deployed in the war-torn country.
</P>
<P>
The move was made in anticipation of Wednesday's decision by
Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia to extend their operations in the
DRC to the rebel-held east of the country, Ugandan daily Monitor
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
In answer to a question about the reinforcements, Zimbabwean
Defense Minister Moven Mahachi was quoted by local media as
saying that his forces are already moving into the east to uphold
and implement the decision of the alliance.
</P>
<P>
After a summit meeting with Angolan President Jose Dos Santos
and Namibian President Sam Nujoma in Harare Wednesday, Zimbabwean
President Robert Mugabe told reporters that they had agreed to
move to the east in defense of the sovereignty of the DRC and the
plans were to be implemented soon.
</P>
<P>
At present, DRC President Laurent Kabila has invited some
10,000 troops from Zimbabwe, Angola, Namibia and Chad to fight
for him. The Radio in Goma, a main rebel stronghold on the
Rwandan border, accused Kabila of deploying about 7,000 Rwandan
Hutu militiamen at the front.
</P>
<P>
The Tutsi rebels, who took up arms against Kabila on August 2,
made rapid advances in the eastern DRC and on October 12, they
recovered Kindu, the main eastern advance base of Pro-Kabila
allies.
</P>
<P>
Uganda and Rwanda, two relatively small neighbors of Congo (K)
but having rather strong military strength in the region, have
been accused of fomenting and backing the rebellion aimed to
topple Kabila. Both countries denied the charge.
</P>
<P>
On October 14, top military delegations from Uganda and Rwanda
met here to discuss their operations in their neighboring
country.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni confessed Wednesday that his
country has deployed more that two battalions of troops in
eastern DRC and did not rule out the possibility of sending more
troops there if the situation worsens.
</P>
<P>
With more foreign troops pouring into the mineral-rich DRC and
further widening of the crisis, the situation becomes more
complicated and volatile. No lasting solution to the problem was
projected for the near future.

<HEADLINE> Mozambique Sets Up HIV-Positive Association </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, October 23 (Xinhua) -- A HIV-positive association, the
first of its kind in south African country Mozambique, was
established in the capital Thursday, the Noticias newspaper
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Salvador Mazive, chairman of the association, said at the
launching ceremony that the aim of the association is to offer
consultation to HIV-positive people and eliminate discrimination
against those who have been found HIV-positive.
</P>
<P>
Mazive said that Mozambicans should come to learn that AIDS is
a reality and every Mozambican should contribute his or her bit
to the fight against the deadly disease.
</P>
<P>
He also urged that branch offices be set up throughout the
country to offer consultation to HIV/AIDS patients.
</P>
<P>
Health check-up should not be taken as a pre-condition in
employment and school admission, he said.
</P>
<P>
The latest statistics by Mozambican Health Ministry shows that
another 2,191 AIDS cases have been found in the first half of the
year in the country, increasing the total number of AIDS patients
to 8,678 since the first AIDS case was found in 1986.
</P>
<P>
There are about 1.4 million HIV-positive people in the country
which has a total population of 15 million.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Govt. Pledges to Curb Collusion in Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President B.J.
Habibie Friday reiterated the government's commitment to
eradicating collusion in government projects.
</P>
<P>
"I realize that in the past, various kinds of bad practices
have marred the country's business sector. Such practices occurred
in the tender for government projects," the president said.
</P>
<P>
Opening the 3rd national meeting of the Indonesian Goods
Provisions Partnership and Distributors Association at the State
Palace here, Habibie said business ethics and law enforcement
could deter the business sector from turning to such wicked ways.
</P>
<P>
"But creating a healthy and conducive climate for the business
sector is not easy if entrepreneurs and government officials
practise collusion," he said.
</P>
<P>
The president also said the government does not undermine the
role of Indonesian entrepreneurs in economic development.
</P>
<P>
"The Reform Cabinet formed in May 1998 is committed to
accommodating the people's aspirations as much as possible," he
said, noting that the government does not merely give instructions
like the people think it does.
</P>
<P>
Indonesian activists have demanded that the upcoming special
session of the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR) next month
ratify a decree to reclaim former president Soeharto's family
wealth which he allegedly amassed during the 32 years in power.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto resigned on May 21 amid a deepening economic crisis,
protests and an explosion of rioting in Jakarta in which almost
1,200 died.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian Corruption Watch said in a recent report that at
least 39 presidential decrees issued between 1980 and 1998 were
legally and materially manipulated to benefit certain parties.
</P>
<P>
Another independent corruption watchdog, the Indonesian
Transparency Society, said on October 16 that at least 79 out of
528 presidential decrees issued between 1993 and 1998 were legally
and materially manipulated.
</P>
<P>
According to a report from the National Land Agency, Soeharto
has land in 10 of the country's 27 provinces. In West Nusa
Tenggara Province alone, the family of Soeharto owns 9.23 million
square meters of land.
</P>
<P>
Indonesian police spokesman told reporters earlier this month
that the police are investigating the issuance of 3 billion U.S.
dollars worth of fake promissory notes which allegedly involved
Soeharto's brother-in-law Ibnu Hartomo.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Attorney General Andi Muhammad Ghalib rejected
demands by certain law experts and politicians that Soeharto be
declared a suspect or indicted in the investigations into his
alleged wealth.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto could not yet be considered a suspect because he was
being investigated by two teams, Ghalib said.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Coordinating Minister for Economy, Finance and
Industry Ginandjar Kartasasmita came to the Attorney General's
Office to submit official documents on PT Freeport Indonesia's
contract of work with the Indonesian government to refute the
corruption charge made against him by American scholar Jeffrey
Winters.
</P>
<P>
Winters has alleged that Ginandjar had colluded with a private
company over the purchase of shares in PT Freeport Indonesia, a
subsidiary of the United States giant copper and gold producer
Freeport McMoran Copper and Gold.

<HEADLINE> Five-Day Rising Streak in Stocks Ends in Tokyo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices closed lower in
Tokyo Friday to end a five-day gaining streak as investors sold
shares broadly to take profits.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the First
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange fell 150.86 points, or 1.06
percent, from Thursday's close to end at 14,144.70 after gaining
1,300 points in the previous five trading days.
</P>
<P>
The broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX), covering all
First Section issues, dropped 6.14 points or 0.57 percent to
1,068.15.
</P>
<P>
Turnover on the major section decreased sharply to an estimated
468 million shares from Thursday's 868.53 million shares.
</P>
<P>
Sakura Bank was the day's most heavily traded issue.
</P>
<P>
Bank shares on the whole declined 0.31 percent, but some rose
on indications that more lenders will soon formally ask the
government for a capital injection.
</P>
<P>
The Tokyo Stock Exchange announced shares of Long-Term Credit
Bank of Japan (LTCB) would be removed from the market as early as

</P>
<P>
The volume leader in the previous six days of trading, LTCB
closed Thursday at 2 yen, 48 yen below its par value. The market's
reaction to the LTCB's nationalization was calm thanks to an 18
trillion yen (about 152.5 billion dollars) safety net created by
the government to nationalize and liquidate failed major banks.
</P>
<P>
Of the 1,345 issues listed on the First Section, losers

<P>
MANILA, October 23 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government has
asked the Republic of Cote d'lvoire to be its bridge in
establishing closer ties with other nations in the African
continent, a presidential press release said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The press release said that President Joseph Estrada relayed
this message to Prime Minister Daniel Kablan Duncan of the
Republic of Cote d'lvoire at a state dinner in the Presidential
Palace Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
"The Philippines is keen on establishing bridges to the African
continent, as it recognizes the opportunities arising from the
creation of a new global environment," Estrada was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
He added that "the Philippines is hopeful that its modest
attempts at reaching out to other African developing countries
will spur greater south-south cooperation."
</P>
<P>
In his speech, he praised Cote d'lvoire for establishing
political stability and weathering the harsh economic conditions
worldwide by instituting market-based structural reforms.
</P>
<P>
"We have much to learn from each other's experiences, and
through this learning process, we appreciate and value the
richness of our cultures and promote closer understanding and
affinity between our two countries," Estrada said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Herbal Medicines Benefit AIDS Treatment (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 23 (Xinhua) -- The clinical use of a certain
herbal medicine has led to a drastic decline in the HIV virus and
an increase in the number of immune cells, according to doctors at
Beijing Ditan Hospital, a clinical research center of the Health
Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Ditan's Prof. Xu Daozhen said that no other Chinese or western
pharmaceuticals used here since the mid-1980s have been so
effective.
</P>
<P>
Xu and his colleague Li Xingwang started treating four AIDS
patients and one HIV-infected person with herbal injections in
February this year and the level of HIV virus was reduced to
varying degrees after six months.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the number of CD4 cells, an important
indicator of how well the immune system of HIV and AIDS patients
is working, also increased, almost doubling in one case,
indicating that the cellular immune function of the patient was
tangibly improved.
</P>
<P>
Xu said that a study by the State AIDS Reference Lab, China's
top AIDS research body, confirmed the good results.

<P>
The clinical application showed that the herbal preparation
kills only the virus, not normal cells, and is without
side-effects, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to latest information from a recent world AIDS
conference held in Geneva, the HIV virus would start to replicate
itself once a patient stops taking medicine.
</P>
<P>
And how to remove the remaining virus in the human body during
anti-virus treatment and increase the number of CD4 cells is still
a question that has troubled researchers the world over.
</P>
<P>
Because a herbal preparation known as "Gongming Anti-HIV" has
proven effective in curing hepatitis, cirrhosis, and hepatic
tumors, Heilongjiang's Gongming Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd., noticing
the similarities between the hepatitis viruses and HIV virus,
re-developed its herbal preparation for AIDS.
</P>
<P>
Prof. Xu had not decided to try Gongming Anti-HIV on his AIDS
patients until he saved the lives of nine people with stubborn
hepatitis cases with the herbal medicine.
</P>
<P>
Initial results are still not sufficient, Prof. Xu said,
because one patient was using interferon at the same time, so he's
decided to do further research by treating AIDS patients with
Gongming Anti-HIV only.
</P>
<P>
The State AIDS Reference Lab also plans to cooperate with the
pharmaceutical company and 30 to 40 patients starting next month.

<P>
BEIJING, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Reconstruction of housing is
being given priority in parts of China where this summer's floods
caused great losses and affected economic development.
</P>
<P>
In Heilongjiang Province, northeast China, a private company in
the city of Daqing has spent two million yuan on building 109 houses
on higher ground to the west of the original site, and households
there will have an average floor space of 50 sq m.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Civil Affairs said that one billion yuan in
relief funds and donations has been allocated to rebuild houses
destroyed by this year's flooding. And the central government will
continue to earmark special funds for this endevor.
</P>
<P>
Jiangxi, Hunan, Hubei and Anhui provinces along the Yangtze
River have finished construction plans for houses destroyed by the
floods.
</P>
<P>
Work has been going swiftly in Heilongjiang and Jilin provinces
and in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region where the climate is
much colder. Government departments have been trying hard to help
flood victims prepare for the winter by providing cotton-padded
clothing, quilts and fuel.

<P>
JERUSALEM, October 23 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Friday:
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- A 32-year-old Jewish man from the Jerusalem neighborhood of
Ramot is under arrest on suspicion of having stabbed six Arab men,
one fatally, police revealed on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The stabbings occurred over a three-month period earlier this
year and the suspect is said to be connected to extreme right-wing
groups.
</P>
<P>
Haaretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Three Israeli cabinet ministers of Likud Party have met to
adopt a joint stance in the event that a second West Bank
redeployment agreement is signed at the Wye Plantation
summit.
</P>
<P>
They decided on Thursday to warn Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu that he will be hard to muster a government majority to
approve the second pullback unless the Palestinians are required
to fulfill all their commitments before the withdrawal is carried
out.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- The devaluation of the shekel continued on Thursday despite
early reports that Israeli Central Bank plans to sharply raise
interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The representative exchange rate was fixed at 4.367 shekels
against a U.S. dollar. And economists said the main impetus behind
the recent depreciation has been that companies run to pay foreign
currency-linked loans, as they fear the shekel would further
decline.

<HEADLINE> Kenya's Fertility Rate Declines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's fertility rate has
declined by 30 percent over the past nine years, according to
George Saitoti, the Planning and National Development Minister in
this east African country.
</P>
<P>
Total fertility rate fell from 6.7 percent in 1989 to 5.4
percent in 1993 and now stands at 4.7 percent, Saitoti said while
launching the preliminary results of the Kenya Demographic and
Health Survey for 1998 Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The fertility rate represents the number of children a woman
would have by the end of her reproductive years.
</P>
<P>
"This shows that population control is being taken seriously
and family planning is taking root," the minister was quoted by
Friday's Kenya Times newspaper as saying.
</P>
<P>
He added that so far 97 percent of Kenyan women had heard of
at least one contraceptive method and over 64 percent of women
use family planning methods.
</P>
<P>
However, the infant and child mortality figures went up
slightly over the years. The 1989 survey showed 60 deaths per
1,000 children, which rose to 63 in 1993 and now stands at 74
deaths in 1,000 children.
</P>
<P>
"This increase could partially be attributed to the increasing
prevalence of HIV/AIDS. Children infected with this virus are
likely to die in infancy or in early childhood," Saitoti noted.
</P>
<P>
The survey shows that between 1993 and 1998, there has been an
increase of 17 percent in the number of children under the age of
five.
</P>
<P>
Immunization figures paint a gloomier picture. Only 60 percent
of children between 12-23 months received the full series of
immunization. This is a decline from 79 percent recorded in 1993.
</P>
<P>
The survey was conducted by the National Council for
Population and Development, the Central Bureau of Statics under
the fund by U.N. and U.S. aid agencies. The full report will be
released in March 1999.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's Economy Contracts by 4.8 Pct in 1998 (1) (by Wu Dingbao) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's economic growth
in 1998 contracts for the first time since 1985 as all major
sectors of the economy have been adversely affected by the
deflationary impact of the financial crisis that beset the region
since mid-1997.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's real gross domestic product (GDP) growth for 1998 is
estimated to contract by 4.8 percent, according to the Economic
Report 1998/99 released here Friday by the Finance Ministry.
</P>
<P>
This is a reversal of 12.5 percentage points when compared with
the 7.7 percent growth attained in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The contraction this year is "severe and Unprecedented" when
the GDP registered a negative growth of 2.8 percent in the first
quarter and 6.8 percent in the second quarter this year.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, as the report pointed out, as a result of
counter-cyclical measures taken by the government in the second
half of the year, which included the implementation of the
National Economic Recovery Plan, the easing of monetary policy and
the injection of fiscal stimulus to invigorate the economy as well
as the imposition of selective exchange controls, the contraction
in real GDP is expected to be less severe in the fourth quarter of
1998.
</P>
<P>
All major sectors of the economy have been adversely affected
by varying degrees by declining demand, excess supply or supply
constraints.
</P>
<P>
The manufacturing sector, which provided the main impetus to
overall GDP growth for the past decade, is envisaged to experience
a reduction in its output by 5.8 percent in 1998 against a 12.5
percent growth in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The construction sector declines sharply in 1998 by an
estimated 19.2 percent against a 9.5 percent growth in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Output growth in the agriculture, forestry, livestock and
fishery sector is estimated to contract by 5.9 percent in 1998
against a growth of 1.3 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
In the mining sector, its output declines slightly by an
estimated 0.8 percent this year against 1 percent growth last
year.
</P>
<P>
As the sharp contraction in the primary and secondary sectors
have led to declining demand for services, the value-added of the
tertiary sector decelerates sharply to an estimated growth of 2.1
percent in 1998 compared with a growth of 8 percent in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's Economy Contracts by 4.8 Pct in 1998 (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Because of reduced economic activities and lower real
disposable income having led to a significant reduction in the
demand for imports, and due to a marginal increase in export
volume, the current account of the balance of payment recorded an
unprecedented surplus of 15 billion ringgit (about 3.947 billion
U.S. dollars) in the first half of 1998, the first surplus since
1989.
</P>
<P>
For the whole of 1998, a surplus of some 20 billion ringgit
(about 5.263 billion dollars) is expected, marking a significant
improvement when compared with the deficit of 14.1 ringgit (about
3.71 billion dollars) in 1997.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, nominal gross national product (GNP),
which reflects national income, increases marginally by 0.4
percent to an estimated 262.1 billion ringgit (about 68.973
billion dollars) this year, against an increase of 9.8 percent in
1997.
</P>
<P>
With the population increasing by 2.4 percent, per capita GNP
therefore is estimated to decline by 1.9 percent to 3,013 dollars
in 1998 against 4,284 dollars in 1997 and in terms of purchasing
power parity, per capita income declines by 31.9 percent to 8,196
dollars in 1998 against 12,043 dollars in 1997, the report said.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, due to a decline by an estimated 16.2 percent in total
revenue collection and an increase of an estimated 23 percent in
its gross development expenditure to revive the economy, the
overall financial position of the Federal government records a
deficit of an estimated 9.587 billion ringgit (about 2.522 billion
dollars) or 3.7 percent of GNP against a surplus of 6.626 billion
ringgit (about 1.743 billion dollars) or 2.5 percent of GNP in
1997.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia, which was successful in keeping inflation at a low
rate of about 3 percent for almost a decade, recorded a much
higher inflation rate during the first nine months of 1998 when
the consumer Price Index increased by 5.2 percent against an
increase of 2.6 percent during the corresponding period of 1997,
reflecting largely the impact of ringgit depreciation on prices of
imported goods.
</P>
<P>
For 1998 as a whole, the inflation rate is expected at about 5
percent against 2.7 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The contraction of the real economy has affected the pace of
job creation and led to increased incidence of structural
unemployment. As a result, the unemployment rate in 1998 is
estimated to increase to 4.9 percent of labor force against 2.7
percent in 1997, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
It is envisaged that with the full implementation of economic
recovery measures, Malaysia's economy could recover mildly in 1999
with its real GDP growth expected to increase by 1 percent.

<HEADLINE> Northern Chinese Province Reports Good Grain Harvest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Shanxi Province in north China
expects to get 10.5 billion kg of grain this year, an increase of
1.3 billion kg from last year, the provincial statistics bureau
said today.
</P>
<P>
The output will be slightly less than the record high of 1996.
</P>
<P>
The bureau attributed the good harvest to an increased growing
area, crop adjustments, and increased use of machinery and
technology.
</P>
<P>
The autumn harvest alone is expected to bring the province 7.2
billion kg of grain, of which 4.5 billion kg is corn.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Hebei and Gansu provinces announced their grain output
estimates for this year, which are both bigger than last year.

<HEADLINE> hke102322 -Mild Recovery Envisaged in Malaysia's Economy for 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's economy is
expected to recover mildly next year with its real gross domestic
product (GDP) growth increasing by 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
The main source of the growth in 1999 against an estimated 4.8
percent contraction in 1998 is expected to be generated through
domestic demand, stimulated by the measures that have been put in
place by the government recently to revive the economy, according
to the Economic Report 1998/99 released here Friday by the Finance
Ministry.
</P>
<P>
With the mild recovery expected in overall aggregate demand,
output of all sectors of the economy, with the exception of the
construction sector, is envisaged to record a moderate growth in
the coming year.
</P>
<P>
Aggregate domestic demand in 1999 is expected to turn around to
record a moderate growth of 3.9 percent after recording a
contraction of 11.7 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the manufacturing sector, the backbone
of the economy, is envisaged to step up its output marginally by
1.0 percent in 1999 against an estimated negative growth of 5.8
percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
This is largely due to expected recovery in the output of
domestic market-oriented industries by 1.3 percent against an 8.8
percent contraction in 1998 and export-oriented industry by 0.8
percent against a 2.9 percent fall in 1998, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The agricultural sector in 1999 is forecast to turn around
positively with its output to grow by 3.9 percent against an
estimated negative growth of 5.9 percent in 1998 as output from
oil palm is estimated to improve by 7 percent after contracting by
8 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Output in the mining sector is expected to recover in 1999 with
a growth of 1.3 percent underpinned by a 7.5 percent increase in
gas output and a marginal increase of 0.6 percent in crude oil
output against an estimated contraction of 0.8 percent in the
sector in 1998.
</P>
<P>
In response to a gradual pick-up in real domestic demand for
services following the easing of monetary policy and injection of
fiscal stimulus, the report said value-added in the services
sector is forecast to accelerate mildly to a 2.7 percent growth in
1999 against a 2.1 percent growth in 1998.
</P>
<P>
But output in the construction sector is forecast to decline
further by 8 percent in 1999 due to sluggish construction starts
in some segments of the property market. Value-added in the sector
declines sharply by an estimated 19.2 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The report said if the ringgit continues to be fixed at 3.8 to
the dollar, both export and import prices could decline marginally
in 1999, and with lower prices, gross national product (GNP) in
current prices is forecast to increase by 0.7 percent against a
0.4 percent growth in 1998 while the per capita GNP is envisaged
to increase by 1.5 percent to 3,059 U.S. dollars against 3,013
dollars in 1998 in view of the stronger ringgit.
</P>
<P>
For 1999, As the merchandise account of the balance of payment
is envisaged to record a smaller surplus and the services account
to register a slightly narrower deficit, Malaysia's current
account of the balance of payments is expected to record a smaller
surplus of 11 billion ringgit (about 2.894 billion dollars) or 4.2
percent of GNP against some 20 billion ringgit (about 5.263
billion dollars) or 7.7 percent of GNP in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Inflation in 1999 is forecast to be lower in the region of 3.5
percent if the ringgit continues to be at the present pegged rate.
</P>
<P>
The report said the measures put in place to insulate the
economy from the contagion effect of the regional and global
financial crisis and to speedily invigorate the economy are
expected to pave the way for a mild recovery of the Malaysian
economy in the coming year.

<HEADLINE> Ban on Logging Worsening Wood Shortage in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 23 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government's recent
ban on logging in some major forest areas will worsen the
country's wood shortage, creating a large market for overseas
suppliers, according to a recent issue of Green Times.
</P>
<P>
The ban will reduce China's timber output of 55 million cubic
meters a year by about a fourth, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
China's housing and infrastructural construction will increase
demand for wood, and by the year 2000, State Forestry Bureau
officials estimate, China's wood needs will grow to 85 million
cubic meters a year.
</P>
<P>
The country will develop 5-6 million cubic meters of wood
substitutes annually, but the remaining 40 million cubic meters
will have to be imported, they say.

<HEADLINE> 18 Travelers Suffocate to Death in Botswana </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Botswana police have
found the bodies of 18 people who appeared to have suffocated on
the back of a truck en route from Zimbabwe to South Africa, South
African newspapers reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
"We have identified eight of the bodies and can confirm they
were Zimbabweans," police spokesman Christopher Mbulawa was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The bodies were found in the bush near the capital Gaborone
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"We are still trying to find out the nationalities of the
others, but we suspect they were also Zimbabweans," Mbulawa said.
</P>
<P>
"Two survivors, also from Zimbabwe, claimed they were
traveling in the back of a truck with no ventilation from
Bulawayo (of Zimbabwe) to Gaborone but were destined for South
Africa."
</P>
<P>
They left Bulawayo Monday.
</P>
<P>
"They don't know what happened along the way, but they found
themselves in the bush Tuesday night with the 18 dead people."
</P>
<P>
Mbulawa said it appeared the travelers had fallen asleep on
the back of the truck and 18 of them, 17 men and one woman, had
suffocated.
</P>
<P>
The passengers were apparently dumped in the bush by the truck
driver, who had fled with his vehicle.
</P>
<P>
Mbulawa said Botswana police were working with their
Zimbabwean counterparts on the case.

<HEADLINE> Iran Kicks off Election for Experts' Assembly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Iran Friday morning kicked off
the election for the powerful Assembly of Experts, which under
constitution has the power to determine and superview the supreme
leader.
</P>
<P>
At 08:00 a.m. (0430 GMT), Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali
Khamenei appeared at the polling station 110 in northern Tehran,
to cast his ballot for the 86-seat assembly, Tehran radio reported.
</P>
<P>
It is the third election of the assembly since it was formed in
1983 under the order of late spiritual leader Ayatollah Musavi
Khomeini to choose his successor.
</P>
<P>
Like Khomeini, father of the 1979 Islamic Revolution which
topple the late shah's regime, the current supreme leader,
Khamenei, has the final say in virtually everything in the country.
</P>
<P>
The election of the assembly is seen as a battle between the
entrenched hardliners, who dominated almost all but the
administrative power, and the moderates, represented by President
Mahammad Khatami.
</P>
<P>
Earlier report said that the Interior Ministry has set up
33,312 polling stations in 28 provinces throughout the country
for people to elect their provincial representatives to the
assembly.
</P>
<P>
A total of 167 candidates run for the 86 seats which serve in
each term of eight years.
</P>
<P>
Critics said many moderate candidates were eliminated even
before the campaign began by the conservative Council of
Guardians, which screened the qualification of applicants.

JAKARTA -- The Indonesian government-sponsored fact-finding
team investigating the May riots has postponed the release of its
final report, due to be announced Friday, until next week,
national newspapers Friday quoted the team leader as saying.
</P>
<P>
The delay was due to an internal debate on the recommendations
to be made to six government representatives, the Joint
Fact-Finding Team leader Marzuki Darusman said.
</P>
<P>
The 18-member team was formed on July 23 under a joint
agreement between five ministries and the Attorney General's
Office. It was entrusted with the task of investigating and, if
possible, unveiling the instigators and perpetrators of the riots,
which some say were organized. (Indonesia-Riot-Findings)

<HEADLINE> 36 Feared Buried in Landslide in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Thirty-six people were feared
dead Friday in a typhoon-caused massive landslide on the
Philippine island province of Catanduanes, the National Disaster
Coordinating Center (NDCC) said.
</P>
<P>
NDCC said that six bodies had been recovered by rescue workers,
bringing the total number of people killed by typhoon Babs
(locally named Loleng) to at least 13.
</P>
<P>
NDCC said that no other details were available yet about the
massive landslide in Catanduanes.
</P>
<P>
However, it added that the death toll brought by Babs could
rise as reports from other provinces are received.
</P>
<P>
So far, NDCC said that Babs' damage to crops and property was
estimated at 111.6 million pesos (about 2.6 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Babs is the second strong typhoon to hit the Philippines in a
week. Earlier, Supertyphoon Zab killed 86 people and destroyed
crops and property worth over 1 billion pesos (some 23 million
dollars).
</P>
<P>
But Babs was more destructive than Zab as it slammed the
country's eastern seaboard and roared across central Luzon and
Metro Manila with a maximum speed of 150 kilometers per hour, NDCC
said.
</P>
<P>
It added that Metro Manila felt the typhoon's fury Friday
morning as it experienced heavy rains and strong winds.
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado, who is also the NDCC
chairman, has ordered military commanders to help evacuate 145,317
people displaced by rising floods in various parts of Luzon.

U.S. cents.
</P>
<P>
All eyes in the market will be on Wednesday's release of the
September inflation figures by the Australian Bureau of
Statistics.
</P>
<P>
The Reserve Bank of Australia's reaction will be keenly watched
by the market for any indication of an interest rate easing.
</P>
<P>
The figures center on an index gain of 0.5 percent and an
annual inflation rate of 1.6 percent.

</P>

the PKK leader had been spotted near Moscow.
</P>
<P>
Zaman (Time)
</P>
<P>

Turkey has been demanding that Damascus expel Ocalan from its
territory and shut down PKK camps in the Syrian-controlled Bekka

<HEADLINE> Chinese Rare Books to Be at Auction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Some rare private letters and
books that were in one of China's best-known libraries but were
missing for 300 years will appear at Guardian Auction's sale next
week.
</P>
<P>
These treasures can enrich collections and make a profit for
rare book collectors, Tuo Xiaotang, head of Guardian's
Chinese rare books department, said here today.
</P>
<P>
The lots formerly belonged to the Danshengtang, a private
collection in Shaoxing of Zhejiang province, east China, and to
the prominent Tianyige library in Ningbo, also in Zhejiang.
</P>
<P>
Danshengtang gradually went into declined because the owners,
the Qi family, were involved in politics, fighting against the
Qing Dynasty (1644-1911) and almost all books and other documents
in the collection disappeared.
</P>
<P>
However, in early 1950s, a Shanghai reporter with sharp eyes
discovered the collection at a small fair near Shaoxing and tried
to get the books and the other documents.
</P>
<P>
According to local chronicles, the Qi house had been entered by
authorities and their property confiscated.
</P>
<P>
But the descendants still kept a few of the treasures, which,
Tuo said, have been locked up for 300 years. Most of the books
have been turned into the National Library, the Nanjing Library,
and Shanghai Library, with a few bought by individuals.
</P>
<P>
The auctioneers expect the most valuable lot, an 8-volume
manuscript written by Qi Biaojia, will bring 250,000 yuan (30,000
U.S. dollars).

<HEADLINE> Suspected Bhang Dealer Arrested in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan police have arrested a
suspected key bhang dealer of the country in her hide-out in
Kisauni in the North Coast.
</P>
<P>
The woman was arrested Thursday after three suspects caught
with 199 stones of bhang told the police they were delivering the
drug to her, said a report reaching here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The suspects also told police that they brought in the bhang
from Tanzania through Lake Victoria and sold it to the woman, an
allegedly notorious drug distributor in the eastern African
country.
</P>
<P>
The Mombasa deputy police boss, Atanasio Munyagia, said the
police believe a syndicate has been involved in drug trafficking
in east Africa for a long time.
</P>
<P>
"These people use very sophisticated methods and sometimes it
is very difficult for the police to beat their traps," he said.
</P>
<P>
Munyagia said most of the bhang is off-loaded at Mikindani and
later transported to Kisauni area using canoes.
</P>
<P>
In another development, police started Thursday combing Mt.
Kenya Forest in search of bhang and found a three-acre bhang farm
near the Tungu River by afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Some 84 acres of bhang have been destroyed in the Mt. Kenya
area since April and 10 had to be re-cleared after the crop
re-germinated.
</P>
<P>
Kenya has become an important post of international drug
smuggling via east Africa over recent years, according to the
U.N. International Drug Control Program.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Human Rights Issue Experts Hope for More Discussions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 23 (Xinhua) -- China's Great Wall, decorated
with autumn leaves and bathed in brilliant sunshine, looked even
better than usual when 20 international delegates climbed up on it
Thursday at the end of the "International Symposium on World Human
Rights Toward the 21st Century".
</P>
<P>
Prof. Hector Cuadra-Moreno from National University of Mexico
speculated on the Great Wall when he learned about how it was
built and added to dynasty by dynasty to resist invasions, and
remembered his days with the United Nations High Commission for
Refugees, when the pitiful faces of African refugees gave him a
searing portrait of wartime suffering.
</P>
<P>
He said that war is the greatest violation of human rights in
history, and that peace is the holy mission of mankind.
</P>
<P>
"No country has a perfect record on human rights," he said,
adding "condemning each other doesn't make any sense. We are now
sitting down to talk freely and this is much better than mutual
denunciation."
</P>
<P>
A Greek member of UN Sub-Commission on Prevention and
Protection of Minorities chose the Forbidden City as her
destination and said that those who do not understand China's past
and present should come here and have a look to correct some of
their prejudices. The ancient palaces remind us of China's long
tradition of feudalism and that it has a unique mission.
</P>
<P>
Faith Pansy Tlakula, of the South African Human Rights
Commission, said that she hopes they will discuss important human
rights issues more seriously and get to the heart of the matter,
and with less diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
She said she noticed that the number of woman speakers was too
small, and she hopes that there will be more sisters to speak out
next time.
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Salma Sobhan, executive director of the Human Rights and
Law Assistance Center of Bangladesh, said that the meeting was
well-organized, but the time too limited and that she hopes there
are more exchanges next time.

<P>
WELLINGTON, October 23 (Xinhua) -- The unemployment in New
Zealand rose steadily to 7.7 percent in recent months, and is
expected to peak at 8.5 percent early next year.
</P>
<P>
The local newspaper Dominion Friday quoted Social Services,
Work and Income Minister Roger Sowry as saying the New Zealand
economy is expected to weaken, and lower growth is forecast to
result in fewer jobs.
</P>
<P>
He said in response to a parliamentary question that a total of
 extra 143 million N.Z. dollars (75.7 million U.S. dollars) has
been budgeted to cope with an expected rise in the number of
people on unemployment benefits. The figure represents a 9.8
percent increase on the budgeted 1998 allocation for the
unemployment benefit and community wage of 1.4 billion N.Z.
dollars (742 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The economy of New Zealand is in a recession after two quarters
of negative growth following the flow-on effects of the Asian
economic downturn.

<P>
CHANGCHUN, October 23 (Xinhua) -- The people of Changchun, the
capital of China's Jilin Province, are paying more attention to
orphans and the city's orphanage is no longer a silent and
isolated place.
</P>
<P>
Wu Shaogang, the head of the orphanage, says that a lack of
contact with the outside world will affect the children's
growth. So local students, laid-off workers, and directors of
private enterprises have come to see the orphans and bring them
toys and sweets.
</P>
<P>
"We can not give every child the care and love they yearn for,
because one nurse here usually has to take care of more than four
children at the same time," Wu explains, pointing out that there
are various ways for local people to show their concern for these
poor children. They can act as temporary parents, taking them to
gardens at festival time or bringing them back home to spend a
weekend with the family. Or they can adopt the children.
</P>
<P>
The orphanage is the only welfare institution that adopts
abandoned babies and orphans and now has 49 children between the
ages of three and seven.
</P>
<P>
In order to provide them with comfortable living conditions,
the institution has spent a large amount of money on a two-story
building with toys in every bright and spacious room, and eight of
the 49 children have been adopted by local people and a lot of
people have called, offering a warm family to these children who
have never experienced parental love.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Sees More Tourists in September </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, October 23 (Xinhua) -- There were 102,640
short-term overseas visitor arrivals in New Zealand during
September, four percent more than in the same month of last year,
according to a media release from Statistics New Zealand, which
was issued here Friday.
</P>
<P>
But, for the year to the September 1998, 1.457 million people
visited New Zealand, down five percent from the previous year.
</P>
<P>
During September, visitor arrivals from Asia totaled 21,640, a
drop of 5,070 or 19 percent compared with the same month of last
year. This drop was mostly due to fewer visitors from the south
Korea and Japan. But the loss was more than offset by increases in
 visitors from Australia, Britain and the United States.
</P>
<P>
According to the release, New Zealand residents left for
123,040 short-term trips during September, up nine percent on the
same month last year. There were more trips to Australia, Asia and
Europe, but fewer to North America.
</P>
<P>
In September, the release added, New Zealand suffered a net
loss of 270 permanent and long-term migrants, compared with a net
gain of 750 a year ago. For the year to September, there was a net
migration loss of 3,860, compared with net gains of 12,900 and
27,270 for the two previous years respectively.

<HEADLINE> Indian Banks Toning up Systems for Credit Monitoring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Indian banks are rigorously
ensuring exact use of bank credit and eliminating diversion of
funds to less viable activities as they are faced with the
prospect of worsening asset quality, Business Standard said here
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Leading commercial banks in the country have started beefing up
their credit monitoring systems to track fund usage project-wise
as well as product-wise, the paper quoted the chief of a
commercial bank as saying.
</P>
<P>
Efforts are on to prevent diversion of funds. This practice was
on during the economic boom when companies diverted funds towards
equities and real estate and investments in subsidiaries, which
were usually shown in the balance sheet under investments and also
loans and advances.
</P>
<P>
Banks have also detected diversion of funds within a unit,
wherein a loan appraised for a particular project or product, was
diverted to one which was unable to raise sufficient credit. This
does not show up in the balance sheet. Given the quantum of loans,
their use was difficult to monitor and normally a bank would limit
its involvement to appraisal of a project's viability. Monitoring
systems were implemented but their reach was limited.
</P>
<P>
But with the non-performing assets rising, banks are willing to
make an effort and bear additional costs to prevent defaults which
may be costlier. Banks are strictly appraising credit proposals
based on the borrower's credit worthiness and the project's
viability. This has necessitated the prevention of diversion of
funds.
</P>
<P>
A special technical team is being appointed to shore up the
recovery machinery. Banks are also recruiting experts to monitor
loans.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Targets to Produce 185,000 Tons of Sugar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Sugarcane crushing in mills in
Bangladesh began Friday with a target of producing about 185,000
tons of sugar this season.
</P>
<P>
This year's target of production might not be fulfilled as
sugarcane on some 1,120 hectares out of the 100,000 hectares of
sugarcane-growing land was either damaged by the recent
devastating floods or by pests, press reports here Friday quoted
sources in the sector as saying.
</P>
<P>
The total sugarcane crushing capacity of the country's 15 sugar
mills is 21,044 tons per day. The mills produce about 200,000 tons
of sugar annually.
</P>
<P>
In the fiscal year from July 1997 to June 1998, the Bangladeshi
government had to import over 200,000 tons of sugar to cater to
the domestic consumers, although the mills had fulfilled the
targets set for them.
</P>
<P>
The domestic demand for sugar is 375,000 tons, and about
167,000 tons of sugar was produced last season against the target
of 145,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, this South Asian country may have to import around
200,000 tons of sugar in the current 1998/99 fiscal year.

<P>
The government is now considering whether to promulgate an

corporates as rapidly as possible. Vajpayee is likely to refer to
the share buyback move at the annual general meeting of the
Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Allowing share buybacks without any government checks would
boost investor confidence in the domestic capital markets, the

</P>
<P>
Share buyback is a long-standing demand of Indian corporates
but has been held up because the Department of Company Affairs had

<HEADLINE> BSEC Foreign Ministers Call for Strengthened Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Bulgarian Foreign Minister
Nadezhda Mihailova Thursday called for all-round economic
cooperation among the member countries of the Black Sea Economic
Cooperation (BSEC) to meet the challenges of the new century.
</P>
<P>
Mihailova told the 12th BSEC ministerial meeting that the
member countries should step up their economic cooperation in the
face of the upcoming 21st century, an increasingly globalized
world economy and the new realities in Europe.
</P>
<P>
She said at the turn of the century, the BSEC should clearly
formulate its priorities taking into considerations the new
realities in Europe and the trend for the globalization of the
world economy.
</P>
<P>
A topmost priority for the organization is a full-fledged
economic cooperation among its members, Mihailova noted. This, she
said, matches the potential of the region and is facilitated by
its strategic location and economic capacity.
</P>
<P>
The BSEC offers a wide spectrum of opportunities for potential
investors, Mihailova said, noting that cooperation within the
framework of the Black Sea Bank for Trade and Development is
particularly important.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister stressed the growing interest in the BSEC
on the part of the European Union.
</P>
<P>
She said it was very important to develop infrastructure
projects because the Black Sea region is the bridge between Europe
and Asia and a crossing point for the transport corridors from
Europe to the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Mihailova underscored the opportunities for cooperation in the
field of power engineering and especially in the transportation of
Caspian oil and gas.
</P>
<P>
Documents endorsed at the one-day meeting also stressed
cooperation in a range of other fields such as communications,
tourism, environmental protection and combat against organized
crime.
</P>
<P>
The participants held out hope that the Black Sea Bank for
Trade and Development could start operation as scheduled on
January 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
The agreement on the establishment of the bank, which aimed to
draw capital for regional construction, was signed by BSEC member
countries at the end of 1996.
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1992, the BSEC is composed of 11 member states --
Albania, Amenia, Azerbaijan, Bulgaria, Greece, Georgia, Moldova,
Romania, Russia, Turkey and Ukraine. The organization has seven
additional observer countries.

<HEADLINE> Poland Launches Quit-Smoking Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, October 22 (Xinhua) -- More than 1.6 million Polish
smokers have quit the habit since 1990, giving a healthier look to
a nation once infamous for heavy smoking and drinking, Poland's
Health Promotion Foundation said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference marking the start of this year's
quit-smoking campaign, the foundation said that by May this year,
smokers accounted for 39 percent among men and 19 percent among
women, sharply down from 62 and 30 percent respectively in 1982.
</P>
<P>
The rate of Polish men who have never smoked has doubled since
1974, said the foundation, which expects to increase this number
among teenagers and adults by campaigning that smoking is both out
of mode and harmful to health.
</P>
<P>
During last year's campaign, some 900,000 vowed to quit smoking
and 200,000 of them succeeded in doing so.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Coffee Exports Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's coffee exports
dropped to 309,000 metric tons worth 550 million U.S. dollars in
the crop year ending September 1998, compared to 380,000 tons of
675 million dollars in the previous crop year, the Jakarta Post
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Executive secretary of the Association of Indonesian Coffee
Exporters Noer Madjid attributed the decline to the falling
domestic output due to the El Nino weather phenomenon which caused
a prolonged drought last year.
</P>
<P>
Noer predicted the crop's output would continue to decline this
crop year by a further 30 percent because of the La Nina reverse
weather pattern which would bring higher rainfall than normal.
</P>
<P>
Heavy rains have affected coffee crops in South Sumatra,
Lampung and Bengkulu, which together account for about 65 percent
of the country's production.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia is the world's biggest grower of robusta coffee,
providing 24 percent of global robusta production. Indonesia is
also the third largest coffee producer, after Brazil and Columbia,
contributing 7 percent to the world total output.
</P>
<P>
Noer said Indonesia normally produced between 450,000 tons and
500,000 tons of coffee per annum, of which 120,000 tons went to
domestic consumption.
</P>
<P>
"But in a situation like this when purchasing power of most
people is decreasing, domestic consumption of coffee is likely to
drop to between 90,000 and 100,000 tons," he said.
</P>
<P>
Following the acute depreciation of the rupiah against the U.S.
dollar, coffee producers have preferred to exporting their
products.
</P>
<P>
Japan is Indonesia's largest coffee export destination in Asia,
and Germany is the country's largest coffee importer in Europe.
</P>
<P>
Noer said coffee was currently the third largest foreign
exchange earner among plantation commodities after rubber and palm
oil, contributing about 22 percent to the agricultural export
value.

<HEADLINE> China Urges Global Cooperation in Face of Asian Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, October 22 (Xinhua) -- China urged strengthened global
cooperation to curb the spreading and deepening of Asia's
financial crisis at the United Nations Conference on Trade and
Development (UNCTAD) here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a one-day high-level session of the UNCTAD Board,
Chinese Ambassador to the U.N. seat in Geneva Wu Jianmin stressed
that the Asian crisis is not merely regional as it has worldwide
impacts deserving a global answer.
</P>
<P>
He said major developed countries in particular should make
more contribution to easing the crisis, urging the United States,
Japan and the European Union countries to stabilize their economy
and financial situation and to strengthen coordination.
</P>
<P>
The UNCTAD, headquartered in Geneva, is a permanent organ of
the U.N. General Assembly aimed at promoting international trade
and sustainable economic growth in the world.
</P>
<P>
Wu said the East Asia financial crisis, with widespread
negative impact, has also hurt China's foreign trade and
investment inflows.
</P>
<P>
However, China's political stability and proper macro-economic
strategies have enabled the country to maintain its currency value
and economic growth, he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that 1998 is full of challenges for China, coupling
the Asian financial turmoil with devastating floods in large parts
of the country.
</P>
<P>
Wu briefed the conference on the Chinese government's policies
to tackle the challenges, including the non-devaluation of its
currency, further reforms in the foreign trade system to boost
exports and improvement of the environment for foreign
investment.

<HEADLINE> Cook Predicts Growing Pressure on Belgrade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, October 22 (Xinhua) -- British Foreign Secretary
Robin Cook said here Thursday that the draft resolution on Kosovo
to be soon discussed by the U.N. Security Council would further
step up political pressure on the Yugoslav authorities.
</P>
<P>
Cook made the remark at a joint press conference with Romanian
Foreign Minister Andrei Plesu.
</P>
<P>
He said if the resolution won support from Russia, it would be
unwise for Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to brush it aside.
</P>
<P>
Under the new draft resolution, Yugoslavia's violation of the
agreement reached between Milosevic and U.S. envoy Richard
Holbrooke would incur the use of force against it, according to
Interfax News Agency.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Russia made it clear that it would vote against
it.
</P>
<P>
Cook also called on the ethnic Albanians in Kosovo to observe
related agreements. He warned that if they thwarted the
implementation of the Milosevic-Holbrooke agreement, they would
only protract their sufferings.
</P>
<P>
The British Foreign Secretary welcomed Romania's stance on
Kosovo and appreciated the country's opening of territorial air
space to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).
</P>
<P>
Apart from meeting Plesu, Cook also held talks with Romanian
President Emil Constantinescu and Prime Minister Radu Vasile.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, Cook repeatedly pledged support for Romania's
entry into NATO and the European Union.
</P>
<P>
Cook arrived in Bucharest Wednesday night on the last leg of
his Balkan tour. He had visited Bulgaria and Macedonia.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Investors Still Wary of Property Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Foreign investors have held off
on big buys of properties of Indonesian debt-ridden developers
because they find no signs of imminent economic recovery, the
Jakarta Post reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
According to property consultant First Pacific Davies, although
local properties were priced relatively cheaply in U.S. dollar
terms, cost was not the only concern for investors.
</P>
<P>
"Other considerations are signs that the economic recovery will
start soon," company executive Jay Smith said.
</P>
<P>
"When it will start to recover? How strong will the economy be
when it starts to recover? And how about the politics?" he added.
</P>
<P>
Smith said property investors would only start to reenter an
ailing market when they found indications it was ready for
recovery. Many property investors considered Southeast Asia as one
entity, meaning they would only enter Indonesia once the whole
region was on the road to recovery.
</P>
<P>
The manager of the company's consultancy and valuation division
Diana Herutami noted that property owners in the office, retail
and apartment market were forced to cut rents in U.S. dollar terms
because of falling occupancy rates.
</P>
<P>
"Some 70 percent of central business district (CBD) grade A
building owners would like to negotiate for the exchange rate or
directly quote the rate in rupiah," Herutami said.
</P>
<P>
Over the third quarter, the rental rate for grade A office
buildings in the CBD area averaged 8.6 dollars per square meter
per month, plus service charge of 4 dollars per square meter per
month.
</P>
<P>
The occupancy rate for the office space continued its downward
trend over the third quarter. The greatest fall was noted for
grade A, with the occupancy rate sliding 5 percentage points to 78
percent.
</P>
<P>
Total vacancies of all grades stood at 834,000 square meters,
rising from 300,000 square meters in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
Herutami said her company recorded no new supplies of office
and retail space over the third quarter, and expected none in the
fourth quarter.

<HEADLINE> Jordan, 240 Players Support Union's Fight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Michael Jordan, Karl Malone
and almost all of the league's high-profile players mingled with
the union's masses and expressed their attitude to unit under the
union in the fight against the owners in the lockout battle today
in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
Jordan dropped no hint whether he will be playing basketball
when the lockout ends.
</P>
<P>
Jordan stands together with 240 players and issued a message
that the union is unified and will never accept a hard salary cap.
</P>
<P>
"My mind is still open. I haven't made my decision, but that
doesn't mean I shouldn't be a part of the union," Jordan said
Thursday after the largest gathering in the history of the
National Basketball Players Union.
</P>
<P>
"I owe an obligation to the young players and the players who
came before me," Jordan said. "This work stoppage is not our
fault. We're willing to work, but David Stern shouldn't be able
to force us to play under a deal that's unfavorable to us."
</P>
<P>
Attending the meeting are stars including Shaquille O'neal,
Scottie Pippen, Kevin Garnett and Kobe Bryant.
</P>
<P>
The meeting almost lasted five hours. Union director Billy
Hunter announced that the players had voted unanimously to never
accept a hard salary cap. He also said almost all 400 players
would come to New York next week to request a formal bargaining
session while the league's Board of Governors was in town.
</P>
<P>
NBA deputy commissioner Russ Granik said in response "We'll
meet with anybody."
</P>
<P>
The NBA is expected to cancel the rest of the November competit
ions next week.
</P>
<P>
Pippen said: "I know my opportunity has come to get market
value, but I came here because I want to see the future of the
game enhanced. I think their upsets a lot of us, especially the
free agents."
</P>
<P>
Charles Barkley said: "I thought Karl Malone was the best
speaker. He gave a very impassioned plea, a great plea for us to
stick together. We do want to play. We feel bad for the fans and
the players, but that's it. We don't feel bad for the owners."
</P>
<P>
David Robinson admitted that he was unwilling to sacrifice
paychecks for a union at first, but this show of force convinced
that the players are together.
</P>
<P>
Malone said: "I bought into everything that management was
telling me. But when I saw for myself, I changed. I'm a man and I
admit I didn't pay attention in the beginning, but I've turned
around."
</P>
<P>
At the end of the meeting today, Jordan said: "In dire need,
what we do is bind together. We believe in the cause, we didn't
start this fight and we have to stand for what we believe in."
</P>
<P>
Baseball union executive director Donald Fehr and National
Football League union head Gene Upshaw also made speech in the
meeting.

the charter issue has been reached.
</P>
<P>
However, White House spokesman Joe Lockhart told reporters at
the media center at the Wye Plantation, Maryland, that "there was
no agreement on that issue."
</P>
<P>
The dispute almost made the whole summit fail on Wednesday
night after Israel threatened to walk out of the summit unless
Palestine met its demand.
</P>
<P>
Despite the new progress, the two sides still differ on the
release of Palestinian prisoners by Israel and the safe passage
between Gaza Strip and the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the afternoon, both the Israelis and Palestinians
said that they are edging towards a land-for-security agreement.
</P>
<P>
A Palestinian official said that the deal could be reached as
early as Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
The critical agreement the Palestinian charter was reached
after U.S. President Bill Clinton pushed the talks in a full gear
for the whole day at the plantation.
</P>
<P>
Clinton had separate talks with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and later joined a
crucial meeting between the two leaders.
</P>
<P>
King Hussein of Jordan also flew to the secluded summit site,
which is 110 kilometers east of Washington.

<HEADLINE> Thai Economic Growth Tipped to Fall 8 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's 1998 exports growth
is expected to fall below the projected 3 percent year-on-year,
which could lead the entire economy to contract by 8 percent from
a previous prediction of 7 percent this year, according to
Kiettisak Meecharoen, Bank of Thailand assistant governor.
</P>
<P>
Kiettisak attributed the decline to external factors. He was
quoted Friday by The Nation as saying Thursday that Thailand's
major trading partners were suffering from their own economic
difficulties, and the purchasing power in those markets had also
dropped markedly.
</P>
<P>
In addition, local exporters have had to cut their prices
sharply in the midst of fierce competition in the world market.
Thus, despite a greater volume of exports, the combined value has
fallen.
</P>
<P>
Exports helped fuel Thailand's remarkable economic growth
during the boom. Amid the economic crisis, the Thai government
still has high hopes that exports will play a major role in
pulling the economy out of the doldrums due mainly to the huge
contraction in demand in the domestic market. Moreover, supply
will accordingly shrink in line with falling demand because of a
sharp slowdown in private investment and production.

<HEADLINE> No More Free Ride for China's Civil Servants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 23 (Xinhua) -- China's civil servants will no
longer be entitled to free automobile use as of January 1,
according to a draft of a State Council program, "Beijing Morning
Post" reports today.
</P>
<P>
The program, which is subject to approval of the State Council,
is intended to cut government expenditures and will provide civil
servants with travel subsidies instead of the use of a free
car. The subsidy ranges from 100 yuan (about 12 U.S. dollars) to
3,000 yuan (360 dollars) depending on the person's rank.
</P>
<P>
All civil servants except those above ministry level are
affected by the reform which touches offices of the Communist
Party of China Central Committee, some nongovernmental groups, and
State Council work units.
</P>
<P>
Officials will have to select their method of transportation
and pay for it themselves when on public business. And cars that
are owned by work units are going to be sold or auctioned off and
drivers will be transferred to other jobs or seek other employment
on a voluntary basis. Some commuter bus services for ordinary
workers will also be canceled.
</P>
<P>
The city of Daqing in Heilongjiang Province and Shenzhen, the
bustling city bordering the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region, had already carried out similar reforms before the program
was worked out. Daqing started the new system earlier this year,
and is expected to cut annual expenditures by 59 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
At present, all Party and government offices and work units have
their own fleets of cars or buses, and officials and staff members
can use them free of charge.

<P>
MEXICO CITY, October 22 (Xinhua) -- A Mexican senator Thursday
hailed a decision of the Texas Natural Resources Conservation
Commission not to issue a permit for a proposed radioactive waste
dumping near the U.S.-Mexican border.
</P>
<P>
Luis Hector Alvares, President of the Senate Environment
Commission, said the cancellation of the Sierra Blanca project
"sets a precedent for future situations in which the Mexican
government and the Congress will present their disagreement in
time."
</P>
<P>
The legislator called it "a triumph, that shows when public
opinion gets together to achieve a goal it gets good results."
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the Texas state commission refused to issue a
permit for a proposed radioactive waste dumping near the Mexican
border, citing concern about a geologic fault line that runs
beneath the site.
</P>
<P>
The Texas Natural Resources Conservation Conservation
Commission voted 3-0 against the project.
</P>
<P>
The project was to be located in rural Sierra Blanca, about 25
kilometers from the Mexican border.

<HEADLINE> 7 Killed by Typhoon Babs in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 23 (Xinhua) -- More than seven people have been
killed by typhoon Babs (locally named Loleng) which is lashing the
Philippines, Philippine Daily Inquirer reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The report said the typhoon was on its way to central and
northern Luzon, the northern Philippines, from the central part of
the country where it has left a wide trail of destruction,
particularly in agriculture and infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
The report said at least seven people have been drowned in
floods or buried alive in landslides caused by the typhoon while
some 200,000 people living in low-lying areas have been forced to
leave their homes to safe grounds.
</P>
<P>
The typhoon flattened thousands of houses, knocked down power
and telephone lines and stranded thousands of commuters, it said.
</P>
<P>
Due to the typhoon, Manila has come to a standstill since
Thursday. Trading in the stock and foreign exchange markets were
suspended while schools and government offices closed.
</P>
<P>
At Manila Airport, some domestic and international flights were
canceled, rescheduled or delayed due to the typhoon on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Philippine President Joseph Estrada has declared three
provinces and one city as calamity areas and ordered the immediate
release of some 2 million pesos (about 46,838 U.S. dollars) to
these areas.
</P>
<P>
According to the weatherman, the typhoon is moving northwest to
slam central and northern Luzon Friday, but its strength will
weaken to 80 kilometers per hour from 185 kilometers per hour.
</P>
<P>
Babs is the second to hit the country in a week and the ninth
so far this year.
</P>
<P>
Last week, supertyphoon Zab crossed the country, leaving 86
people dead and a heavy financial loss of 1 billion pesos (about
23 million dollars).

<HEADLINE> Brazilian Trade Deficit Down 34 Percent in Nine Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, October 22 (Xinhua) -- The Brazilian trade deficit
amounted to 3.811 billion U.S. dollars in the first nine months of
this year, a 34 percent drop from the same period of 1997,
Mauricio Cortes, Foreign Trade Secretary for the Industry,
Commerce and Tourism Ministry of Brazil announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The trade deficit for the first three quarters came as a result
of exports of 39.46 billion dollars and imports of 43.271 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Cortes said Brazil had its biggest single-month trade deficit
of this year in September which stood at 801 million dollars
because of the international financial crisis that affected
Brazilian exports and also because of more anticipated imports.
</P>
<P>
Estimates show that the Brazilian trade deficit for the whole
of this year will amount to between five and six billion dollars
compared with 8.372 billion dollars for 1997.

QUITO, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Ecuador's state oil company
Petroecuador announced Thursday that it expects a "new oil boom"
in the country.
</P>
<P>
Petroecuador executive president Ramiro Gordillo told reporters
that the country's oil output will increase to 705,000 barrels per
day in 2003, which is 300,000 barrels more than the present level,
or more than three times the figure in 1973.
</P>
<P>
He said the state company plans to construct a new oil
pipeline, sell new oil fields, modernize refining plants and
conduct studies to increase crude reserves.
</P>
<P>
It is planned that 3-3.5 billion U.S. dollars will be invested
in the next three years to start the program and private companies
will provide the bulk of the needed funding.
</P>
<P>
An investment of 466 million dollars is foreseen for the
construction of a new oil pipeline, which will run parallel to the
existing one that goes from the Amazonian oil fields to the ports
of shipping in the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
The new oil pipeline is expected to operate in the first
quarter of 2001.
</P>
<P>
Gordillo said that at least five of the oil fields will be

<TEXT>
<P>
QUFU, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Many descendants of Confucius, the
great educator and philosopher who lived more than 2,500 years
ago, are involved in commercial activities today, something that
seems to conflict with Confucianism and its place in Chinese
culture.
</P>
<P>
Confucius' thought places priority on culture and restrains
commerce as a result of the small-scale farming of the time,
explains Kong Xiangjin, a member of the 75th generation of the
Confucius family.
</P>
<P>
"If Confucius were alive today, he would probably value the
development of commerce and market economy trends in the country,"
Kong added.
</P>
<P>
Kong is an official in charge of the tourism industry in the
city of Qufu in Shandong Province, the home of Confucius, and has
the same surname as the philosopher. For the past several years,
Kong has spent more than 40 million yuan on publicity in many
countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
More than 2.48 million tourists visited Qufu last year,
compared to just a few thousand in the 1980s and tourism accounts
for at least 10 percent of the city's GDP.
</P>
<P>
A fifth, or 130,000 of the residents in Qufu have the family
name Kong, hence the a local saying -- "A village can not be a
village without the Kong family, a banquet can not be held without
the Kong family."
</P>
<P>
Many of Confucius' descendants have seen the value of the
family name and have used it on advertisements and for brand
names. About 10 percent of Qufu's 1,900 enterprises have names
related to Confucius. These enterprises account for 40 percent of
the city's industrial output and 50 percent of its profit.
</P>
<P>
Kong Chao, vice-chairman of the Confucius Family Jia Liquor
Co., is an old hand at linking products with the family name. Even
the company's trademark and package design embody Confucian
thought and its exports have been ahead of similar Chinese
products for several consecutive years.

<P>
Using the name has not been easy for some of the descendants
because some people think that naming products after Confucius is
blasphemy, but the Kongs maintain that their actions show a kind
of respect for their ancestor.
</P>
<P>
"Using the name to serve today's economic development is, on
the one hand, to plumb the depth's of Confucian culture, and on
the other, to carry on the thought of Confucius," said Kong Chao.
</P>
<P>
Wang Kexiao, deputy mayor of Qufu, said that Qufu was a
traditional farming area for a long period of time with Confucian
thought restraining commerce. For many years, the local people
placed greater importance on educating their children, and
commercial activities were mostly done by outsiders.
</P>
<P>
And, Wang went on, it is only in the past 20 years that Qufu
has formed its own industrial system and great changes have taken
place with many of Confucius' descendants applying Confucian
thought to business.
</P>
<P>
Inspired by Confucian ideas of benevolence, the Confucius
Family Jia Liquor Co. has developed a spirit of "being honest and
credible, hard-working, living in harmony, and family-centered."

Sino-German joint venture, have introduced the Confucian idea of
"rule by virtue and humane government" as a guide to their
actions. The company's leaders have worked 12-hour a day for
years, but their income is lower than that of their staff,
something that has greatly encouraged staff to work.

<HEADLINE> Report: 13 Percent Black Men Cannot Vote for Felony </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Approximately 13 percent of
black men are not allowed to vote in the November 3 elections in
the United States because they are convicted felons, a report
released Thursday said.
</P>
<P>
Some of those 1.4 million black men are in prison, others are
on probation or parole or have served their sentences, said the
report by Human Rights Watch and The Sentencing Project.
</P>
<P>
Nationwide, 3.9 million people, or one in 50 adults, are
temporarily or permanently disenfranchised because of a felony
conviction, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Their state-by-state survey of voting laws for felons shows the
greatest percentages of disenfranchised black men are in Alabama
and Florida, where one in three cannot vote.
</P>
<P>
Laws on voting rights for criminals differ among the states.
All but four -- Maine, Vermont, Massachusetts and Utah -- bar
prisoners from voting. Other states suspend voting rights until a
felon has completed probation or parole.
</P>
<P>
Fourteen states take away some or all felons' voting rights
permanently: Alabama, Arizona, Delaware, Florida, Iowa, Kentucky,
Maryland, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Mexico, Tennessee, Virginia,
Washington and Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
In Texas, voting rights are suspended for two years after a
sentence is completed.

<HEADLINE> Griffith Joyner's Death Blamed on Seizure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Olympic triple gold
medalist Florence Griffith Joyner of the United States suffocated
during an epileptic seizure in her sleep, and that is the reason
to cause her death on September 21, authorities announced in
California on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Lt. Frank Fitzpatrick said toxicology tests showed she had
taken Tylenol and Benadryl, but "there was nothing unusual in
terms of drugs."
</P>
<P>
Some scientists said at a news conference that her heart
appeared to be normal.
</P>
<P>
The 38-year-old Griffith Joyner died at her home during a
sleep, and investigators had been trying since then to determine
the exact cause.
</P>
<P>
Griffith Joyner, known as FloJo, set fabulous world records
for the women's 100 and 200 meters at the 1988 Seoul Olympics.
Her 10.49 second clocking for the 100 meters was so fast that
many people thought her performance might be aided by banned
drugs.
</P>
<P>
She retired after the Olympics, but the rumors tortured her in
the past decade.
</P>
<P>
Griffith Joyner had been shadowed through her career by
speculation about use of performance-enhancing substances, but
she never failed a drug test and denied ever using drugs.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Riot Team Delays Presentation of Findings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 23 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian
government-sponsored fact-finding team investigating the May riots
has postponed the release of its final report, due to be announced
Friday, until next week, national newspapers Friday quoted the
team leader as saying.
</P>
<P>
The delay was due to an internal debate on the recommendations
to be made to six government representatives, the Joint
Fact-Finding Team leader Marzuki Darusman said.
</P>
<P>
The 18-member team was formed on July 23 under a joint
agreement between five ministries and the Attorney General's
Office. It was entrusted with the task of investigating and, if
possible, unveiling the instigators and perpetrators of the riots,
which some say were organized.
</P>
<P>
The team is also investigating claims made by human rights
groups that there were rampant sexual assaults and rapes during
the riots which killed 1,200 people and led to the downfall of
former president Soeharto.
</P>
<P>
Marzuki admitted that political problems were partly
responsible for the postponed release of the report on the mass
riots.
</P>
<P>
"Obviously the formulation process led to a debate. It's
certainly something which is quite natural in a mixed group like
this team. Most importantly though, in order to produce an
objective result, objectivity of the team has to be based on
consensus. Therefore, consensus for the recommendations depended
on the objectivity of the reports," he said.
</P>
<P>
But Marzuki said the report will be impartial and truthful,
adding it would reveal all the facts.
</P>
<P>
"I think the report will generally reflect the public's general
knowledge of what actually happened during the May riots," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Asked if the team identified a specific unit within the Armed
Forces responsible for the riots, Marzuki said, "I am not in a
position to specify anything at this moment ... because the
overall assessment of the report is to come out with a balanced
picture of the whole event."
</P>
<P>
Armed Forces Chief General Wiranto recently acknowledged that
elements of the military were involved in the violence, but
refused to name perpetrators.
</P>
<P>
Hinting that some members of the fact-finding team may not want
the truth to be revealed, Marzuki would not rule out the
possibility of some members refusing to sign the final report.
</P>
<P>
"We hope to avoid any conflicting views ... We do not foresee
it from happening but we do not rule it out ... because this
team's members are independent," he said.
</P>
<P>
With President B.J. Habibie's official acknowledgment that
rapes and sexual assaults occurred during the May riots, Marzuki
said the facts surrounding the rapes should not be disputed.

<HEADLINE> Sichuan Plans Tree Planting to Repair Environmental Damage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Sichuan Province in southwest
China has decided to plant trees on 770,000 hectares of farmland
to repair the damaged environment and stop soil erosion, the
Provincial Forestry Bureau said today.
</P>
<P>
The return-to-forests program will begin next year and be
completed by 2008, planting 70,000 hectares of trees each year
along the banks of major rivers like the Yangtze, Jinsha, and Min,
according to a bureau official.
</P>
<P>
Because of massive logging and land reclamation schemes over
the past several decades, Sichuan suffers from serious soil
erosion problems, causing heavy silting in rivers, with 43 percent
of the earth entering the Yangtze each year from the Jinsha, the
province's major river. The Yangtze in turn carries as much as 600
million tons of earth annually into reservoir areas of the
Three-Gorges Dam, China's massive hydro-electric power project now
under construction.
</P>
<P>
Soil erosion has affected 34 percent of the land in western
Sichuan and is growing at a rate of 2,000 hectares annually.
</P>
<P>
The devastating floods on the Yangtze this summer prompted the
Chinese government to take action to protect the environment.
</P>
<P>
On September 1, Sichuan began a natural forest protection
project and banned all logging of natural forests a month later.

<HEADLINE> Israel, Palestine Agree on Changing Palestine's Charter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Israel Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat reached
agreement Thursday on revising anti-Israel provisions in the
Palestinian charter.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the Palestinian National Council (PNC)
would meet with other Palestinian groups and take formal action to
annul clauses of the 1964 document that promotes Israel's
dismantling as a Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
Palestine had insisted that the provisions were canceled in
1996 and it is unnecessary to reconvene the PNC, whose 700 members
are living in exile.
</P>
<P>
The dispute almost made the whole summit fail on Wednesday
night after Israel threatened to walk out of the summit unless
Palestine met its demand.
</P>
<P>
Despite the new progress, the two sides still differ on the
release of Palestinian prisoners by Israel and the safe passage
between Gaza Strip and the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the afternoon, both the Israelis and Palestinians
said that they are edging towards a land-for-security agreement.
</P>
<P>
A Palestinian official said that the deal could be reached as
early as Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
The critical agreement the Palestinian charter was reached
after U.S. President Bill Clinton pushed the talks in a full gear
for the whole day in the Wye Plantation, Maryland.
</P>
<P>
Clinton had separate talks with Netanyahu and Arafat and later
joined a crucial meeting between the two leaders.
</P>
<P>
King Hussein of Jordan also flew to the secluded summit site,
which is 110 kilometers east of Washington.
</P>
<P>
While the three leaders talked, the Israeli and Palestinian
delegations worked on the text of a possible agreement in case
Arafat and Netanyahu are able to reach an accord.
</P>
<P>
Describing the talks, White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said
that the atmosphere was "cordial and businesslike."
</P>
<P>
"The hardest decisions, now, at last, are on the table.
Israel, the Palestinians, the region and the world have very much
at stake today," Clinton told reporters before boarding a
helicopter in Washington for the Wye Plantation earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
"I hope the parties will seize this opportunity, and not
retreat from the clear moment to capture the momentum of peace and
keep it moving forward," Clinton said.
