<HEADLINE> S. Africa Dissatisfied With European Council Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 27 (Xinhua) -- The South African
government is extremely dissatisfied with the European Council's
failure to agree on a mandate to negotiate a free trade deal with
South Africa.
</P>
<P>
This was expressed by South African Trade and Industry
Minister Trevor Manuel today.
</P>
<P>
European Union (EU) foreign ministers failed for the third
time yesterday to agree on a mandate after france insisted
sensitive farm products be excluded from the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
"The continued delay and apparent stonewalling by individual
member states serves only to perpetuate the discrimination by the
EU against South African goods and services," said the minister.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that france was worried that dropping trade
barriers would expose its farmers to too much competition, but it
had not specified what products it wanted to add to an EU "black
list".
</P>
<P>
The black list has already set out about 20 agricultural
products, including wine, apples and flowers, that may be
excluded from the free trade talks.

<P>
MAPUTO, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Maputo saw an average of 330
malaria patients go to hospital every day, announced the health
authority of the Mozambican capital here today.
</P>
<P>
It said the number of malaria patients were tripled in
February compared to that of last December.
</P>
<P>
Maputo's suburban areas were stricken with malaria following
days of torrential rains which fostered the breeding of
mosquitos, carriers of the disease.
</P>
<P>
Long queues of malaria patients were seen everywhere in the
hospitals and clinics of Maputo, waiting to be cured. Most of
them were children.
</P>
<P>
The Mozambican health authority has called for the citizens to
wage a campaign against the mosquitos to reduce the disease.

<HEADLINE> S.Africa Committed to African Peace, Says Nzo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 28 (Xinhua) -- South Africa is
committed to helping prevent and manage African conflicts in
order to create a stable and secure continent.
</P>
<P>
The commitment was made by South African Foreign Minister
Alfred Nzo today while addressing the Council of Ministers
meeting of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) in Addis
Ababa, Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
Nzo said South Africa's acceptance internationally had brought
with it numerous demands and the country did not have the
resources to meet many of these.
</P>
<P>
Nzo said South Africa had contributed 1.2 million Rand (about
330,000 US dollar) to the OAU Peace Fund on February 16 and
volunteered 28 million Rand (about 7.67 million US dollar) for
the quartering of the former anti-government rebels in Angola.
</P>
<P>
"As a gesture of our appreciation for the passing of an United
Nations resolution absolving us from paying arrears, we announce
our readiness to make a substantial financial contribution
towards peace-keeping in Africa," added the Minister.
</P>
<P>
The UN General Assembly adopted a resolution late last year to
write off South Africa's accumulated debt of about 94 million US
dollar.
</P>
<P>
South Africa will hold a UN Trade and Development Conference
in April and has expressed its willingness to host a meeting of
African Ministers of Education in the second half of the year.

<HEADLINE> Thailand, Colombia Join WTO Telecom Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Thailand and Colombia today
became full participants in the World Trade Organization (WTO)
negotiations on a global deal to open up telecommunication
markets, the WTO announced today.
</P>
<P>
WTO spokesman Nuzrat Nazeer said that the participation of
Thailand and Colombia brings the total of full participants in the
telecom negotiations to 50, representing about 90 percent of
global revenue for telecommunications which was estimated at 513
billion U.S. dollars in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Trade officials of Thailand told a formal meeting of the WTO
telecom negotiating group today that Thailand is going to put
forward its initial market-opening offer as soon as possible.
Colombia said its offer could be submitted in the next few days.
</P>
<P>
Four more countries, Israel, Brazil, Poland and Mauritius, have
tabled their liberalization offers earlier this week, bringing the
total number of offers to 23. More offers or improved offers are
expected to come by March.
</P>
<P>
As in all WTO trade negotiations, initial offers submitted by
negotiators serve only as a basis for bargaining. They are subject
to revision and even withdrawal, depending on the quality of
offers from their negotiating partners. The offers could become
binding only when a deal is finally reached.
</P>
<P>
Although the increases in the number of participants and offers
submitted are interpreted as positive signs for progress in the
WTO telecom negotiations which began in May 1994, negotiators said
they are not sure yet whether a deal could be reached by the April
30 deadline. "There is no breakthrough yet," one trade official
said.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese delegate expressed at the meeting today his "mixed
feeling" about the progress of a new round of bilateral
discussions which began Monday. He said he is encouraged by the
offers introduced this week but discouraged by the fact that there
are still 25 countries remaining as observers and thus less
committed to the process.
</P>
<P>
He argued, "participation in the negotiations does not mean an
obligation to liberalize markets overnight."
</P>
<P>
A European Union representative at the meeting said he sensed
"a mood moving towards effective negotiations" this week. But a
large number of concerns still remain, he added.
</P>
<P>
He also indicated that the EU is prepared to consider further
improvement of its offer at the request of its trading partners in
the bilateral negotiations.
</P>
<P>
While the developed countries have been keeping asking the
developing countries to make more efforts to open their telecom
markets, the so-called Quad group, the U.S, the EU, Japan and
Canada, hasn't agreed on the terms of a market opening among
themselves.
</P>
<P>
Japan and Canada, for example, are offering less than the
others want, trade officials close to the talks said.
</P>
<P>
Also speaking at the meeting today, a U.S. official said
creative and innovative work is coming from developing countries.
"We look forward to similar creative and innovative solution from
the developed countries," he added.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Wants Collective Presidency To Stop Violence In Liberia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 28 (Xinhua) -- The United States today urged
the Monrovia authority to stop continuing violence that was
impeding the peace process in the west African state of Liberia.
</P>
<P>
"Continuing violence in some areas of the country, most
recently in the southeast, was a serious impediment to getting
momentum back into the peace process," said Chief of the U.S.
Mission in Liberia, William Milan, according to a news dispatch
from Monrovia.
</P>
<P>
"It is essential that the faction leaders in the Council of
State, move urgently to stop such violence, wherever it occurs,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. envoy also called on the faction leaders "to restrain
fighters from harassing those courageous folks who deliver
humanitarian assistance to stricken Liberians".
</P>
<P>
Milan expressed confidence in the West African peace-keeping
force in liberia known as ECOMOG, which was sent in August 1990
by the Economic Community of West African States to help stop
the six-year old war.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG, with its mission to disarm some 60,000 fighters of the
armed factions in Liberia, began deployment in mid-December last
year but suspended it three weeks later after attacks on its
positions by a Liberian armed faction in Tubmanburg, a town 60 km
north of Monrovia.
</P>
<P>
The peacekeeping force then described the nine days of
skirmishes in which about 20 peacekeepers were killed as "one of
the most disastrous experiences of the peacekeepers".
</P>
<P>
"Violence against peacekeepers is unacceptable, and the U.S.
deplores the attacks on ECOMOG. We call upon the parties to
ensure this never happens again," said Milan.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. envoy pointed out that disarmament and demobilization
"are necessary to create the conditions that will permit general
elections in Liberia, scheduled for August this year.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Arrives in Cairo for Talks with Mubarak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
arrived here today to meet with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
on the latest developments in the Palestinian self-rule areas of
the Gaza Strip and West Bank.
</P>
<P>
His visit to Egypt came in the wake of two suicide bombing
attacks Sunday in Jerusalem and the Israeli city of Ashkelon,
which killed 25 people and injured some 80 others. Israel sealed
off Gaza and the West Bank following the tragic incidents.
</P>
<P>
Arafat said upon arrival that the closure is a breach to what
has been agreed upon between the Palestinians and Israel.
</P>
<P>
PLO officials in Cairo said Arafat will meet Mubarak Thursday
to seek an end to the closure.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said earlier today that he
will meet with Arafat for talks on Palestinian-Israeli
negotiations and the impact of the Israeli settlement policy on
the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
The PLO Executive Committee, at its latest meeting in the
Egyptian coastal city of El Arish earlier this month, denounced
what it called the "expansionist measures" taken by Israel.
</P>
<P>
The committee accused Israel of trying to expand Jewish
settlements on the Palestinian land under the pretext of building
by-pass roads and other so-called security reasons.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, the first Arab country to make peace with Israel in
1979, has been a key mediator between Israel and the Palestinians.

<HEADLINE> UK Civil Servant Total Falls Below 500,000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 28 (Xinhua) -- The number of permanent civil
servants in Britain has fallen below 500,000 for the first time
since the outbreak of the second world war, according to latest
government figures.
</P>
<P>
At 499,900 on January 1, the total number of permanent civil
servants represented a 5 percent drop than a year ago.
</P>
<P>
However, the tally remains above half a million if the 21,700
casual staff employed by Whitehall departments are included.
</P>
<P>
The decline in civil service numbers follows five years of
government cost-cutting. Staff numbers have fallen by more than 15
percent in the past four years.
</P>
<P>
According to the government target, overall running costs are
to be reduced by a further 12 percent over the next three years,
implying 60,000 further job losses by 1998.

<HEADLINE> Sinn Fein Cautiously Welcomes Anglo-Irish Statement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Sinn Fein President Garry Adams
expressed his cautious welcome to the Anglo-Irish Statement on
Northern Ireland issued this afternoon, which sets June 10 as the
date for all-party talks on the future of the province.
</P>
<P>
According to reports from Belfast, Adams said in a statement
that there was a need for "absolute clarity on all aspects of
these proposals."
</P>
<P>
They had to be assessed on whether they had "an inherent
dynamic to re-establish the peace process," he said.
</P>
<P>
His statement did not mention whether he would make a fresh
approach to the Irish Republican Army (IRA) to revive its
cease-fire bombed apart on February 9.
</P>
<P>
But Sinn Fein's chief negotiator with the British government
Martin McGuinness had promised more than once that he would try to
persuade the IRA to call a new cease-fire if a date for all-party
talks is fixed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Social Democratic and Labor Party (SDLP), the
largest Catholic political party which fervently favors a fixed
date for all-party talks in return for a new IRA cease-fire,
praised the "tenacity" of British Prime Minister John Major and
his Irish counterpart, John Bruton, in their quest for peace in
Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
SDLP deputy leader Seamus Mallon described the Anglo-Irish
joint statement as a "declaration of intent" that the conflict in
Ulster could only be solved by peaceful means.
</P>
<P>
But he warned that the peace process should not be allowed to
become a "pub crawler of pre-conditions."
</P>
<P>
He stressed that no party involved in the peace process should
be allowed to exercise a veto on all-party negotiations.
</P>
<P>
However, Ulster Unionist Party (UUP), the largest Protestant
political party, repeated that it cannot meet face-to-face with
Sinn Fein until it has committed itself to peace.
</P>
<P>
UUP leader David Trimble said that "commitment" must be the
first item to be addressed and resolved in this province.

<HEADLINE> London Rail Link Expansion Approved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 28 (Xinhua) -- The British government Tuesday
gave the go-ahead for a largely private-sector funded program to
quadruple rail transport through the City of London.
</P>
<P>
Financial Times reported today that the long-awaited approval
for Thameslink 2000, which will expand north-south rail links
through London, was given after Railtrack, the network company
soon to be privatized, agreed to shoulder 550 million pounds (825
million U.S. dollars) of the total 650 million pounds costs.
</P>
<P>
Transport officials said the Thameslink project, where
government spending would be limited to 100 million pounds (150
million U.S. dollars), was a model of how large schemes would be
managed in the privatized rail network.
</P>
<P>
The final approval of the project, five years after the idea
was first put forward, was welcomed by both the City and Labor
MPs.
</P>
<P>
The project will give a boost to rail connections in the
southeast of England and increase the number of cross-capital
train services from six to 24 an hour.
</P>
<P>
George Young, transport secretary, said, "Thameslink 2000
will be a valuable addition to London's infrastructure,
complementing the Channel Tunnel rail link, providing new service
opportunities for train operators and additional capacity for
commuters into London."

<HEADLINE> Canada Defends Duties on Dairy Products </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, February 27 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian government has
said that it does nothing wrong in applying high tariffs on dairy
products, poultry and eggs.
</P>
<P>
In its formal response to the U.S. government's challenge of
Canadian dairy tariffs, Canada argued that the North American Free
Trade Agreement (NAFTA) gave it the right to exempt part of its
farming sector from the new trade rules.
</P>
<P>
In January 1995, Canada converted import quotas on dairy, egg
and poultry products to tariffs as high as 351 percent to comply
with new international trading rules under the World Trade
Organization.
</P>
<P>
But the U.S. has claimed the duties are illegal under the NAFTA
and has formally complained to a NAFTA trade dispute panel.
</P>
<P>
"The fundamental question to be decided in this case is whether
the United States can secure through the NAFTA dispute settlement
something which it and Canada did not bargain through eight years
of bilateral, trilateral and multilateral trade negotiations and
three trade agreements," said the Canadian response.
</P>
<P>
A five-member binational panel under the NAFTA is expected to
rule on the dispute in June, Canadian newspapers reported today.
</P>
<P>
A loss for Canada would cost 27,000 jobs and over 2 billion
U.S. dollars in economic output each year, and would result in as
much as 1 billion dollars in new U.S. dairy exports to Canada and
as much as 300 million dollars in U.S. export of chicken products.

<HEADLINE> UK Sets to Relax Gaming Industry Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 28 (Xinhua) -- The biggest changes in nearly
30 years to British laws governing the multi-billion pounds
gambling business were announced by the UK government Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The announcement came after complaints that the gaming industry
is treated differently to the National Lottery.
</P>
<P>
A consultative paper from the Home Office proposes to relax the
rules brought in to help stamp out mafia-type infiltration of
gambling clubs in the 1960s in order to strengthen London's
competitive position against emerging gaming centers in Western
Europe and the former Communist countries.
</P>
<P>
The widespread deregulation announced by the Home Office
includes 13 new locations for casinos, halving of the 48-hour
waiting period for membership of casinos, the removal of
advertising restrictions on bingo, extended licensing hours for
drinks in casinos and the use of debit cards in both casinos and
bingo clubs.
</P>
<P>
These changes would provide opportunities for the industry and
consumers while maintaining effective regulation of gaming, the
Home Office said.
</P>
<P>
"This is a balanced package of reform which will update legal
controls which go back more than 25 years whilst maintaining
effective regulation," it added.
</P>
<P>
The measures were welcomed by the industry, which has been busy
lobbying and has been expecting the consultation paper for almost
a year.
</P>
<P>
The industry has until May 31 to respond to the consultation
document. Most of the proposals will be implemented this year,
according to the Home Office.

<HEADLINE> Scientists: Good Habits, Key to Healthy Old Age </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Genetics play greatest role
in health characteristics early in life. But by old age, for many
characteristics there is hardly any genetic influence left,
American scientists said.
</P>
<P>
The scientists at the MacArthur Foundation Consortium on
Successful Aging launched in 1995 a joint project among several
universities and hospitals to study an often-outlooked segment of
the elderly population: those who enter their eighth decade
healthy and independent.
</P>
<P>
To their surprise, the researchers found that not only that
most old people are doing well physically and mentally but also
that much can be done to foster a healthy and productive old age
in the millions of Americans.
</P>
<P>
They attributed their successful aging to several factors --
regular physical activity, continued social connections,
resiliency.
</P>
<P>
The researchers also emphasized that society has a crucial role
in helping older people achieve healthy old age. By promoting
social engagement instead of isolating or ignoring the elderly,
much could be done to enhance physical and intellectual abilities
in later life.
</P>
<P>
"People are largely responsible for their own old age," Dr.
John W. Rowe, director of the MacArthur Foundation Consortium on
Successful Aging, concluded. So he advised old people to stay
active both physically and socially.

<HEADLINE> AT&AMP;T Offers Free Internet Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, February 28 (Xinhua) -- AT&AMP;T Corp. is extending its
service network to Internet business, a virtually virgin land for
the telecommunications giant.
</P>
<P>
As a special gift, it plans to offer its long-distance
customers with a five-hour free access to the global data network
each month. The service will be available from March 14 and will
last 12 months.
</P>
<P>
After the first five hours, customers will be billed at 2.5
U.S. dollars per hour, according to a news release of the company.
</P>
<P>
Regular customers said they use more than five hours a month on
Internet. So the country's leading long-distance carrier has a
second offer: 20 U.S. dollars per month for unlimited access for
its long-distance customers, or 25 U.S. dollars per month for
non-AT&AMP;T customers.
</P>
<P>
Market analysts said the move represents a price challenge to
other companies, which generally start with monthly charges of
five U.S. dollars to 10 U.S. dollars for the first few hours and
can range to many times for heavy users.
</P>
<P>
AT&AMP;T said it will also provide free software for the Internet
which allows parents to block access to portions of the Internet
they regard as unsuitable for their children.
</P>
<P>
MCI Communications Corp., the other major long-distance
firm, has offered Internet service for 18 months. It charges 20
U.S. dollars for 20 hours of use each month, according to a
marketing official of the company.

<HEADLINE> EC Promotes World Rules on Trade, Environment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Brussels, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Open trade and environment
protection can and should work hand in hand and they can be
mutually supportive, the European Commission (EC) said in a
document launched today to the Council of Ministers.
</P>
<P>
The wide-ranging Communication on Trade and Environment
explained the relationship between trade liberalization and
environmental protection measures, their impact on competitiveness
and the best ways to achieve a balance between the two, while
looking at "the special needs of developing countries."
</P>
<P>
The document stated that trade allowed for a more efficient use
of natural resources as well as "encouraging the burgeoning market
for green technology and eco-friendly consumer goods to flourish."
</P>
<P>
It said that trade gave developed and developing countries
alike greater export earnings with which to finance more
environmentally sustainable economic policies.
</P>
<P>
The communication stressed, "Clear rules are needed to prevent
trade friction and to avoid countries resorting to unilateral
restrictions."
</P>
<P>
"Environmental measures must be proportionate, transparent and
non-discriminatory," it said, "and imports should not be penalized
through eco-duties and other such instruments."
</P>
<P>
The EC also emphasized that environmental measures should be
crafted so as "to avoid jeopardizing the growth and export
prospects of developing countries or economies in transition."

<P>
NICOSIA, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Health standards in Cyprus
are considered to be high and compare favorably to those of
developed countries, according to the 1994 Health and Hospital
Statistics published recently by the Department of Statistics and
Research.
</P>
<P>
As statistics show, during the period 1992-1993 infant

females.
</P>
<P>
Expenditure on health services during 1993 is estimated at

of which 93.6 million represent expenditure of the private sector
and 55.2 million of the public sector.
</P>

The share of expenditure on health as a percentage to Gross
National Produce (GNP) increased from 2.7 percent in 1980 to 4.5
per cent in 1993.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 28 (Xinhua) -- An Anglo-Irish statement on the
Northern Ireland peace process issued this afternoon provides for
a "balanced approach" to peace, British Prime Minister John Major
told parliament.
</P>
<P>
After a three-hour summit with his Irish counterpart, John
Bruton, on Ulster, Major told the House of Commons that elections
in Northern Ireland to choose delegates to the planned all-party
talks on June 10 were the most "viable and direct" route to peace
in the troubled province, according to a BBC TV report.
</P>
<P>
But the prime minister also admitted that some issues,
including the role of the elected body, still had to be resolved.
</P>
<P>
Major reminded the parliament members that the road to peace
"would be long and stony."
</P>
<P>
"The men of violence will not give up lightly," he warned.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Fulfills Most Economic Criteria of MT, Says Bank Chairman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus' economic achievement
is comparable to that of many European countries and the per
capita income is estimated at 13,500 U.S. dollars, according to a
leading Cypriot economist.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Greece's financial review "Economikos
Tachydromos", which was carried by Cyprus News Agency today,
Solon Triantafyllides, Chairman of the Bank of Cyprus (BOC),
said that Cyprus has fulfilled most economic criteria of the
Maastricht Treaty (MT).
</P>
<P>
"The only criterion Cyprus does not (has not fulfilled) fulfill
so far is that governing interest rates, whose ceiling is
determined by law," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Describing economic developments as "generally very
satisfactory," Triantafyllides said possible membership of the
European Union (EU) would not affect the economy in an adverse
manner.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus applied for full EU membership in July 1990. The
EU Council of Ministers decided on March 6, 1995, to start
accession talks with Cyprus six months after the end of the
EU's 1996 Intergovernmental Conference.
</P>
<P>
According to the BOC Chairman, the rate of economic growth in
1995 was five percent compared with three percent in EU countries
and in the U.S..
</P>
<P>
Unemployment was around 2.6 percent, a figure much lower than
European and American indicators.
</P>
<P>
Triantafyllides said inflation stands at 2.6 percent, public
deficit amounts to 1.3 percent of the Gross Domestic Product and
public debt is about 54 percent of the GDP.
</P>
<P>
"These achievements are even more significant if one takes
into account that most EU members do not fulfill the
Maastricht criteria on public deficit and public debt. only
Germany and Luxembourg comply fully with all the Maastricht
criteria," the bank Chairman said.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Workers Unions Determined to Stage Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, February 28 (Xinhua) -- In spite of a government
decision to enforce a ban on demonstrations, the Lebanese
General Workers Confederation (GWC) announced this afternoon its
determination to stage a strike and demonstrations Thursday.
</P>
<P>
At the end of a meeting of the GWC's Executive Committee,
President of the confederation Elias Abu Rizk read out a
statement, stressing that the workers stick to all their
rights, including the rights of strike, demonstration and
sit-in.
</P>
<P>
He said that his confederation holds the government
responsible for any negative results, no matter what kind it might
be, and asked the national army to safeguard the natural rights
of the workers to strike and demonstrate.
</P>
<P>
"The General Workers Confederation, which always desires the
security, the stability and the general order, and which will
remain conscious of its principles and its slogans, and its
adherence to the general freedom and democracy, makes this
appeal to all those standard, and are still standing on its
side every day," Abu Rizk said in the statement.
</P>
<P>
"And it announces its adherence to an implementation of the
decision on the strike and general demonstrations, and an
execution of the demonstrations on the day of tomorrow,
February 29, in the same places which it defined in its
previous statement, namely Beirut, Saida, Sour, Nabatiyeh, Zahle,
Baalbek, Tripoli and Ajalton."
</P>
<P>
"And it calls again on the lebanese workers, and various
political forces of parliamentary members, political parties and
personalities ... to participate in the demonstrations on all the
lebanese lands," the statement declared.
</P>
<P>
After an extraordinary session of the cabinet Tuesday,
Prime Minister Rafik Al Hariri announced that the Lebanese
army was ordered to maintain security, law and order for the
next three months.
</P>
<P>
Beirut press, including the leading "An-Nahar" daily
and the leftist "As-Safir" daily, described the move as a
"partial declaration of martial law."
</P>
<P>
According to the decision, Lebanon's armed forces, which totals
about 100,000 soldiers and police, have begun deploying
at every corner on the capital streets and in other big
cities where the trade unions planed to stage demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
Hariri said the three-month period may be
extended or cut short, depending on the circumstances as they
develop.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 28 (Xinhua) -- President Nelson Mandela
today met visiting Swedish Parliamentary Speaker Birgitta Dahl at
his official Cape Town residence, thanking Sweden for giving aid
to ANC'S struggle against apartheid.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after the meeting, Mandela said it was
always a privilege to entertain a speaker from a country which
supported the African National Congress (ANC) during the
liberation struggle.
</P>
<P>
Although South Africa has many powerful friends, she will
never forget those who assisted its freedom struggle against
apartheid, said the president.
</P>
<P>
Dahl, who arrived in Cape Town Tuesday, is heading a
high-level Swedish delegation to South Africa at the invitation
of National Assembly Speaker Frene Ginwala.
</P>
<P>
Dahl told reporters that she was moved and encouraged to be in
a democratic South Africa.
</P>
<P>
"Our message is that when we were trying to give support to
the struggle for freedom here we were not only defending the
rights of South Africans, but also our rights," she said.
</P>
<P>
At a joint press conference with Ginwala later in the day,
Dahl said she would like to see increased cooperation between the
two countries' parliaments.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that Sweden was the first country in the
western world to give official assistance to the liberation
struggle in South Africa.

LONDON, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Irish Prime Minister John
Bruton today urged the Irish Republican Army (IRA) to call a new
cease-fire to allow its political wing Sinn Fein to take part in
the planned all-party talks on the future of Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
The Irish leader held the first Anglo-Irish summit with his
British counterpart, John Major, here this afternoon to repair the

Bruton stressed that both the Irish and British people utterly
repudiated the violence campaign launched by the IRA.

had been forced by the resumption of IRA violence into holding
their summit today and announcing the date for all-party
negotiations on the future of Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
He said that the date of June 10 had been set for all-party
talks to start and this would not change, regardless of whether

<HEADLINE> Beijing Edges Liaoning by 19 Points </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Shan Tao hit a season-hight 38
points to pace Beijing over Liaoning 89-70 on Wednesday in the
last second game of the preliminary rounds of Chinese Basketball
league.
</P>
<P>
Shan's layup in the sound of buzzer made Beijing (17-4)
possible to be second place in the top four-team finals.
</P>
<P>
Beijing will meet the Guangdong Hongyuan in its last game of
the 22-round regular season next Wednesday on road in Gongguan,
Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
If it wins, would placed second in the regular season, which
could avoid August First in the first round of the finals.
</P>
<P>
The August First on Wednesday trounced the Vanguards 117-87 at
home in Shanghai to stretch its winning streak to the 21st and
ensured its first place in the regular season with one game
remaining on Sunday when it faces Liaoning.
</P>
<P>
Beijing built a 46-39 lead at halftime after both sides tied
five times in the points at 8-8, 16-16, 18-18, 22-22 and 25-all
with 10 minutes left.
</P>
<P>
Beijing widened its advantage by 12 points, 59-47 with a 12-8
run before Liaoning narrowed the gap by six points 65-71, on Wu
Qinglong's three-pointer with 7:50 to play in the second half.
</P>
<P>
However, Beijing, helped by Shan Tao's eight in the last
minutes, had a 16-5 spur to nail the game.
</P>
<P>
"We played very well in the game, which we thought was the best
one we have played this season," Beijing head Coach Yuan Chao
said. "Liaoning didn't play its own game. It seemed that its
players were not in form tonight.
</P>
<P>
"We will play against the Guangdong Hongyuan, who was always
better at home and is favorable to beat us. But as long as we make
control of the rebounds and play nice defense, we have chance to
win."
</P>
<P>
Li Ge, head coach of Liaoning, admitted that his players were
too relax to clinch the game after it smashed it by 17 points in
their first meeting in Anshan, Liaoning's home arena.
</P>
<P>
In Jinan, Shandong created a season-low halftime record before
it lost to Zhejiang 51-75 at home.
</P>
<P>
Shandong scored just 17 against Zhejiang's 31 points in the
first half. But the defeat didn't effect the Shandong's fifth
place it has set in the regular season with 11-10.
</P>
<P>
"This was our bad game that our players weren't prepared well
and cared for," said Zhao Xuanmin, head coach of Shandong. "We
will do our best in the next game against the Shenyang Army."
</P>
<P>
The Shenyang Army scored a 97-76 home win over Jiangsu in
Tieling, Liaoning Province. However, Hu Weidong highlighted the
game with a season-high 45 points for Jiangsu (6-15), including
eight 3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
In Qingdao, the Jinan Army extended its 46-36 halftime edge to
a 87-78 home victory over the Air Force. Lu Yandong led the
winner with 25 points.
</P>
<P>
In Hefei, the Guangdong Honghuan held off a strong come-back to
down the new-look Nanjing Army 99-94 on road following a 54-44
lead in the first half.
</P>
<P>
The Hongyuan, like Beijing in the team standings, has 17-4
win-loss and has to overcome Beijing next round for third place in
the regular season.

</P>
<P>
The report said SADC and the US signed a memorandum of
understanding at the meeting to provide a framework for
cooperation in the area of trade and investment.
</P>
<P>
It said what made the gaborone meeting more than just a
tentative step was that the US move was steeped in a new policy
initiative on trade and development in Africa, based on a report

<HEADLINE> US Trade Deficit Up to $111 Billion in 1995 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 28 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. trade deficit in
goods and services went up to 111.04 billion U.S. dollars in 1995,
the highest recorded showing in seven years.
</P>
<P>
While the deficit with Japan did shrink for the first time in
four years, the country had record trade gaps with Mexico and
China, according to a report from the Commerce Department today.
</P>
<P>
The report showed that the overall deficit of 111.04 billion
dollars in goods and services was up 4.5 percent from a 1994
imbalance of 106.21 billion dollars. It was the worst showing
since 115.3 billion dollars in 1988.
</P>
<P>
In goods alone, the United States suffered an all-time high
trade gap of 174.47 billion dollars. However, the imbalance was
offset somewhat by a surplus of 63.4 billion dollars in services,
such as tourism and consulting fees.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration claimed that while the trade deficit
for the entire year worsened, the monthly trade performance has
been improving since June and the narrowing trade gap provided one
of the few sources of strength for the overall economy in the
final three months of 1995.
</P>
<P>
The trade balance with Mexico, which had shown a small surplus
of 1.35 billion dollars in 1994, soared to a record deficit of
15.4 billion dollars last year as imports from Mexico surged 24.7
percent while U.S. exports to Mexico fell by 8.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
This sharp reversal has been attributed to the neighboring
country's economic troubles, caused by a sharp devaluation of the
peso in December 1994.
</P>
<P>
The deficit with Japan, which hit a record 65.7 billion dollars
in 1994, declined by 9.7 percent last year to 59.28 billion
dollars. While that was still the highest for trade gap with any
country, it marked the first decline in four years and represented
the first time since 1989 that U.S. imports of Japanese autos
fell.
</P>
<P>
For overall, the U.S. exports rose 13.9 percent to totaling
783.7 billion dollars while imports rose 12.1 percent to 894.7
billion dollars last year.

<HEADLINE> Fiat Chairman Retires After 30 Years at Top </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Italy's top businessman Gianni
Agnelli handed over the chairmanship of the country's biggest
industrial group, Fiat, to Cesare Romiti in Turin today.
</P>
<P>
The 72-year-old Romiti is seen as a powerful interim leader
before a younger member of the Agnelli family can take over the
leadership of the conglomerate, whose interests range from cars to
civil engineering.
</P>
<P>
Agnelli, who took office 30 years ago, announced at a gathering
of Fiat managers in December last year that he would retire when he
turns 75 on March 12, 1996.
</P>
<P>
Romiti came to Fiat in November 1974 and has been managing
director since April 1976. He will also have to retire at 75.
</P>
<P>
Turin's La Stampa newspaper, owned by the Agnellis, said today
that by the time Romiti retires in 1998, Giovanni Alberto,
31-year-old nephew of Agnelli, should be ready to take control.
</P>
<P>
Fiat is one of Europe's largest businesses. Profits for 1995
are expected to reach 1.3 billion U.S. dollars, nearly double the
previous year, when Fiat recovered from a loss of 1.1 billion
dollars in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Romiti's position as managing director will be filled by Paolo
Cantarella, who is in his early fifties and in charge of the
group's car division.

<HEADLINE> China Reaffirms Anti-Doping Stance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Olympic Committee
(COC) reiterated here on Wednesday the principles in the
anti-doping campaign drawn by the relevant international sports
organizations should be firmly implemented around the world.
</P>
<P>
Wei Jizhong, the COC secretary-general, stressed in an
interview with reporters that banned drug using cases should be
dealt with equally.
</P>
<P>
Wei said several positive test cases have been found in such
countries as Australia and the United States since last year.
</P>
<P>
This means that the anti-doping campaign is a long-term,
arduous and complicated task in the international sports
arena, Wei noted.
</P>
<P>
Australian swimmer Samantha Riley tested positive for banned
drugs in the world short course swimming championships last year,
Wei said, adding that she did violate the regulations by the
International Olympic Committee (IOC) and world swimming ruling
body FINA.
</P>
<P>
The COC believed that the case will be handled properly by the
IOC and FINA in line with rules acknowledged by the world, Wei
added.
</P>
<P>
Wei said that the COC will strictly adhere to the rules, which
have been listed as provisions of China's Sports Law with the
approval of The National People's Congress, China's legislature.
</P>
<P>
The COC anti-doping commission stepped up their efforts in
doping test including fly test last year, which involved 2,099
cases, up 48 percent over that in 1994, Wei said.
</P>
<P>
However, Wei said the commission will continue to strengthen
this work in the coming days.

<HEADLINE> US Consumer Prices Up 0.4 Percent in January </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 28 (Xinhua) -- U.S. consumer prices were
up by 0.4 percent in January, the biggest advance in more than two
years, the Labor Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
The increase in its Consumer Price Index (CPI) was the largest
since a similar 0.4 percent gain in October 1993, the department
said.
</P>
<P>
The increase of the CPI in January was led by a 1.9 percent
surge in energy prices, steepest since a 2 percent rise also in
October 1993. It was driven up by demand for energy as a blizzard
hit the country in the month.
</P>
<P>
The fuel oil prices increased by 8.8 percent in January, the
biggest gain since they jumped 12.6 percent in October 1990.
Natural gas costs and gasoline were up 0.6 percent and 3.7 percent
respectively while electricity was down by 0.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
Other components shared in the increase, including apparel and
upkeep, transportation and housing. Food prices, on the other
hand, rose a barely perceptible 0.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
Excluding the volatile food and energy component, the so-called
core CPI was up 0.3 percent, the biggest advance since a 0.3
percent increase last October.
</P>
<P>
Analysts had expected a 0.3 percent advance, driven by surging
energy costs as consumers fought a blizzard in the East and bitter
cold in the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
The Labor Department also reported Tuesday that wholesale
prices in the country rose 0.3 percent in January following a 0.6
percent increase in December. But excluding food and energy
prices, the core index dropped 0.1 percent.

<P>
HARARE, February 28 (Xinhua) -- The government will not
hesitate to introduce stiff penalties for companies that continue
to pollute the environment, Minister of Environment and Tourism
Chindori-Chininga said here today.
</P>
<P>
"If companies do not voluntarily establish procedures for
environmental management and monitoring of industrial pollution,
my ministry will not hesitate to introduce policy measures based
on the notion that polluters of environment must pay, with very
high penalties for offenses," he warned.
</P>
<P>
Urging industries to adopt environmental management as a
corporate goal and social responsibility, he said, "the
environment within which we live and work is the basis of our
survival. If we do not manage and take care of it properly and
efficiently it means we are simply destroying ourselves."

<HEADLINE> U.S. 1995 Trade Deficit Hits Seven-Year High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 28 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. trade deficit in
goods and services rose 4.5 per cent to 111.04 billion dollars in
1995, the worst performance for seven years.
</P>
<P>
Although the deficit with Japan shrank for the first time
in four years, the U.S. chalked up record trade gaps with Mexico and
China, the Commerce Department said today.
</P>
<P>
In goods alone, the United States suffered an all-time high
trade deficit of 174.47 billion dollars. But the imbalance was
offset to some degree by a surplus of 63.4 billion dollars in
services, including tourism.
</P>
<P>
Despite the worsening overall deficit for 1995, the Clinton
administration claims the monthly trade performance has been
improving since June and the narrowing trade gap provided one of
the few areas of strength in the economy in the final quarter of
1995.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. trade balance with Mexico, which showed a surplus
of 1.35 billion dollars in 1994, soared to a record deficit of
15.4 billion dollars last year as imports from Mexico surged 24.7
percent while U.S. exports to Mexico fell by 8.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
This sharp reversal was partly due to the neighboring country's
economic troubles caused by a sharp devaluation of the peso in
December 1994.
</P>
<P>
The deficit with Japan, which hit a record 65.7 billion dollars
in 1994, declined by 9.7 percent last year to 59.28 billion
dollars, marking the first decline in four years.
</P>
<P>
It was also for the first time since 1989 that U.S. imports of
Japanese autos fell. Even so, the imbalance with Japan remains the
highest the U.S. has with any country.
</P>
<P>
Overall U.S. goods imports rose 13.9 percent last year, the
biggest increase since 1988.

<HEADLINE> ICRC Fails to Meet Hostages in Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 28 (Xinhua) -- International Committee of the
Red Cross (ICRC) representatives today failed again in their
efforts to meet the 13 hostages held by the Free Papua Movement
(OPM), in Irian Jaya, Indonesia, for more than seven weeks.
</P>
<P>
The Antara news agency quoted a military source in Wamena as
saying that the OPM refused to let the ICRC meet with the hostages
despite the recent meetings between the ICRC and OPM leaders
Daniel Yudas Kogoya and Kelly Kwalik.
</P>
<P>
The ICRC has been acting as a mediator between the Indonesian
Armed Forces (ABRI) and the OPM kidnappers for the release of the
hostages.
</P>
<P>
The OPM kidnapped 26 people, including seven foreigners who
were on a scientific expedition, in Mapunduma village on January
8. Later, 13 hostages, including a German, were released.
</P>
<P>
The kidnappers demanded the recognition of a West Papua state
in Irian Jaya in return for the release of their captives. The
Indonesian government has rejected the demand.
</P>
<P>
Hopes for the release of hostages were raised after meetings
between the ICRC representatives and OPM leaders, who had hinted
at doing so.
</P>
<P>
However, the hopes dimmed after the OPM leaders said the
decision to release the hostages was in the hand of another senior
OPM leader living in Papua New Guinea.
</P>
<P>
The ICRC asked to meet the hostages to directly observe their
health conditions but the request was turned down by the OPM.
</P>
<P>
Carrying food and medicine, ICRC representatives flew every
morning to the location around an OPM hideout to seek the release
of the 13 hostages.

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of Turkey's two
center-right parties finally agreed to form a five-year
coalition government, thereby bringing an end to the
two-month-long government crisis.
</P>
<P>
True Path Party (DYP) chairwoman and caretaker Prime Minister
Tansu Ciller met with Motherland Party (ANAP) leader Mesut
Yilmaz today to discuss the domestic situation.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, the two leaders told a brief press
conference that they had decided to set up a coalition based on a
system of rotating premiership.
</P>
<P>
Ciller said that they had reached an agreement in principle
on DYP-ANAP coalition, favored by most of Turkish citizens.
</P>
<P>
High-ranking officials from the two parties will come together
Thursday to work out a common government program, added ciller.
</P>
<P>
However, neither Ciller nor Yilmaz mentioned who would be the
Prime Minister at first. The two leaders said they would meet
Friday again on the matter, but refused to answer questions until
then.
</P>
<P>
The Leaders of the two rival conservative parties have been
fighting for domination in the center-right coalition and failed
to resolve the question for the past two months.
</P>
<P>
Both Ciller and Yilmaz have been under mounting pressure
for forming the long-awaited coalition to prevent the Islamic
Welfare Party (RP) from coming to power.
</P>
<P>
The RP appeared as the leading force in the December 24
general election, followed by DYP and ANAP with a small
margin. But none of them could form a government on its own
because each failed to obtain a simple majority in the 550 seat
parliament.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 28 (Xinhua) -- The world's first satellite
payphone system was launched by the International Maritime
Satellite Organization (Inmarsat) here today.
</P>
<P>
The system operates globally through the Inmarsat-M satellite
network, via any of its 22 land stations.
</P>
<P>
For the first time, areas which are too remote for telephone or
even cellular phone connections will have access to international
phone, fax and data services.
</P>
<P>
The system does not need to be wired up to the international
telephone system; instead, the phones tap into the global digital
Inmarsat-M network via satellite.
</P>
<P>
Calls are picked up by the Inmarsat's geostationery satellites,
and then sent to a land station.
</P>
<P>
Here they link into the terrestrial phone network and are then
routed to their destinations. Calls can also be received from
terrestrial phone users.

will mark the start of strengthened cooperation between the two
continents.
</P>
<P>
The visiting Belgian premier told reporters that the summit on

The leaders of the 15-member European Union (EU) will join
those of the seven-member Association of Southeast Asia Nations

Dehaene stressed the informality of the gathering, which he
said will enable participants to exchange views "in the spirit of
cooperation rather than confrontation."

Economic cooperation between the regions will be at the top of
the agenda but some non-economic issues will also be discussed.
</P>
<P>
Dehaene said the unprecedented summit will not be the last and

<HEADLINE> Britain Launches Campaign to Prevent Baby Handicap </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 28 (Xinhua) - A major campaign urging
pregnant women to take extra vitamin B to prevent babies being
born handicapped was launched in Britain yesterday.
</P>
<P>
Some 500 babies a year are born with serious handicaps such as
spina bifida resulting from folic acid deficiency in their mothers.
</P>
<P>
The three-year drive, launched by the Health Education
Authority (HEA), is designed to encourage women betwen 16 and 45 to
boost their intage of folic acid, one of the B vitamins, to 400
milligrams a day before and during the early stages of pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
A Medical Research Council study showed that the risk of giving
birth to babies with neural tube defects decreased by 71 per cent
among women who increased their folic acid intake. But Kathy
Elliot, the HEA's business team director, said that only nine
percent of women were aware of this.
</P>
<P>
Research by the Consumers' Association has shown that while 51
percent of women had heard of folic acid only 11 percent acted on
the advice.
</P>
<P>
Folic acid deficiency results from long storage of food, food
processing and the British habit of overcooking vegetables. Folic
acid can be taken through vitamin pills or by eating fresh green
vegetables or bread and cereals with added folic acid.

<P>
BEIJING, February 28 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference (CPPCC) is playing an increasingly
important role in China's political, economic and social life, and
has contributed much to drafting the country's long-term
development strategy.
</P>
<P>
Composed of influential representatives from all walks of life,
the CPPCC has been active in performing its functions of political
consultation, democratic supervision and participation in
governmental affairs.
</P>
<P>
The advisory body aired lots of constructive views and
suggestions regarding the formulation of China's Ninth Five-Year
Plan (1996-2000) and the long-term goal for the year 2010 on the
basis of in-depth investigations.
</P>
<P>
The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) and
the State Council have attached great importance to the views and
suggestions and adopted many of them in the course of mapping out
the development strategy.
</P>
<P>
The CPPCC Subcommittee on the Economy made 17 suggestions on
June 3, 1995, concerning mapping out the Ninth Five-Year
Plan. Suggestions such as a moderate economic growth rate, lower
inflation rate, 30-percent fixed assets investment, distribution
equity and helping the poor were highly valued by the CPC Central
Committee.
</P>

Since the Third Session of the Eighth CPPCC National Committee
early last year, the Subcommittee for Handling Proposals has
received 2,377 proposals submitted by CPPCC National Committee
members, non-Communist parties and various subcommittees,
including 887 on economic issues. They have served as important

<HEADLINE> Russia Proposes Three Oil Joint Ventures with Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Russia has proposed three
oil joint ventures with Iran in the Caspian Sea, a Russian
source disclosed here today.
</P>
<P>
Yuri Shafranik, Russian Minister of Fuels and Power, is
expected to make a tour to Tehran in mid-March, the source said.
</P>
<P>
Russia has put forward the proposal of the three joint
ventures and negotiations are under way currently between the
two sides.
</P>
<P>
Vladimir Seniv, chief of industrial department of Slavneft
Oil and Gas Company, told Xinhua that his company wants to
establish the first joint venture company with Iran for
exploration of oil resource in the Iranian side of the Caspian
Sea.
</P>
<P>
At the first stage, he added, the joint venture will be
operated between Russia and Iran only.
</P>
<P>
He said that the joint venture operation could be expanded
to the third country in the Caspian Sea and other regions.
</P>
<P>
Slavneft, the open stock oil and gas company, is one of
Russia's 12 vertically integrated holding companies. It operates a
closed production cycle encompassing oil prospecting and production,
complete refining and sale of petroleum products.
</P>
<P>
As to the second joint venture, Seniv said, Russia is willing
to form a joint venture of transportation with Iran in the
Caspian Sea. The joint venture can build oil drilling platform and
 shipyard in the region.
</P>
<P>
He said that as the third proposal Russia would like to
establish a joint trading company with Iran for commercial and
technological business in a third country.
</P>
<P>
"Our cooperation will be at government level between Russia
and Iran. We try to prevent any pressure from other countries,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
Russia and Iran are both littoral states of the Caspian Sea
which has an oil reserves of 150 billion barrels.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian authorities described the Caspian Sea as the
"second Persian Gulf," which is rich in oil and gas resources.
</P>
<P>
An Iranian oil expert predicted that the Caspian Sea
littoral states will be able to exploit 12 million barrels of
oil per day and export about half of it until the year
2,000.
</P>
<P>
There is a gas reserve of 75,000 billion cubic meters in
the sea, the expert added.
</P>
<P>
Two Russian companies -- Slavneft and Tatneft -- are
participating the First International Fair of Oil, Gas
Petrochemical and Related Products in Tehran between 25 and 29
February.
</P>
<P>
Some 40 foreign companies from Britain, Canada, China, Germany,
Hungary, Romania and Russia will exhibit their products and technology
in the exhibition.

Anwar said Pakistan has an estimated potential of 40 billion
barrels of oil and 200 trillion cubic feet of gas, whereas the
proven reserves of oil and natural gas are about 491 million
barrels and 32 trillion cubic feet respectively.
</P>
<P>
"There is a dire need to explore and exploit natural resources
at an accelerated pace to bring these potential resources into use
for the benefit of people," he noted.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the government had signed 50 petroleum
concession agreements with local and foreign oil and gas
exploration companies in the last two years in line with the
policy to attract investment to the petroleum sector.
</P>
<P>
These companies are making risk investments of about 500
million US dollars in the petroleum sector, he said.
</P>
<P>
On the indigenous production of gas, Anwar said that about 1.8
billion cubic feet of gas is being produced daily at present,
while the government is making efforts to increase the amount to
2.5 billion cubic feet by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Gas is in great demand in the country and the gap is expected
to grow to around two to three billion cubic feet per day by the
end of the century, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
He said Pakistan must have at least one pipeline to bring 1.6
billion cubic feet of gas daily either from Iran or Turkmenistan
to bridge the gap.
</P>
<P>
The minister disclosed that the government will soon announce a
new policy to encourage private oil companies to engage in
off-shore oil exploration.

<HEADLINE> Unidentified Gunmen Attack Court Office In North Mogadishu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Unidentified gunmen
attacked the office of an Islamic court in North Mogadishu last
night.
</P>
<P>
Mahad Mohamed Tifow, the spokesman for the court, said the
guards of the Islamci office returned fire, wounding two of the
attackers as they were fleeing away.
</P>
<P>
He said small arms fire, rocket propelled grenades and heavy
machine guns were used in the 20-minute attack, in which no
casualties on the court side were caused.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman accused Gen. Mohamed Farah Aidid, faction leader
in South Mogadishu, of destablizing North Mogadishu by sending
"bandits".
</P>
<P>
According to sources opposing the Islamic courts, the attack
was meant to terrify the Islamic leaders and their activities.
</P>
<P>
This was the second attack in a week on the Islamic court
personnel or its premises. Earlier, the residence of Sheikh
Hassan Ali Alasow, a prominent religious leader in the Somali
capital, was attacked by allegedly anti-Sharia militiamen,
killing three people and wounding four others.
</P>
<P>
The two attacks followed the arrests of some senior
politicians including Abdurahman Gabow Mohamud by the court. The
arrested politicians have formed a faction opposing North
Mogadishu faction leader Ali Mahdi Mohamed.
</P>
<P>
In another development, a commercial vessel sank on Tuesday
off the coast of Rascamboni District close to the Somali-Kenyan
border. Two of the crew men have reportedly died while another
one is still missing.
</P>
<P>
According to Radio Field Communication reports from the
district, some of the 49 passengers on the vessel, most of them
refugees returning home voluntarily from Kenya, were rescued by a
small fishing boats while others swam to the beach.
</P>
<P>
The cause for the sea peril is said to be overload. The
vessel, Al-Majid, was hired by Somali merchants. enditem

<HEADLINE> French Economic Growth Rate Down in 1995 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 28 (Xinhua) -- French economic growth slowed
last year to 2.4 per cent, against a 2.9 percent growth in 1994,
and experts predict a further decline to 1.5 per cent this year.
</P>
<P>
Fourth quarter growth actually fell 0.3 percent over the third
quarter reflecting the impact of three weeks of massive public
sector strikes, a report by the National Institute of
Statistics and Economic Studies said today.
</P>
<P>
The public sector deficit in 1995, made up of 323 billion
francs (65 billion U.S. dollars) of budget deficit and about 69
billion francs (14 billion dollars) in undeclared social insurance
deficit, was more than five percent of 1995 GDP (Gross Domestic
Product), according to latest figures announced by the Ministry of
Economy and Finance.
</P>
<P>
France must cut its public deficit to GDP ratio to below three
percent by 1997 to meet the requirements of the Maastricht Treaty
for a single currency in Europe.

<HEADLINE> NPC to Mull Convention on Nuclear Safety </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Judging from the state of
China's existing nuclear technology, all nuclear power stations,
whether already completed or to be built, in China can meet the
basic safety requirements of the Convention on Nuclear Safety, a
senior government official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Entrusted by the State Council, Huang Qitao, director of the
National Nuclear Safety Administration, submitted the convention
to the 18th Session of the Standing Committee of the Eighth
National People's Congress (NPC) for deliberation and ratification
when it opened here today.
</P>
<P>
The convention was adopted by the International Atomic Agency
on June 17, 1994, and has been open for all countries to sign
since September 20 the same year.
</P>
<P>
To date, 62 countries, including China, have signed the
convention.
</P>
<P>
Huang said that the functions of China's National Nuclear
Safety Administration can meet the requirements of the convention
as an institution exercising supervision over nuclear safety.
</P>
<P>
The State Council has also promulgated the Regulations on
Emergency Administration of Accidents at Nuclear Power Plants. The
National Nuclear Safety Administration, the State Bureau of
Environmental Protection, the Ministry of Public Health, the
Ministry of Power Industry and other departments have all
formulated nuclear safety regulations and standards in line with
international practice.
</P>
<P>
China does not have any difficulty in executing the convention,
according to experts from the International Atomic Agency who
conducted a three-week assessment of the nuclear safety
supervision by the National Nuclear Safety Administration.
</P>
<P>
Huang pointed out that Chinese nuclear power stations have been
built and have been operating in accordance with Chinese laws and
regulations on nuclear safety and international standards.
</P>
<P>
The stations have passed safety assessments by the
International Atomic Energy Agency, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said that, as a nuclear power, China has some influence in
the international nuclear sphere.
</P>
<P>
"The appropriate development of nuclear power is an important
part of China's energy construction efforts," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Ratification of the convention will further demonstrate that
China has consistently attached the utmost importance to safety in
developing nuclear power and has taken an active part in
international co-operation in this regard, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Ratification of the convention will also enable China to
further improve its nuclear safety," Huang said.

<P>
NAIROBI, February 28 (Xinhua) - road accidents have claimed
the lives of 8,577 people on kenya's roads in the last three
years, the paper "Daily Nation" said today.
</P>
<P>
Directorate of motor vehicle inspection Mr A.P. Mutwana was
quoted as saying a further 24,047 people were injured over the
period.
</P>
<P>
"A good number of accidents are caused by drivers moving under
the influence of alcohol or drugs," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Accidents are caused by drivers as a result of carelessness,
recklessness, irresponsibility, lack of courtesy and failure to
follow the highway code," Mr Mutwana noted.
</P>
<P>
Also to blame are defective vehicles, fatigue, drunkenness,
and poor roads, among other things, he said.
</P>
<P>
Kenya's road network, hit by lack of funds for maintenance,
has also been deteriorating and most highways are riddled with
potholes.

<HEADLINE> Acupuncture Helps Cure Asthma: Scientists Say </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 28 (Xinhua) - Acupuncture can help cure
asthma, a scientist said at a conference sponsored by the National
Asthma Campaign here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Kim Jobst, a trained acupuncturist, said that 13 out of 16
studies found that acupuncture could help to reduce the need for
drugs in the treatment of asthma.
</P>
<P>
But it can not become a replacement for medication, he added.
</P>
<P>
"In almost all studies in which it was evaluated, the
combination of orthodox Western treatment - such as commonly used
inhaler medication - and acupuncture, the level of medication
which patients were taking to control their asthma was reduced."
</P>
<P>
Donald Lane, a consultant chest physician at the Churchill
Hospital, Oxford, and the vice-chairman of the Campaign, agreed
to Jobst's idea but warned that more work was needed.
</P>
<P>
"There seems little doubt that certain techniques employed in
complementary medicine, such as acupuncture, can relieve some of
the symptoms," Lane concluded.

BEIJING, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Jiang Zemin, Chairman of the
Central Military Commission, has signed a set of regulations
governing the use of oil products by the People's Liberation Army
(PLA).
</P>
<P>
In recent years the demand for fuels, lubricants and some
special liquids by the military has notably increased, and the
role of these oil products has become increasingly important in
the army's logistics, an official with the department said.

This is China's first set of regulations standardizing the
supply of oil products to the PLA, which has ten chapters in 46
articles, according to the PLA General Logistics Department. They

<HEADLINE> Israel to Continue Closure on West Bank, Gaza </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Shimon Peres announced here today that the closure on the
West Bank and the Gaza Strip will continue until further
notice.
</P>
<P>
The closure was imposed following two Hamas suicide bombing
attacks in Jerusalem and Ashkelon Sunday, which killed 25
people and injured 84.
</P>
<P>
Announcing decisions taken by the Israeli ministerial security
committee which convened earlier today, Peres said that a special unit
will be set up to deal with safety on the country's buses.
</P>
<P>
He added that Israel is not asking the Palestinians to be
responsible for Israel's safety, but the Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) has to abide by the agreement, according to which the
Islamic extremist organizations are to be dismantled.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Internal Security Minister Moshe Shahal said after the
meeting that the committee approved the separation plan between
Israel and the Palestinian autonomous areas.
</P>
<P>
He said that work will start immediately and the whole
project will last two years.
</P>
<P>
Shahal said that under the plan, entries into Israel from
the Palestinian autonomous areas will only be allowed at
organized crossing points, and anyone crossing elsewhere will
be considered to be on his way to carry out a violent
attack on Israelis.
</P>
<P>
The decisions are part of Israel's all-out war against
violence by Hamas and other Islamic extremist groups following
Sunday's two attacks.
</P>
<P>
So far, the Palestinian security forces have arrested some
150 Hamas and Islamic Jihad activists in the West Bank and
the Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
The PNA has been under mounting pressure by Israel to
rein in activities by Hamas and Islamic Jihad in areas
under its jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
Peres warned Tuesday night that if the PNA does not crack
down on Islamic militants, it may jeopardize Israel's scheduled
pullout from Hebron next month.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a meeting of American Jewish leaders in Jerusalem,
Peres said that "We expect (PNA President Yasser) Arafat to
fulfill his part. If not, we shall have to consider many
things, maybe Hebron included."
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with Israeli army Chief of Staff Amnon Shahak
Tuesday night at the Erez checkpoint, Arafat said that he was
doing whatever he can.

<HEADLINE> Fishing Ban Announced in Oil Spill Sea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 28 (Xinhua) -- An official fishing ban along
the coast worst affected by the oil spill disaster in South Wales
was announced today by the British government.
</P>
<P>
Fishermen will be forbidden from catching crabs, lobster,
crayfish, whelks, cockles and other kind of fish off the affected
coasts until further notice.
</P>
<P>
Last week's oil spill from the tanker Sea Empress continued to
affect 160 kilometers of the Welsh coastline, with patches of
floating oil reported in Milford Haven and Carmarthen Bay.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 300 fishermen and merchants gathered in Milford Haven
Tuesday to demand compensation and accused the Welsh Office of
delay in announcing restrictions.
</P>
<P>
Nick O'Sullivan, chairman of the Sea Empress Fishermen's
Claimants Association, said fishermen were losing a lot of money
and urged the Welsh Office to fix the boundaries of the off-limits
area of sea as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
"We have members who fish at the edge of the affected
area. They have kept their boats in harbor as part of our own
efforts to preserve our good name as suppliers of quality fish,"
O'Sullivan said.
</P>
<P>
"But they are losing a lot of money. They don't know whether to
start fishing again because they don't know where the Welsh
Office will fix the boundaries of the closed area. There is a
need for urgency now," he continued.
</P>
<P>
The number of live oiled birds picked up on the shoreline rose
above 2,000 Tuesday and wildlife services estimate thousands
more may have died at sea.
</P>
<P>
Some conservationists predict that the eventual death toll
could reach 50,000, the worst since the wreck of another oil
tanker called Torrey Canyon in 1967.

<HEADLINE> Botha Denies Keeping Nuclear Incident Secret </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 28 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's Mineral
and Energy Affairs Minister Pik Botha has denied newspaper claims
that he had kept a nuclear incident secret, a local daily "the
citizen" reported today.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued in Johannesburg yesterday, Botha said he
had learned of the incident only at 10 a.m. on Sunday from the
newspaper report.
</P>
<P>
The incident was referring to the disclosures by an official
from the Council for Nuclear Safety (CNS) that "many" buried
200-liter drums containing radioactive waste had been excavated
last April at an Atomic Energy Corporation (AEC) nuclear waster
disposal site at Pelindaba, west of Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
CNS licensing manager S. W. de Waal said in a November report,
which was published on Sunday, that many of the unearthed drums
had been damaged and turned ruptured by a mechanical digger,
"spilling contaminated material in and around the excavated
area."
</P>
<P>
Newspapers in Pretoria and Johannesburg on Sunday alleged Mr.
Botha had hidden the incident for almost a year, saying it was a
scandal that millions of people living in Gauteng province, where
the incident occurred, had not been informed.
</P>
<P>
Botha said he had received reports from the AEC and the CNS
after learning of the incident on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"After having studied the reports and having received a
personal assurance from CNS chief executive Bert Winkler, it
became clear to me the danger was insignificant," Botha said.
</P>
<P>
"I felt it was my first duty to inform the public fully of
this finding to avoid unnecessary alarm," said the minister,
adding he had asked the AEC and CNS why he had not been informed
of the incident, and said the situation of denying him the
information was unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the AEC said yesterday tests in November had shown
no radioactive contamination of the environment at the Pelindaba
nuclear waste disposal site.
</P>
<P>
No contamination tests had been conducted at the site since
then, AEC nuclear waste management senior manager Brian
Hambleton-Jones said.
</P>
<P>
It was not thought necessary to conduct any further
contamination tests as previous tests were negative, he noted.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Sees Further Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's economic achievements
last year were much greater than expected, a two-day cabinet
meeting was told.
</P>
<P>
But Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet urged ministers to come up with
action plans to solve issues left over from 1995, control public
spending, boost production and international trade and regulate
financial and monetary markets.
</P>
<P>
The country enjoyed high growth rates in agriculture and
industry in 1995 while exports hit 5.3 billion U.S. dollars, 600
million dollars higher than expected, local press today quoted the
cabinet as saying.
</P>
<P>
The rate of inflation fell and stood at 12.7 percent in 1995,
lower than forecast.
</P>
<P>
Reports given to the two-day regular meeting showed the country
made greater achievements than those estimated in a cabinet report
submitted to the national assembly last October.
</P>
<P>
After reviewing 1995's economic situation, the cabinet called
for further socio-economic development, promotion of
anti-corruption measures and more effective controls on government
expenditure.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet warned that "any organizations or
individuals corrupting or using the state budget and state
property lavishly should be punished severely in order to
reestablish order in the area."
</P>
<P>
The meeting discussed how to boost socio-economic development
and accomplish tasks set for 1996, including measures to raise
production, exports, imports, consumer spending and to improve
financial markets and state management.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will submit the reports discussed to the National
Assembly at its regular session scheduled for early March.

<HEADLINE> NPC Mulls over Three Draft Laws </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Three draft laws, including
Martial law, were submitted once again for deliberation to the
18th meeting of the Eighth National People's Congress (NPC)'s
Standing Committee, which opened here today.
</P>
<P>
In an explanatory report on the draft Martial Law delivered at
today's meeting, Wang Shuwen, vice-chairman of the NPC Law
Committee, said this was an indispensable law for a sovereign
state.
</P>
<P>
It is of vital importance in maintaining national unity,
security and social stability, and to protect the legal rights and
interests of Chinese citizens, he said.
</P>
<P>
The vice-chairman said this was the optimum time for the
introduction of the law to be considered, and suggested it be
released as soon as possible after necessary modification.
</P>
<P>
Gu Angran, chairman of the Commission of Legislative Affairs of
the NPC Standing Committee, suggested that the revised draft law
on Administrative Punishment Law and the Amendments to the Law of
Criminal Procedures should contain more details, and the scope of
application for administrative punishments should be specified.
</P>
<P>
In the course of discussions, representatives from some
localities and central government departments made amendments to a
number of articles in the Amendments to the Law of Criminal
Procedures. These included detention times, condition of arrests
and the release of offenders on probation.
</P>
<P>
The revised draft laws stipulated, on the basis of experts'
opinion, that the majority of cases should be handled within the
required time limit, with an aim to protect the legal rights and
interests of suspects, and defendants by shortening the period of
time spent in custody.

<HEADLINE> Sino-Saudi Arabian Mixed Committee Meets in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 28 (Xinhua) -- The first meeting of the
Sino-Saudi Arabian Mixed Trade and Economic Committee was held
here this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was co-chaired by Chinese Minister of Foreign Trade
and Economic Co-operation Wu Yi and Finance Minister Ibrahim Assaf
of Saudi Arabia. The two ministers exchanged views on widening
bilateral economic and trade links.
</P>
<P>
Wu said that Sino-Saudi Arabian economic and trade co-
operation has witnessed rapid development since the two countries
forged diplomatic ties, with the bilateral trade volume last year
reaching 1.285 billion US dollars-worth, a 47 percent rise over
1994.
</P>
<P>
But there still exists a great gap in the field of bilateral
trade compared with the economic strengths of the two countries,
Wu noted. She said she hoped the two sides would make joint
efforts and take concrete measures to tap the potential in
bilateral economic collaboration.
</P>
<P>
China has trade contacts with 227 countries and regions around
the world, and its economy covers all sectors, Wu continued,
adding that both the quality and prices of China's commodities are
quite competitive and it can also provide Saudi Arabia with all
kinds of products.
</P>
<P>
Assaf said that his country attaches importance to its economic
and trade links with China, which plays a major role in world
trade. Saudi Arabia is willing to import more products from China
since their quality is good, Assaf noted, saying that he also
hoped that China would import more petrochemicals from his country.
</P>
<P>
Assaf arrived here Tuesday for a week-long visit to China at
the invitation of Wu Yi. He is expected to meet with Chinese
President Jiang Zemin and senior officials from the ministries of
finance and railways as well as some leading business leaders.

<HEADLINE> Kazakhstan to Export Oil via Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Kazakhstan is exploring ways
with Iran to export its oil via an Iranian island in the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
Tehran Radio reported that the negotiation on the deal is under
way between the oil ministers of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The landlocked Kazakhstan wants to export 2 to 5 million tons
of crude oil annually from the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani today told Kazakh Oil
Minister Nurlan Balgimbaev during their meeting that Kazakhstan
could use Iran's ports in the Gulf to export its oil.
</P>
<P>
"Iran is committed to helping its neighbors including
Kazakhstan to further bolster their economic independence. We are
prepared to work with Kazakhstan to export its oil," said
Rafsanjani.
</P>
<P>
The radio said that Balgimbaev submitted a message from Kazakh
President Nursultan Nazarbayev to Rafsanjani.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, Iranian Oil Minister Gholamreza
Aqazadeh expressed Iran's readiness to receive Kazakh oil in the
Caspian Sea port cities.
</P>
<P>
Aqazadeh said that Iran will export oil for them from Iran's
Kharg Island in the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that Kazakhstan exports the bulk of its oil
through Russia in the past few years.
</P>
<P>
Economic analysts here said that the visit by the high-ranking
Kazakh delegation was aimed at diversifying the avenues of export
for the Kazakh oil in order to reduce its dependence on Russia as
the only source of export.

<HEADLINE> Chongqing Customs Crack down on Cultural Relics Smuggling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Customs officers have
stepped up a crackdown on the smuggling of cultural relics in the
Three Gorges reservoir area.
</P>
<P>
In the past year the officers in Chongqing, capital of
southwest China's Sichuan Province, have confiscated 93 pieces of
historical relics.
</P>
<P>
The Three Gorge area, an important component of ancient Chinese
culture, is rich in historical relics.
</P>
<P>
Experts say a total of 1,208 locations with cultural relics
have been found in the area, and some of the relics are very rare.
</P>
<P>
With the Three Gorges Project well underway, some lawbreakers
have managed in recent years to raid the ancient tombs. They have
also purchased relics scattered among local folk and then smuggled
their hauls of relics overseas. Often they use false names and
postal addresses as part of their ploy.
</P>
<P>
To tackle the problem the Chongqing Customs department set up
special agencies in local post offices and adopted different
checking measures for postal items -- concentrating on packaging,
volume, the intended recipient and some other things.
</P>
<P>
The special agencies confiscated 71 pieces of cultural relics
in March and April last year, most of them, according to experts,
unearthed in the Three Gorge Reservoir Area, and a dozen of them
classified as national level relics.
</P>
<P>
Officers at Chongqing Customs have vowed to intensify
supervision of export items sent via waterways, by airline,
railway or post this year.
</P>
<P>
The department says it is ready to join hands with customs
offices in Guangzhou, Chengdu and Wuhan, in a bid to crack down on
smuggling activities more effectively.

<HEADLINE> Forum Held to Mark Taiwan Uprising </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 28 (Xinhua) -- A forum to mark the 49th
anniversary of the Taiwan "February 28 Uprising" was held in
Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
The event was organised by the Central Committee of the Taiwan
Democratic Self-Government League, All-China Federation of Taiwan
Compatriots (ACFTC) and Association for Relations Across the
Taiwan Strait (ARATS).
</P>
<P>
Zhang Kehui, president of the ACFTC and vice-chairman of the
Central Committee of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League,
presided over the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Expressing his appreciation for the Taiwan people's patriotic
spirit in the movement for democracy 49 years ago, he said that
today's commemoration aims to carry forward patriotism, and adhere
to the "one China" principle and oppose splittism.
</P>
<P>
Cai Zimin, chairman of the Central Committee of the Taiwan
Democratic Self-Government League, said that as a patriotic
democratic movement to ask for political reform of Kuomintang, the
uprising was taken on the premise of one China and it was by no
means an "exclusive" or "Taiwan independence" movement as someone
had alleged.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the "peaceful reunification, and one
country, two systems" is the best way to solve the Taiwan question.
</P>
<P>
Although a high-degree of autonomy put forward during the
"February 28 Uprising" was different from the high-degree of
autonomy of Taiwan under the principle of "one country, two
systems", in the background of the times, he said, the two
propositions are both under the "one China" principle and in line
with the interests and the democratic demands of the people in
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Tang Shubei, vice-president of the ARATS, said that the
"February 28 Uprising" was closely related to the struggle waged
by the compatriots on the Chinese mainland against the tyrannical,
corrupt and traitorous Kuomintang regime that represented
interests of imperialism, feudalism and bureaucratic capitalism in
those days. It was, therefore, a part of the great new-democratic
revolution of the Chinese people, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Chinese government and mainland compatriots
have always supported, and shown sympathy, with the struggle
against Taiwan authorities for democratic rights by the Taiwan
people.
</P>
<P>
"We fully respect the way to exert democratic rights chosen by
the Taiwan people," he added.
</P>
<P>
"We are, meanwhile, firmly opposed to the way some leaders of
the Taiwan authorities have taken advantage of the democratic
demands and aspirations of the Taiwan people, and
used 'democratization' as a pretext to serve their political
attempts of creating 'two Chinas', 'one China, one Taiwan'
and 'Taiwan independence'," he said.
</P>
<P>
Only if the Taiwan authorities comply with the will of the
people, and stop their separatist activities worldwide, and return
to the "one China" principle, can Taiwan have a bright prospect,
he said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Official on Linkage of China's Economy with HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 28 (Xinhua) -- A high-ranking Chinese
official said here today that the country's sustained and rapid
economic growth is inseparable from the large inflow of investment
from Hong Kong and Macao.
</P>
<P>
Xiang Huaicheng, deputy commissioner of the Chinese State
Administration of Taxation, made the remarks while addressing a
luncheon, sponsored by the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
He said that a stable and prosperous Hong Kong will help China
to maintain its fast economic growth, while a booming Chinese
economy will make Hong Kong more stable and prosperous.
</P>
<P>
He reviewed the sustained, healthy and fast development of the
Chinese economy over the past four years, which has grown by 10 to
14 percent annually.
</P>
<P>
"The rapid growth is a big achievement considering that it was
realized under the situation of a tightening economy," he told
hundreds of Hong Kong businessmen. The Chinese government started
to adopt macro-economic adjustment measures in the later half of
1993 in order to cool down an overheating economy and curb
inflation.
</P>
<P>
Xiang said that the growth was not coupled with sky-rocketing
inflation. China has succeeded in bringing the inflation rate
down to 14.8 percent last year from the highest of 21.7 percent in
1994.
</P>
<P>
He attributed China's economic growth partly to booming
investment from Hong Kong and Macao. Statistics show that
investors from the two regions have set up more than 150,000
ventures in the mainland, involving contracted investment of 220
billion US dollars. The actual inflow of capital amounted to 75
billion US dollars, accounting for 60 percent of the total foreign
investment utilized in China.
</P>
<P>
The official made it clear that after 1997, enterprises funded
by Hong Kong businessmen will continue to enjoy the same treatment
as foreign-funded ventures in China, including the current tax
preferential policy.

BEIRUT, February 28 (Xinhua) -- French Defense Minister
Charles Millon is due to arrive in Beirut tonight to open another
page of France's recent intensive diplomatic activities in Lebanon
which will reach a climax with an expected visit by President
Jacques Chirac in May.
</P>
<P>
Millon's visit to Beirut comes as the fourth link in a chain
after President of the French National Assembly Philippe Seguin
visited the Lebanese capital on January 5, Foreign Minister Herve
de Charette on January 16 and former Interior Minister Charles
Pasqua on January 26.
</P>
<P>
But local political observers noted that France has until now
limited its activities in Lebanon to "painting an ideal halo
accompanied with a large-scale propaganda on 'the extraordinary
concern of France on Lebanon.'"
</P>
<P>
Million is scheduled to arrive at Beirut International Airport
at 5:00 p.m. (15:00 GMT).
</P>
<P>
During his visit, he will hold meetings with his Lebanese
counterpart Mohsen Dalloul, Army Commander Emile Lahoud, Foreign
Minister Farez Boueiz and President Elias Hrawi, according to
reliable diplomatic sources.
</P>
<P>
On the eve of his departure for Beirut, the French defense
minister stressed that a peace in the Middle East "means a
respect for Lebanon's sovereignty, its territorial integrity and
that is what France strongly desires."
</P>
<P>
He told the London-based Arabic daily Al-Hayat that Paris and
Beirut are determined to study ways to enhance their military
cooperation to strengthen the ability of the Lebanese army to be
a guarantor of the legitimacy of the Lebanese state.
</P>
<P>
Millon expressed France's aspiration to play a basical role in
the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
"France attaches a significant importance to the peace process
and the positive results which it could result in," the French
defense minister stressed. "France is ready to take part in the
measures to be agreed on in a form of security guarantees given to
all the parties in Golan and in south Lebanon."
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that a defense cooperation is developing between
Lebanon and France, noting that his country is ready to offer
assistances to Lebanon in this field in a framework of respecting
Lebanon's sovereignty.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian Trade Unions Should Support Government: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 28 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzania Federation
of Trade Unions (TFTU) has been urged to rally its membership
behind the government to fight poverty, corruption and other
vices.
</P>
<P>
This appeal was made by the Minister for Industries and Trade,
Dr. Abdallah Kigoda, when opening a three-day conference "On
Social Dimensions Of Adjustment In Tanzania" here yesterday.
</P>
<P>
He told the conference that Tanzania was under-going a "very
significant change" in the economy that was dominated by a once
buoyant public sector, now seriously battered, yielding to
privatization.
</P>
<P>
"This phase demands all persons to be responsible and
accountable in every field we render our services. We cannot
achieve success overnight," he said.
</P>
<P>
"TFTU has a role to play to reinculcate in its members the
attitude of hard work. We can do it. Let us play our parts," he
added.
</P>
<P>
The minister stressed that Tanzania should reject the notion
that only leaders were accountable for the state of the economy.
The accountability was shared by all -- leaders, civil servants,
workers, farmers and technocrats, he said.
</P>
<P>
The conference was attended by representatives of newly-formed
local trade unions and trade union delegates from Kenya, Uganda
and the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Russia's defense industry will
grind to a halt if no fundamental measures are to be carried out
without delay, experts warned.
</P>
<P>
An official of Russia's Defense Industry Committee told
Interfax News Agency recently that production of the defense
industry decreased 26 percent in January from the same period of
1995.
</P>
<P>
The official added the four worst-hit sections were aviation,
telecommunications, weaponry and space rockets, in which
production slipped by 30 to 33.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
He said that compared with the first month of 1995, the output
value of civilian products manufactured by the defense industry
dropped 25 percent in January, and that of military products went
down 33 percent.
</P>
<P>
The official described the fast reduction as a "total disaster."
</P>
<P>
In fact Russia's defense industry has been in a state of total
recession since 1991. Statistics showed its output last month was
only one fourth of that in January of 1991. The decline process
slowed down somewhat in 1995, but sped up again this year.

<HEADLINE> S.Africa's Former Defense Minister Faces New Charge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 28 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's former
Defence Minister Magnus Malan, charged with the murder of 13
people in Kwazulu/Natal nine years ago, have been added with a
supplementary criminal charge, local newspaper "The Citizen"
reported today.
</P>
<P>
In an official notice to lawyers for the accused, released
yesterday by Kwazulu/Natal Attorney-general Tim Mcnally, new
evidence was brought against the accused with a charge of a
far-reaching conspiracy to murder members of political
organizations in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Malan and 19 co-accused face murder charges arising from a
massacre of 13 people, most of them children, at Kwamakutha south
of Durban in 1987.
</P>
<P>
The massacre was allegedly carried out by members of a trained
murder squad instructed to kill the United Democratic Front
activist Victor Ntuli.
</P>
<P>
Mcnally's supplementary charge introduced evidence,
implicating the accused in a plot to murder members of the then
banned African National Congress (ANC) and other political
organizations after the Kwamakutha massacre, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Call for Joint Development of Marine Resources </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Chinese experts have proposed
that Hainan Province, which has the largest sea territory in the
country, should attract more overseas investment to develop marine
resources in the South China Sea.
</P>
<P>
Hainan wants a huge sum of money to develop oil, gas, fishery,
tourism, mineral, chemical and other resources in the sea around
the province, experts said, adding that overseas investment will
solve the problem.
</P>
<P>
Experts believe that the Hainan and Taiwan islands should join
hands in developing resources in the South China Sea, such as
establishing a fishing team, in the form of joint ventures,
co-operating in ocean transportation, ocean tourism, and exploring
offshore oil and gas resources.
</P>
<P>
They also suggested speeding up the development of the Xisha
Islands by opening a tourism route, and establishing an economic
development zone or a tourism development zone.
</P>
<P>
Big name companies from around the globe have already visited
Hainan to study the feasibility of development.
</P>
<P>
American and French companies have participated in the
exploration of oil and gas in the four large basins around the
Hainan Island.
</P>
<P>
Ya 13-1, China's largest offshore gas field, jointly developed
by the China National Offshore Oil Corporation, the Atlantic
Richfield Company of the United States, and the Kuwait Foreign
Petroleum Exploration Company, has provided gas supplies to Hong
Kong since January.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN to Conserve Commercial Tree Resources </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 28 (Xinhua) -- The Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) will work to check the rapid loss
and degradation of forests and their genetic resources in the
Asian and Pacific region, ASEAN's Institute of Forest Management
(AIFM) said here today.
</P>
<P>
The AIFM said that it had secured one million US dollars and
would start a three-year project to develop strategies for
conservation of the genetic resources of commercial tree species,
principally in the production forests in the region.
</P>
<P>
AIFM Project Steering Committee Chairman Ismail Awang said
today that the project would be implemented in Brunei, Indonesia,
the Philippines, Malaysia and Papua New Guinea.
</P>
<P>
The project is expected to produce practical and effective
guidelines in the forms of a manual for the establishment and
management of conservation stands as well as models of operational
plans for genetic resource conservation.
</P>
<P>
Under the conservation plan, the project will draw up an
inventory for species that need to be conserved and to determine
the rate of genetic loss in the region.
</P>
<P>
Commercial tree species will be looked at not only for their
timber value but also for their medical value, said the AIFM.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Reiterates Condition for Resuming Peace Talks with Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese-Israeli peace
negotiations will not be resumed unless tangible progress is made
on the Syrian track of the Middle East peace process, a senior
Lebanese official said today.
</P>
<P>
Major-General Sami al Khatib, head of the Security and National
Defense Committee at the Lebanese Chamber of Deputies, said in an
interview with Cairo-based Sawt Al Arab (Voice of Arabs) Radio
that his country is not to separate in any way the Syrian track
from the Lebanese one.
</P>
<P>
His remarks coincided with the opening of a new round of peace
talks between Syria and Israel today in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Syria earlier accused Israel of obstinacy and said it expects
no major results from the talks due to resume today near
Washington.
</P>
<P>
Khatib added that the Israeli raids on south Lebanon will not
intimidate Lebanon as it is determined to seek a just and
honorable peace.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon will continue its armed resistance as long as Israeli
troops occupy the south of the country, he said.
</P>
<P>
Israel carved out a so-called "security zone" in south Lebanon
in 1985 and have since controlled the border area as a buffer zone
to prevent cross-border guerrilla attacks on northern Israel.

<HEADLINE> Exports Rose in Guangxi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Export volume in the Guangxi
Zhuang Autonomous Region hit a record high of 2.24 billion US
dollars in 1995, a rise of 40.2 percent over 1994.
</P>
<P>
The growth put the autonomous region in south China in the 13th
place nationally, in export volume last year. In 1990 the region
ranked 16th.
</P>
<P>
Regional authorities attributed the progress to the expansion
of foreign trade by State-owned foreign trade companies
traditionally dominating the business, and by local enterprises
and overseas-funded businesses, which moved into foreign trade in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
Though a relatively backward region, Guangxi has made
significant headway in foreign economic cooperation and trade in
the past few years.
</P>
<P>
Between 1990 and 1995, the regional government approved 5,624
projects, a staggering 1,000 percent increase compared with the
previous five years.
</P>
<P>
The projects in the past five years generated a combined
pledged overseas investment of 7.6 billion US dollars, with almost
2.6 billion US dollars of overseas investment brought into use.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the region signed 259 contracts for overseas
contractual engineering projects worth 460 million US dollars.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Rules Out War With Cameroon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian defence spokesman Fred
Chijuka has stated that Nigeria has no intention of going to war
with Cameroon over Bakasi peninsula.
</P>
<P>
Chijuka made the remark yesterday when asked what Nigeria
intended to do in view of reports in some media that France had
promised to back cameroon in the event of war with Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
He said that the situation in Bakassi remained calm even as at
yesterday, but was however quick to point out that Nigeria did
not know the intention of Cameroon.
</P>
<P>
"We have no cause to go into full scale war, we have been
living as good neighbours with Cameroon. We have agreed to keep
to the rules, provided Cameroon reacted positively," he noted.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian government issued a statement last week, pledging
to abide by the spirit of cooperation, understanding and peaceful
co-existence with her neighbours and the guiding principles of
the OAU and the U.N..
</P>
<P>
The spokesman explained that since the disputed peninsula
issue was before the International Court of Justice at the Hague,
Nigeria was very cautious and mindful of her actions and
utterances.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, it was reported that Cameroonian Foreign Minister
Ferdinand Oyono had written to the U.N. Security Council to get
it to intervene in the dispute.
</P>
<P>
Oyono in his letter called on the Security Council to ask
Nigeria to withdraw to the positions before the December 21, 1993
clash between the two countries on the peninsula.
</P>
<P>
The Cameroonian foreign minister alleged that Nigerian troops
had been "advancing further into Cameroonian territory and
launching artillery attacks on the Cameroonian positions since
February 3+, 1996, when the armed conflict between the two
countries flared up again.
</P>
<P>
The both sides have been trading accusations of alleged fresh
hostilities at each other's instance, following the peace parley
in Togo over the February clash.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Boutros-Boutros Ghali on Monday renewed
his call on Nigeria and Cameroon to seek a peaceful settlement to
the dispute.
</P>
<P>
Cameroon initially brought the dispute to the U.N. Security
Council in 1994 after the armed clash between the two countries
in February 1994, but, Nigeria, then a member of the 15-member
U.N.Security Council, successfully blocked the tabling of the
issue by the council.
</P>
<P>
In separate letters to the governments of Nigeria and Cameroon
on April 29,1994, the then President of the Security Council
asked them to seek a peaceful solution to the dispute.
</P>
<P>
Cameroon later took the dispute over the ownership of the
oil-rich peninsula to the world court for arbitration.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 28 (Xinhua) -- A two-million strong army of
farmers and laborers used muscle power to help breathe new life
into arid land in east China's Zhejiang Province.
</P>
<P>
In neighbouring Anhui Province another massive army of farmers
and laborers put their backs to the land, and moved more than 500
million cubic meters of earth and stones in their race-against
time to construct crucial water irrigation systems.
</P>
<P>
Their daily toil on the land added up to 625 million workdays
over the winter months in Anhui, their task to improve farming
conditions.
</P>
<P>
Work on 211,000 water conservancy projects in Anhui has now
been completed, bringing 63,000 hectares of arid land into
irrigation, harnessing 2.2 million square kilometers of eroded
land and providing fresh drinking water for 339,000 people, the
"People's Daily" reported in China.
</P>
<P>
Four provincial leaders and 20,000 government officials joined
farmers at construction sites.
</P>
<P>
The Government allocated four-billion yuan for the irrigation
projects in the winter-spring period, doubling the figure given
during last year's winter.
</P>
<P>
Zhejiang Province, on the eastern coast, organized two million
farmers and laborers a day during the past three months and
completed 88 percent of the new irrigation projects.
</P>
<P>
It has also built 143,300 hectares of irrigated fields and
improved 30,600 hectares of medium and low-yielding land, the
paper reported.
</P>
<P>
But the farmers have had a helping hand this year. As well as
the conventional spade and shovel way of construction, more
machine tools were used this year, resulting in a higher
efficiency and lower cost.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Preliminary estimates of the
Philippines' balance of payments (BOP) position in 1995 showed a
surplus of 645 million US dollars, the Central Bank said today.
</P>
<P>
The figure is substantially lower than the surplus of 1.802
billion US dollars posted in 1994 and way below the revised BOP
target for 1995 of 1.4 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Central Bank officials said that the International Monetary
Fund did not make any negative reaction to the shortfall, noting
that it was only an offshoot of external shocks.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the net current account posted a deficit of 854
million US dollars primarily because of the negative net
merchandise trade account of 9.109 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The imports amounting to 26.479 billion US dollars last year
continued to outpace the exports of only 17.370 billion US
dollars, said the Central Bank.
</P>
<P>
Net foreign investments were also positive at 2.011 billion US
dollars with inflows amounting to 6.544 billion US dollars as
against outflows of only 4.533 billion US dollars.

<HEADLINE> Glory Undertaking to Benefit Tibet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Dozens of China's non-state-run
hi-tech enterprises will invest over 400 million yuan in the Tibet
Autonomous Region to help local people eliminate poverty.
</P>
<P>
As part of the Glory Undertaking Program, the enterprises from
other parts of China have signed 46 contracts with local companies.
</P>
<P>
This will result in cooperation in such areas as agriculture,
medical care, education, culture, science and technology.
</P>
<P>
The program, launched in 1994, is designed to eliminate poverty
by encouraging non-governmental, hi-technology enterprises to open
businesses and train personnel for the country's underdeveloped
areas.
</P>
<P>
The Continent Biology Hi-Tech Company, based in Nanchang, the
capital of east China's Jiangxi Province, is to build a farm in
the Lhasa River Valley by reclaiming 933 hectares of wasteland.
</P>
<P>
The Yuexi Corn Institute in east China's Anhui Province and
Nedong County in Tibet will jointly open a farm close to the
Yarlung Zangbo River, by reclaiming 667 hectares of wasteland.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 hectares of land will be sown with fine corn
seeds this spring.
</P>
<P>
These projects, expected to involve 10 million yuan in total
investment in the next three to five years, will help Tibet
achieve self-sufficiency in grain, edible oil and meat by the end
of the century.
</P>
<P>
Also scheduled to open later this year is a pharmaceutical
factory involving an investment of 10 million yuan from the
Qizheng Company in northwest China's Gansu Province.
</P>
<P>
As part of the contract, the factory will give 100,000 yuan
annually to civil affairs departments in the Nyingchi Prefecture
for the next 20 years.
</P>
<P>
The Kangli Company in Anshan, Liaoning Province, and
Gongbo'gyamda County in Tibet will jointly build a factory to turn
out medicinal plasters for treating contusions and strains by
using certain herbs that can only be found in Tibet.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing-based Jinghai Group Co. will spend 300,000 yuan
building a "Glory School" in Shannan Prefecture.
</P>
<P>
Another Beijing-based hi-tech company, the Stone Group, has
transported 250,000 yuan-worth of equipment to the prefecture,
where it has set up a personnel training center together with the
local government.
</P>
<P>
A company from Nanjing in east China's Jiangsu Province
promised to train four groups of Tibetan officials for the region
in two years. The first group of 25 officials finished their
studies in Nanjing at the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
Li Ruihuan, chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese
Political Consultative Conference, praised the enterprises
investing in Tibet for opening a non-governmental channel for
other parts of China to aid Tibet in its economic construction.
</P>
<P>
Yang Chuantang, vice-chairman of the Tibetan regional
government, said, "The implementation of the Glory Undertaking
program will greatly increase Tibet's economic strength and
benefit the Tibetan people."

<HEADLINE> Australia Sees Chance to Resume Link with DPRK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 28 (Xinhua) -- The Australian government has
left the door open for resuming diplomatic links with the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), but has set some
pre-conditions for the process, the local newspaper Age said
today.
</P>
<P>
Australian Minister for Foreign Affairs Gareth Evans told the
paper that his government was open to talks with the DPRK 20 years
after the scission of diplomatic relations between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the DPRK has "stepped up efforts" to
reopen talks with Canberra in recent weeks, contacting Australian
diplomatic representatives through its embassies around the world,
including in the United Nations and Bangkok, Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Pyongyang approached Canberra for talks on the normalization of
relations a few years ago but Canberra found the issue too
sensitive at that time, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Australia recently decided to send humanitarian aids to
Pyongyang despite that the two countries have no formal links.
</P>
<P>
"I think they (DPRK) certainly see us as one of the more
energetic and creative countries in the region," Evan said.
</P>
<P>
But he linked the normalization of Australian-DPRK relations to
the resumption of talks between the DPRK and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
"We don't see that cause is much advanced by us rushing to
embrace a regime that is still being very reluctant to behave
cooperatively. We are using such influence as we have to
encourage both sides to come to a dialogue arrangement," he told
the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
He said that Australia was conscious not to "get too far ahead
of the play."
</P>
<P>
Australia and the DPRK broke off diplomatic relations after
Pyongyang withdrew its personnel from Canberra in 1976.

<HEADLINE> ANAP, DYP Leaders to Meet to Decide Turkish Government Fate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Motherland Party (ANAP)
Chairman Mesut Yilmaz and True Path Party (DYP) leader Tansu
Ciller will hold a historical meeting this afternoon to decide
the fate of the Turkish government.
</P>
<P>
The two arch rival parties, which are fighting for domination
in the center-right, are expected to become partners in a
"Motherpath" coalition government since the ANAP and the
pro-Islamic Welfare Party (RP) failed to form a coalition
government due to their divergence on which party should be in
charge of the national economy and be the Directorate-General of
Religious Affairs.
</P>
<P>
Turkish reliable sources said Yilmaz and Ciller would agree in
principle to form the coalition government in today's meeting.
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz was assigned by President Suleyman Demirel to form a
coalition on February 3 after the RP and DYP failed to find
partners in the parliamentary political parties.
</P>
<P>
Both Yilmaz and Ciller have been under strong pressure to
compromise for the over two-month-awaited coalition government.
</P>
<P>
In the past, Ciller had accepted the idea of a "rotating
premiership," but she insisted on getting the post first, thus
leading to the collapse of the coalition talks between the ANAP
and DYP.
</P>
<P>
Just when the ANAP was about to form a coalition government
with the RP, Ciller made a large compromise and revived the
"Motherpath" plan by agreeing that Yilmaz could take the
premiership first.
</P>
<P>
Over 70 percent majority of the Turkish citizens are
supporting the ANAP and DYP to form a coalition government in a
bid to keep the secular, democratic and contemporary character of
the republic.
</P>
<P>
The RP opposes Turkey's 43-year-old membership of the NATO. It
is also against a customs union between Turkey and the European
Union, which RP leader Necmettin Erbakan sees a part of the
Western plot to hold the moslem world under its economic
domination.
</P>
<P>
After meeting with President Demirel on Monday, Yilmaz told
reporters that he was optimistic with the DYP that he could
announce the cabinet list by the weekend.

JERUSALEM, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Chief of Staff Amnon
Shahak has presented Palestinian National Authority (PNA)
President Yasser Arafat with a long list of demands including the
immediate arrests of those planning and initiating acts of
violence.
</P>
<P>
The Shahak-Arafat meeting Tuesday night at the Erez checkpoint
between Israel and the Gaza Strip was held following Sunday's two
Hamas suicide bombing attacks in Jerusalem and Ashkelon, which
killed 27 people.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting which lasted two and a half hours, Shahak
heard reports from Palestinian officials concerning arrests of
Hamas activists.
</P>
<P>
He made it clear to Arafat that the closure on the West Bank
and the Gaza Strip, which was imposed Sunday after the suicide
attacks, will continue until Israel is convinced that the PNA is
cracking down on extremist organizations.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Arafat said that he is doing everything he can.
</P>
<P>
According to him, some 150 Hamas activists have been arrested
by the Palestinian security forces since Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese FM Describes US Decision to Extend Travel Ban as Unjustified </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, February 28 -- Lebanese Foreign Minister Farez Boueiz
described here Tuesday night Washington's decision to extend a ban
on Americans' travel to Lebanon as "unjustified," since the
U.S. interests are threatened in most other countries much more
than in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Talking to reporters at Beirut International Airport Tuesday
night following his visits to France and Spain, the foreign
minister stressed that Lebanon's position on the travel ban
imposed by the U.S. Administration on its citizens is "firm and
old."
</P>
<P>
Boueiz pointed out that an improvement of the security
condition in Lebanon since the end of the civil war in 1990 has
made the travel ban an "unjustified decision."
</P>
<P>
"We believe that the security progress and development in
Lebanon in the past five years have made this decision taken
during Lebanon's (civil) war an unjustified one," Boueiz said.
</P>
<P>
"But the American administration wants to maintain this
decision, so this is its business," the foreign minister noted.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that the American interests are threatened in 90
percent of the world countries much more than in Lebanon," he
added, underlining that if the travel ban is linked with any
political consideration related to the negotiations and policies
in the region, "we don't believe it is useful."
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that any political pressure will not force
Lebanon to shift its position on the peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Boueiz said a Sunday suicide bombing in Jerusalem, which
reportedly killed some 27 people and wounded dozens of others,
could affect the internal affairs in Israel, and the Israeli
elections expected in May could have an effect in slowing down
the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
But he expressed a belief that after the Israeli elections,
the problems will be dealt with "with a stronger push."
</P>
<P>
At a hearing session of the Congress, U.S. Assistant Secretary
of State for the Middle East Affairs Robert Pelletreau announced
the decision to extend the ban on American citizens' travel to
Lebanon because "Lebanon is still a dangerous place for the
Americans."
</P>
<P>
"Lebanon remains a sanctuary for militant and organized groups,
which have a history of launching attacks at the Americans,
including Hezbollah, the organization of Abu Nidhal and the
Popular Front-the General Command," Pelletreau made the remarks
before a sub-committee on the Middle East and South Asia in the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
He pointed to an improvement of the security situation in
Lebanon since the last American hostage was released in 1991 and
no attacks targeted the Americans have taken place in that
country in the recent years.
</P>
<P>
"In spite of that, there are still a number of threats for the
Americans and there are enough reasons for a continuity of our
concern on a peace of the Americans in Lebanon," said the
U.S. official.
</P>
<P>
Washington imposed the travel ban in the middle of 1980s
following a series of terrorist attacks against American
interests in Beirut and around the world.

"Iran's attempts to threaten of undermine the neighboring

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Appreciated For Drug Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan is appreciated for
its efforts to combat drug production, according to the 1995
annual report of the International Narcotics Control Board (INCB)
released today.
</P>
<P>
The report available here said, "The Board appreciates that the
illicit poppy cultivation and opium production have been reduced
in Pakistan, mainly in those districts where projects for
integrated development are being implemented."
</P>
<P>
However, the INCB is concerned about the extent of the illicit
trafficking and abuse of narcotic drugs in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
The report said the INCB is aware of the external and internal
difficulties facing Pakistan that hinder efforts by the government
to deal with the problem.
</P>
<P>
The unstable situation in Afghanistan, the non-enforcement of
federal law in tribal areas in the northwestern part of the
country were sited as some of the difficulties facing Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
The INCB appreciates Pakistan's law enforcement actions that
have led to the seizure of substantial amounts of cannabis resin
and opium, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The Board urged Pakistan to give highest priority to
implementing the federal narcotic laws and regulations in tribal
areas where there is substantial illicit cultivation, production,
manufacture and trafficking.
</P>
<P>
The report said the INCB was concerned that successful law
enforcement action is often not followed by the punishment of
traffickers.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, Pakistan and Afghanistan continue to
be important suppliers of illicit drug market in Europe.
</P>
<P>
The INCB was established in 1968 as an independent control
organ for the implementation of the UN drug control treaties.
</P>
<P>
About 140 countries have been parties of different
international conventions on drug control.

<HEADLINE> Iranian FM Begins Tour to Six CIS States </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Ali
Akbar Velayati started today a tour to six Central Asian and
Caucasus states for promoting political and economic relations
with those countries.
</P>
<P>
Heading a high-ranking delegation, Ali Akbar Velayati left this
morning for Uzbekistan at the first leg of the tour which will
also take him to Russia, Belarus, Ukraine, Kyrgyzstan and
Kazakhstan.
</P>
<P>
Mahmoud Mohammadi, spokesman for the Foreign Ministry, said
that Velayati's visit would aim to "strengthen bilateral
relations" and "regional cooperation."
</P>
<P>
Velayati is carrying messages from President Akbar Hashemi
Rafsanjani for heads of state of those six members of the
Commonwealth of the Independent States, inviting them to
participate in the inaugural ceremony of Sarakhs railway, which
will link landlocked Central Asian countries to open sea through
the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
Iran claimed that the railway will entail outstanding
achievements for regional cooperation and development of economic
and transportation ties between the regional countries and other
regions via Iran.
</P>
<P>
The railway will be officially inaugurated in the Iranian
month of Ordibehesht (April-May) in the presence of a number of
heads of state of the regional countries.
</P>
<P>
The other major agenda of Velayati's tour is the ceasefire
between the Tajik government and the opposition which was agreed
upon in Tehran last year under auspices of Tehran and Moscow.
</P>
<P>
Iranian officials said that the issue would be one of the main
axis of Velayati's talks aimed at bolstering peace talks and
materializing a national reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that the main purpose of Velayati trip is
to invite heads of state, including Russian President Boris
Yeltsin, to come to Iran, and smash international isolation and
economic sanction by the United States.
</P>
<P>
To this end, Iran's Deputy Foreign Minister Mahmoud Vaezi will
leave soon to Italy and Switzerland to invite leaders of the two
countries with Rafsanjani's messages.

<HEADLINE> Oman, South Korea to Sign LNG Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Oman is expected to sign
formally a deal to supply liquefied natural gas, LNG, to Republic
of Korea, according to reports reaching here today from Muscat.
</P>
<P>
Oman and the Korea Gas Corp, KGC, signed a letter of intent in
February 1995 for the supply of three million tons a year of Omani
LNG to south Korea for 25 years starting in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Omani industry sources said a definite deal with KGC is
expected to be signed shortly.
</P>
<P>
The reports also quoted Khalifa al Hinai, director-general of
the Gas and Petroleum Department of the Omani Ministry of
Petroleum and Minerals, as saying that a final investment decision
on a proposed 5 billion U.S. dollars LNG project in the Sultanate
is expected to be taken in August.
</P>
<P>
The project's 70 percent of the cost will be met by foreign
bank loans and the rest from equity in the Oman LNG Company which
was formed in 1993 to exploit the country's gas reserves.
</P>
<P>
The project, the largest to be undertaken in this country, is
planed to produce 6.6 million tons of LNG per year and it is
expected to yield Oman a 20 percent increase in its oil and gas
earnings.
</P>
<P>
Oman, an independent Gulf oil producer, produces some 850,000
barrels of crude per day. The proven oil reserves at the end of
1994 were 5 billion barrels.
</P>
<P>
But the Sultanate has rich gas reserve. Total gas reserves,
which stood at 9.8 trillion cubic feet (TCF) in 1990, rose to 25
TCF in 1994.

<HEADLINE> Oculist's Bright Project for Poor Blinds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, February 28 (Xinhua) -- A young Chinese eye surgeon
has given the gift of sight to patients - thanks to a scientific
breakthrough and a donation from an American company.
</P>
<P>
Ophthalmologist Zhang Jingsong recovered the eye-sight of 21
poor cataract sufferers in northeast China's Liaoning Province by
implanting artificial lenses.
</P>
<P>
The doctor,who works at the No.1 Clinical Hospital of the
Chinese Medical University, received the lenses, and some
accessories, free from an American company.
</P>
<P>
Zhang, 41, has twice studied in Japan and made great
achievements in the field of ophthalmology.
</P>
<P>
He has been commended for making outstanding contributions as
an oculist, by the International Artificial Lens Society. He has
also addressed six international symposiums.
</P>
<P>
Some years ago, an old farmer with one eye blind and another
poor-sighted, went to Zhang's clinic with 2,000 yuan and a basket
of eggs.
</P>
<P>
When told that he needed 3,000 yuan as down payment for
hospitalization expenses, the farmer almost burst out crying.
</P>
<P>
Doctor Zhang waived medical expenses for him carefully with the
head nurse. He performed eye surgery on him at a cost of only 750
yuan, and improved his eye-sight substantially.
</P>
<P>
Since then he has been carrying out the "bright project" for
the poor blind.
</P>
<P>
He has tried to bring everything, including microscopes,
imported ophthalmic sutures and even eye drops, to clinics in
rural areas, in order to help the performance of operations.
</P>
<P>
So far he has conducted cataract operations and artificial lens
implantation procedures on 1,000 patients, most of whom have their
eye-sight improved sharply.
</P>
<P>
As the 30 artificial lens donated by the American company will
run out soon, he is still working to collect more lenses.
</P>
<P>
Doctor Zhang also plans to start training courses to teach
doctors in county or district hospitals how to perform artificial
lens implantation operations, and enable cataract sufferers to
have eye operations at a minimum cost.

BEIJING, February 28 (Xinhua) -- China's top research body of
humanities today declared the establishment of its first overseas
funded company.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing Eastern City Company of Cultural and Scientific
Services, has been funded jointly by the Chinese Academy of Social
Sciences (CASS) and the Hong Kong-based New Asia Cultural
Foundation Ltd. with an investment of five million yuan (620,000
U.S. dollars)
</P>
<P>
"The move will help prosper liberal and social sciences,
promote the reunification of China, and speed up the reform and
opening process," said Ru Xin, vice president of the CASS.
</P>
<P>
The company will take advantage of the abundant intellectual
resources of CASS to develop culture-related businesses between
the Chinese mainland, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macao, says Ru.
</P>
<P>
CASS has long been a base for the study of Marxism, and it has
worked out a policy of "opening the research institutes to the
outside world" and "serving the socialist market economy" in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
The academy has a high profile abroad and is being supported by
many foreign foundations. But for many years no foreign businesses
were involved in the research body.

<HEADLINE> Forbes Wins Arizona Rep. Presidential Primary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 27 (Xinhua) -- U.S. multi-millionaire and
publisher Steve Forbes tonight won the Arizona Republican
presidential primary, pushing U.S. Senate majority leader Bob Dole
into a third place behind TV commentator Pat Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
Flat-tax champion Forbes, who came fourth in Iowa Republican
caucuses and New Hampshire primary earlier this month, won
Delaware's primary Saturday, and used that boost to surge past
Buchanan and Dole in the final weekend.
</P>
<P>
With one-third of Arizona's vote counted, Forbes was leading
with some 36 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Arizona win would put Forbes in the lead in the Republican
National Convention delegate count with 59. Buchanan would have 39
and Dole 35.
</P>
<P>
A total of 996 delegates are needed to win the nomination at
the GOP's National Convention in August.
</P>
<P>
To partially offset his loss in Arizona, Dole, the one-time
Republican front-runner, won twice in his backyard states of North
Dakota and South Dakota.
</P>
<P>
But Arizona was believed to be a much bigger prize with 39
delegates all going to the winner.
</P>
<P>
With primaries now coming fast and furious, the Republican
presidential race to oppose Democrat President Bill Clinton in
November 5 election has become even tighter. Forbes' second
primary victory in four days put him back in the thick of the
fight while Dole suffered through another day of voting without
picking up any momentum.

<P>
Second, it is necessary to introduce a resource-efficient
national economic system.
</P>
<P>
Song Jian said that China must establish an industrial
structure and a consumption setup, linking environmental
protection with economic growth, pursue the strategy of resource
efficiency, and change the current situation, marked by high input
but low output, and high energy and raw material consumption, but
low economic returns.
</P>
<P>
Third, it is also imperative to institute a decision-making
mechanism and a coordination and managerial mechanism that will
ensure sustainable development.
</P>
<P>
"China's sustainable development strategy is based on creating
a socialist market economy," he said.
</P>
<P>
Only by relying on a perfect legal system, a policy-making
system and effective supervision over law enforcement and
instituting a decision-making mechanism and a coordination and
managerial mechanism that will ensure sustainable development,
will it be possible to implement the sustainable development
strategy to the letter.
</P>
<P>
It is also imperative to display China's advantage in
intellectual and labor resources and step up international
cooperation and exchanges, Song said.
</P>
<P>
He also cited problems China currently faces in development and
environment, such as a huge population, relative deficiency of
natural resources, ecological deterioration and environmental
pollution.
</P>
<P>
For example, China's population has exceeded 1.2 billion and is
growing at an annual rate of 15 million. "Population expansion and
its adverse impact on resources and environment has become the
primary problem restricting coordinated environmental and economic
development," he said.
</P>
<P>
China's per-capita share of fresh water, farmland, forestry and
grasslands is only 28, 32, 14 and 32 percent of the world's
average, respectively.

<HEADLINE> Taking Road of Sustainable Development: Song Jian (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Taking the road of sustainable
development is an inevitable choice that has been made by China,
according to State Councillor Song Jian.
</P>
<P>
In an article in today's People's Daily, Song, who is also
Minister in charge of the State Science and Technology Commission,
said that expanding the economy, eliminating poverty and achieving
prosperity are the essential goals set in China's development
strategy.
</P>
<P>
Chinese President Jiang Zemin said, "In the modernization
drive, we must take it as an important strategy to achieve
sustainable development."
</P>
<P>
His remark means that in the course of modernization, it is
imperative to seek a development path that will coordinate the
development of the population, the economy, society, environment
and resources, and take into consideration the interests of the
current generation and future generations as well, Song explained.
</P>
<P>
"This means sustainable development. Taking the road of
sustainable development is an inevitable choice that has been made
in China's development strategy," he noted.
</P>
<P>
To implement the sustainable development strategy, the Chinese
government has worked out a "China 21st century agenda," he said.
</P>
<P>
The agenda has set the goal for China's sustainable development
as "instituting a sustainable development economic system and
social system, and maintaining a compatible basis for resource and
environment which can be used in a sustained manner."
</P>
<P>
According to Song, to implement the sustainable development
strategy, China currently needs to work hard in five areas.
</P>
<P>
First, it is necessary to enhance the awareness of the
population and the environment.
</P>
<P>
He described family planning and environmental protection as
"the two most basic components" of the sustainable development
strategy.
</P>
<P>
He said, "Family planning is the nucleus of the basis for
creating a society that will achieve sustainable
development. Environmental protection (including pollution control
and ecologic improvement) constitutes the material basis for
ensuring sustainable development."

<HEADLINE> Atlanta Police to Get Extra Olympic Overtime Money </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 27 (Xinhua) -- The City Council of
Atlanta has responded to police officer demands by earmarking an
additional 2.5 million U.S. dollars in overtime funds for work
during the month of Olympic Games this summer.
</P>
<P>
Police unions said officers would have to give up part-time
jobs to work the extended 12-hour, six-day Olympic shifts and so
would be receiving less money than usual, even with previous
overtime pay totals.
</P>
<P>
The money, coming from nine million U.S. dollars saved in 1995
by not filling staff vacancies, ensures no monetary loss by
police, fire and prison employees.

<HEADLINE> Sluggish Auto Sales in January </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Vehicle sales in China
suffered a slowdown last month, marking a pause in the continuous
increases reported in the fourth quarter of 1995.
</P>
<P>
A number of truck and light-duty bus producers in China last
month registered only half of the sales of the previous month. But
some car and mini automobile plants still managed to maintain a
good market performance levels, said the China Machinery and
Electronics Daily.
</P>
<P>
The Dongfeng Automobile Company, one of China's largest
automobile makers, sold 6,121 vehicles last month, a drop of 48
per cent from the 11,675 sold the previous month.
</P>
<P>
The lower sales margins of other large enterprises, including
the Yuejin and Gold Cup, stood between 45 and 55 per cent down, as
the survey showed.
</P>
<P>
The sluggish automobile market probably will not see a revival
this month, said the paper, because the Spring Festival, the most
important traditional holiday for the Chinese people, fell on
February 19.
</P>
<P>
The paper predicted that the first sales surge of this year
will appear in middle March. However, the sales volume of the
first quarter is expected to be lower than the corresponding
period of last year.

<HEADLINE> Ostriches Survive Freezing Winter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, February 28 (Xinhua) -- The world's largest bird -
the ostrich - has been raised naturally in China's icy winter
conditions for the first time.
</P>
<P>
Temperatures as low as minus 23 degrees centigrade failed to
ruffle the feathers of the big birds, raised in natural winter
conditions in northeast China's Liaoning Province.
</P>
<P>
A private firm in Shenyang invested more than 1.3 million yuan
(about 156,600 US dollars) last November to raise 11 African
ostriches, introduced from the southern province of Guangdong with
the help of the ostrich experts from Guangdong Academy of
Agricultural Sciences.
</P>
<P>
The birds have been living normally in a 900 square meter farm
in the wild, on the outskirts of the city, with no cold-proof
facilities.
</P>
<P>
Their weight increased by an average of 30 kg each in three
months, though the maximum low temperature fell at one time to
minus 23 degrees centigrade, experts said.
</P>
<P>
China began to raise ostriches, a native of sandy area of South
Africa, in 1988 in Guangdong Province. At present, a number of
provinces, including Yunnan, Shanxi, Shandong and the capital city
of Beijing have set up ostrich farms.
</P>
<P>
The ostrich has an average life span of 70 years, a breeding
period of 50 years, and can lay 100 eggs a year. The price for
ostrich meat is 10 times as high as that of beef, and its skin is
regarded as a high-grade leather, known for its softness,
durability and beauty, experts said.
</P>
<P>
The successful raising ostriches in natural conditions in the
cold weather in northeast China has drawn attention from among
other potential ostrich raisers in the region.

<HEADLINE> Coalition Deal Clenched in New Zealand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, February 28 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand's ruling
National Party signed a deal with a smaller party, the United
Party, today to ensure its hold on power till the general election
later this year.
</P>
<P>
The deal also means that the two parties will form a coalition
in the government under the Mixed Member Proportional
representation system (MMP) after the election.
</P>
<P>
The United Party will support the National in Parliament on
confidence issues. The National promised a seat for the United in
the new cabinet after the election.
</P>
<P>
With the deal, the National and the United will enjoy 50 seats
in the 99-member Parliament. The National has also got the
support from Christian Democrats leader Graeme Lee, pushing its
majority to 51.
</P>
<P>
Today's deal is crucial for the National if it wants to
continue to rule after the election. It is widely believed that
the next government will have to be a coalition as no party is
expected to win a majority under the MMP system.

<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, February 28 (Xinhua) -- A modern town built by farmers
in South China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region is mushrooming
in Bobai County.
</P>
<P>
Designed by Liu Cunyu, a young entrepreneur based in the area,
the new town is the first of its kind in the autonomous region.
</P>
<P>
The so-called Langba Farmer City is 300 km from Nanning,
capital of Guangxi.
</P>
<P>
The town, which will cover a total area of 53 hectares and
become home to 30,000 people, is expected to provide jobs for
2,800 people when the first phase of work finishes.
</P>
<P>
When the whole project has been completed, 210,000 people from
a surrounding area of around 600 square kilometers will benefit.
</P>
<P>
Since 1994, more than 38 million yuan has been injected into
the new town. Now work on a hospital and drainage system has been
completed, and work on hotels, markets and streets is half way
through.
</P>
<P>
Over the next few years, the town is expected to build schools,
theaters, commercial offices and four sino-overseas joint ventures.
</P>
<P>
It will also have government agencies, administrative
organizations such as police office, taxation bureau and
industrial and commercial departments.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that construction of the new town will not only
help promote the local economy, but also help ease the problems
caused by a surplus of rural labor.

<HEADLINE> Computer System Facilitates Air Cargo Transport In China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 28 (Xinhua) -- China's first nationwide
computer system for air cargo transport has reached advanced
global levels, it was reported today.
</P>
<P>
Experts in Beijing who have appraised the system here agreed
that it has reached the high levels of the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
A national key scientific and technological project,
development of the system started two years ago.
</P>
<P>
"The system has so far connected six major air traffic hubs in
China, including Xiamen, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Chengdu,
facilitating air cargo transport business in the cities." said
Zhang Linping, an official with the Management Information System
of the Civil Aviation Administration of China (MIS/CAAC), which
developed the computer system.
</P>
<P>
He said MIS/CAAC introduced hardware and software for the
system from the United States, Italy and Singapore, and adapted
the software to meet the requirements of air cargo transport
business in China.
</P>
<P>
Supported by domestic and international civil aviation
telecommunication networks, the system is able to link up major
domestic and international air traffic destinations, Zhang added.
</P>
<P>
This year the system will connect more than ten domestic
destinations, and for the first time will link with international
networks, Zhang noted.
</P>
<P>
Six major Chinese air carriers have already joined the system,
with Shanghai-based China Eastern Airlines becoming the first to
link up with international networks through the new system.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka has adopted
stringent security measures to guarantee the safety of its capital
Colombo, in particular its business center the Fort, officials
sources said today.
</P>
<P>
These measures have been adopted following the vehicle bomb
attack on January 31 by suicide bombers of the Liberation Tigers
of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) at the Central Bank in the heart of
Colombo's commercial center, during which over 90 people were
killed and about 1,400 others injured.
</P>
<P>
Under the measures, no heavy vehicles, such as trucks,
containers and bowsers, will be allowed within city limits between
7 a.m. and 5 p.m. starting today.
</P>
<P>
Without police permits, vehicles violating the measure will be
towed away and dismantled, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Heavy vehicles carrying vegetables, fish and other food will be
allowed into the area before 7 a.m..
</P>
<P>
Sniffer dogs specially trained to detect explosives will be
deployed in Colombo starting today.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE is reportedly planning to use explosive-laden trucks
parked on major bridges leading to the city. Starting from
Tuesday, security personnel manning the check points at the
bridges have been instructed Tuesday to search all heavy vehicles
thoroughly before they are allowed onto the bridges.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE has been conducting a 13-year war against the
government for a separate state, during which over 50,000 people
were reportedly killed.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Bangladesh's Economy Suffering from  Political Impasse  (by Tian Fan) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dhaka, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's political turmoil
is jeopardizing the economy's growth prospects by vitiating the
investment environment, hitting major export industries and
damaging the country's image abroad, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
"The economy has already started bleeding and this will
continue unless the political problems are solved," said Atiur
Rahman, senior research fellow at the Bangladesh Institute of
Development Studies.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh is enduring a nearly two-year-old political wrangle
as main opposition parties insisted upon a general election under
a neutral government and resorted to street agitation and general
strikes off and on.
</P>
<P>
Rahman warned that the macro-economic gains will disappear very
fast, inflation will get worse, investors both foreign and local
will shy away and exports will shrink gradually unless an
immediate settlement is made.
</P>
<P>
The country's inflation rate has already doubled to about nine
percent in less than a year.
</P>
<P>
What is worse, Bangladesh's foreign exchange reserves dwindled
to 2.3 billion US dollars at the end of January from 3.4 billion
last year.
</P>
<P>
The export-oriented industries, especially the ready-made
garments (RMG) sector, took the greatest blow from the ongoing
political turmoil.
</P>
<P>
There are about 2,400 RMG units in Bangladesh with a total
workforce estimated at 1.2 million and the sector earned 1.9
billion US dollars in the form of export receipts in 1994-95
fiscal year, 63 percent of the country's total export earnings for
the year.
</P>
<P>
However, orders for Bangladeshi garments worth millions of
dollars had already been canceled as a result of the uncertain
political situation and at least one-fourth of the garment units
would be forced to close down after July if this situation
continues, the industry sources said.
</P>
<P>
Although the government has accepted privatization and other
reforms program supported by the World Bank and other
international donors, the reforms process is rather slow due to
the lack of political consensus and a strong government.
</P>
<P>
Only 12 public sector enterprises have been transferred to the
private sector over the past five years, and most of the much
required economic reforms beginning from the early 1990s has
slowed down.
</P>
<P>
The donors have expressed their concern about the country's
slow pace of reforms and implicated that they will cut down the
amount of aid in the current fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
As one of the most undeveloped countries, Bangladesh receives
around 2 billion US dollars annually from international donors.

The World Bank, which sponsors the "Bangladesh Aid Club"
meeting every year in April, has postponed the 1996 meeting to
July. The bank's officials in Dhaka said the postponement is the
result of the country's political uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
"It is unfortunate that the political wisdom of our politicians
has gone down to such an extend that they allowed such a funny
situation," a Finance Ministry official said.
</P>
<P>
He blamed both the ruling and opposition parties for the
crisis, which, he added, had destroyed the prospect of having a
high growth.
</P>
<P>
It is widely believed that the country's gross domestic product
is unlikely to grow 4 percent against the target of 6 percent for
1995-96 fiscal year ending in June.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai's Gold Consumption Booms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, February 28 (Xinhua) -- The glitter of gold is
shining down on Shanghai. China's largest industrial and business
center, has become one of the country's largest gold markets, with
gold consumption per capita topping the country.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the city's total consumption of gold products
reached 15 tons of the much loved metal.
</P>
<P>
So far, 22 gold and jewels enterprises have been established in
the city, with more than 400 retail counters in the shops.
</P>
<P>
Almost two thirds of Shanghai people own gold articles, which
places the city second in China, next to Guangzhou, capital of
Guangdong Province, in terms of ownership of the gold products.
</P>
<P>
From 1990, the average income of local workers has continued to
rise, reaching about 7,300 yuan last year. This helped to
stimulate the purchase of gold articles.
</P>
<P>
However, many people originally bought gold ornaments as an
edge against inflation years ago.
</P>
<P>
Recent years have seen great changes in consumption
motives. People are now more likely to buy the ornaments because
they like, and jewelry to enhance their own beauty, rather than
because of fears about inflation.
</P>
<P>
But gold ornaments, along with stocks and bonds, and real
estate are still the most popular forms of investments among local
residents.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Manager Says No to Pirate CDs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 28 (Xinhua) -- The general manager of
Beijing's first producer of CDs has slammed pirate disc makers for
harming the industry.
</P>
<P>
The Yuncheng Laser Audio &AMP; Video Company, based in the
capital's northeastern suburb of Miyun, is to start production
soon.
</P>
<P>
"I do not, and will not produce pirated CDs," the 33-year-old
general manager, Liu Yonglian told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
The new factory is a non-pollution enterprise close to the
Miyun Reservoir, one of the major water suppliers to the capital.
</P>
<P>
Co-funded by businesses from China and Singapore, with a total
investment almost three million US dollars, the plant is expected
to produce two million laser discs a year.
</P>
<P>
Liu said that "the company would be ruined" if pirated CDs were
discovered to have come from the factory.
</P>
<P>
Some fake CD producers in south China have been heavily
punished by Copyright Bureaus. Production lines of some were
closed down, and other pirate producers were suspended from
operating.
</P>
<P>
Liu said that as the first laser disc producer in the country's
capital city, the Yuncheng Company "is incumbent to present itself
as a model for its counterparts across the nation."
</P>
<P>
"Our copyrights are from respected domestic publishing houses
and major research institutes, and the copyrights we buy from
overseas must be confirmed by the State Copyright Bureau before
production starts," he said.
</P>
<P>
He believes that China has a huge market potential for laser
discs, and additionally CDs can be major boost for the
recreational industry.
</P>
<P>
Liu also believes that disc technology could provide a better
and more convenient way of storing the abundant number of books
and other material in libraries and research institutions in the
country.
</P>
<P>
"Chinese consumers will need hi-tech devices, just as people in
other parts of the world have seen their living standards lifted,"
he said, adding that "the development of science and culture in
China also needs our help."
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government is strengthening control over the audio
and video industry, by implementing a series of appropriate laws
and regulations. The government action means that manufacturers of
authorized CDs are enjoying a turn for the better.
</P>
<P>
"Why should I put myself and the company at risk by making fake
products?" Liu exclaimed, saying he would not like to see anyone's
legal rights infringed.
</P>
<P>
Omyia Lee, the Singaporean business counterpart stationed in
the factory, agreed with Liu, saying "We are confident with our
investment in the production of authorized CDs in China as we can
see the government is serious in cracking down on pirates."
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government discovered that among over 30 CD
producers, ten factories broke the law by producing illicit goods.
</P>
<P>
Government copyright supervisors have been stationed at the
factories still operating to prevent further copyright
violations. Some were banned from production altogether - an
illustration of the seriousness which the government attaches to
the problem.
</P>
<P>
The State Administration of Press and Publication says not a
single pirated product has been discovered in any of the
factories, since the strictly clampdown was introduced.
</P>
<P>
Liu's factory will also have a supervisor stationed there when
it starts production.

<HEADLINE> New Bangladeshi Cabinet Not to Be Formed Before Elections  Complete </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, February 28 (Xinhua) -- The incumbent interim government
of Bangladesh has decided not to form the new cabinet before the
completion of the postponed elections in some constituencies, the
local press said today.
</P>
<P>
Policy-makers of the ruling Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP)
made the decision here Sunday at a meeting chaired by Prime
Minister Begum Khaleda Zia.
</P>
<P>
Most of the BNP leaders agreed at the meeting that the
government's priority is to form a full-fledged parliament of 330
members (30 women members to be elected by MPs) to give
constitutional legitimacy to the new cabinet.
</P>
<P>
In the February 15 elections that were boycotted by mainstream
opposition parties, the ruling BNP seized enough seats to form a
new cabinet. But voting in 92 constituencies has been postponed
because of violence and rigging.
</P>
<P>
Some BNP leaders said that setting up the new cabinet before
elections are completed in all the constituencies might cause
dissatisfaction among those candidates who might lose the
elections.
</P>
<P>
The government would also have to decide how many seats should
be conceded to the opposition parties who are contesting in the
elections on certain conditions, including assurance of some
seats.
</P>
<P>
The Election Commission of Bangladesh has announced in the
official gazette the election results of 208 constituencies, of
which the BNP won 206.

<P>
NANNING, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Agricultural development in
south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region has had a strong
appeal to Taiwan investors in recent years.
</P>
<P>
More than 50 agriculture-related projects, involving a total of
30 million US dollars from Taiwan, have been built in the region.
</P>
<P>
They cover a wide range of fields including crop-growing,
aquaculture and farm produce processing.
</P>
<P>
As the two areas share similar climates and geological
positions, cultivation techniques imported from Taiwan can be
applied in Guangxi without experiment, said a regional
agricultural official.
</P>
<P>
This year, the local government has announced a series of
preferential policies to encourage investors to pour funds to more
areas.
</P>
<P>
Major cooperation projects include the construction of an
agricultural base, popularization of imported crop and livestock
strains and some processing items.

<P>
SEOUL, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Five more former officers were

military coup and the 1980 crackdown on pro-democracy
demonstrators.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Pakistan Launches Electoral Reforms  (by Hu Xiaoming) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan government has
launched electoral reforms in the country with Monday's approval
of a report submitted by the Electoral Reforms Committee.
</P>
<P>
The report suggested holding provincial and national assembly
polls on the same day, lifting the condition of National Identity
Card (ID) and giving dual voting right to minorities.
</P>
<P>
"The report contains recommendations aimed at substantially
changing the country's electoral system so as to make it more
transparent, eliminate chances of rigging, reduce election
expenses and improve and modernize the entire system to suit the
requirements of a modern democracy," said Federal Information
Minister Khalid Ahmed Kharal.
</P>
<P>
The proposed electoral reforms requiring a constitutional
amendment would be soon presented before the National Assembly in
the form of a bill.
</P>
<P>
The committee, which was constituted in October 1994, suggested
 removing the requirement of the ID cards for the voters, saying
it would eliminate chances of abuse of ID cards by wealthy and
influential candidates and help check the use of bogus ID cards
for polling.
</P>
<P>
The committee argued that holding national and provincial
assembly polls on the same day would help maintain law and order,
avoid unnecessary expenditure and reduce tension and disorder
during the period between the two polls.
</P>
<P>
The committee, calling for using transparent ballot boxes in
future general election so as to guard their pre-poll stuffing,
has prepared samples of such boxes having windows on two opposite
sides fitted with unbreakable transparent plastic sheets.
</P>
<P>
Ballot boxes of different colors representing national and
provincial assemblies will be used.
</P>
<P>
The minorities will be allowed to cast votes in elections for
general seats in addition to their right to vote in elections for
their reserved seats.
</P>
<P>
It was decided that the election expenses of individual
candidates would be limited and hoarding, banners of all sizes and
wall-chalking would be completely banned.
</P>
<P>
Advertisements by individual candidates in newspapers will not
be allowed and only the political parties would be permitted to
place advertisements of a total cost of up to 10 million rupees
(about 278,000 US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The cabinet also decided that election results would be
tabulated by the returning officer and announced by the district
returning officer while the postal ballots would have to be cast
in advance but opened and counted on the elections day in the
presence of nominees of the candidates.
</P>
<P>
Each candidate will have to pay the election fee of 10,000
rupees (about 278 dollars) in the case of National Assembly and
5,000 rupees (about 139 dollars) in the case of provincial
assemblies which would be non-refundable.
</P>
<P>
Defending the electoral reforms, Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto
said the package would eliminate any chances of rigging in the
polls.
</P>
<P>
However, the opposition Pakistan Muslim League, led by former
prime minister Nawaz Sharif, after holding a three-hour-long
meeting Tuesday, rejected the government's reform package.
</P>
<P>
The opposition, in its reaction to the electoral reforms
package, dubbed it as part of the government's grand design to rig
the next elections and manipulate the election results.
</P>
<P>
The opposition accused the government of taking controversial
decisions on key issues without taking the opposition into
confidence.

<HEADLINE> Portugal Registers 2,780 AIDS Cases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LISBON, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Portugal has registered 2,780
AIDS cases by the end of last year, with 1,724 of the sufferers
already dead, according to a report by a national commission.
</P>
<P>
The commission attributes the spread of the Acquired
Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) to syringe sharing among drug
addicts, sexual behavior and blood contamination.
</P>
<P>
In 1991, 25 percent of the AIDS sufferers were drug addicts.
That figure rose to 50 percent in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The health authorities have taken a series of steps to stem the
spread of HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, such as exchange of
used syringes for clean ones, tighter control on blood banks and
an awareness campaign for safe sex.
</P>
<P>
The country has also strengthened the research on AIDS and
opened hotlines on the disease.
</P>
<P>
Portugal, with the largest number of HIV-2 virus carriers,
leads other European countries in the research of the virus strain.
</P>
<P>
Experts predict that the number of AIDS sufferers in Portugal
would rise to 8,000 by the year 2000.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Consumer Confidence Rebounds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Consumers in the United
States have greatly improved their confidence this month, walking
out of a pessimistic mood in January, according to a survey
published here today by a private research group.
</P>
<P>
The February index of consumer confidence measured by the New
York-based Conference Board increased to a reading of 97, a gain
of more than eight points over last month.
</P>
<P>
"The bounce back of consumer sentiment in February suggests
that the drop registered last month was largely a result of
one-time circumstances -- the blizzard of '96, the government
shutdown, the many lay-off announcements -- rather than a signal
for consumers that severe economic hardship was on the way," Edgar
Fielder, vice president of the board, said.
</P>
<P>
The board's monthly consumer confidence survey is based on a
representative sample of 5,000 U.S. households.
</P>
<P>
The research group reported that the proportion of consumers
who feel ongoing business conditions are "bad" increased slightly
to 19 percent from December's reading of 18 percent.
</P>
<P>
Looking ahead to the next six months, consumers are less
optimistic than in December. A greater proportion feel the state
of the economy will worsen, while about the same proportion feel
business conditions will improve in the months ahead.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, the U.S. Commerce Department reported that
retail sales dipped 0.3 percent in January, the worst performance
in six months. A report on wholesale prices, meanwhile, showed
only a 0.3 percent rise in January, a substantial moderation after
December's 0.6 percent increase.
</P>
<P>
But some analysts said optimism among consumers might mean less
optimism among investors in the stock market, who are hoping for
lower interest rates.
</P>
<P>
Investors fear that increased consumer spending will reduce the
incentive for the Federal Reserve to push down interest rates to
stimulate the economy.

<HEADLINE> Dialogue Urged to Resolve Bangladesh's Political  Impasse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Business leaders in Bangladesh
have urged all political parties to start dialogues at any cost
for resolving the nagging political crisis which has started
taking toll of the national economy.
</P>
<P>
The call was contained in a joint statement published here
today by the Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the
Dhaka Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the Foreign Investor's
Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
</P>
<P>
In the statement, the chamber leaders said, "The country's
economy, which has suffered immensely, will deteriorate further if
immediate moves are not taken to defuse the crisis."
</P>
<P>
While the ruling Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) held sixth
parliamentary elections along with some small parties and
independent candidates on February 15, all opposition parties have
boycotted the polls process and launched nationwide
"non-cooperation movement" for the fifth day today, demanding
cancellation of the polls and holding of a fresh general election
under a neutral caretaker government.
</P>
<P>
The business leaders alleged that anti-social elements have
been given political patronage so as to maintain strength of the
political parties in street agitation and violence.
</P>
<P>
"Business people will feel reassured and their morale will be
restored if the illegal activities of undesirable elements are
checked firmly," the statement said.

KATHMANDU, February 28 (Xinhua) -- One hundred and fifty
Bhutanese refugees were released unconditionally Tuesday after an
Indian court judged that their arrests were illegal, reports

<HEADLINE> hke022809 --Australia's Asian Policy To Remain Intact: Opposition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Australia's opposition leader
John Howard said that a coalition government would maintain the
current foreign policies toward Asia if he was elected prime
minister Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"I make it very clear to all Australians that the importance of
our association with the (Asian) region will remain unchanged
under a change of government," he told the National Press Club
here.
</P>
<P>
In his policy speech before the March 2 federal election, he
said that there was a bi-partisan consistence of Australia's
policy toward Asia.
</P>
<P>
He said that the country's policy of merging into Asia was the
result of contributions of both the opposition and the Labor
government.
</P>
<P>
He said that he would obviously make his first overseas visit
to an Asian country if he became the new prime minister.
</P>
<P>
According to the foreign policy package released by the
opposition coalition in the election campaign, a coalition
government is to make Australia fully engaged with the East Asian
region, while maintaining and developing links with countries
beyond the region.
</P>
<P>
Howard reiterated the coalition's stand that Australia was at
an intersection of history and geography. He said that Australia
would continue to forge relations with the Asian region and at the
same time maintained its traditional links with Europe and North
America.
</P>
<P>
The coalition of Liberal and National parties enjoyed a
comfortable lead over the Labor Party just three days before the
election.

<HEADLINE> More Opposition Leaders Arrested in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, February 28 (Xinhua) -- More opposition leaders in
Bangladesh have been arrested as the opposition-launched
"non-cooperation movement" against the government is going on.
</P>
<P>
Sources concerned said that the Awami (People's) League
presidium member Tofael Ahmed and the Jamaate-e-Islami Publicity
Secretary Abdul Qader Mollah were picked up by police Tuesday and
sent to the Dhaka Central Jail.
</P>
<P>
Earlier the police arrested some other opposition leaders and
workers including the Jatiya (National) Party Secretary General
Anwar Hossain Manju and presidium member Moudud Ahmed and the
Awami League Organizing Secretary Mohammed Nasim and Agricultural
Affairs Secretary Begum Motia Chowdhury.
</P>
<P>
The government ordered a swoop on the opposition leaders and
workers since the launching of the non-cooperation movement last
Saturday, demanding for cancellation of the ruling party-held "one
party farcical" general elections of February 15 and holding of a
free and fair general election under a neutral caretaker
government.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, life across the country remained paralyzed Tuesday
as the opposition parties enforced their non-cooperation movement
for the fourth day. Clashes took place mainly in Tongi,
Chittagong and some areas in Dhaka. Some government and ruling
party offices were torched and dozens of people were hurt.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Government Borrowing Doubles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 28 (Xinhua) -- The borrowing by the
government of Pakistan from banks doubled the target set in the
1995-96 annual credit plan, said a press release of the State Bank
of Pakistan published here today.
</P>
<P>
Government borrowing for the budgetary support is expected to
be contained at 28.1 billion rupees (about 0.93 billion US
dollars) during the current fiscal year. However, it stood at 59.5
billion rupees (1.98 billion dollars) as on February 8, it said.
</P>
<P>
On the other side, the State Bank is able to contain expansion
of credit to the private sector within the credit plan limits.
</P>
<P>
Private sector credit expanded by 52.7 billion rupees (1.76
billion dollars) by February 8, as against the target of 64
billion rupees (2.13 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
Similarly, lending by the specialized credit institutions was
also contained effectively within the credit plan limits.
</P>
<P>
The State Bank noted that there is a declining trend in
inflation, as in the first seven months of 1995-96. The annual
rate of inflation measured by the Consumer Price Index was 6.7
percent compared with 10 percent in the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
During 1994-95 fiscal year, the inflation rate reached a record
12.9 percent, far exceeding the official target of 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
The State Bank in its annual report last year attributed the
high inflation rate mainly to excessive government borrowing from
banking system, which led to monetary expansion at 16.6 percent as
against the 11.8 percent target.
</P>
<P>
The monetary expansion this year is being controlled remarkably
and is at 12.1 percent at present, the press release said.
</P>
<P>
The government has set a 9.5 percent inflation rate for the
1995-96 fiscal year from July 1, 1995 to June 30, 1996.

JAKARTA, February 28 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government has
sent a medical team to Irian Jaya villages where an epidemic has
reportedly killed 177 people.
</P>
<P>
The team has been sent to Brome and Ndugwa villages, Wamena
district, Jayawijaya regency, to investigate the cause and actual
number of victims of the epidemic, the symptoms of which were
difficulty in breathing and vomiting up blood, according to Hadi
M. Abednego, director general of communicable disease control and
environmental health of the Health Ministry, here today.
</P>
<P>
It was not immediately clear when the epidemic first broke out
and the deaths occurred.
</P>
<P>
Hadi noted that the cause could be anything, from dengue,
diarrhea, poor sanitation or any virus from local animals, such as
pigs.
</P>
<P>
Kompas daily quoted Jayawijaya Regent Wenas as saying that
medical help arrived too late because the reports came in too
late.
</P>
<P>
Due to the lack of telecommunications facilities, reports of
the epidemic reached the local health authorities through couriers
who had to travel through difficult terrain.

<P>
BEIJING, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Hungary and Guatemala Tuesday
reacted differently to Cuba's February 24 downing of two U.S.
aircraft piloted by exiled Cubans based in Miami.
</P>
<P>
Hungary expressed support for a U.N. Security Council
statement, which "strongly deplores" the shooting down of the two
unarmed U.S. aircraft by the Cuban air force, said reports from
Budapest today.
</P>
<P>
Hungary denounced the Cuban act as violating international law,
the Foreign Ministry spokesman Gabor Szentivanyi told the
Hungarian news agency.
</P>
<P>
He added that his country supports the will of the
international community to conduct a thorough investigation into
the incident.
</P>
<P>
However, Guatemalan President Alvaro Arzu Irigoyen criticized
the U.S. government's decision to tighten economic blockade
against Cuba.
</P>
<P>
The president described the U.S. decision as "deplorable" and
"way off target," according to a report reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, reports from the Chilean city of Santiago said the
National Solidarity with Cuba Movement (NSCM) in Chile sided with
the Cubans in the downing of the U.S. planes over the Cuban
territorial waters.
</P>
<P>
The planes were piloted by "terrorists" of an anti-Castro
organization, whose activities are to violate the Cuban territory
to disseminate subversive propaganda, the NSCM said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council adopted a statement Monday condemning
Cuba and requested that the International Civil Aviation
Organization investigate this incident.

On Saturday, the Cuban air force shot down two light planes
belonging to the Miami-based Cuban exile group, Brothers to the

BEIJING, February 28 (Xinhua) -- An official with the National
Environmental Protection Agency (NEPA) said that experimental
programs in which fees were collected from firms discharging
sulphur dioxide have reduced such discharges by 30 percent,
reported today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Over the next five years, such programs will be reformed and
established nationwide, according to Lu Xinyuan, deputy director
of the Supervision and Management Department of NEPA.
</P>
<P>
The levy -- 0.2 yuan (2.38 cents) per kilogram of sulphur
dioxide discharge -- was collected experimentally in two provinces
and nine cities for over three years, Lu said.
</P>
<P>
These experiments showed that the collection of fees had
spurred the enterprises to tackle the problem of sulphur dioxide
in the environment.
</P>
<P>
Experiments with new methods of collecting fees will be carried
out this year in some cities of East China's Jiangsu Province,
said Wang Dongqing, a division chief in Lu's department.

Under one proposed method, fees will be collected for all the

<P>
GUANGZHOU, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Officials in south China's
Guangdong Province have launched a crackdown to curb cheating by
overseas investors.
</P>
<P>
They have already uncovered swindles amounting to more than 100
mllion US dollars, all centered on the overvaluing of invested
equipment.
</P>
<P>
The target of the Provincial Administration for the Inspection
of Import and Export Commodities have been equipment investments
by overseas investors, a common swindle in joint ventures.
</P>
<P>
Information from the Administration show that it has completed
2,500 assessments of equipment imported by overseas investors, as
their investment in sino-overseas joint ventures.
</P>
<P>
In the assessments, administration officials found that
overseas investors overvalued their equipment by an average of 8.6
percent - representing a total value of 108 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
In the Special Economic Zone of Zhuhai, the administration
discovered that one overseas investor of a joint venture project
exaggerated 16.84 million Hong Kong dollars worth of equipment by
7.2 million HK dollars.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the administration say their work has prevented
the invisible loss of state assets and helped to clean-up the
local investment environment.

As China opens to the outside world, more and more foreign

Unfortunately, there are some agents who seem to be more

<HEADLINE> Christopher: U.S. to Continue Support for Central America </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, February 27 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Warren Christopher said today that his country will continue to
support Central America to achieve sustainable development,
according to a report from San Salvador.
</P>
<P>
Before winding up his 3-day visit to El Salvador, Christopher
told Salvadoran businessmen that his country "is firmly decided to
support this new association" between the United States and
Central America with an eye to the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. will continue to work with all the Central American
governments to strengthen their association with respect to
environment protection, Christopher said.
</P>
<P>
He said that at least four Central American countries, which he
did not elaborate, are implementing a U.S. initiative earmarked to
protect environment in the areas of reforestation and construction
of energy stations.
</P>
<P>
"Working together to protect natural resources of Central
America has to do with trade, because it opens up opportunities
for the development and the commercialization of new environmental
technologies," he said.
</P>
<P>
El Salvador is the first leg of Christopher's Central America
tour. He is scheduled to fly to Chile Wednesday after meeting with
presidents of Central American nations in San Salvador, capital of
El Salvador.
</P>
<P>
Christopher pledged that Washington would donate a package of
10 million dollars to El Salvador.
</P>
<P>
Central America, which groups Belize, Guatemala, Honduras, El
Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica and Panama, has signed an
agreement to cooperate with the United States for development.
</P>
<P>
These countries, already a fast-growing market for U.S.
exports, have committed themselves to creating a free trade zone
before 2005 in an agreement adopted at a summit meeting in Miami
in December 1994.

<HEADLINE> Germany's BASF Plans to Double Market Share in Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, February 27 (Xinhua) -- BASF, one of Germany's three
chemical giants, plans to double its market share in Asia in the
next 15 years and increase investment in the region, a director of
the company, Volker Frantz, told a newspaper here.
</P>
<P>
The company plans to boost its sales in Asia to 15 billion
marks (about 10.3 billion U.S. dollars) in 2010 from 1995's 5.45
billion marks (3.76 billion dollars), Frantz said.
</P>
<P>
BASF's investment in Asia now stands at 3.3 billion marks (2.28
billion dollars) and its sales in the region increased by 15
percent for two consecutive years in 1994 and 1995.
</P>
<P>
In the medium- and long-term, Asia will be the largest chemical
market in the world, Frantz said, adding that a chemical
manufacturer has to lead in Asia before it could lead the world.
</P>
<P>
According to company predictions, Asia will remain a chemical
importer and will not challenge European chemical producers well
into the next century.
</P>
<P>
BASF is especially interested in China, where it already has
eight joint ventures and a holding company.
</P>
<P>
It has become the biggest foreign chemical enterprise in China
with an investment of one billion marks (690 million dollars),
almost one third of its total investment in Asia.
</P>
<P>
BASF is now negotiating to establish a comprehensive chemical
base in the eastern city of Nanjing with an investment of several
billion marks. If the negotiations succeed, construction would
begin in 1997.
</P>
<P>
A comprehensive chemical base comprises a series of plants in
which the next plant takes as raw material the previous plant's
by-product.
</P>
<P>
Besides the planned base in Nanjing, BASF is also planning to
set up two more in India and Southeast Asia. The company currently
has four comprehensive chemical bases in Europe and the United
States.

million in 1984.
</P>

The report defines "extreme poverty" as occurring when total
income earned in a household is less than the cost of a basic food
basket, meaning that household income is not enough to feed a
family.
</P>
<P>
The two agencies attributed the improvement of living standards
to the economic policies of the Mexican government.

<HEADLINE> Diplomat: Cuba Prepared for U.S. Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Cuba is prepared for
sanctions imposed by the United States after the downing of two
small planes that violated Cuban air space, Cuba's ambassador to
Panama said.
</P>
<P>
Carlos Alberto Mas Zabala said that Cuba would not surrender
its sovereignty under the threat of sanctions imposed by the
U.N. Security Council or other governments, the local press
reported today.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton Monday announced new sanctions
against Cuba after a Cuban Air Force MiG shot down two small
planes belonging to the Florida-based Cuban exiles' organization,
"Brothers to the Rescue," last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, the U.N. Security Council issued a statement
deploring the incident and requesting the International Civil
Aviation Organization to investigate.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions announced by Clinton include restrictions on the
movement of Cuban diplomats, the suspension of chartered flights
to Havana and a proposal to tighten the economic embargo against
that Caribbean island.
</P>
<P>
Cuba is prepared for "the existing sanctions and those to come
from the United States as a consequence of the incident," Zabala
said.
</P>
<P>
"The Cuban government has unequivocal proof of the intrusion of
the two pirate aircraft into its air space," said the diplomat.
</P>
<P>
The evidence "consists of maps showing minute-by-minute radar
detection, taped conversations and even objects recovered during
the search for the remains of the two small planes that were shot
down," said Zabala.
</P>
<P>
Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina, who arrived in the
United Nations today, has asked for the U.N. General Assembly to
be reconvened so that he can explain the shooting down of the two
planes.

<HEADLINE> Rush to Leave Liverpool after 15 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 27 (Xinhua) -- International Striker Ian Rush
said on Tuesday that he would be leaving Liverpool on a free
transfer at the end of the season after spending 15 years at
Anfield.
</P>
<P>
Rush, 34, who has a career total of 404 goals including a
record 345 for Liverpool, is still club captain but has failed to
dislodge young strikers Stan Collymore or Robbie Fowler from the
starting line-up since recovering from a cartilage operation in
November.
</P>
<P>
"I must look to my future," Rush was quoted as saying by
English newspapers on Tuesday, "and so must Liverpool. It will be
a massive wrench to leave but I have reluctantly decided it is
time to move on.
</P>
<P>
"I believe I have two years left in me and I can score goals
at the highest level, but to do so I need to be playing regularly.
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to go before next month's transfer deadline, but
have agreed to stay until the end of the season, " he said.
</P>
<P>
Rush first joined Liverpool from his local side Chester for
300,000 pounds (462,200 U.S. dollars) in May 1980 and has spent 15
of the last 16 years at Anfield.
</P>
<P>
He signed for Juventus for 3.2 million pounds (4.93 million
U.S. dollars) in July 1986 and played for them in the 1987-88
season before returning to Liverpool for 2.8 million pounds (4.31
million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
With Liverpool he has won five league championships, three
F.A. Cups, five League Cups and one European Cup.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year he set a 20th century record of 42 F.A. Cup
goals, and in all has scored 345 goals for Liverpool -- 228 in
the League, 39 in the F.A. Cup, 48 in the League Cup, 20 in
European competition and 10 in other matches.
</P>
<P>
He needs just 17 more league goals to beat Roger Hunt's league
scoring record for the club -- now likely to be one of the few
achievements he will miss out on at Anfield.
</P>
<P>
At least a dozen clubs have already expressed an interest in
signing him, including Manchester City, Middlesbrough, Leeds, and
clubs in the new American League and the J.League in Japan.

<P>
Luis Rentero Suarez, organizer and founder of the games which
feature many of the world's finest players, said on Monday it
would not be rescheduled in 1996 as a result of criticism from
members of the opposition United Left coalition.
</P>
<P>
A United Left spokesperson, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said the coalition felt that Rentero Suarez had turned
the tournament into a one-man show, being technical director as
well as owner of the hotel where it is staged.
</P>
<P>
"This is a matter of personal dignity," said Rentero
Suarez. "They say I am unfairly running this tournament. And that
isn't true."

The 1995 Linares Chess Tournament was won by Vasily Ivanchuk of

<HEADLINE> Asia-Europe Meeting to Usher in New Structure of Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Leaders from 25 Asian and
European nations gather here Friday for the first-ever top-level
meeting between the two regions to usher in a new structure of
inter-regional cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The unprecedented Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) is the first time
in the history of relations between Asia and Europe that leaders
of major countries from the two regions will meet on an equal
footing to open a dialogue on cooperation in political, economic
and other fields.
</P>
<P>
Attending the two-day get-together will be leaders from China,
Japan, South Korea, the seven-member Association of Southeast
Asian Nations (ASEAN) -- Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the
Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam -- and the 15-member
European Union (EU), as well as the president of the EU
Commission, Jacques Santer.
</P>
<P>
The first ASEM is a historic initiative intended to establish a
new partnership between Asia and Europe based on the promotion of
political dialogue, the strengthening of economic and trade
relations and cooperation in various fields.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will focus on economic cooperation, particularly
the expansion of trade and investment, though political issues
will also figure in the talks.
</P>
<P>
In terms of setting up a new global structure for the 21st
century, the first ASEM will have far-reaching and historic
significance.
</P>
<P>
It will lay a solid foundation for promoting the development of
both the Asian and European civilizations, maintaining peace and
stability in the two regions, strengthening inter-regional
economic cooperation and promoting global multi-polarization.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, it will promote mutual understanding and links
between Asia and Europe, and pave the way for establishing a new
Asia-Europe partnership based on equality.
</P>
<P>
The ASEM was proposed by Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong
at the World Economic Forum in Singapore in October 1994. The
Asian and European nations concerned have since responded
positively to the proposal.
</P>
<P>
In preparation for the meeting, the EU adopted in December 1994
its "Toward a New Asia Strategy" and passed in March 1995 a
resolution to support the convening of the ASEM.
</P>
<P>
An EU Commission statement issued in late January said that the
first ASEM is of "important strategic significance" and will lead
to a new decade of political dialogue and economic cooperation
between the two regions.
</P>
<P>
The EU hopes that the meeting will give it an opportunity to
exchange views with Asian countries on long-term political
consultation and cooperation in the economy, trade and other
fields, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The rapid economic growth and vast market potential of East
Asia offers an expanding export and investment market for the EU,
and will inject new vitality into the EU's economy as a whole.
</P>
<P>
In Asia, the nations concerned have convened a series of
meetings to coordinate their positions and draw up the blueprint
for future Asia-Europe cooperation in all fields.
</P>
<P>
In particular, China has adopted an active and earnest approach
toward the ASEM and hopes that it will help improve mutual
understanding and cooperation between the two regions as well as
play a positive, constructive role in creating a new Asia-Europe
partnership.
</P>
<P>
After repeated consultations, the EU and the 10 Asian nations
have agreed that the first ASEM will be held under the theme
"Towards a New Asia-Europe Partnership for Greater Growth."
</P>
<P>
In addition, they have agreed that the promotion of political
dialogue, the strengthening of economic relations and the
strengthening of cooperation in various fields will be the three
general items on the agenda of the meeting.

<HEADLINE> Asia-Europe Meeting to Usher in New Structure of Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As analysts have pointed out, there are broad prospects for
economic cooperation between Asia and Europe.
</P>
<P>
Although suffering from a poor economic foundation,
under-developed infrastructure, shortage of capital and lack of
technology, Asia, particularly the East Asian region, has achieved
rapid economic growth over recent years. Consequently, it has
become a region with the most vigorous economic development in the
world today.
</P>
<P>
According to latest statistics from the World Bank, the 10 East
Asian countries made up a market worth 748.7 billion U.S. dollars
in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Over the next 10 years, East Asia needs some 1.5 trillion
dollars worth of investment for the construction of infrastructure
facilities, creating vast market potential.
</P>
<P>
Economic and trade relations between East Asia and Europe have
developed steadily over the past few years.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, East Asia replaced the United States as the largest
export market for the EU, taking 18-percent of the EU's total
exports.
</P>
<P>
However, in terms of the market share in East Asia, the EU has
clearly lagged behind the United States. In particular, the EU's
investment in East Asia accounted for only 1 percent of its total
overseas investments between 1982 and 1992.
</P>
<P>
Two-way trade between the EU and the 10 Asian countries
totalled 238 billion dollars in 1992, compared with 240 billion
dollars between the EU and North America in the same year.
</P>
<P>
Consequently, economic and trade relations between Asia and
Europe have much room for growth.
</P>
<P>
As the economies of Asia and Europe complement each other very
well, the strengthening of economic cooperation between them not
only conforms to the aspirations of both sides, but also to the
fundamental interests of the nations of both regions.
</P>
<P>
Apart from strengthening their economic and trade cooperation,
Asia and Europe need to promote political dialogue, further
develop political relations and enhance mutual understanding.
</P>
<P>
Because of differences in social background and level of
economic development as well as in historical and cultural
traditions, it is natural that Asia and Europe have adopted
divergent approaches toward certain political issues.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the two sides, in discussing political issues,
should respect each other, treat each other as equals, promote
mutual understanding and establish mutual confidence through the
exchange of views.
</P>
<P>
Only by seeking common ground while reserving differences will
Asia and Europe be able to promote cooperation and create a new
partnership conforming to the fundamental interests of the nations
of both regions.
</P>
<P>
It is widely anticipated that Asia and Europe, while reviewing
inter-regional relations in the past and looking into the future,
will succeed in seizing the historic opportunity and jointly
laying the foundation for promoting overall cooperation between
them.

<HEADLINE> Bailey's 50-meter World Record may Stand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Canadian Donovan Bailey's
5.56 clocking for 50 meters indoors should be submitted to
track's world governing body for ratification as a new world
record even though there is evidence of a false start, a
U.S. athletics official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Bob Hersh, chair of the men's records panel for USA Track and
Field (USATF), said a review of the tape from Bailey's race at
Reno, Nevada, on February 9 indicates "that he anticipated the gun
rather than reacting to it."
</P>
<P>
But he added:
</P>
<P>
"I have concluded that USATF should submit the application for
(his) world record to the International Amateur Athletic
Federation for ratification."
</P>
<P>
A record must first be ratified by the sport's governing body
in the country in which it was set before it is sent to the IAAF
for its approval, with a guarantee that all IAAF rules were
complied with.
</P>
<P>
"I am now satisfied that USATF can and should apply to the
IAAF for the ratification of Donovan Bailey's 50-meter world
indoor record," Hersh said.
</P>
<P>
If the race had been controlled by starting blocks equipped
with false start detection devices, as required for the Olympic
Games and world championships, Hersh said, "I believe a false
start would have been signalled. But this equipment was not in
use in Reno, and Bailey literally complied with the rules because
he apparently did not commence his starting motion before the
report of the gun."
</P>
<P>
Bailey, the 1995 world 100 meters champion, bested the world
indoor record of 5.61 seconds set by German Manfred Kokot in 1973
and equalled by American James Sanford in 1981.

<HEADLINE> Jiangsu Encourages Overseas Investment in Transportation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Overseas investment is being
encouraged in construction of highways, bridges and berths in east
China's Jiangsu Province, where one of the country's fastest
economic growths has been recorded.
</P>
<P>
According to the provincial government, overseas enterprises
and companies are allowed to set up Sino-overseas joint ventures
or solely-overseas-funded entities involved in transportation
construction, but the projects have to comply with the province's
overall development plan.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investment is especially welcomed in projects such as
sealed highways for motor vehicles, second-grade roads over 40 km
in length, highway bridges over 300 m long and berths for ships of
over 3,000 dwt.
</P>
<P>
The operation term for a transportation enterprise involving
overseas funds generally shall not be longer than 30 years. And
upon the termination of the term, the project shall be turned over
to the local government gratis, as stipulated in agreements.
</P>
<P>
Operations with a duration exceeding 15 years can be exempted
from enterprise income tax for the first five profit-making years
and enjoy a 50 percent tax deduction in the sixth to tenth years.
</P>
<P>
The province also allows the transfer of operational right of
completed transportation facilities and the use right of the
surrounding land to overseas investors for up to 30 years.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Receives Credit Rating Boost </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Moody's, a New York ratings
 agency, has raised the New Zealand government's credit rating a
notch to Aa1.
</P>
<P>
The move followed the upgrade to AA-plus by Moody's rival
agency Standard and Poor's one month ago, a local press report
said today.
</P>
<P>
Announcing the boost Tuesday, Moody's said it reflects the many
benefits of important structural changes in the NZ economy.
</P>
<P>
It expects budget surpluses to remain a feature of NZ's economy
in the medium term, while balance of payments deficits will stay
at between 2 percent and 4 percent of the gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Treasury has announced that the government's
budget surplus and asset revaluations in the six months to
December 1995 will be larger than forecast.
</P>
<P>
The government is to pose an operating surplus of 2.5 billion
NZ dollars (1.66 billion US dollars) in the half year, compared
with 1.87 billion (1.24 billion US dollars) as expected.
</P>
<P>
Its net worth at the halfway stage of the current financial
year is also 884 million dollars (584 million US dollars) better
than forecast.

<HEADLINE> Dispute over Prevlaka Peninsula to Be Solved Peacefully </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, February 27 (Xinhua) -- President of the Yugoslav
Republic of Montenegro Momir Bulatovic said today the peaceful
solution to the Prevlaka problem is precondition for mutual
recognition between Yugoslavia and Croatia.
</P>
<P>
After meeting with U.N. Secretary General's special envoy to
former Yugoslavia Kofi Annan in port city Herceg Novi in
Montenegro, Bulatovic told reporters it was of great significance
for Montenegro and Croatia to solve peacefully their dispute over
the Prevlaka peninsula.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia and Croatia are yet to establish diplomatic
relations mainly due to the dispute over the tiny peninsula in
Herceg Novi. Both countries claimed that Prevlaka belong to them
and fought for the peninsula in 1991. It is now under the control
of the U.N. peace monitors.
</P>
<P>
Bulatovic said more intensive talks with Croatian
representatives on the disputed Adriatic peninsula on the
Montenegrin-Croatian border would begin in about 10 days.
</P>
<P>
This unpopulated peninsula of only one square kilometer has no
economic significance. But it is strategically important to
Yugoslavia, however, because it dominates over the entrance to the
gulf of Boka Kotorska, the only gulf in the Montenegrin part of
the Adriatic that is deep and has exceptional military
significance.
</P>
<P>
In a statement after his talks with Bulatovic, Annan said he
was impressed by Montenegro's positive role in the peace process,
by its resolve to work on the normalization of relations between
the sovereign states in the territory of former Yugoslavia and its
determination that all the outstanding issues be resolved
peacefully.
</P>
<P>
Annan would be touring the Prevlaka area later today and tell
the U.N. peace monitors stationed in the peninsula, as he said,
that Montenegro assessed their mission favorably and wanted them
to stay in Prevlaka until the final settlement of the dispute.

<HEADLINE> Democrats Threaten to Block Whitewater Hearings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 27 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Senate Democrats on
Tuesday threatened a filibuster if Republicans try to extend
congressional Whitewater hearings by more than 5 weeks.
</P>
<P>
Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, when asked if Democrats
would block debate on any Senate resolution continuing the
hearings for more than five weeks, said, "That is correct."
</P>
<P>
The Senate Whitewater probe, begun last july, is to expire
Thursday but Republicans say they favor an open-ended extension.
</P>
<P>
The problem the Republicans have is that key Whitewater
witnesses will be unavailable between now and April 3.
</P>
<P>
A criminal trial looms March 4 in Little Rock, Arkansas, for
the former Whitewater business partners of the Clintons, which
means the Senate will have to wait until well into the spring to
get information central to its investigation.
</P>
<P>
Republicans want to keep the investigation open-ended, arguing
that such a step will encourage the White House to produce
material promptly to the committee.
</P>
<P>
Democrats argue that Republicans simply are seeking political
gain by prolonging hearings deep into this year's presidential
election campaign.
</P>
<P>
Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle and Whitewater Committee
Democrats Paul Sarbanes of Maryland and Christopher Dodd of
Connecticut were holding a news conference today to lay out their
alternative.
</P>
<P>
Unless leaders of the two parties agree on an extension, Senate
debate on the Republican plan to extend the investigation
indefinitely could get under way as early as Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Senate Whitewater Committee Republicans, including chairman
Alfonse D'Amato, favor appropriating an additional 600,000 dollars
to continue the investigation on an open-ended basis.

<HEADLINE> Bildt Hold Talks with PMs of Two Parties in Bosnia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, February 27 (Xinhua) -- The High Representative for
civilian issues in Bosnia, Carl Bildt, Bosnian Serb Premier Rajko
Kasagic, and the Prime Minister of the Muslim-Croat federation
Hasan Muratovic met today behind closed doors in Banja Luka.
</P>
<P>
The meeting focused on putting into operation of the Banja
Luka-Zvornik railway linking the two cities in the west and east
of RS through the territory of the Muslim-Croat federation, and
the agreement on feeding power into transmission lines, Tanjug
quoted Muratovic as saying.
</P>
<P>
A formal statement was expected following talks between Bildt,
Kasagic and Muratovic, the news agency said.
</P>
<P>
The Serb authority suspended contacts on February 8 with the
Muslim-Croat federation for Muslim arrest of two senior Serb
officers. Today's meeting was the first contact of high-ranking
officials between the two parties this month and signaled a
gradual resumption of relations between the two entities in the
country.
</P>
<P>
On the massive exodus of Serbs from Sarajevo, Muratovic said
that was the result of propaganda. He said there would be no
danger for the Serbs to live under Muslim rule and he believed
that a "large number of them will return."
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands of Serbs living in Sarajevo have fled to
other Serb territories before the five Serb-held suburbs are
reverted to the administration of the Muslim-Croat federation in
mid-March. The federation police have already entered one of the
Serb suburb and will patrol in the other four districts gradually
from this week on.

<HEADLINE> New York State Forces Delinquent Parents to Pay  Child-Support </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, February 27 (Xinhua) -- New York State will take
tougher actions, including publishing the names of the 10 most
"wanted", to force delinquent parents to pay what they owe in
child-support, local press reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The state court have 380,000 cases of child-support payment
orders in place. In 350,000 of those cases, or 92 percent, parents
are behind in payments, owing about 1.6 billion dollars, state
officials were quoted by The New York Times as saying. In 170,000
of those cases, no payments have ever been made.
</P>
<P>
To solve the problem, the state started a new policy six month
ago under which driver's licenses of the delinquent parents would
be suspended if they failed to pay their child-support within a
period of time.
</P>
<P>
Since then, the state had mailed notices to 380,000 delinquent
parents and it, Governor George E. Pataki announced Monday, had
collected 622 million dollars in child-support last year,
including nearly 2 million dollars paid by 1,400 people who
received notices from the State Department of Social Services
warning them that their licenses would be revoked if they did not
begin making child-support payments.
</P>
<P>
The governor displayed the 10 most "Wanted" posters with their
names and photographs. They owe about 750,000 dollars in support
for 24 children.
</P>
<P>
The state expected to increase child-support payment by 30
million dollars this year under the new policy.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa To Take Measures To Keep Doctors In Public Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 27 (Xinhua) -- South Africa is to
introduce new salary structures and grading systems in an attempt
to keep its doctors in the country and the public service, Health
Minister Ms. Nkosazana Zuma said today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters at Johannesburg International Airport
while welcoming the arrival of Cuban doctors, Ms. Zuma said these
proposed measures would "give doctors a much better deal", adding
that the doctors' working conditions would also be improved.
</P>
<P>
South Africa has a serious shortage of doctors, especially in
rural areas. The situation is even exacerbated by doctors leaving
the public sector for higher salaries in the private sector or
other countries, especially Britain.
</P>
<P>
Ms. Zuma said she was not pleased with Britain's aggressive
recruitment of South African doctors, who had been trained at
great expense.
</P>
<P>
She said her department was exploring various ways to keep doctors
in the country. These included a community service system in terms of
which South African-trained doctors would be required to work in the
public sector for a number of years after completing their studies.
</P>
<P>
In order to provide the basic health care to all people,
especially in rural areas previously neglected, South Africa had to
"import" doctors from other countries, such as Cuba.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Public Service Workers Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Zambian civil servants and
public workers staged a strike today protesting the government's
alleged failure to pay them 45 percent salary and wage increment.
</P>
<P>
In capital Lusaka, most of junior civil servants and public
workers downed their tools to back their demand.
</P>
<P>
In other cities and towns, operations of some government
institutions were paralyzed after the public service workers
walked out of their offices.
</P>
<P>
Reacting to the event, Minister of Labor and Social Security
Newstead Zimba said today that the strike was illegal.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the Civil Servants Union of Zambia would be held
responsible for the strike action, Zimba said.
</P>
<P>
The government and public service workers have different
explanations over the 45 percent pay increase ruled by the
Industrial Relations Court.
</P>
<P>
The government holds that 30 percent pay increment which it
awarded to public service workers last year should be included in
the 45 percent increase.
</P>
<P>
However, the public service workers argue that the 45 percent
increment is separated from the 30 percent pay rise effected last
year.

for a U.N.-approved oil-for-food plan.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Foreign Ministry spokesman Omer Akbel told a weekly

<HEADLINE> Report Reveals Ordeals of Palestinians Working in Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 28 (Xinhua) -- The average daily working hours
of Palestinian laborers in Israel range from 12 to 15, according
to a report issued by Gaza Center for Rights and Law.
</P>
<P>
The report on conditions of the Palestinians living in Gaza and
working inside Israel said that the workers start their day at
approximately 3 o'clock in the early morning to reach Erez check
point, where the Israeli authorities allow Palestinian laborers to
cross into Israel at about 4 a.m., the Middle East News Agency
(MENA) reported today.
</P>
<P>
Then the workers stand in long queues to be searched by Israeli
soldiers, said the report received by the Egyptian Trade Unions
Federation (ETUF).
</P>
<P>
They are not allowed to carry anything with them, neither food
nor drinks, the report said.
</P>
<P>
After being searched, the Palestinian workers have to pay high
rates of fares to go to their working places by bus, MENA quoted
the report as saying.
</P>
<P>
While the buses are on their way, they are stopped at various
searching posts, where the Palestinians are subject to more search
by Israeli soldiers, the report noted.
</P>
<P>
The workers sometimes are provoked, humiliated and even beaten
when being searched.
</P>
<P>
Some 300 to 400 Palestinian workers are arrested every month
for not carrying work permits inside Israel and some of them are
detained in a desert camp in Negev, MENA said, citing the report.
</P>
<P>
The report also said the closure of the Gaza Strip by the
Israeli authorities inflicts on those Palestinians working in
Israel a daily loss of about 1.6 million Shekels (some 533,000
U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Palestinians are not allowed to enter Israel to work after
Israel sealed off the Palestinian self-rule areas of Gaza and the
West Bank following two suicide bombings Sunday in Jerusalem and
the Israeli coastal city of Ashkelon, which killed 25 people and
injured some 80 others.
</P>
<P>
Israel did not say when the closure would end, but Israeli
media has said that the closure may remain in place until after
the May 29 election in the Jewish state.
