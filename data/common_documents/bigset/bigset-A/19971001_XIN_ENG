<HEADLINE> French Catholic Church Apologizes for Silence Under Vichy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 30 (Xinhua) -- For the first time since the
end of World War II, the French Roman Catholic Church will
apologize to Jews for maintaining silence over the
anti-Semitic policy adopted by the Vichy collaboration regime from
1942 to 1944.
</P>
<P>
The episcopate of the Church will issue a statement today
recognizing its silence over the arrest and deportation of some
76,000 French Jews as "a fault" and ask for pardon from the world
Jewish community.
</P>
<P>
"We beg for the pardon of God and ask the Jewish people to
listen to this word of repentance," said the statement, which is
to be read by a representative of the French bishops at a rail
station in Drancy outside Paris, a former concentration site from
where thousands of Jews were sent to Nazi death camps in the east.
</P>
<P>
Church personalities and representatives of the French Jewish
community will attend the ceremony this evening.
</P>
<P>
The church will recognize that there existed a "compost" of
anti-Semitism among the Christian -- including Catholic --
community, upon which "had bloomed the poisonous plant of hatred
of Jews," said the statement, which was partially published by
Agence France-Presse today.
</P>
<P>
The church said that as a result of anti-Semitic thinking among
the Christian community of pre-war Europe, the attempt by Nazi
Germany to exterminate the Jewish people failed to be recognized
as a central human and spiritual tragedy at that time.
</P>
<P>
"Before the fullness of the tragedy and the unprecedented
character of the crime, too many pastors of the church had,
through their silence, offended the church itself and its
mission," said the statement.

<HEADLINE> Direct Foreign Investments in Egypt Shoot Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Direct foreign investments in
Egypt are expected to top 1.5 billion U.S. dollars by the end of
this year, a 67 percent hike from last year, the Middle East News
Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
It quoted Minister of Economy Youssef Boutros Ghali as telling
economic editors that the rise is due to the government's credible
economic policies, international recognition of Egypt's economic
performance and it burgeoning money market.
</P>
<P>
Foreign direct investments in Egypt rose from 432 million
dollars in 1995 to 900 million dollars in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the Egyptian economy is strong enough to lure
investments and impregnable to damages of what he described as "a
single incident."
</P>
<P>
He was referring to the shooting and petrol bomb attack on
foreign tourists in central Cairo on September 18 which killed
nine German tourists and an Egyptian driver and wounded eight
other.
</P>
<P>
"The attack on a tourist bus will not affect this field because
investors are fully convinced that it was a single act," he added.
</P>
<P>
Fearing the attack might ruin its multi-billion-dollar tourism
industry and investment environment, Egypt has been quick to claim
it was an isolated incident that had nothing to do with organized
Islamic militant attacks prevalent in Egypt in the early 1990s.

<HEADLINE> Canada Rolls out TV Ratings System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Canadian TV networks and cable
channels are rolling out national ratings system, starting this
week.
</P>
<P>
The TV ratings system is a method of classifying most TV shows
to alert parents about the levels of violence, sexual content and
coarse language they or their children can expect to meet.
</P>
<P>
When a show begins to be broadcast, a small icon will appear
for about 15 seconds in the upper-left corner of the TV screen.
</P>
<P>
Each icon symbolizes one of six ratings categories, ranging
from C, for children under eight, up to 18, for adult 18 and
older.
</P>
<P>
News, sports, documentaries and other non-dramatic shows are
exempt from the system.
</P>
<P>
Most of Canada's big public and private networks began airing
the icons yesterday. Other broadcast services may take a few weeks
to follow suit.
</P>
<P>
The new system makes Canada "number one in the world" among
countries that classify or control programming, according to Trina
McQueen, president of the Discovery Channel.
</P>
<P>
Yet, the present ratings are only a temporary measure, which is
likely to be phased out once a more comprehensive system of
household control, the "V-chip", falls into place.
</P>
<P>
The V-chip is a Canadian-invented technology that will permit
parents to program their TVs to black out any shows that parents
deem inappropriate for their children.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Gala Performance to Mark National Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 30 (Xinhua) -- A grand theatrical show was
staged this evening in the Great Hall of the People here to mark
the 48th founding anniversary of the People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
Members of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of
the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee Hu Jintao,
Wei Jianxing and Li Lanqing watched the show together with an
audience of 10,000.
</P>
<P>
The Great Hall of the People was colorfully decorated for
China's National Day, which falls October 1. One slogan
read: "Holding high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory and
forging ahead the great course of building socialism with Chinese
characteristics into the 21st century in an all-round way".
</P>
<P>
The curtain was raised to the audience's singing of China's

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Russia began to issue new
passports today to replace that of the dissolved Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
At a ceremony marking the issuance of passports, Russian
President Boris Yeltsin said the event is of great significance,
because Russia should have its own passports. Passports issued by
the former Soviet Union are still in use nationwide so far.
</P>
<P>
Local reports say the issuance of new passports will proceed in
three stages: Approximately 4.5 million passports will be
published from October 1 to the end of the year; 10 million
passports will be issued in 1998, and 200 million from 1999 to
December 31, 2005.
</P>
<P>
The project's cost is estimated at 2.5 trillion roubles.

<HEADLINE> Senior CPC Official Meets Indian Visitors (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Echoing Deng Xiaoping's words
that China poses no threat to India nor is India a threat to
China, senior CPC leader Li Ruihan said today that the two countries
have every reason to deepen their friendship and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Li, a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau
of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, made the
comments during a meeting here with a delegation from the
Communist Party of India (CPI) led by its general secretary
Ardhendu Bardhan.
</P>
<P>
Li, who is also chairman of the National Committee of the
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), said
that China and India are neighbors, each with a long history and
splendid civilization. Both countries are engaged in developing
their economies and improving the quality of their respective
peoples, and share identical or similar viewpoints on many major
international issues.
</P>
<P>
On the history of the international communist movement, Li said
it was a necessity for the communist parties in some countries to
take power at the beginnging of the century. Similarly, there were
inner causes for the frustration of the communist movement in some
countries in the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Both sides of the historical experience show that it is
imperative that the communist parties give priority to advancing
productive forces of the society and improving the living
standards of the people after they come to power, thus winning
support from the masses, he pointed out.

<P>
He said that the key reason the Communist Party of China stands
strong in the changing international situation is that
the Chinese communists, represented by Deng Xiaoping, carefully
sum up experience and learn from their past and draw on both the
successes and failures of other socialist countries.
</P>
<P>
The Party also has set the growth of productive forces of
the society as the basic task of the primary stage of socialism and
set forth the guidelines of "one central task, two basic points,"
namely, regarding economic advancement as the core, and sticking
to the four fundamental principles and reform and opening-up.
</P>
<P>
The practice over the past 18 years has fully proved that the
policies of the Communist Party of China are correct and Deng
Xiaoping Theory is also correct, he stated.
</P>
<P>
"Although we are faced with some difficulties, and there might
be some problems on the road ahead, our cause will prevail as long
as we follow Deng Xiaoping Theory," Li said.
</P>
<P>
Bardhan extended his congratulations on the successful
convening of the 15th CPC National Congress, and on the 48th
anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
He said that Li's words will help the Communist Party of India
understand the spirit of the 15th CPC National Congress, and
that his party highly appreciates all the decisions made at the
congress.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that practice has proven that the road initiated
by the Communist Party of China is correct, and that Deng
Xiaoping's theories that poverty is not socialism and economic
development is the prerequisite for consolidating and carrying
forward socialism have contributed to the development of
Marxism-Leninism.
</P>
<P>
Bardhan said that his party is ready to make concerted efforts
to advance friendly bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Dai Bingguo, head of the International Department of the CPC
Central Committee, attended the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The Indian visitors, who are here as guests of the CPC, will
also travel to Nanchang and Shanghai.

<HEADLINE> Peace in Afghanistan Vital to Tajikistan: Rahmonov </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Tajikistan has joined
international efforts to seek peace in neighboring Afghanistan as
it is in vital interests of Tajikistan, said President Emomali
Rahmonov here today.
</P>
<P>
"Frankly speaking, the unsettled nature of the Afghan problem
may undermine the fragile peace in Tajikistan," he told the
on-going 52nd session of the General Assembly of the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
"We are participating in meetings on Afghanistan that have been
conducted laterly by the U.N. Secretary-General among states
concerned and we support proposals on initiation of a broad
intra-Afghan dialogue, as well as on convening an international
peace conference on Afghanistan under the U.N. auspices," he said.
</P>
<P>
The peace in Afghanistan "would also help to substantially reduce
the flow of arms and drugs across the Tajik-Afghan border and the
proliferation of terrorism and extremism waves which destabilize
the whole region," he added.
</P>
<P>
Rahmonov said a coordinated international effort to check drug
trafficking in Central Asia is necessary and Tajikistan supports
conducting a special session of the U.N. General Assembly on drug
problems in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Russia to Continue Efforts on Nuclear Disarmament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Russia would like to continue
its efforts to reduce the number of nuclear weapons under the
U.S.-Russian nuclear arms reduction treaty, Russian Minister of
Atomic Energy Viktor Mikhailov said today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the 40th annual conference of the International
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Mikhailov reiterated that Russia
would adhere to the principles of nuclear disarmament.
</P>
<P>
In 1995-1997, Russia used 36 tons of enriched uranium for
nuclear power plants and it plans to up the figure to 156 by the
year 2000, Mikhailov said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Russia will invest 100-150 million U.S. dollars per
year to improve safety devices in nuclear power plants, the
minister added.
</P>
<P>
As for the START-II nuclear arms reduction treaty, he said
Russia and the U.S. signed an accord last week in New York urging
the Russian State Duma (the lower house of parliament) to ratify the
treaty, which was signed between the two countries in 1993.
</P>
<P>
The treaty has been stalled for four years in Russia's
parliament.
</P>
<P>
The treaty sets a warhead limit of 3,500 on each side, down
from about 8,000, and strips Russia of its most powerful missile,
the SS-18.
</P>
<P>
Mikhailov also noted that Russian President Boris Yeltsin and
his U.S. counterpart, Bill Clinton, recently reached an agreement
on basic principles for the START-III treaty, which will undergo
negotiations once the START-II is ratified in Russia.

WASHINGTON, September 30 (Xinhua) -- A Miami federal court has
convicted a top aide to Venezuela's former anti-drug chief of
conspiring to ship up to 22 tons of cocaine to Florida, reports
reaching here said today.
</P>
<P>
The verdict against Adolfo Romero Gomez, who was extradited
from Colombia a year ago, was announced late on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The jury deliberated 12 hours over two days but remained
deadlocked on another charge, accusing Romero of smuggling a
shipment of more than 900 pounds of cocaine from Colombia through
Venezuela to the United States in 1990.
</P>
<P>
The sentence is scheduled for December 10 and Romero, who is in
his 60s, faces life in prison.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors said Romero and his boss, Gen. Ramon Guillen
Davila, betrayed the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency and Drug
Enforcement Administration agents who worked with them.
</P>
<P>
Convicted drug smugglers testified that Romero acted as a
middleman between Colombian cocaine suppliers and Florida
traffickers.
</P>
<P>
CIA and DEA agents also testified that Romero smuggled tons of
cocaine into the United States in 1990 and 1991 without telling
U.S. authorities.

<P>
BEIJING, September 30 (Xinhua) -- China's great achievements in
reform and opening-up have proved that Marxism is the guiding
truth, Li Ruihuan, a ranking Communist Party of China (CPC) official,
told Harkishan Surjeet, general secretary of the Communist Party
of India (Marxist) today.
</P>
<P>
Li, both a Standing Committee member of the Political Bureau of
the CPC Central Committee and chairman of the National Committee
of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC),
conveyed greetings from General Secretary of the CPC Central
Committee Jiang Zemin to Surjeet during their talks.
</P>
<P>
Li said China will continue to adhere to Marxism so as to
"overcome the difficulties on the road of advance and score
still greater success."
</P>
<P>
"The adherence that we are talking about is precisely the
adherence to the basic principles of Marxism," he noted. "The
development history of Marxism is a history of overcoming the
limitations of the predecessors and setting forth new viewpoints."
</P>
<P>
"To ignore development and only consider some outdated
conclusions is not genuine adherence to Marxism," Li said.
</P>
<P>
Li also mentioned that Lenin could not have brought forth
Leninism had he not proposed, in accordance with the reality of
Russia then, that socialism could succeed in a country where the
capitalism rule was the weakest.
</P>
<P>
Mao Zedong, he noted, could not have produced Mao Zedong
Thought had he not set forth, in line with China's revolutionary
practice at the time, the theory of encircling the cities from the
countryside and finally seizing them.

<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Zoran Djinpjic, mayor of
Belgrade, capital of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, was
relieved of his duties for abuse of power after a secrete ballot
by the city's parliament today.
</P>
<P>
Among the 68 legislators present at the vote, 67 voted for
Djinpjic's dismissal. Some 36 legislators from the Democratic
Party of Serbia, headed by Djinpjic, refused to attend the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
As Novinska Agencija Tanjug reported, the motion was
proposed by the Serbian Renewal Movement.
</P>
<P>
About two months earlier, another party, Serbian Socialist
Party, proposed to the 110-strong city parliament, a motion to
impeach Djinpjic, though the motion was aborted due to a majority
vote against it at the time.
</P>
<P>
As Chairman of the Democratic Party of Serbia, one of the major
opposition parties, Djinpjic was elected mayor of Belgrade in last
year's regional elections.
</P>
<P>
At today's vote, Djinpjic was charged with abuse of power in

And Deng Xiaoping could not have brought forth Deng Xiaoping
Theory if he did not correct some of Mao Zedong's conclusions or
creatively put forward a series of new theses in accordance with
the specific conditions in China's construction.
</P>
<P>
So it is imperative to continue to combine the cardinal
principles of Marxism with both a nation's specific conditions and
characteristics of an era, he noted. The combination should not
produce only a theoretical answer, but also a tangible development
-- only in this way will Marxism be full of vigor and vitality.
</P>
<P>
Surjeet said the report delivered by Jiang Zemin at the
15th CPC National Congress not only summarized China's experience,
but also summed up the course of the development of Marxism, which
is helpful to China and the cause of socialism in the world.
</P>
<P>
"We have always held that it is easy for the Communist parties
to build socialism after they come into power," he said, adding
that there are no ready-made answers for backward nations to build
socialism through Marxism.
</P>
<P>
Deng Xiaoping had made a major contribution in this regard, he
noted, saying that without growth of productive forces, socialism
could not be strengthened.
</P>
<P>
This is an arduous task for developing nations, and that the
theory of the primary stage of socialism set forth by the Chinese
communists is a new development of Marxism, Surjeet concluded.

BEIJING, September 30 (Xinhua) -- American former world number
one Jim Courier moved into the second round of the China Open on
Tuesday by beating Alex Radulescu of Germany 6-3, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
Courier, who has clinched 20 singles titles in his tennis

</P>
<P>
"I'm satisfied with my first match in China," said Courier, who
was the world No.1 in 1992.
</P>
<P>
"I hope to win the singles here, but now the most important for
me is next round." He also said: "If I keep the form as I was in

it's very difficult."

Kiefer, winner of the Toulouse Open Sunday by beating the
reigning champion Mark Philippoussis of Australia, will meet Renzp

<HEADLINE> Iraq to Cut Food Rations from October </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Food rations for Iraqi people
will be cut as from October due to short supplies, according to
the Iraqi news agency (INA) today.
</P>
<P>
INA said an official source of the Ministry of Commerce blamed
the cut on U.S. obstructing and delaying the approval of the
contracts Iraq signed with foreign companies under the
oil-for-food deal.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said cereals ration will be cut from one kilogram
to 400 grams and edible oil from one kilogram to 250 grams. The
third item is soap, but the amount is unknown.
</P>
<P>
The rations for an adult Iraq per month include at nine
kilograms of flour, 2.5 kilograms of rice, two kilograms of sugar,
150 grams of tea, one kilogram of cereals, one kilogram of edible
oil, 350 grams of washing powder and 250 grams of soap.
</P>
<P>
Dennis Haleidy, U.N. humanitarian affairs coordinator in Iraq,
said last week that Iraq had received 90 percent of the food items
contracted within the framework of the first phase of the
oil-for-food deal which ended in June.
</P>
<P>
The deal, signed in May 1996 and put into force last December,
allows Iraq to export 2 billion U.S. dollars worth of oil over a
six-month period to buy food, medicines and other humanitarian
goods. It was renewed in June this year.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi people have been suffering from the six-year-old
U.N. sanctions imposed following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been accusing the U.S. of obstructing the
implementation of the deal. It claimed that some of the contracts
still have not been approved by the U.N. Sanctions Committee due
to U.S. hindrance.

<HEADLINE> Germany Backs EU Membership for Turkey in Principle, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, September 30 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Helmut Kohl
told visiting Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz that Germany
supports an eventual membership for Turkey in the European Union
(EU) but first expects Ankara to make its own contributions toward
this goal, a German government spokesman said today.
</P>
<P>
"Chancellor Kohl declared that he supported the goal of a later
Turkish membership in the EU and expected Turkey to follow EU
demands to make its own contributions in order to reach this
goal," said Kohl's spokesman Peter Hausmann after a meeting
between Kohl and Yilmaz today in Bonn.
</P>
<P>
According to the spokesman, Kohl had made Turkey's future EU
membership dependent on, among other things, a solution of
Ankara's dispute with Greece over the divided island of Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz told reporters after the meeting that he was satisfied
with his talks in Bonn and he saw "a turning point" in Turkey's
relations with the EU.
</P>
<P>
He also criticized the EU's selection of Poland, Hungary, the
Czech Republic, Slovenia, Estonia as well as Cyprus as the top
candidates for its enlargement and expressed the confident that
Turkey would not be excluded from the process at EU's next summit
due in December.
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz said he would hold intensive talks with other EU
governments in the run-up to the summit and would reconvene with
Kohl in Bonn in December.
</P>
<P>
On the sidelines of the talks, Turkish and German officials
today also signed an agreement on setting up a German-language
university in Istanbul in an effort to promote the cultural
relations between the two countries.

<HEADLINE> King Hussein: Jordan Never Allow Terrorist Acts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Jordan today affirmed its
determination to counter terrorist acts which culminated in the
past week in consecutive attacks on two Israeli embassy guards and
a Hamas leader.
</P>
<P>
"Jordan would never allow anybody to turn this country into a
base for acts of terrorism in any form or shape," King Hussein
said today while addressing a public gathering in southwest to
capital Amman, Radio Jordan reported.
</P>
<P>
On the morning of September 22, two Israeli embassy guards here
were shot and wounded by unidentified gunmen; and on September 25,
Khalid Mashiel, head of the political bureau of the Islamic
Resistance Movement, Hamas, was beaten into coma by two Canadian
tourists in front of his office here.
</P>
<P>
The king urged his countrymen to cooperate and work together
with the government to face up to coming challenges.
</P>
<P>
While investigations of the two attacks are now underway and
the attackers of the September 22 case remain at large, public
fear of new eruption of violence has been making headlines in the
country.
</P>
<P>
The wounded Israeli diplomats was immediately treated in local
hospitals, and later sent back to Israel for further therapy.
</P>
<P>
The Hamas leader is now hospitalized in the King Hussein
Medical Center under Hussein's instruction and confirmed to be in
"stable condition" by a Jordanian official.
</P>
<P>
The two Canadian tourists who beat Mashiel are now in custody
for investigation. Hamas has accused the Israeli secret
intelligence Mossad of implication in the attack.
</P>
<P>
Hamas was established in 1987 to fight against Israel`s
occupation of Palestine. Most Hamas political bureau members live
in Jordan.
</P>
<P>
Jordan signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1994, becoming one
of the countries in the Arab world that have normalized relations
with the Jewish state. The other country is Egypt.

<HEADLINE> Kinshasa Bombing Cuts Short kabila's Visit to </HEADLINE>

<P>
LUSAKA, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Laurent Kabila, President of
the Democratic Republic of Congo, today cut short of his
scheduled three-day official visit to Zambia and returned home.
</P>
<P>
Kabila rushed back to his country after 17 people were killed
Monday in Kinshasa as a result of shellings from Brazzaville,
capital of the Republic of Congo, across the River Congo.
</P>
<P>
The visiting president, who arrived here Monday on his first
visit abroad after he took power from late Mobutu Sese Seko in
May, is supposed to visit the Copperbelt province today and fly
home Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Shells fired from Brazzaville landed in Kinshasa again today as
the former Zaire held a National Day of mourning for the victims,
according to the reports reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
Around 20 shells hit Kinshasa, which is separated with
Brazaville by the Congo River, during a second day of heavy
artillery exchanges in Brazzaville between supporters of
President Pascal Lissouba and his predecessor Denis Sassou
Nguesso.
</P>
<P>
It was not immediately clear who was firing the shells.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the incident at a banquet for him by Zambian
President Frederick Chiluba last night, Kabila disclosed that
security in his country is threatened by soldiers of the former
government who, after running away after the fall of Mobutu's
regime, have re-grouped and are posing a threat to people's life.
</P>
<P>
"If the provocation persists, we may be forced to take action
to silence the mortars," he said.
</P>
<P>
Kabila added that he wants an explanation from Brazaville that
why Kinshasa is being bombed.

</P>
<P>
He made the remarks during talks with the visiting Kuwaiti
parliamentary delegation which is currently paying a five-day
visit to Ethiopia, according to the Ethiopian News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The vice-minister said, Kuwait has demonstrated great will to
assist Ethiopia's bid to improve its national economy, and he
recalled that the Kuwaiti government has provided 25 million U.S.
Dollars for the reconstruction of Addis Ababa international
airport.
</P>

Head of the Kuwaiti delegation Mubarak Al-Khurinej, on his
part, expressed conviction that Ethiopia would continue to

Kuwaiti war prisoners, compensate for gulf-war victims and return
looted property.
</P>
<P>
"We urge the Ethiopian government to work toward the
implementation of the resolution," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Kuwaiti delegation arrived here Saturday. It was received
Monday by Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi and Ethiopian
President Negasso Gidada separately.

HARARE, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Police in the 14-member
Southern African Development Community (SADC) should strengthen
their cooperation in the fight against crime if the region is to
be successfully integrated, a Zimbabwean minister said today.
</P>
<P>
Home Affairs Minister Dumiso Dabengwa said efforts toward
regional integration in economic and other spheres would fail in

have been rife.

He was addressing delegates to a Southern African Regional

<P>
The fruits of cooperation in the fight against cross border
crime, the minister noted, were beginning to be seen.
</P>

A total of 1,576 stolen vehicles were recovered during the
first phase of Voyager Four operation, an exercise aimed at
dealing with cross border vehicle thefts.

<HEADLINE> German Finance Minister Sees 1 Billion Mark Tax Cut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, September 30 (Xinhua) -- German Finance Minister Theo
Waigel today said that German taxpayers could only expect a net
tax cut of up to one billion German marks (565 million U.S.
dollars) next year through a planned reduction in the so-called
"solidarity" income tax.
</P>
<P>
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's ruling coalition has agreed to
cut the unpopular 7.5-percent solidarity surcharge from January
next year after a broader tax reform package was buried by the
main opposition Social Democratic Party (SPD) last week.
</P>
<P>
The solidarity tax was imposed after the 1990 German
reunification to finance the reconstruction of eastern Germany.
</P>
<P>
However, a two-percent cut in that tax, as requested by Kohl's
junior coalition partner, the Free Democratic Party (FDP), would
rip a 7.5 billion mark (4.2 billion dollar) hole in next year's
budget, a shortfall that remains unfinanced without the broader
tax package.
</P>
<P>
A government consultation presided by Kohl today in Bonn had
apparently failed to find a reasonable solution to the problem.
But Waigel told reporters that he expected a decision on the issue
before November.
</P>
<P>
Officials emerging from the talks disclosed that the government
was considering further sales of state assets to help
counter-finance the tax cut.
</P>
<P>
As their subsidy-fueled economy is slowing down to a nearly
standstill at present, eastern German leaders of Kohl's party have
vowed to resist any attempt to cut subsidies to their regions.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus' Rivals to Exchange Info on Missing People </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, September 30 (Xinhua) -- The Greek Cypriot side is
ready to hand over information about 200 Turkish Cypriots and 15
Greek Cypriots missing in the conflicts two decades ago.
</P>
<P>
Government spokesman Manolis Christofides made the announcement
today at his daily press briefing. He said Cypriot government is
ready to comply with an agreement reached by the leaders of the
two communities in July.
</P>
<P>
Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides and Turkish Cypriot leader
Rauf Denktash agreed "to provide the other side immediately and
simultaneously with all information already at their disposal on
the location of graves."
</P>
<P>
The exchange of information was set by the end of September.
</P>
<P>
"The information will be handed over in a responsible manner
and we expect the other side to respond in the same way, so we can
put an end to this tragic problem," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Since inter-communal clashes began in the early 1960s, at least
500 Turkish Cypriots have been reported missing; and 1,619 Greek
Cypriots were listed as missing after Turkey intervened by landing
its troops on the Mediterranean in 1974.
</P>
<P>
Christofides said the information gathered from witness reports
and statements will have to be substantiated with scientific
evidence on every missing person's identity.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkey landed its
troops and occupied the northern third of the island to protect
the Turkish Cypriots following a failed coup seeking union with
Greece.
</P>
<P>
The issue of missing people has been one of the main issues of
the protracted Cyprus problem, which has remained unsolved despite
the U.N. and international community's peace efforts in the past
23 years.

<HEADLINE> France to Impose Traffic Control in Paris to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 30 (Xinhua) -- The French government will
impose an open-ended tough traffic control in Paris and some towns
around it on Wednesday to reduce pollution, which hit a record
high in nearly two years today.
</P>
<P>
All primary schools in Paris region today cancelled physical
and sports classes because of heavy pollution, and police
tightened speed limit in the city to 20 kilometers per hour.
</P>
<P>
From 05:30 a.m. until 22:00 p.m. Wednesday, only vehicles with
odd registration numbers can circulate in Paris.
</P>
<P>
The pollution level hit level three, or more than 400
micrograms of dioxide nitrogen in each cubic meter, today in
Paris, the highest since November 8, 1995.
</P>
<P>
The Minister of Environment Dominique Voynet, who is the
president of the Green Party, proposed the measure to the welcome
of ruling leftwing parties and opposition from the opposition
right.
</P>
<P>
She said that it is difficult to predict how many days the
control will be in force in Paris, which has been having clear
days with full sunshine for many weeks.
</P>
<P>
She said that a cloudy or rainy day could help reduce the
pollution level to below level three, in which case the control
will be lifted.
</P>
<P>
The measure is backed by a 1996 national law on air cleanness
and a regional decree in the Paris region adopted by local
councillors in April 1997.
</P>
<P>
Anyone who breaks the decree will be fined 900 francs (150 U.S.
dollars), said police.
</P>
<P>
Only small cars carrying fewer than tree persons, public
transport vehicles, taxis and vehicles serving certain kinds of
professions are spared from the control.
</P>
<P>
The southcentral city Lyon adopted similar traffic control on
heavy trucks on January 16-18, after the metropolis was hit by a
pollution above level three for days.

<HEADLINE> Annan: Programs for Older Persons Must Be Integral </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Programs for older
persons must be part of development planning, the U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan stressed here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the occasion of the International Day of Older
Persons, The Secretary-General said a society for all ages was one
that recognized the rights and responsibilities of all group
persons. It was one in which old persons could live healthy,
productive, economically secure lives. It was one that adjusted
its policies and plans to the needs and capabilities of all,
thereby releasing the potential of all, for the benefit of all.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief said that the General Assembly had taken
several significant initiatives concerning the rights and the
welfare of older persons. In 1982, the Assembly endorsed the
International Plan of Action on Aging. In 1991, it adopted the
United Nations Principles for Older Persons.
</P>
<P>
Annan said with the aging of individuals and populations in
developed and developing countries alike, the world faced a
two-fold challenge. First was the promotion of lifelong
individuals development, so that individuals could reach old age
with life skills, vocational skills, good health and good family
and social network. Second was the creation of an enabling and
encouraging environment in which individuals of all ages could
participate actively and receive care and support when needed.
</P>
<P>
He said the situation of women bore special mention. Women
everywhere were living longer than men. Women were also likely
than men to be poorer in old age for various reasons. Ensuring
economic security for older women must be a major focus of our
work.
</P>
<P>
Annan added the United Nations had consistently promoted the
fullest possible participation of older persons in society and the
fullest possible recognition of their needs and concerns.
</P>
<P>
Annan stressed that as the world's demographic transition
proceeds, efforts should be redoubled to make policies and
programs for older persons an integral part of overall
development strategies.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Announces Measures against Housing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 30 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill
Clinton Tuesday outlined a couple of steps to enhance the battle
against housing discrimination, which he admitted was worse than
he had believed.
</P>
<P>
Clinton named a total of 67 public and private local agencies
that will receive a total of 15 million dollars in federal grants
to combat housing discrimination.
</P>
<P>
Clinton also outlined plans for the federal government to
double its number of housing discrimination enforcement actions
over the next four years.
</P>
<P>
The president made the announcement at a meeting of his race
advisory board, saying, "It's clear to me now that there is more
housing discrimination in America than I had thought there was
when I became president." He said that has been keeping "too many
families from sending their children to the schools of their
choice."
</P>
<P>
Administration officials said the nationwide rate of home
ownership is near its record high, with minority owners accounting
for 29 percent of all new home buyers from 1993 to 1996. But
officials said the number of complaints of housing discrimination
have increased along with the growth in minority participation.
</P>
<P>
The 15 million-dollar grant will consist primarily of a 10.2
million dollar share for enforcement organizations that
investigate allegations of housing discrimination, provide housing
counseling and promote fair housing.
</P>
<P>
The grant money, from the federal budget for the fiscal year
that ends today, also includes money to help build such
organizations, and to promote reconciliation in racially troubled
communities where minority groups move into formerly all-white
areas.

<HEADLINE> US Fed Decides to Hold Interest Rates Steady </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 30 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Federal Reserve
(Fed) decided today to hold short-term interest rates steady as
the inflation in the country remains well under control.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Fed apparently opted instead to watch and wait for
more signs of inflation which was now in the best performance in
three decades.
</P>
<P>
The decision had been widely expected given the near absence of
price pressures despite robust economic growth and the lowest
unemployment rate in 24 years.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. central bank announced this afternoon that it had
adjourned a closed-door meeting of its policy-making Federal Open
Market Committee (FOMC) and had nothing further to say. It meant
the FOMC had left the federal fund rate, the rate governing
overnight loans between banks, unchanged at 5.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
An increase would have raised borrowing costs for millions of
American consumers and businesses.
</P>
<P>
The Fed hasn't changed the benchmark rate since March 25 when
it raised it by a quarter percentage point to curb potential
excessive demand that could fan inflation. The U.S. economy has
continued to expand strongly since then but inflation has
improved.
</P>
<P>
Consumer prices increased at an annual rate of 1.6 percent in
the first eight months, less than half of the 3.3 percent in last
year. And the prices excluding the volatile energy and food costs
rose at 2.2 percent rate, down from 2.6 percent last year and the
best since 1965.
</P>
<P>
U.S. economic analysts say that how soon the Fed will raise the
interest rates all depends on whether economic growth moderates
enough to ease strain on factory capacity and the labor supply. It
also depends on the explanation for the good luck on inflation.

<HEADLINE> 17 People in Kinshasa Killed in Congolese </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YAOUNDE, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Seventeen people have been
killed in the Democratic Republic of Congo's capital Kinshasa in
renewed intensified fighting in neighboring Republic of Congo,
according to sources monitored here today.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that military forces in Kinshasa responded by
firing artillery shots across the Congo River separating the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
The authorities in the Democratic Republic of Congo said they
wanted an explanation from the Congolese government.
</P>
<P>
Earlier last week, the police in the Democratic Republic of
Congo had already closed three Congo River crossing points and
ordered refugees from the Congolese capital Brazzaville to
register with the authorities.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Congolese President Pascal Lissouba said he has
sent a ceasefire proposal to international mediators in the
conflict with his rival former president Sassou Nguesso.
</P>
<P>
Lissouba also said the crisis in the country will not hamper
the democratic process. He declared that presidential election
will take place in the country within 15 months despite the
crisis which is still going on.
</P>
<P>
The Congolese authorities said the fighting in Brazzaville has
killed at least 4,000 people since it broke out in June.

<HEADLINE> Turkey to lift Emergency Rule in Southeastern </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, September 30 (Xinhua) -- The Turkish government today
decided to lift the 10-year-old emergency rule imposed on three
southeastern provinces, the semi-official Anatolia News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
This decision was made at a Council of Ministers meeting
chaired by Deputy Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit earlier today.
</P>
<P>
The government wants the emergency rule to come to an end in
Batman, Bingol and Bitlis, Government Spokesman Sukru Sina Gurel
told a press conference following the meeting.
</P>
<P>
However, the government has to get parliament approval of the
decision before it takes effect. The parliament is expected to
discuss this proposal soon, according to the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The emergency rule was imposed on nine southeastern provinces
to combat the separatist movement of the outlawed Kurdish Workers'
Party (PKK). The rule gave the army and police more powers to
arrest the PKK rebels.
</P>
<P>
The PKK has been fighting a 13-year-old war against the
Turkish authorities in a bid to establish an independent Kurdish
state in southeastern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
More than 27,000 people, including soldiers, rebels and
civilians, have been killed in the armed conflicts between the
government troops and the PKK militants.

<HEADLINE> US Congress Votes to Keep Government Running </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 30 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Senate voted
today to keep the government running into the new fiscal year
while lawmakers finish spending legislation.
</P>
<P>
With fiscal 1998 beginning on October 1, the U.S. Senate voted
99-0 to let government agencies function through October 23 and
shipped the measure to the White House for Clinton's certain
signature.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. House of Representatives also approved the bill
overwhelmingly Monday with a vote of 355-57.
</P>
<P>
The legislation is needed because the U.S. Congress has sent
only three of the 13 annual spending bills to the White House and
none of them has been signed by the U.S. president as yet.
</P>
<P>
The bill temporarily finances programs at 1997 levels, except
for those that lawmakers and the president have agreed to cut. The
stopgap bill will be signed by President Clinton soon as expected.
</P>
<P>
Even though there are some disputes on items in several
spending bills of fiscal 1998, the Republicans and Democrats in
the Congress are cooperating in a spirit that was lacking for the
last two years.
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, the beginning of the new fiscal year was marked
by a bitter budget stalemate between Clinton and Republicans. That
fight produced two partial government shutdowns totaling 27 days.
Republicans in the U.S. Congress were overwhelmingly blamed by the
public for provoking the battle.

WASHINGTON, September 30 (Xinhua) -- The United States will
send home two Cubans who hijacked a border patrol boat and took
four people hostage in an attempt to go to the U.S., the State

<P>
The hijackers and the four hostages were picked up by the U.S.
Coast Guard off the Florida Keys Thursday and were taken to the
U.S. Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay.
</P>
<P>
All the hostages, a teenager girl and three border guard
personnel, were returned to Cuba Monday and the hijackers will
soon be sent back, Rubin said.

<HEADLINE> UK Prime Minister on Education Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRIGHTON, England, September 30 (Xinhua) -- British Prime
Minister Tony Blair delivered today a package of education reforms
to fulfill his election pledge of education being its government's
"top priority."
</P>
<P>
He told the Labor Party Conference about a 2 billion pound (3.2
billion US dollar) rescue package to renovate rundown classrooms
and equip every school with the latest computers and a drive for
even higher numeracy and literacy standards at primary level.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said, "The biggest assault on poor literacy
and numeracy standards this country has seen: Nearly 40 percent of
11 year olds can't read, write or add up properly."
</P>
<P>
Britain is now at "the 42nd in the world education league," he
admitted.
</P>
<P>
"This is the scandalous legacy not just of 18 years of the Tory
government but of a country too often content to educate the elite
and ignore education for all," he added.
</P>
<P>
In order to reverse the "scandalous" trend, Blair set "a target
of 80 percent up to the standard in literacy, 75 percent for
numeracy by the year 2002."
</P>
<P>
He said that the aim of the education reforms is to give "every
11-year-old the start in life they deserve."
</P>
<P>
The huge cash injection is the center-piece of an ambitious
three-point drive to improve education.
</P>
<P>
Blair announced that every one of the country's 33,000 schools
will have the latest computers within five years.
</P>
<P>
Analyists here believe that the move underlines Blair's
commitment to make education his government's passion and give
Britain the world's best-trained workforce.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said, "We will never be the biggest country,
we may never be the mightiest, but we can be the best."
</P>
<P>
Blair warned that teacher training would be reformed. Head
teachers would have a proper qualification. "Poor teachers will
go," he said.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister stressed, "Don't let anybody think that we
are tough on bad teaching because we don't value teachers."
</P>
<P>
"We are tough on bad teachers precisely because we do value
good teachers," he added.

<HEADLINE> Blair Announces 1998 Is UK NetYear </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRIGHTON, England, September 30 (Xinhua) -- November will see
the launch of UK NetYear, an on-going high-profile program
designed to raise awareness of the potential of the Internet as an
education tool, according to a press release issued by the Labor
Party Conference.
</P>
<P>
UK NetYear was given government support today as part of a
package of education initiatives in Prime Minister Tony Blair's
first speech to the Conference.
</P>
<P>
Schools across the UK need both the technology, and the
teachers trained to use it, to equip children with the skills they
need to excel in the next millennium.
</P>
<P>
At present only some 6,000 schools in the UK are connected to
the Internet. The aim of UK NetYear is to increase this total to
17,000 by the end of 1998, and in conjunction with the National
Grid for Learning to have all 32,000 schools on the "Net" by 2002.
</P>
<P>
UK NetYear will motivate local communities and businesses to
become involved in the process, not only in sponsorship and
fund raising but also guidance for schools, the press release said.
</P>
<P>
UK NetYear will involve leading companies in the computing and
communications sectors, experienced in the application of
technology for the needs of society.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the program, the UK NetYear board's Executive
Chairman, David Wimpress, said, "We are determined that our
industry will make every effort to help school governors,
teachers, pupils and parents fully utilized the significant
potential of Information and Communication Technology to enhance
educational attainment."

<HEADLINE> World Scientists Call for Action on Global Warming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Some 1,000 world senior
scientists at a summit here today called on world leaders to act
immediately to prevent the potentially devastating consequences of
human-induced global warming.
</P>
<P>
A consensus declaration "World Scientists' Call for Action at
Kyoto," signed by more than 1,500 scientists, was presented to the
U.S. government at the Summit on Climate Change in Washington, DC.
</P>
<P>
"Let there be no doubt about the conclusions of the scientific
community: the threat of global warming is very real and action is
needed immediately," said Nobel laureate Henry Kendall, chairman
of the Union of Concerned Scientists. "It is a grave error to
believe that we can continue to procrastinate."
</P>
<P>
Leading scientists came to the Science Summit to urge world
leaders at their Kyoto Climate Summit in Japan in December to
negotiate final agreement on a treaty to reduce emissions of
carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases that are altering the
climate.
</P>
<P>
The scientists meeting today was held six days before a White
House conference to propose global actions on the issue.
</P>
<P>
The scientists' declaration urged all government leaders to
demonstrate a new commitment to protecting the global environment
for future generations.
</P>
<P>
The declaration stated that global warming is underway and the
overuse of fossil fuels is partly to blame. It said that climate
change is projected to raise sea levels; increase the likelihood
of more intense rainfall, floods, and droughts; and endanger human
health by greater exposure to heat waves and encroachment of
tropical diseases to higher latitudes.
</P>
<P>
Further, the declaration said, climate change is likely to
exacerbate food shortages and spread undernutrition by adversely
affecting water supplies, soil conditions, temperature tolerances,
and growing seasons.
</P>
<P>
Climate change will also accelerate the appalling pace at which
species are now disappearing, especially in vulnerable ecosystems,
it said, adding that possibly one-third of all species may be lost
before the end of the next century.
</P>
<P>
According to the Union of Concerned Scientists, the atmospheric
concentration of carbon dioxide has increased by 30 percent since
preindustrial times. Over the same period, atmospheric methane has
risen by 145 percent, mostly from agricultural activities like
growing rice and raising cattle.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the earth's average surface temperature will
increase by 1.0-3.5 degrees Celsius in the next 100 years, in
addition to the increase of 0.3-0.6 degrees Celsius that has
already occurred since 1860.
</P>
<P>
Scientists predict that even if people stopped emitting
heat-trapping gases now, the climate wouldn't stabilize for many
decades because of the gases have already been sent into the
atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
They hold that a strong treaty will be the "first step to
protect future generations from dire prospects that would result
from failure to meet our responsibilities toward them."
</P>
<P>
This is a wake-up call for world leaders. Never before has the
senior scientific community spoken so boldly on the urgent need to
prevent disruption to our climate," said Nobel laureate Dudley
Herschbath, professor of chemistry at Harvard University.

<HEADLINE> US Congress Extends Eviction Deadline for Illegal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Only a few hours before
thousands of illegal immigrants could have been required to leave
the United States, Congress today completed action on a bill
letting many illegal immigrants stay in the United States for
three more weeks while seeking legal residence.
</P>
<P>
The reprieve through October 23 was included in a bill keeping
federal agencies financed for the start of fiscal 1998, which
begins Wednesday. The Senate approved the overall measure without
debate by 99-0, with only one senator missing the vote.
</P>
<P>
The House approved the measure Monday by 355-57.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said President Bill Clinton
will sign the bill "whenever we get it."
</P>
<P>
Final congressional action came as lawyers, charitable
organizations and other groups were flooded by thousands of calls
from immigrants worried that the grace period was about to expire.
</P>
<P>
A 1994 law lets some undocumented immigrants file in the United
States for legal status instead of at U.S. consulates abroad. To
do so, they must pay a fine of 1,000 dollars.
</P>
<P>
The provision applies only to illegal immigrants eligible for
legal residence, either because they're already in line for visas
or are the spouse or minor child of a U.S. citizen. Parents of
adult children who are U.S. citizens also can apply.
</P>
<P>
Of the more than approximately 5 million illegal immigrants
believed to be in the United States, 345,000 people took advantage
of the rule in 1995 and 1996. An estimated 214,000 are applying
this year.
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers will decide next month whether to renew the provision
for a longer period. The Senate already has approved a permanent
extension.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Chinese embassies in some
African countries held receptions today to mark the birthday of
the People's Republic of China which falls on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Chinese ambassador to Uganda Tan Xingju gave a reception in
Kampala this evening to celebrate the 48th anniversary of the
founding of the People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
The year of 1997 witnessed smooth return of Hong Kong to its

</P>
<P>
He added that the two events are worth being proud for Chinese
people. The program adopted by the congress and the new Central
Committee elected by the congress will lead all Chinese people to
march into the 21-st century, he noted.
</P>

<HEADLINE> China Is No Threat to its Neighbors, Powell Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, October 1 (Xinhua) -- General Colin L. Powell,
former Chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff said here today
he does not believe China is a threat to its neighbors despite
efforts to modernize its military.
</P>
<P>
Asked to comment on the so-called China Threat allegation at a
press conference after his keynote speech at the 1997 Citibank
Asian Leadership Series, Powell said, "It's something to watch. I
watch because it is too early to worry."
</P>
<P>
He said that China is modernizing its military because "their
military is so far behind they have to modernize it. We are
modernizing ours and Singapore is modernizing theirs," he added.
</P>
<P>
"China has come to the conclusion that the way to become a more
successful nation is not to threaten its neighbors, but to
participate in the world economic system," said Powell, who served
as a key military advisor to the US president.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Powell stressed that China is becoming a major power
in the world, not because of its ideology or its military force,
but because of it's participation in the globalization of the
world economy.

<HEADLINE> Sudanese Government Seeking to Sign Agreement With </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, October l (Xinhua) -- The Sudanese government is
seeking to sign an agreement with the largest anti-government
rebel group in the south, in a bid to end the 14-year civil war, a
government official has said.
</P>
<P>
The government is ready to accept all the mediations to secure
an agreement with John Garang, leader of the Sudan People's
Liberation Army (SPLA), Mohamed Al Amin Khalifa, secretary general
of Sudan's Supreme Peace Council, said in an exclusive interview
published by Sudanese newspaper Akhbar El-Yom today.
</P>
<P>
The government signed a peace agreement with four small
southern rebel factions in Khartoum last April. But the SPLA
refused to join the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Khartoum peace agreement stipulates that the Southerners
would be given the right to self-determination at the end of a
transitional period, Khalifa said.
</P>
<P>
After the four-year transitional period, citizens in the south will
decide by ballot whether they will stay in or to separate from the
country, according to the agreement.
</P>
<P>
Khalifa said that the government and the SPLA agreed recently
on the venue of a meeting and the number of negotiators from both
parties to the negotiation.
</P>
<P>
Khalifa said that the government is ready to put forward its
own views while listening to ideas of the SPLA delegation on the
future of the country in the coming negotiations scheduled for
October in Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
The SPLA declared its acceptance of the IGADD
(Inter-Governmental Authority on Drought and Development)
"Declaration of Principles" put forward in 1994 for resolving the
southern Sudan question.
</P>
<P>
IGADD, which groups Sudan, Kenya,Uganda, Ethiopia, Eritrea,
Somalia and Djibouti, called for separation of religion from
politics and upholding political pluralism in Sudan in the
"Declaration of Principles".
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese government has already signed peace agreements
with seven rebel factions in southern Sudan.
</P>
<P>
Over 1 million people have died in violence since 1983 when the
southern rebels took up arms for greater autonomy from the
Islamic north for the Christian and Animist south.

<HEADLINE> Criminal Proceedings Initiated Against Kokh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 1 (Xinhua) -- The Moscow Prosecutor's
Office has initiated criminal proceedings against ex-deputy prime
minister and former head of the State Property Committee Alfred
Kokh on a charge of abuse of office, the Interfax news agency
reported today.
</P>
<P>
According to Deputy Prosecutor of Moscow Yuri Syomin, the
decision was made after the Prosecutor-General's Office submitted
reports claiming that Kokh had received a 100,000 U.S. dollar bribe
from the Swiss company Servina Trading.
</P>
<P>
The reports revealed that in January 1997, the Servina agency
paid Kokh 557.3 million rubles (about 100,000 dollars) for the
right to publish his book on privatization in Russia, which has not
been finished yet.
</P>
<P>
"The number of books that will be printed is expected to be 100
to 4,000 copies at a price not to exceed 15 U.S. dollars a
copy. However, under the agreement, the author received a fee far
in excess of expected revenues," Syomin said.
</P>
<P>
"No responsibility was envisioned in the agreement for the
improper implementation or nonimplementation of obligations by
Kokh," the deputy prosecutor added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Prosecutor's Office has also been informed that
the agreement between Kokh and the Servina agency had been
mediated by Dmitri Ushakov, the vice chairman of the board of
UNEXIM bank.
</P>
<P>
Syomin said the bank wished "to strengthen relations
with Kokh, as a deputy prime minister and the head of the State
Property Committee."
</P>
<P>
Under these circumstances, the Prosecutor's Office today
initiated criminal proceedings against Kokh and launched an
investigation.

VIENNA, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Triple World Cup ski jump
champion Andreas Goldberger, temporarily suspended from the
Austrian team for using cocaine, was Wednesday ordered to pay a
fine for "multiple possession" of the drug.
</P>
<P>
The court did not immediately announce the amount of the fine.
</P>
<P>
Goldberger was suspended by the Austrian Ski Federation in
April, a day after admitting trying cocaine "just once" at a
Viennese disco last year.
</P>
<P>
Goldberger, whose form dipped this season after World Cup
triumphs in 1993, 1995 and 1996, admitted trying the drug on
Austrian television following widespread rumours in the Austrian
media.
</P>
<P>
Goldberger has said he still intends to compete at next year's

<HEADLINE> Southern Africa Urged to Prepare for El Nino </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Southern African countries
have been urged by the World Bank to enhance regional cooperation
to prepare for the early appearance of El Nino, which could cause
a long spell of devastating drought in the region.
</P>
<P>
Regional cooperation is needed, with better forecasting
technology, for the region to be better prepared for the early
approach of El Nino, bank officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"There are clearly benefits to integration in the region...
Africa is not even on the map for many investors as a trade area
and that is a concern," said Pamela Cox, World Bank country
director for South Africa, Botswana, Namibia, Lesotho and
Swaziland.
</P>
<P>
He said that there were many cross-border issues in the region
such as water management, transport infrastructure for landlocked
nations, improving communications systems and addressing health
issues such as malaria.
</P>
<P>
He said the World Bank has identified broad targets for future
assistance. They include encouraging trade links, developing
transport corridors, making capital flow easier and solving water
supply problems.
</P>
<P>
The South African Weather Bureau said it was detecting early
signs of the appearance of El Nino.
</P>
<P>
"The fairly good rains we experienced a few weeks ago,
followed by these very high temperatures (in the past few days),
is an indication of the disturbance in the weather patterns,"
said Mike Edwards, the bureau's deputy director.
</P>
<P>
Normally El Nino did not start causing weather problems in
South Africa before December, but it was known that the El Nino
pattern started early this year.
</P>
<P>
As an indication of the approach of El Nino, a strong heat
wave swept the country in the past few days when summer has
barely begun.
</P>
<P>
At least 13 heat records for September were broken Monday with
temperatures as high as 42.6 being recorded.
</P>
<P>
South Africa's hottest temperature Monday in the Kruger
National Park in the Mpumalanga province was a record high in 35
years.
</P>
<P>
High temperatures were also recorded in the Northern Cape and
Gauteng provinces.
</P>
<P>
"I would not say that this particular heat is an indication
that there is going to be a drought in South Africa... it is an
indication that there is already a disturbance in our weather
patterns," Edwards said.
</P>
<P>
The Pretoria-based weather bureau predicted that hot to very
hot weather will continue in most of the country for the next two
weeks.
</P>
<P>
South Africa's National Maize Producers' Association, worried
about an early onset of an El Nino drought in southern Africa,
has warned its members to delay planting this year. Early El Nino
could be disastrous in the region, it said.
</P>
<P>
The El Nino weather phenomenon, caused by the warming of
Pacific waters off South America, is already being blamed for
economic turmoil in other parts of the world.
</P>
<P>
In Southeast Asia, a dry spell has damaged maize crops in
Java, Indonesia, and it is feared that the El Nino effect could
rival that in 1982-83, which cost the world about 13 billion U.S.
Dollars.

<HEADLINE> Hamas Welcomes Yassin's Release, Vowing to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 1 (Xinhua) -- The Islamic Resistance
Movement (Hamas) today welcomed the release of its founder Sheikh
Ahmed Yassin, while vowing to continue its holy war against Israel
"until the liberation of Palestine."
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued following Yassin's release overnight from
Israeli prison and arrival in Jordanian capital Amman, Hamas also
thanked Jordanian King Hussein for his efforts in securing
Yassin's release.
</P>
<P>
"Hamas welcomes the release of the Mujahid Sheikh Ahmed Yassin
from the prison of Zionist enemy. The movement also appreciates
the Jordanian efforts exerted to release him," the Hamas statement
said.
</P>
<P>
Yassin, 61, who founded Hamas in 1987 and has been jailed for
life sentence since 1989, was flown in a Jordanian helicopter to
Amman and transferred to the King Hussein Medical Center for
treatment. He was seriously ill after nine years imprisonment in
Israeli jail, and was wheel chair-bound, paralyzed in arms and
legs, and suffering from breathing and hearing problems.
</P>
<P>
After refusing numerous calls for Yassin's release, Israel
finally decided to free Yassin apparently because of the fear
that his death in Israeli prison could spark a wave of
retaliatory terror attacks by Hamas militants.
</P>
<P>
Hamas, which has been launching a terror campaign to destroy
Israel in order to establish a single Muslim state in the whole
Middle East, has gained fame for its suicide bombing operations
against Israeli targets.
</P>
<P>
Since 1994, Hamas has planned a dozen of suicide attacks
inside Israel, killing hundreds of people. It claimed
responsibility for the recent two suicide attacks in Jerusalem's
Mahane Yehud market and Ben Yehuda mall which killed 25 people
and wounded over 300 others.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, King Hussein called on Israel to take positive
steps to help promote the peace process by freeing Yassin from
jail. This provided the excuse for Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu to release Yassin.
</P>
<P>
After his arrival in the hospital in Amman today, Yassin gave
a four-minute telephone news conference held in Gaza by local
Hamas leader Abdul Aziz Rantisi. "I send to my greetings to the
entire Palestinian people. I want to inform them that I am coming
back to Gaza in the near future," Yassin said.
</P>
<P>
Rantisi earlier condemned Israel's handling of Yassin's
release, saying Yassin was expelled and not freed by Israel. In
the Gaza news conference, he quoted Yassin as saying that Hamas
will continue its jihad (holy war) "until the end of Israeli
occupation and the return of the total rights of the Palestinian
people."
</P>
<P>
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) officials also criticized
Israel for deporting Yassin instead of allowing him to reunite
with his family in Gaza.
</P>
<P>
PNA Secretary-General Abdul Rahman denounced Israel for not
informing the PNA of Yassin's release. Senior Palestinian
negotiator Saeb Erekat expressed the hope that Yassin would be
allowed to come back to Gaza, adding that Israel should release
all jailed Palestinian prisoners according to signed peace
accords.

<HEADLINE> Biogas Advised as Energy Source in Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, October 1 (Xinhua) -- A total of 1.4 million
megawatts in annual potential electricity can be produced in
Tanzania through biogas from crop wastes, with crude diesel oil
substitution of about 350,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
This is a suggestion by Professor Amelia Kajumulo of the
applied microbiology unit in the Department of Botany at the
University of Tanzania in a research she has conducted.
</P>
<P>
Total oil substitution from residues will be equivalent to two
percent of total energy consumption in the country, on the basis
of case studies conducted at coffee and sisal processing
factories.
</P>
<P>
Amelia Kajumulo said that important agro-industrial residues
and municipal solid wastes with large potentials from anaerobic
conversion into biogas and electricity have been identified and
quantified following intensive research.
</P>
<P>
She said that about 615,000 tons of organic matter is being
generated from coffee, sisal, sugar-cane and cereal residues
while households in major towns generate about 600,000 tons of
organic materials annually.
</P>
<P>
She is of the view that tapping available resources of biogas
energy will enable the country to stabilize power supply. Wastes
used for biogas production has enormous potential for reduction
of environmental pollution.

<HEADLINE> UN Concerned about Safety of its Staff in Afghanistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 1 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations expressed
here today its "deep concern" over the safety of its staff in
Mazar-e-Sharif, northwest Afghanistan, following reports that they
have been threatened with "serious actions" by warring factions.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Special Mission to Afghanistan (UNSMA) is
deeply concerned about the safety and well-being of the U.N. and
Non-Governmental Organization staff in Mazar-e-Sharif, where the
Afghan Islamic Taliban militia and their northern rivals are
battling for the control of the city, UNSMA Head Norbert Holl said
here today in a press release.
</P>
<P>
"The U.N. is engaged solely in a mediation process and in
humanitarian activities in Afghanistan and that any suggestion of
undercover activities is groundless," Holl said.
</P>
<P>
Holl appealed in the name of the Secretary General of the U.N.
to all the warring factions to facilitate the evacuation of the
U.N. and NGO staff from the city at the earliest possible time.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Hezb-e-Wahdat, one of the anti-Taliban
factions reportedly threatened today that unless the U.N. takes
action to stop Taliban jet raids on Mazar-e-Sharif, "serious
actions" will be taken against the U.N. staff in the city who he
said were passing on intelligence to the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. and the International Red Cross had evacuated about 70
staff from Mazar-e-Sharif to Pakistan in late September. But due
to increased fighting in and around the city, the U.N. has failed
to bring the remaining staff in the city to safety.

<HEADLINE> Main Construction of Tibet Museum Completed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, October 1 (Xinhua) -- The main construction of the Tibet
Museum, the first modern multi-function museum in the Tibetan history,
was completed here today.
</P>
<P>
A special ceremony was held today for the unveiling of the
museum's name, written by Chinese President Jiang Zemin.
</P>
<P>
In August 1995, the Chinese central government allocated over
100 million yuan for the construction of the museum in Lhasa,
capital of the Tibet Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The construction of the museum is the largest cultural project
Tibet has ever witnessed in this century.
</P>
<P>
The already-completed projects of the museum include a three-story
main exhibition hall and 30 warehouses, with a total area of
15,500 square meters.
</P>
<P>
The construction company said that both the hall and warehouses
feature up-to-date first-class security and firefighting equipment.
</P>
<P>
Museum Curator Chilai Qoigzha said that following the full
completion of its construction by the end of next year, the museum
would become a new symbol of Lhasa and a tourist attraction as
popular as the Potala Palace.
</P>
<P>
Yang Chuantang, vice-chairman of the Regional People's
Government, noted that the museum would also serve as a major base
for education on patriotism in Tibet, for it would contain many
relics and records that could prove Tibet has been an inalienable
part of China since ancient times.
</P>
<P>
He added that the museum would also display a number of
revolutionary relics from the past four decades and more, to
reflect the tremendous changes in the region since the complete
abolition of serfdom, especially since the beginning of China's
reform and opening-up to the outside.
</P>
<P>
"Let various rumors fabricated by western anti-China forces and
the Dalai clique declare their own intellectual bankruptcy in the
face of iron-clad proof," Yang said.

<HEADLINE> Abacha Hails Nigeria's Macro-Economic Stability </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's head of state, General
Sani Abacha today hailed his government's success in bringing
macro-economic stability to the country.
</P>
<P>
"It is uplifting that as we come into the final year in office
of this administration, the nation is experiencing relative
macro-economic stability as a result of the policy measures and
actions we have taken," Abacha said in his early morning national
broadcast marking the west African country's 37th Independence
Day.
</P>
<P>
He noted the increased earnings from non-oil sector, stronger
foreign reserve, the favorable balance of payments, stricter
fiscal discipline and the reduced rate of inflation from 72.8
percent in December 1995 to 17.5 percent in June this year.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, he said, the exchange rate of the Naira has
stabilized over the past four years. Interest rates have also
stabilized.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria's external debt stock has fallen to 28.06 billion U.S.
Dollars by the end of 1996 from 32 billion Dollars a year ago.
</P>
<P>
As to the oil sector which is backbone of the national
economy, Abacha said significant progress has been made in the
execution of four major natural gas utilization projects.
</P>
<P>
As order and security returns to the country, foreign and
local oil firms have maintained a high level of investment. As a
result, he declared that Nigeria's crude oil reserve has risen
from 20.8 billion barrels in 1994 to about 25 billion barrels
today.
</P>
<P>
He promised continued commitment to the Petroleum Trust Fund
which he established in 1994 and assured that the fund will
continue to give support to road, health, water supply, education
and other aspects of life with money from the oil sector.
</P>
<P>
He condemned the criminal acts of petroleum products smuggling
and the sabotage of oil production facilities, saying that the
government is committed to the uninterrupted supply of petroleum
products at affordable prices to the people.
</P>
<P>
In the agriculture sector, the head of state promised to make
government funds available to the millions of small-scale farmers
and to crack down on corruptions involved in fertilizer
subsidies.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Abacha assured the government is making efforts
to boost the dwindling purchasing power of the Nigerian people,
especially those in the public sector.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that a pay rise might come soon for the country's
civil servants, as the government has almost concluded a review
of their salaries and allowances.

<HEADLINE> Canada Sees Strong GDP Growth in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Canadian economy surged in July,
erasing concerns of a slowdown signaled by flat numbers in June,
reports said today.
</P>
<P>
Statistics Canada reported Tuesday that the country's gross
domestic product (GDP) grew by 0.8 percent in July, doubling the pace
of growth forecasters had been expecting.
</P>
<P>
So far this year, the economy has expanded at an annual rate above
three percent, almost twice the growth rate of 1996.
</P>
<P>
The July surge was partly influenced by recovery from production
disruptions in June in the auto, oil, mining and metal processing
industries.
</P>
<P>
Yet, growth in July was widely spread through the economy. There
was growth in 19 of the 21 manufacturing groups.
</P>
<P>
The strong GDP growth in July will prompt revisions of growth
estimated by many economics departments, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Paul Ferley, assistant chief economist at Bank of Montreal,
predicted a growth rate of 4.4-5 percent for the third quarter, up
from a previous forecast of 3.75-4.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The strong growth data pushed the Canadian dollar higher yesterday
as speculation intensified that the Bank of Canada will raise its
benchmark rate soon.
</P>
<P>
The next major market-sensitive report will be the September labor
force survey results due October 10.
</P>
<P>
The market is expected to watch out for a rate hike if growth in
employment pushes the jobless rate below nine percent.

LONDON, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Chris Eubank of Welsh will have a
bout against fellow Briton Joe Calzaghe for the vacant WBO
super-middleweight title in Sheffield on October 11.
</P>
<P>
Eubank, former world light-heavyweight champion, replaced
holder Steve Collins of Ireland, whose title was taken by the WBO
for his absence of the fight due to a leg injury.
</P>
<P>
Eubank, who runs his match record to 45 wins, two defeats and
two draws, has to lose six pounds first to make the weight for the
bout. However, he was confident for his diet plan.
</P>
<P>
His opponent has lost no one in his 22 matches.
</P>
<P>
Collins will wait to fight the winner.

<HEADLINE> Sion Protests Spartak Goal Was Too Small </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Swiss champion Sion has made a
formal protest to European soccer's ruling body that one of the
goals was too small for their UEFA Cup match away to Spartak
Moscow on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Sion has asked that the first-round second-leg match, which
ended 2-2 but with Spartak winning 3-2 on aggregate, be awarded to
the Swiss side 3-0, allowing them to go through to the second
round.
</P>
<P>
Spartak angrily dismissed the complaint as frivolous but said
the club was not unduly concerned by the appeal.
</P>
<P>
According to media reports, measurements by a UEFA match
delegate, which delayed the start of the game by 30 minutes, found
the crossbar on one of the goals at Moscow's Locomotiv stadium was
14 centimeters below the regulation height of 2.44 meters.
</P>
<P>
UEFA confirmed on Wednesday it had received the protest and
would make a decision before the second- round draw in Geneva on
Friday.

WASHINGTON, October 1 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading American newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
The New York Times
</P>
<P>
-- The Republican leaders of both the House and Senate said

to the cause.
</P>

in the disputed region of Kashmir, leaving up to 21 people dead

</P>
<P>
The Washington Post
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. Airways and its pilots' union late last night reached a
tentative agreement on a new contract which would create a major

<TEXT>
<P>
Lusaka, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Zambia signed the final

<HEADLINE> Hamas Founder Released by Israel, Arrives in Amman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Shiekh Ahmed Yassin, the founder
of the Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas, arrived here early this
morning after Israel released the seriously ailing anti-Israeli
hardliner from jail on Jordanian King Hussein's demand.
</P>
<P>
Hussein and Jordanian Prime Minister Abdul Salam Majali
received the spiritual leader at the airport, who was removed
from a Jordanian helicopter on a stretcher and later hospitalized
in the King Hussein Medical Center (KHMC) under Hussein's
instruction, Radio Jordan reported.
</P>
<P>
The king said today that he is happy to see that Israel
released Yassin only hours after he announced such a demand
Tuesday during a speech in Zarqa City, southwest of Amman.
</P>
<P>
Hussein expressed the hope that the release of Yassin would be
the first step of a series of Israeli actions that might help
reactivate the stalled Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The king later went to KHMC and visited Yassin, who had been
jailed by Israel in 1989 and expected to serve a life sentence for
ordering attacks by Hamas guerrillas against Israeli targets.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat also called repeatedly on
Israel to release Yassin, but his demands were just ignored.
</P>
<P>
Israel released the Hamas leader to exchange for two Canadian
tourists, who were arrested in Jordan for attacking Hamas leader
Khaled Mashal. Hamas claimed that the two foreigners are Israeli
agents in an assassination attempt on Mashal.
</P>
<P>
In the same hospital, Hussein also visited Mashal, head of the
political bureau of Hamas who is recovering from the September 25
attack.
</P>
<P>
Hamas was established in 1987 to fight against Israel's
occupation of Palestine. Most Hamas political bureau members live
in Jordan.
</P>
<P>
Jordan signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1994 and is now one
of the only two Arab countries that have peace with the Jewish
state.

<HEADLINE> FAO to Help Malawi Secure Food </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lusaka, October 1 (Xinhua) -- The Food and Agriculture
Organization (FAO) will launch a special food security pilot
program in Malawi next month to help the country secure a base of
food production by controlling water.
</P>
<P>
FAO director general Jacques Diouf, who visited Malawi
recently, said the country is lucky to be endowed with abundant
water resources like Lake Malawi, and it should not have its
people sleeping on empty stomachs for most of the year.
</P>
<P>
To irrigate crops and turn around the sad hunger story which
afflicts 60 percent of the population of 12 million, he said
Malawi should tap its good surface water, comprising a network of
rivers and lakes covering 20 percent of the country.
</P>
<P>
Only eight percent of Africa's arable land has water control
while the rest depends on the vagaries of climate, he said.
</P>
<P>
More than half of the water control is in five countries of
Egypt, Sudan, Morocco, Madagascar and South Africa, according to
him.
</P>
<P>
The biggest problem in Africa is water and the continent loses
four billion cubic meters of water to the sea every year, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Diouf urged Africans to control that water as everybody else
does around the world and use it for irrigation.
</P>
<P>
FAO will provide start-up funds of 500,000 U.S. Dollars to
launch the program and this will be supplemented with bilateral
funds from the World Bank and the African Development Bank.
</P>
<P>
Malawi has only 10,000 hectares of the potential 200,000
hectares of land under irrigation.

<HEADLINE> Japan Warns of Fake Car Dealers in Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, October 1 (Xinhua) -- The Japanese Ministry of
International Trade and Industry (MITI) has warned through the
Japanese embassy here that some Japanese car dealers might be
cheating their customers.
</P>
<P>
MITI, which was requested by the Japanese government to carry
out investigations into allegations by Zambian buyers that they
have not received their vehicles even after paying for them,
concluded that nothing could be done about the missing dealers
because the transactions did not have signed contracts.
</P>
<P>
"Under the given situation MITI considers that what the buyers
can now do is only to wait for the sellers' goodwill to keep the
promises," it said.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman from the embassy said Tuesday that sometimes
vehicles take a long time to reach their destinations after being
ordered because sellers embarked upon the search for a particular
vehicle after the order.
</P>
<P>
Sometimes the dealers could deliberately keep the vehicles
until they have enough orders to reduce on freight costs, the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
He said that to avoid similar problems in future, MITI will
first investigate an organization selling cars and the government
will order that the vehicle be delivered.
</P>
<P>
In the case of a Mail Order Business, MITI will instruct the
sellers based on the laws of Japan to specify the time required
for delivery in the seller's advertisement.
</P>
<P>
"It is considered that the main cause of the trouble is
attributed to the lack of an agreement between the buyer and the
seller, concerning the delivery period of a vehicle," the
spokesman said.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's Vision 2010 Committee
on Tuesday submitted the country's first long-term development
plan to the head of state, General Sani Abacha, 11 months after
it was launched in November 1996.
</P>
<P>
Receiving the final report of the committee in Abuja, General
Abacha said the government would carefully study it and would
implement some of the recommendations as soon as they are
adopted.
</P>
<P>
He solicited for the support of all ethnic groups, states and
stake-holders to ensure the successful implementation of the
report.
</P>
<P>
Apparently referring to the wide fear that succeeding
governments might not observe the plan, Abacha said he hoped that
subsequent administrations would continue what he had started.
</P>
<P>
Former leader of an interim government and chairman of the
250-member committee, Chief Ernest Shonekan described the future
of Nigeria as portraited by the report.
</P>
<P>
According to him, by 2010, Nigeria will be "a united,
industrious, caring and God-fearing democratic society, committed
to making the basic needs of life affordable for everyone and
creating Africa's leading economy".

Tibetan counties, including Nagarze, Gongbo'gyamba, Bomi, Zayu and
Lhunze, where intensive ultraviolet rays have brought on a high
incidence of cataracts.
</P>
<P>
Doje comes from Nagarze County, near Yamzho Yumco Lake, which
has one of the harshest natural environments in the Tibetan
Autonomous Region. A total of 151 patients with cataracts from
Nagarze County had undergo surgery at the Nagarze County Hospital
by last Monday. And on September 29, the medical team from the
Beijing Tongren Hospital, with help from the local medical staff,
operated non-stop from 8 a.m. till 11 p.m., and Chief surgeon Zhou
Jun performed eight surgeries without a break.
</P>
<P>
"I have never done so many operations continuously under such
difficult conditions. Frankly speaking, I am tired. But I can't
stop working with so many patients still waiting in the operating
room," Zhou said.
</P>
<P>
The medical staff is working very hard to overcome difficulties
arisen from the poor-quality medical equipment and the unfamiliar
high-altitude environment.

<HEADLINE> Ramos, Suharto Agree to Fight Currency Speculators </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
and Indonesian President Suharto have agreed to forge a common
front to fight the speculative attacks on Southeast Asian
currencies.
</P>
<P>
Ramos said in his weekly press conference today that they made
the commitment in a phone conversation Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
He said his discussion with Suharto dealt on the need for a
united action to protect the rupiah, peso and other regional
currencies from further depreciation which has affected the growth
of the economies of the countries in the region.
</P>
<P>
One specific mechanism, Ramos said, was the establishment of an
ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) Fund to "weather"
the financial crisis sweeping the region and stabilize regional
currencies.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN finance ministers and monetary authorities have been
meeting in the past few months to discuss the current economic
situation in the region as well as the need for united action
against speculative currency attacks, he said.
</P>
<P>
Ramos said it was possible that central banks of all ASEAN
member-countries would adopt and implement common policies and
mechanisms to stabilize the region's currency.

<HEADLINE> Abacha Reiterates Military's Quit in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's head of state General
Sani Abacha reiterated today that the military administration
will hand over to an elected government a year later as
scheduled.
</P>
<P>
The political transition program drafted two years ago has
been "steadfastly implemented and "will by the grace of God
terminate on October 1, 1998 with the entry into office of an
elected civilian administration", according to Abacha.
</P>
<P>
The military ruler made the remarks in a 50-minute
pre-recorded speech on the national television station this
morning to mark the 37th anniversary of the country's
independence.
</P>
<P>
The transition to civil rule program proposed by the Abacha
regime, seen as a road to democracy in the country, has attracted
immense attention both at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
But Abacha warned: "the success of any experiment of political
engineering ultimately depends on the watchfulness and commitment
of the people."
</P>
<P>
"For our political structures to work, we all must imbibe the
spirit of give and take, fair play, justice and respect of the
rule of law," he added.
</P>
<P>
The head of state felt "happily" satisfied that the
overwhelming majority of the Nigeria people and their leaders are
participating enthusiastically in the implementation of the
transition program.
</P>
<P>
With all restrictions on political activities lifted and the
five registered political parties firmly established and ready to
participate in the remaining elections of the transition period,
Abacha said, "the spirit and letter of the first stage of the
transition program have been successfully fulfilled."
</P>
<P>
There is one year to go to complete the transition program and
Nigerians have to elect state governors and a president during
the period. Preparations have been underway with the National
Electoral Commission of Nigeria in charge.
</P>
<P>
Despite Abacha's confidence in the transition program, his
speech today did not seem to allay speculations that he would
succeed himself by that time.
</P>
<P>
Whether Abacha will quit the military and run for the
presidency as a civilian has been a hot topic among Nigerians
since early this year.
</P>
<P>
Organizations for and against Abacha's participation in the
presidential election have been founded in the country. The
Nigerian army declared last week it will give full support to any
person elected as president, including Abacha.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year Abacha said it would depend on his
constituency if he would run for the presidency.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 1 (Xinhua) -- "We are proud of being
Chinese. We are especially happy to celebrate our own National Day
for the first time," said Lei Kuok-kun, a bus driver who led his
five-year-old son to the seaside promenade at the Hong Kong
Convention and Exhibition Center early this morning to pay their
salute to the hoisting of the national flag.
</P>
<P>
The solemn flag-raising ceremony held at 8:00 am today to mark
the 48th Chinese National Day was joined by over 3,000 local
residents, who were experiencing the first official flag-raising
ceremony in the Special Administrative Region (SAR).
</P>
<P>
After watching the ceremony, a Mr. He, in his 60s, and his wife
had a picture taken in front of the flag post as a memento.
</P>
<P>
"We are glad to see the raising of our national flag," He said.
"You can see that Hong Kong has been doing well since it became an
SAR and we are very confident in our future."
</P>
<P>
The hoisting of the flag opened a wide range of official and
social activities throughout Hong Kong in celebration of the
National Day, which include a Formation Flypast with six aircraft,
a grand National Day reception held by the SAR government, and a
half-hour splendid fireworks display in the night.
</P>
<P>
To Hong Kong people, October 1 means much more than two days
off. After more than 150 years of British colonial rule, Hong Kong
residents are now able to celebrate the National Day of their
motherland.
</P>
<P>
Today's local newspapers devoted pages to the National Day,
hailing the achievements of the motherland and the successful
implementation of "one country, two systems" in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Walking through Hong Kong's downtown or residential areas,
people are greeted with a sea of five-star red flags and colored
banners. The economic prosperity and social stability that have
been maintained in Hong Kong since July 1 have clearly added
happiness to the festival.
</P>
<P>
The venue of the flag-raising ceremony -- Hong Kong Convention
and Exhibition Center -- itself is a pride of Hong Kong, in which
the handover ceremony at midnight June 30, as well as the most
recent World Bank/IMF Annual Meetings, were successfully held.
</P>
<P>
"We in Hong Kong take tremendous pride in our Chinese identity.
This is our home and we will move forward together to promote
prosperity of our country and the SAR," said Tung Chee Hwa, chief
executive of HKSAR, in his National Day message.
</P>
<P>
The latest official public opinion survey has revealed that 80
percent of Hong Kong people were confident that Hong Kong would
continue to be prosperous and stable, which is eight percentage
points higher than a similar survey conducted in July.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Some 1,000 young people from
Hong Kong spent their first National Day in the Chinese capital
after the region returned to the motherland on July 1.
</P>
<P>
They are the first group of the 10,000 Hong Kong yougsters
organized by the Hong Kong Soong Ching Ling Fund to visit the
inland areas, for the purpose of better understanding China.
</P>
<P>
In the morning they visited the residence of Soong Ching Ling,
wife of China's revolutionary pioneer Sun Yat-sen, in northern
downtown Beijing.
</P>
<P>
"We knew little about Soong Ching Ling previously. But now we
understand that she was an important historical figure of our
country," said Chen Shuxian, a student.
</P>
<P>
During the War of Resistance against Japan (1937-45), Soong
stayed in Hong Kong to raise funds and materials to support the
Chinese army.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that after visiting the house, she knew that Soong
had made many contributions to the development of China by serving
the Chinese people wholeheartedly.
</P>
<P>
Chen Songde, another student, said that Soong was not only the
wife of Sun Yat-sen, but also Sun's comrade-in-arms and the
inheritor of his revolutionary cause. "She is one of the greatest
women in the 20th century," he said.
</P>
<P>
The young people will tour Beijing for the next several days.

</P>
<P>
Addressing the reception with participation of some 5,000

great achievements in the social, political and economic spheres
and of its important position in the international arena.
</P>
<P>
On July 1 this year, Hong Kong returned to the motherland and
entered a new era of its history, Tung said, noting that the SAR

<HEADLINE> Abacha Vows to Save Troubled Education Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria head of state, General
Sani Abacha today vowed to save the country's education sector
from many years of bad planning and shortsightedness.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks at his early morning national broadcast
marking the country's 37th anniversary of independence.
</P>
<P>
According to him, Nigeria's education sector has been troubled
by the severe strain and stress occasioned by many years of bad
planning and shortsightedness and was worse hit by a sliding
economy.
</P>
<P>
"With recent improvement in our national finance we shall soon
be in a position to deploy even more sources to the
rehabilitation of this crucial sector of our national growth and
development," said the head of state.
</P>
<P>
He noted that in the past one year, relative stability and
sanity have been restored in Nigerian schools, and that for the
first time in many years, schools began and concluded an academic
session without disruptions occasioned by strikes, closures or
student unrest.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that a 25-man committee set up by his government
to examine the problems of the education sector will soon submit
its final report.
</P>
<P>
The head of state expressed the hope that the findings and
recommendations of the group will greatly assist the government
in evolving further measures to revamp the education sector.
</P>
<P>
Another source of hope for the sector, he said, is the
Education Tax Fund established through a decree in 1993.
</P>
<P>
The fund has so far collected about seven billion Naira (about
86 million U.S. Dollars) which will be soon distributed to all
kinds of educational institutions, said the head of state.
</P>
<P>
According to him, 40 percent of the fund will go to primary
schools, 25 percent to universities, 12.5 percent to
polytechnics, 12.5 percent to colleges and the rest 10 percent to
secondary schools.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia, Thailand Open Third Common Border Crossing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia and Thailand today
opened along their common border the third crossing point, reports
said.
</P>
<P>
The river crossing checkpoint links Bukit Bunga in Malaysia's
northeastern state of Kelantan and Bukit Tar in Thailand's Weng
District, and will open at 6 am and close at 7 pm daily, the
Malaysian national news agency Bernama reported.
</P>
<P>
Commuters have to take the boat to cross the 20-metre wide
Sungai Jenub which separates the border.
</P>
<P>
The opening of the river crossing, as a reflection of close
bilateral ties between the two countries, would provide easy
movement of people of the two sides and enhance business
activities in the area, the news agency said quoting Immigration
Director-General Mohamed Zakri Abdul Rashid.
</P>
<P>
"Besides, it will also help overcome the problem of illegal
entry by villagers in the border areas" who have relatives in the
other side of the border, the Malaysian official was quoted as
saying after visiting the area.
</P>
<P>
The official said a complex would be set up in the area as soon
as Malaysia and Thailand officially agreed to the building of a
bridge across the river to replace the temporary building which at
present houses the Immigration, the Royal Customs and Excises
Departments.
</P>
<P>
The other two checkpoints at the Kelantan-Thailand border are
in Rantau Panjang where a bridge has been built over border river
Sungai Golok, which opens from 6 am to 10 pm daily, and at
Pengkalan Kubur, Tumpat, which opens daily from 6 am to 7 pm,
according to the reports.
</P>
<P>
The new checkpoint would make it more convenient for people
from both countries to cross over from other side.

MOSCOW, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Belarussian President Alexander
Lukashenko said today that the head of the Minsk bureau of Russian
Public Television (ORT) Pavel Sheremet, who has been detained in
Grodno, will be released within two or three days.
</P>
<P>
Lukashenko told reporters in Minsk that Sheremet is "not a
threat to society," and it does not make sense to keep him under
arrest since the investigation has been completed, Interfax
reported.
</P>
<P>
Prior to a court procedure, Sheremet can be released in
exchange for a written pledge not to leave the region, Lukashenko
said.
</P>
<P>
He said the decision to release Sheremet is exclusively within the
jurisdiction of the Belarussian law enforcement bodies, adding the
release became possible "only after the investigation conducted in
strict compliance with the procedural norms had been completed."
</P>
<P>
Sheremet and another ORT employee Dmitry Zavadsky were charged
by Belarus with "illegally and repeatedly crossing the state
(Belarrussian-Lithuanian) border."
</P>
<P>
Sheremet has been under detention since July; Zavadsky was

<HEADLINE> NATO Defense Ministers to Discuss Bosnian Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAASTRICHT, Netherlands, October 1 (Xinhua) -- NATO defense
ministers will hold a two-day talk on when and how to phase out
the presence in Bosnia-Herzegovina of SFOR troops whose
peacekeeping mandate expires in June, 1998.
</P>
<P>
In their annual informal meeting prior to the policy-making
conference scheduled for December, the defense ministers will be
briefed on the latest developments following municipal elections,
which were held on September 13-14, and exchange views on setting
up a security framework in Bosnia for the remaining nine months of
the SFOR (NATO-led Multinational Stabilization Force).
</P>
<P>
NATO reinforced its ground force to 40,000 troops before the
municipal elections and it intends to keep the troops in Bosnia
to ensure that parliamentary elections occur without incident on
October 23, reliable sources said.
</P>
<P>
Both elections are hailed as important steps toward
implementing the Dayton peace accords.
</P>
<P>
Though no decision will be made during the meeting in this
Dutch town, the defense ministers will try to figure out whether
to postpone or simply skip the planned third phase of the
peacekeeping operation in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
The SFOR had planned to reduce its troops after the municipal
elections. But conditions for a planned phase-out seemed premature
after Bosnian Serb loyalists, faithful to war-time leader Radovan
Karadzic, and the local media incited unrest against the presence
of the international community prior to the elections .

<HEADLINE> Nigeria to Be On for New Friends, Says Abacha </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria has successfully made new
friends with other countries in recent years despite the
hostilities from a section of the international community, the
head of state General Sani Abacha announced today.
</P>
<P>
Deliberating the country's foreign policy in a speech to mark
the 37th anniversary of independence, Abacha said that his
military administration was "satisfied with the remarkable level
of response we have received" in looking to "other parts of the
world to make new friends".
</P>
<P>
The former British colony's traditional allies in Europe and
America imposed sanctions on the country in 1993 when the then
military regime annulled that year's presidential election on
charges of malpractices.
</P>
<P>
The Commonwealth suspended Nigeria's membership following the
execution of nine tribal activists in November 1995.
</P>
<P>
All this has seriously hampered the development of Nigeria and
the government has to turn to other parts of the world,
particularly the east, for new friends.
</P>
<P>
The country has fostered good relations with some Asian
countries, including Malaysia, China and the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea, in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Thus Abacha declared: "Despite attempts by some misguided
persons, and assisted by a hostile section of the international
community to wage an ill-motivated campaign against our country,
we are satisfied that Nigeria's international stature has
remained undiminished."
</P>
<P>
For the country's bid to look for new friends which "became
necessary for Nigeria," Abacha explained, "this seems to be
normal practice by all nations and our country should be an
exception."
</P>
<P>
He noted: "we are conscious of the fact that true friendship
can only be nurtured on the matrix of mutual understanding, trust
and respect."
</P>
<P>
He further stated that Nigeria will remain open to all those
who wish to be friends and cooperate with the country.
</P>
<P>
The head of state also hoped the Commonwealth leadership to
embrace fair play, genuine dialogue and negotiations in order to
resolve the unfortunate impasse between the organization and
Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Abacha seemed particularly satisfied with the "traditionally
constructive roles" Nigeria has continued to play "within our
sub-region, within Africa and indeed on the larger international
arena".
</P>
<P>
He was referring to the active role Nigeria plays in the
sub-regional organization of the Economic Community of West
African States (ECOWAS), of which Nigeria takes the chairmanship.
</P>
<P>
Under ECOWAS, Nigeria has led the peace-keeping operations in
Liberia with huge human, financial and materials contribution,
which resulted in an end of the country's seven-year-old civil
war and a successful establishment of an elected civilian
government.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria now is also actively involved in the resolution of the
crisis in Sierra Leone, where a number of officers overthrew the
legitimate government in a coup on May 25 this year.
</P>
<P>
With the success in Liberia, Abacha said, "we already have
experience which we will bring to bear in our search for a
peaceful resolution of the crisis."
</P>
<P>
The ECOWAS chairman called on Sierra Leone's military junta to
resume serious negotiations and dialogue for the early
reinstatement of ousted President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah, the return
of peace and security and the settlement of refugees and the
displaced.
</P>
<P>
He also urged the international community to give support to
ECOWAS effort to resolve the crisis.
</P>
<P>
ECOWAS decided in August to impose economic embargo on Sierra
Leone in order to force the junta to step down. The embargo has
since been enforced by the west African peace-keeping force.

<HEADLINE> China Begins Regulating Commercial Theatrical Performances </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 1 (Xinhua) -- A set of regulations on
improving the management of commercial theatrical performances
went into effect today in China.
</P>
<P>
The regulations, issued by the State Council, stipulate that
performances must adhere to the principle of serving the people
and socialism, and must not have a negative social impact.
</P>
<P>
Commercial performances have become the main form of China's
theatrical production. Some of the stage shows have mediocre
scripts with vulgar content, and some actors have demanded
exorbitant salaries and have evaded taxes, according to an
official from the Ministry of Culture.
</P>
<P>
The regulations note that the performances should promote the
quality of national arts and enrich the cultural life of the
people. The content of advertisements must be both truthful and
legal, and must in no way deceive consumers.
</P>
<P>
According to the regulations, China will not allow the
establishment in China of joint-venture or solely
overseas-funded theatrical troupes, performing venues and
brokering institutions.
</P>
<P>
Overseas investment is allowed for the establishment or
renovation of theaters, but those investors are not allowed to
participate in the management or operation of the theaters, the
regulations said.
</P>
<P>
If artists from the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, Macao,
Taiwan of China or from other countries want to produce commercial
performances in China, they must receive approval from the
Ministry of Culture and are required to be managed by brokering
institutions.
</P>
<P>
The ministry official said that after the regulations are
implemented, cultural departments at various levels should
organize cadres and workers to study the new rules, and intensive
projects to regulate the cultural market will be carried out.
</P>
<P>
China has 57,000 theatrical troupes and 400 brokering agencies
providing services and information in the field.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Clean up House for Tourism Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 1 (Xinhua) -- The Tourism Authority of
Thailand (TAT) will need to "clean up" the country and improve its
image so as to attract more foreign tourists over the next two
years, according to Deputy Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra.
</P>
<P>
TAT is seeking cooperation from other government agencies to
deal with the country's negative image and to solve such problems
as crime, local mafias, traffic and airport security, that hurt
the tourism industry, according to the Bangkok Post today.
</P>
<P>
The Interior Ministry, which controls the police department,
will play a significant role in the task, Thaksin said.
</P>
<P>
TAT is set to launch a two-year "amazing Thailand" campaign for
1998 and 1999 at the end of this year, aimed at attracting a total
of 17 million foreign tourists with a total earning of 600 billion
baht (16.7 billion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
During the past two years, there were about 7 million foreign
arrivals and tourism-related income of about 200 billion baht (8.5
billion dollars) each year.

<HEADLINE> Russia Joins SFOR Action Against Serb Transmitters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAASTRICHT, Netherlands, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Russia, that had
lashed out at the NATO for not consulting it before taking some
Pale-held transmission towers, today took part in an SFOR action of
taking four of the Srpska Radio and Television (SRT) transmitters.
</P>
<P>
The NATO-led SFOR troops captured the four transmission towers in
Bosnia at the request of the high representative of the international
community.
</P>
<P>
High Representative Carlos Westendorp requested SFOR military
action earlier today after he determined that the SRT had violated the
Udrigovo Agreement of September 2 by their unacceptable treatment of a
September 26 press conference by Justice Arbour.
</P>
<P>
The SRT television tampered with the tape recording of the press
conference before airing the program.
</P>
<P>
Russian SFOR troops set up road blocks to help prevent provocative
incidents from local Serbs who had blocked SFOR maneuvres several
times prior to Bosnia's municipal elections held on September 13 and
14.
</P>
<P>
Some 400 SFOR troops took the four transmitters without incident,
according to NATO Secretary General Javier Solana, and they will be
handed over to new management, which the NATO chief defined as the
parties supporting the Republika Srpska president in Banja Luka.
</P>
<P>
The aim of SFOR's action is to assist the international high
representative in ensuring that the media in the Republika Srpska
reflects international norms of professional media conduct and fully
supports the goals of the Dayton peace accord.
</P>
<P>
The NATO chief described the SFOR action earlier today as a
demonstration of NATO's determination to back those who support
Dayton and to react swiftly and robustly against those who seek to
obstruct the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the Bosnian municipal elections, the SFOR troops had
captured a couple of radio and television transmission towers in
Bosnia. They later returned them to loyalists to Serb war-time leader
Radovan Karadzic.
</P>
<P>
Pro-Karadzic media in Bosnia was blamed by NATO and other
international organizations as inciting unrest against international
presence.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Closes Stronger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, October 1 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar sailed to
a stronger close today, blown along by a sudden jump up in the
gold price overnight.
</P>
<P>
It finished here at 72.68 U.S. cents, up from 71.97 U.S. cents
late yesterday.
</P>
<P>
Late today, gold was trading at higher at 335.05 U.S. dollars.

<P>
"The retracement levels on the Aussie are now going to be
limited with bullion looking very solid, copper looking very
solid," said Guy Reynolds, foreign exchange manager with Macquarie
Bank.
</P>
<P>
"It was a terrific move today and the target is now 73.10 U.S.
cents, a level we have been looking at for quite some time," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Traders said also underpinning the currency on the day was the
fact that many players now think any rate cut by the Reserve Bank
of Australia is not likely to occur until late October or early
November.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar was at 1.2784 marks, from 1.34 here
previously.
</P>
<P>
Against the yen, the local unit was at 87.53, off an intraday

<HEADLINE> Australians Water Bombing Planes to Combat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Australian water bombing planes
will be sent to Indonesia to fight the country's disastrous forest
fires which have blanketed much of South-East Asia in a thick
haze, Foreign Minister Alexander Downer said today.
</P>
<P>
"I am pleased to announce an additional Australian commitment
of up to one million Australian dollars (720,000 U.S. dollars) for
aerial water bombing to assist Indonesia to tackle emergency
problems resulting from the forest fires," Downer said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
The announcement comes just two days after Mr. Downer committed
another one million Australian dollars in emergency assistance to
deal with the health problems caused by the fires.
</P>
<P>
The fires are reportedly unlikely to be extinguished until the
onset of the monsoon rains, which are unusually late this year.
</P>
<P>
But Downer said the Australian aircraft would help prevent the
crisis worsening.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister said the water bombing aircraft should be
able to go quickly into action.
</P>
<P>
"The lead members of the Water Bombing and other Fire
Management and the Health Assistance teams are scheduled to arrive
in Indonesia by the end of the week."
</P>
<P>
Australia would send two fixed-wing aircraft to Indonesia
within five days, both capable of carrying 3,000 litters of water.

sealants will hit two million to 2.4 million tons annually by
2000, sources said.
</P>

the country's synthetic adhesive industry an annual production
capacity of 1.3 million tons.

They said that the increased production of adhesives can be
attributed to the fast-growing automotive and construction
industries.
</P>

The exhibition, to run from October 8 to 10 at the National
Agricultural Exhibition Hall, will showcase the latest development
in the sector. A total of 2,000 adhesive products will be on

<HEADLINE> Discarded Batteries Reclaimed in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 1 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese capital of Beijing
is now promoting a campaign to reclaim worn-out batteries for
recycling, China Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
Special boxes bearing slogans like "You want a beautiful
environment, I want your batteries" will be set up along streets
and in stores later this year for the collection of discarded
batteries.
</P>
<P>
Sponsors of this campaign include the Beijing Television
Station, the municipality's Regenerated Resources Multi-Purpose
Use Office and the China Environmental Protection Fund (CEPF).
</P>
<P>
"Unreclaimed worn out batteries, which contain harmful metals,
are a serious source of pollution," Wang Qunsheng, a manager of a
local electric equipment company, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Yiling, an expert with the CEPF, said that discarded
batteries release mercury, cadmium and lead, which are extremely
harmful to the human body.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he said, these released metals will seep into the
earth and pollute the soil and groundwater.
</P>
<P>
"The best way to guard against this pollution is to collect
these batteries and to reclaim the noxious metals," Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
Batteries are widely used for walkmans, radios and other kinds
of miniature electronic devices to the tune of nearly 10,000 tons
a year in Beijing alone.

<HEADLINE> Haze Reaches Dangerous Level in Indonesia: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Haze raging through Sumatra and
Kalimantan islands in Indonesia has reached "dangerous levels",
Health Minister Sujudi said here last night.
</P>
<P>
"The haze can cause lung infection, particularly for children,"
the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Forest and land fires have sent haze (smoke, ash and dust) with
260 particles per cubic meter, on a scale where 100 was considered
tolerable, sources at the Health Ministry today quoted the
minister as saying.
</P>
<P>
"In some areas the level has reached 2,000. This is endangering
people's health," Sujudi said, without referring to a specific
region.
</P>
<P>
He said the government had already dropped 400,000 masks around
the country and was suggesting the use of wet towels and
handkerchiefs to purify the contaminated air.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of expatriates were reportedly being evacuated from
Sumatra Tuesday amid fears the haze blanketing the region could
damage their health.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the United Nations Tuesday described bush fires in
Indonesia as an environmental emergency which would affect
individual health and the well being of Asian economies for years
to come.
</P>
<P>
UN experts, gathering in Jakarta to coordinate international
efforts to douse the flames, delivered the grim message that even
if the fires were controlled soon, the pollution after-effects
could last for years.
</P>
<P>
"The long-term effects are in economic, health, social and
ecological areas," said Ravi Rajan, the chief representative of
the UN In Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
About 300,000 hectares of land and forest in Sumatra and
Kalimantan were estimated to have been scorched by fires in the
last three months.
</P>
<P>
As the haze was worsening, seven most affected provinces of
Riau, Jambi and South Sumatra and East Kalimantan, West
Kalimantan, Central Kalimantan and South Kalimantan were declared
on first alert status.

<HEADLINE> Southern Africa Urged to Prepare for El Nino </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Southern African countries
have been urged by the World Bank to enhance regional cooperation
to prepare for the early appearance of El Nino, which could cause
a long spell of devastating drought in the region.
</P>
<P>
Regional cooperation is needed although, with better
forecasting technology, the region is now better prepared for the
early approach of El Nino, bank officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"There are clearly benefits to integration in the region...
Africa is not even on the map for many investors as a trade area
and that is a concern," said Pamela Cox, World Bank Country
Director for South Africa, Botswana, Namibia, Lesotho and
Swaziland.
</P>
<P>
He said that there are many cross-border issues in the region
such as water management, transport infrastructure for landlocked
nations, improving communications systems and addressing health
issues such as malaria.
</P>
<P>
He said the World Bank has identified broad targets for future
assistance, including encouraging trade links, developing
transport corridors, making capital flow easier and solving water
supply problems.
</P>
<P>
The South African Weather Bureau said it is detecting early
signs of the appearance of El Nino.
</P>
<P>
"The fairly good rains we experienced a few weeks ago,
followed by these very high temperatures (in the past few days),
is an indication of the disturbance in the weather patterns,"
said Mike Edwards, the bureau's deputy director.
</P>
<P>
Normally El Nino does not start causing weather problems in
South Africa before December, but it is known that the El Nino
pattern started early this year.
</P>
<P>
As an indication of the approach of El Nino, a strong heat
wave swept the country in the past few days when summer has
barely begun.
</P>
<P>
At least 13 heat records for September were broken with
temperatures as high as 42.6 being recorded on Monday.
</P>
<P>
South Africa's hottest temperature in Kruger National Park in
Mpumalanga Province on Monday has been a record high in 35 years.
</P>
<P>
High temperatures were also recorded in the northern Cape and
Gauteng provinces.
</P>
<P>
"I would not say that this particular heat is an indication
that there is going to be a drought in South Africa... it is an
indication that there is already a disturbance in our weather
patterns," edwards said.
</P>
<P>
The Pretoria-based weather bureau predicted that hot to very
hot weather will continue in most of the country for the next two
weeks.
</P>
<P>
South Africa's National Maize Producers' Association, worried
about an early onset of an El Nino drought in southern Africa,
has warned its members to delay planting this year. Early El
Nino could be disastrous in the region, it said.
</P>
<P>
The El Nino weather phenomenon, caused by the warming of
Pacific waters off South America, is already being blamed for
economic turmoil in other parts of the world.
</P>
<P>
In southeast Asia, a dry spell has savaged maize crops in
Java, Indonesia, and it is feared that the El Nino effect could
rival that in 1982-83, which cost the world about 13 billion
U.S.Dollars.

<HEADLINE> SFOR Captures Transmitters in Bosnia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAASTRICHT, Netherlands, October 1 (Xinhua) -- NATO-led SFOR troops
today captured four radio and television transmission towers in Bosnia
at the request of the high representative of the international
community.
</P>
<P>
The news was announced by NATO Secretary General Javier Solana who
was attending the annual informal meeting of NATO defense ministers.
</P>
<P>
High Representative Carlos Westendorp requested SFOR military
action earlier today after he determined that the Srpska Radio and
Television (SRT) had violated the Udrigovo Agreement of September 2 by
their unacceptable treatment of a September 26 press conference by
Justice Arbour.
</P>
<P>
Some 400 SFOR troops took the four transmission towers without
incident, according to Solana, and they will be handed over to new
management, which the NATO chief defined as the parties supporting the
Republika Srpska president.
</P>
<P>
The aim of SFOR's action is to assist the international high
representative in ensuring that the media in the Republika Srpska
reflects international norms of professional media conduct and fully
supports the goals of the Dayton peace accord, Solana said.
</P>
<P>
The NATO chief described the SFOR action earlier today as a
demonstration of NATO's determination to back those who support
Dayton and to react swiftly and robustly against those who seek to
obstruct the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the Bosnian municipal elections held on September 13 and
14, the NATO-led SFOR troops had captured a couple of radio and
television transmission towers in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Local media loyal to Bosnian war-time leader Radovan Karadzic was
blamed by NATO and other international organizations as inciting
unrest against international presence.

<HEADLINE> Macao Residents More Enthusiastic About National Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Macao residents have become ever
more enthusiastic about China's National Day this year following
the success of Hong Kong's return.
</P>
<P>
As major buildings and streets are awash with colorful flags
and red lanterns, local residents are holding more gatherings,
receptions, tea parties, and singing and dancing parties to mark
China's National Day.
</P>
<P>
Editorials in local newspapers cited this year's national
day as a special one worth of big celebration.
</P>
<P>
As a well-known businessman Ma Man Kei, chairman of the
presidium of the Macao Compatriots Preparatory Committee for the
Celebration of the 48th Anniversary of the Founding of the
People's Republic of China, put it, Hong Kong's return and the
15th Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC) made this year
special.
</P>
<P>
"The successful return of Hong Kong has wiped out the
humiliation China suffered a century ago," he said in a speech at
a grand gathering today. "And the 15th Party Congress concluded
last month has laid an all-out plan for China's growth in the 21st
century."
</P>
<P>
More than 1,300 representatives from grassroots organizations,
leading social bodies as well as local residents, attended the
gathering, which staged singing and dancing performances as
celebration.
</P>
<P>
Similar gatherings, receptions, tea parties, dancing and
singing performances have increased notably this year as a way to
praise China, observers said.
</P>
<P>
Many residents said that they are happy because they have gained
confidence that under the policy of "one country, two systems",
Macao will also enjoy a better future as good as Hong Kong after
its return in a little more than two years time.
</P>
<P>
"China and Portugal have been cooperating well," said a leader
of the Macao Federation of Trade Unions. "Transitional affairs in
Macao are being resolved one by one and the process is being
quickened. We anticipated a smooth return in 1999 so long as
such trend continues."
</P>
<P>
Top Chinese officials stationed in Macao have said earlier
that the preparatory work for the return of Macao is "in full
swing and good order." The preparatory committee for the
establishment of the Macao Special Administrative Region is
expected to be set up early next year.

<P>
HONG KONG, October 1 (Xinhua) -- A latest poll conducted by
Hong Kong University showed that a record-high 85 percent of
people have confidence in Hong Kong's future, a local newspaper
reported today.
</P>
<P>
And 68 percent of the respondents are confident about the "one
country, two systems" concept, according to the Ming Pao Daily
News.
</P>
<P>

As to the concept of "one country, two systems," he said, Hong
Kong people have always been bullish over it, with optimism fueled
by repeated pledges by Chinese leaders.
</P>
<P>
According to another telephone poll by the paper, the
popularity of Tung Chee Hwa, chief executive of the government of
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR), has also
increased compared with two months ago.
</P>
<P>
Some 60 percent of the respondents agreed that Tung, who
assumed the post three months ago, has passed his "probation
period."

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Uganda's Budding Cocoa Industry Makes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
(by Cai Guozhong)
</P>
<P>
KAMPALA, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Uganda's cocoa industry has
made much headway in recent years with cocoa export is
expected to reach 2,500 tons in the 1997/98 season in
comparision with 2,200 tons in the 1995/96 season.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Agriculture predicted that Uganda's cocoa
exports will increase from 2,200 tons in 1995/96 season to 2,500
tons in 1997/98 season.
</P>
<P>
Foreign exchange the country will get from the expotation of
cocoa this year will increase to 3.75 million U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
Uganda's cocoa commercial export started in 1917, 16 years
later when cocoa was introduced into the country by Europeans and
Asians. However, the production of cocoa has been very low for
the past several decades.
</P>
<P>
According to the statistics from the Agricultural Ministry in
June 1994, cocoa plantation covers 10,843 hectares in Uganda's
nine districts.
</P>
<P>
The Ugandan government decided a few years ago to take steps
to develop the cocoa production. A cocoa development project was
worked out by the Ministry of Agriculture with an aim to reshape
the industry. The United States Agency For International
Development (USAID) under the Agri-Business Development Centre
(ADC) and the Investment Developing Export Agriculture (IDEA)
decided last year to fund the cocoa development project for the
next three years.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Agriculture worked to develop the cocoa
production by adaptive research, importation of improved cocoa
varieties and the provision of direct and indirect channels for
the transfer of expertise technology to the cocoa farmers.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the project also aims at training farmers in
cocoa growing areas, rehabilitation of the abandoned farms and
establishing cocoa nurseries countrywide.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with the project, 20 nurseries countrywide are
to be set up in the country to supply farmers with improved
seedlings which produce high yields.
</P>
<P>
In order to fight vermin which will destroy cocoa, a
consultant on vermin has been invited to study the insect's
movement and eating habits, so as to fight it effectively.

<HEADLINE> Soeharto: Legislative, Executive Bodies Are Equal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Soeharto
said today that the legislative and executive bodies of government
should have equal positions to enable the former to supervise the
implementation of the nation's development.
</P>
<P>
"To address the increasingly complex challenges in the future,
we must have legislative and executive institutions which function
to the optimum," he said after attending the swearing-in
ceremonies of the members of the People's Consultative Assembly at
the parliament building.
</P>
<P>
The assembly, which consists of all 500 members of the House of
Representatives and another 500 members chosen from various walks
of life, will serve for the 1997-2002 period.
</P>
<P>
The 1,000-member assembly will meet to elect the country's next
president and vice president in March next year.
</P>
<P>
The new house and assembly were the result of the 1997 general
election held on May 29, which was the sixth general election in
Indonesia under the aegis of the 1945 constitution.
</P>
<P>
The assembly is strongly dominated by the ruling party Golkar,
with 488 members, the powerful armed forces faction have 113
members, the United Development Party (PPP) 134, and the
Indonesian Democratic Party (PDI) 16.
</P>
<P>
To ensure that the national system will work properly, the
political, economic, socio-cultural and defense-security
infrastructures would work well too, the president said.
</P>
<P>
"Political parties, functional group, the social organizations,
the economic agencies, the artists and literati, even the
segments, groups and individual citizen must have an adequate room
for developing their creativity and initiative," he added.
</P>
<P>
Many politicians and analysts here predicted that the assembly
just sworn in this morning is likely to reelect the incumbent
76-year-old president for a seventh five-year term in March.
</P>
<P>
Tomorrow, the assembly will elect a new speaker for the
1997-2002 period.

<HEADLINE> UNITA Headquarters to Shift to Luanda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, October 1 (Xinhua) -- A high-level delegation of the
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) will
gather soon in Luanda to make arrangements for the shifting of
its headquarters to the capital, the Angola Catholic Radio
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Horacio Junjunvili, UNITA's deputy chief in the Joint
Commission of the Angolan Peace Process, made the statement
Tuesday during an interview with the radio.
</P>
<P>
He said, the delegation led by UNITA General Secretary Correin
Victor will come to Luanda in a few days. However, Junjunvili
did not reveal any more details.
</P>
<P>
UNITA is the biggest opposition party and the second biggest
party in Angola. Although 70 of its parliament members have been
admitted to the National Assembly and those who joined the
national unity government have sworn in, UNITA
hasn't set up formal or legal institutions in Luanda since 1992.
</P>
<P>
Ever since November, 1994 when Angola's warring parties signed
the Lusaka Peace Accord and formally announced the end of the
civil war, the central leadership agency of the former rebel
movement has been located in Bailundo city in Angola's central
province of Huambo, and Andulo city in Bie province.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan leaders have reiterated for many times that the
shifting of UNITA's headquarters to Luanda means the victorious
ending of all work regarding the peace process.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 1 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's Truth and
Reconciliation Commission (TRC), had subpoenaed former President
P. W. Botha and five members of his cabinet to appear at its
hearing on the State Security Council on October 14, TRC
Chairman Desmond Tutu said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Tutu said Botha's lawyers had informed the commission that for
health reasons Botha would not be able to attend the three-day
hearing.
</P>
<P>
The lawers also asked the TRC to withdraw the subpoenas, but
the latter indicated it would not withdraw the subpoena, and
requested a medical certificate and a full medical report about
Botha's health.
</P>
<P>
"We are exploring an alternative date for his (Botha's)
appearance," Tutu said.
</P>
<P>
Botha recently had hip replacement surgery. There were
apparently post-operative complications, Tutu said. But he did
not give further details.
</P>
<P>
Tutu said more than 20 former and current political and
military leaders from across the political spectrum had been
"invited or subpoenaed" to give evidence on the state Security
Council and on the roles played by armed forces during the
apartheid era.
</P>
<P>
Those subpoenaed for the hearing included former Defense
Minister Magnus Malan, former Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok
and former Secretary of the State Security Council Pierre van der
Westhuizen.
</P>
<P>
Former Foreign Minister Pik Botha had accepted invitation to
the hearing.
</P>
<P>
Three generals and one admiral of the former South African
armed forces had been subpoenaed to appear at the TRC's special
hearing on the role of the armed forces during the apartheid
years. The hearings will take place in Cape Town next week.
</P>
<P>
In addition, former African National Congress's military
leader and now Defense Minister Joe Modise, his deputy Ronnie

<HEADLINE> Kia Creditors Press for Kia's Bankruptcy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Creditors of South Korea's ailing
Kia group are pushing for a court receivership order for Kia,
which would declare the automotive group bankrupt and enable its
hand-over to a third party.
</P>
<P>
But the courts order to freeze debt obligations and assets of
Kia Information System on Tuesday, and the earlier orders to
freeze assets of nine Kia subsidiaries, have dampened creditors'
hope to call in debts immediately.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting of 55 of Kia's creditors on Monday, the creditors
renewed their call for Kia Motors Corp., the flagship company of
the nation's eighth largest group, to file for court receivership
instead of court protection.
</P>
<P>
They said that court protection does not help at all for Kia's
normalization, as creditors could not provide additional funds to
Kia under the system.
</P>
<P>
The call came as workers of the Kia Motors Corp. started a
two-day strike Monday morning to protested creditors' pressure for
Kia's insolvency, demanding a court protection in order to allow
more time to save the debt-laden conglomerate.
</P>
<P>
Fourteen of Kia's 15 affiliates had sought special court
protection against debt default by creditors or court receivership
last week. The spokesman of Kia said that the group was trying to
secure more time to get rid of the crisis of collapse under its
incumbent management system.
</P>
<P>
Court protection differs from court receivership in that it
allows the current management to keep managerial rights while
trying to save the group through self-rescue efforts and debt
rescheduling.
</P>
<P>
Kia ran into trouble after piling up debts totalling 9.5
trillion won (10.4 billion U.S. dollars) by the end of May. It was
placed under protection by its creditor banks on July 15 after
they determined that Kia would default on debt repayment.
</P>
<P>
Kia's trouble battered the Seoul stock market, pulling down the
broad-based composite stock price index by as much as 129.98
points or 17.2 percent over the past two and a half months.

<HEADLINE> S.Korean Businesses Welcome Amnesty Tycoons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Major South Korean conglomerates and
their organizations welcomed the government's Tuesday decision to
amnesty 23 business tycoons sentenced for bribing former President Roh
Tae-woo.
</P>
<P>
"The special amnesty will clear smears on the image of the major
business leaders in the scandal," the Federation of Korean Industries
(FKI), a powerful lobbying group for giant conglomerates, said in a
statement Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The amnesty will also help reinvigorate the dampened morale of the
business circle, the federation added.
</P>
<P>
South Korean government Tuesday decided to grant special
pardons to the tycoons who were convicted of bribing, embezzling as
well as tax evading.
</P>
<P>
The government's decision was interpreted as a way to help revive
the nation's sagging economy by lifting the burden from the
businessmen, allowing them to concentrate on business activities.
</P>
<P>
After the exposure of the scandal related to the former president
Roh, the involved tycoons and their companies have been arguing that
not the companies but the circumstance under which they were
"compelled" to give money to the President and government officials
should be blamed.
</P>
<P>
Major conglomerates, involved in the scandal, which led to the
sentencing of Lee Kun-hee of the Samsung Group, Kim Woo-choong of the
Daewoo Group and other business magnates, have experienced
difficulties in their overseas operations, it said.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that the decision will contribute to the reviving of the
sagging domestic economy," it said.

<HEADLINE> US Military Base in Turkey Closed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, October 1 (Xinhua) -- A U.S.-Turkish military base
which was built in southeastern Turkey to monitor the former
Soviet Union and the Middle East countries 41 years ago was closed
Tuesday, local Daily News reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Pirinclik Base in Turkish province of Diyarbakir has served
out its Cold War mission, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the U.S. personnel working in the base had returned
home and all the facilities had been dismantled and sent back to
the United States.
</P>
<P>
Some 280 Turkish staff employed by the base have also been
disbanded.
</P>
<P>
The Seventh Turkish Army Corps will use the Pirinclik as
one of its military bases, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Security Forces on High Alert Over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Israeli security forces
remain on a high state of alert for possible terror attacks by
Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) over the Jewish holiday
season, Israel radio reported today.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of police and soldiers have been deployed in the
public places across the country, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Israeli security officials as saying that
despite the recent crackdown of terrorists by the Palestinian
National Authority (PA), in which more than 200 Hamas activists
were arrested, there are still terror cells operating in the West
Bank, which may plan further bombing attacks against Israel.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Chief of General Staff Ammon Lipkin Shahak said
Tuesday that since the terror cell that carried out the Jerusalem
bombings was uncovered, the PNA has been making an extra effort to
fight terror, but this does not mean they are dismantling the
terror infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
"We have heard the declaration. It has to be translated into
action that can be seen, not just in detaining (terrorists) but
everything that follows that detention," he said, citing the
judicial procedures and how long and under what conditions the
terrorists would be held in Palestinian prisons.
</P>
<P>
Shahak also noted that both the PNA and Hamas face a dilemma
following the exposure of the terror cell. Hamas is considering
whether or not to carry on with the terror attacks, while PA has
to decide whether or not to take action against Hamas, he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a senior Israeli army official said Tuesday that
Israel has given the PNA a short list of terrorists considered to
be extremely dangerous, including Adel Awadallah who is believed
to have planned the two recent suicide bombings at Jerusalem's
Mahaneh Yehuda market and Ben Yehuda mall, which killed 25 people
and wounded hundreds.
</P>
<P>
Shahak stressed that Awadallah is still roaming the
countryside between Israeli and Palestinian controlled territory,
saying that "he is moving about, most of the time he is in area A
(under Palestinian control), but he is also in areas where we are
in control."
</P>
<P>
Rosh Hashana (Jewish New Year) will begin tonight and the
whole holiday season in Israel will last through the month.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: "Marcos Gold" Arouses Controversy in Manila </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
has branded as complete falsehood the allegation that proceeds
from the alleged sale of Marcos gold have been deposited in secret
Swiss bank accounts belonging to him.
</P>
<P>
"Well, I consider that a conspiracy of falsehood and
fabrications and that is what these news sources, whoever they
are, have been saying these past few days," Ramos told reporters
here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Without naming the sources of the allegation, the president was
clearly referring to a story by American lawyer Rober Swift, who
represents the "human rights victims" (HRV) under Marcos' rule.
</P>
<P>
Addressing Manila-based reporters at a tele-conference in Los
Angeles Tuesday, Swift dragged the name of President Ramos into
the resuscitated controversy over the Marcos wealth stashed in
Swiss banks, the alleged discovery of 1,241 tons of Marcos gold
and the reported sale of several tons of it recently.
</P>
<P>
Swift claimed that President Ramos is maintaining an account in
the Swiss Bank Julius Baer &AMP; Co. ltd, where part of the Marcos
assets, mostly in gold amounting to 13 billion U.S. dollars, were
reportedly kept in coded accounts which he and other HRV lawyers
uncovered recently.
</P>
<P>
Swift said that a memo by retired Swiss Judge Peter Ritter, who
is in charge of a trust for some of the late President Ferdinand
Marcos' wealth, "suggested that no other than the President of the
Philippines, Fidel Ramos, has an account at Bank Julius Baer in
Switzerland."
</P>
<P>
Swift's allegation drew strong reactions in the Philippine
Parliament, ranging from threats of impeachment of President Ramos
to calls for his resignation.
</P>
<P>
Senator Miriam Santiago Tuesday urged President Ramos to resign
after his name was dragged into the fray. She said that other
administration officials involved in hiding the Marcos wealth
should be investigated for plundering what belongs to the Filipino
people.
</P>
<P>
Reacting to Swift's allegations and parliamentarians' pressure,
Ramos denied he has a bank deposit in Switzerland. He admitted
that he had a U.S. dollar account "many years ago which I closed
even before I became president on June 30, 1992."
</P>
<P>
Ramos said that efforts to link him to the Marcos wealth "might
be part of a conspiracy of some irresponsible and spurious or may
be criminally inclined people who are trying to bring upon the
Filipino audience such convoluted statements."
</P>
<P>
Imelda, widow of late president Marcos also denied that the
president, other government officials and her son Ferdinand Marcos
Jr. were involved in the alleged withdrawal of their assets from
Swiss banks.
</P>
<P>
In an attempt to check possible public anger caused by the
allegation, Philippine Central Bank Governor Gabriel Singson
issued a statement here Tuesday, saying recent reports that Marcos
was able to spirit away from the Philippines a gold hoard totaling
1,241 tons are incredible.
</P>
<P>
Marcos, who ruled the Philippines for 20 years, moved to
Hawaii, a U.S. state, after he was forced out of office in
February 1986 and died in 1989. He was accused of spiriting
billions of dollars, and hundreds of tons of gold from the state
coffer.
</P>
<P>
Singson said that the total gold production in the Philippines
over the 20 year period from 1977 (when gold refinery operation
started in the Philippines) to August 31, 1997 was estimated at
636 tons.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he said, of this total production, the central bank
was able to purchase only 286 tons with the balance of gold
production being directly exported by private gold producers.
</P>
<P>
By the annual averages, it would take the central bank "the
last 87 years just to amass the gold for the so-called Marcos
hoard," the governor said.
</P>
<P>
According to local press reports today, the Ramos
administration threatened to file a civil suit for damages against
American Lawyer Swift and retired Swiss Judge Ritter for their
allegations.
</P>
<P>
But analysts here warned said that as the alleged Marcos gold
hoard is a very complicated issue, it is hard to predict if it
would lead to a political crisis in the Philippines.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian Official Slams Israel's Settlement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amir
Moussa has said that Israel's settlement policy "humiliates" the
Palestinians and he has "no confidence" in Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu's handling of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
In an interview published on the Jerusalem Post daily today, he
criticized Netanyahu's announcement last week build another 300
Jewish housing units in Efrat near Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
He said this move is prohibited under international law, and
goes against not only the Oslo accords, but also the
U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
"So I believe that the position taken by the Israeli
government is totally illegal and false," he said.
</P>
<P>
Moussa sharply criticized some Jewish settlers' taking-over
last month of the houses in East Jerusalem's Ras Al-Amud, a
densely populated Arab area.
</P>
<P>
The mere presence of all those people in this neighborhood is a
violation of the letter and spirit of whatever agreement concluded
between Israel and the Palestinians, he said.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said that he does not believe that Netanyahu really
wants a "fair" solution with the Palestinians because every
couple of days he announces something in order to poison
the atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
To reopen the peace talks, he said, the major responsibility
lies on the shoulder of Netanyahu, not on Palestinian National
Authority President Yasser Arafat's.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Netanyahu's proposal to place the final-status
issues on the fast track negotiations with the PNA, Moussa said
Netanyahu even did not cooperate on the transitional issues such
as Israeli troops redeployment in West Bank and he could not
believe that Netanyahu would be ready to negotiate with the PNA on
such final-status issues as Jerusalem and Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
He urged the Israeli government to take actual actions towards
the reopening of the Middle East peace process, not only
making promises.
</P>
<P>
He said if the Israeli government does not change its
current hardline policy towards the peace talks, the failure
of the scheduled regional economic summit in Qatar this November
is assured.

<HEADLINE> Xinhua Hong Kong Branch Chief's Good Wishes to HK Residents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Jiang Enzhu, director of
Xinhua News Agency's Hong Kong Branch, expressed his best
wishes to Hong Kong residents on the occasion of the National
Day, in a written message circulated here this morning.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said in the message that not long ago, descendants of the
Chinese nation throughout the world celebrated the event of the
century -- the return of Hong Kong to its motherland.
</P>
<P>
"The smooth transition of Hong Kong, the smooth transfer of
power and the establishment of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR) of the People's Republic of China,
marks the beginning of a new era in Hong Kong's history," he said.
</P>
<P>
Now, he went on to say, "we are celebrating the jubilant
occasion of the 48th anniversary of the founding of the People's
Republic of China." This is of special significance for Hong Kong
residents, as this is the first time for them to celebrate the
National Day together with people in other parts of China after
Hong Kong's return, he said.
</P>
<P>
"I would like to take this opportunity to express my most
sincere festive greetings and send my best wishes" to all Hong
Kong residents, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's return has rendered closer the relationship between
Hong Kong and the inland areas of China, Jiang said, adding that
their mutual support and common progress will achieve greater
success.
</P>
<P>
China's vast inland areas serve as a huge market for Hong
Kong's economic development while the return of Hong Kong will
provide better opportunities for international investors to enter
the market of China's inland areas and for the integration of the
Chinese economy with that of the world, the message said.
</P>
<P>
The recent successful convocation of the annual meetings of the
World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in Hong Kong
has made a positive impact on consolidating and strengthening Hong
Kong's status as an international financial center, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
The fact that Premier Li Peng and Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji
attended the meetings fully demonstrated that the Chinese central
government supported and attached great importance to the
meetings, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Under the guidance of "one country, two systems," "Hong Kong
people governing Hong Kong" and high-degree autonomy, and with the
backing of the ever stronger motherland, Hong Kong compatriots
will, under the leadership of the SAR government headed by Tung
Chee Hwa, "act as their own masters and give full play to their
talents," Jiang concluded.

<HEADLINE> G15 Summit to Be Held in Malaysia Next Month </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, October 1 (Xinhua) -- The annual summit of the
Group of 15 developing countries or G15 will be held in Malaysia
on November 3-5.
</P>
<P>
Kenya will be admitted as the 16th member at the forthcoming
summit but the name of the grouping will remain unchanged,
Malaysian Foreign Ministry's Secretary-General Abdul Kadir Mohamad
told reporters here today.
</P>
<P>
The secretary-general said the summit had already achieved its
quorum with the confirmed attendance of eight heads of state or
government and a vice president whose names would be made known
later due to security considerations.
</P>
<P>
On the commitment of member countries in view of the difficulty
in getting a quorum for the past summits and proposals to space
out the summit instead of holding it annually, Abdul Kadir said
the G15 was still important as it was the only forum for
developing countries to come together for their mutual benefit
apart from undertaking joint development projects.
</P>
<P>
He said that as for the frequency of the summit, the leaders
would decide at the forthcoming summit here whether to maintain
the existing yearly format or otherwise and added that Malaysia
was flexible on the matter.
</P>
<P>
The summit would be preceded by a meeting of economic ministers
of the group for the first time, Abdul Kadir said.
</P>
<P>
The economic ministers meeting is set for October 31 and 13
economic ministers had confirmed their attendance but replies were
pending from Senegal, Venezuela and Kenya, he said.
</P>
<P>
On the agenda of the economic ministers meeting is a review of
the multilateral trading system that will include consultations on
possible inputs by G15 countries for the 1998 WTO conference, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Abdul Kadir said, "There will be an exchange of views on new
and emerging issues, and on the current WTO work in trade and
environment, investment, competition policy and government
procurement."
</P>
<P>
The meeting is also expected to look into the further reduction
of tariff and non-tariff barriers as the ministers discuss how to
spur intra-trade and investment and development cooperation, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The economic ministers will examine ways to revitalize existing
initiatives, namely the G15 Business and Investment Forum and
consider new ones such as G15 business leaders round-table
meetings.
</P>
<P>
The G15 spans three continents and the present members are
Algeria, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Egypt, India, Indonesia,
Jamaica, Malaysia, Mexico, Nigeria, Peru, Senegal, Venezuela and
Zimbabwe.

<HEADLINE> HK Newspapers Hail First National Day After Handover </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Major newspapers in Hong Kong
published commentaries today to mark the 48th anniversary of the
founding of the People's Republic of China, the first National Day
after Hong Kong's return to the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong people are happy and proud today because this is the
first time for them to celebrate the National Day as dignified
Chinese together with 1.2 billion compatriots across the country,
a commentary in the Hong Kong Commercial Daily said.
</P>
<P>
A commentary in Ta Kung Po said that in the past, the Hong Kong
 people could not publicly raise the national flag and celebrate
the National Day of their own country on their own land.
</P>
<P>
The return of Hong Kong to the motherland has restored the
obligations and rights of the Hong Kong people as members of the
People's Republic of China, the commentary added.
</P>
<P>
Today, a flag raising ceremony was held in Hong Kong, with Tung
Chee Hwa, chief executive of the HKSAR, attending.
</P>
<P>
The raised flag represents the coming of a new era and the
dignity, glory and feelings of the HKSAR government and the six
million Hong Kong people, Ta Kung Po said.
</P>
<P>
An editorial in Wen Wei Po noted that the smooth transition of
Hong Kong and the smooth operation of the HKSAR government have
reflected the strength of the motherland and the policies of the
central government.
</P>
<P>
On the occasion of the National Day, the Hong Kong people
cherish the prosperity of Hong Kong and wholeheartedly wish that
the overall strength of China will continue to grow, the editorial
said.
</P>
<P>
Other Hong Kong newspapers including Sing Tao Daily, Hong Kong
Daily News and Ming Pao Daily News also covered extensively the
activities marking the National Day.

<HEADLINE> Israel Releases Hamas Founder to Jordan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 1 (Xinhua) -- In an overnight secret
operation, Israel released Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, founder of the
militant Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas), from jail and flew
him to Jordan.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by Israeli Army said that the release of
Yassin, who was arrested in 1988 and jailed to life sentence in
1989 for ordering terror attacks against Israel, was part of
prisoner exchange for the two Canadian tourists, who were arrested
in Jordan for attacking Hamas leader Khaled Mashal.
</P>
<P>
Hamas claimed that the two tourists were agents sent by Israeli
secret intelligence service Mossad in an assassination attempt on
Mashal.
</P>
<P>
Yassin, in his 60's, is seriously ill, wheel chair-bound,
paralyzed in arms and legs, and suffering from breathing and
hearing problems. He was flown to Amman in a Jordanian medical
helicopter and is now hospitalized in the King Hussein Medical
Center.
</P>
<P>
The release of Yassin was cleared by Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu in response to a public call issued by
Jordanian King Hussein Tuesday for releasing Yassin in order to
help build the hope for peace, the army statement said.
</P>
<P>
The deteriorating health of Yassin was the major
consideration in Israeli government's decision to release him.
Israeli security officials have recommended Yassin's release for
fear that his death in Israeli prison would spark a new
round of retaliatory terror attacks by Hamas militants.
</P>
<P>
However, Hamas denounced the way that Yassin was released,
saying it is a plot by Israel to get rid of Yassin before his
death. Abdul Aziz Rantisi, Hamas leader in Gaza Strip, called the
release as "an expulsion of the sheikh from his country," and was
totally rejected by the Hamas.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian National Authority (PNA) also criticized Israel
for handling the Yassin's releasing. Abdul Rahman, PNA
Secretary-General, said that Yassin was not released but
deported. He stressed that Yassin should be allowed to return to
his family in Gaza.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli security forces are keeping high alert
today against possible more Hamas terror attacks, especially
during the upcoming New Year holiday season that begins today.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of security reinforcements have been deployed around
the major cities across the country to prevent terror attacks.
Police Inspector-General Asaf Hafetz has called on the public
to keep watchful eyes against suspicious subjects and incidents
and report to the police immediately.
</P>
<P>
Since the July 30 Mahane Yehuda twin suicide bombings and
September 4 Ben Yehuda suicide bombings, both claimed by
Hamas, which killed 25 people and wounded 300 others, Israeli
security forces have been warning about more Hamas attacks.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Keeps Food Reserves for Drought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's Grain Marketing Board
(GMB) has enough maize in stock to feed the nation for at least
four months in the event of a drought, the daily "The Herald"
quoted the Zimbabwean GMB Managing Director as reporting today.
</P>
<P>
The GMB also has enough cash on hand to import further stocks
to carry the country through to the 1999 harvest, the GMB
Managing Director said.
</P>
<P>
GMB Managing Director Martin Muchero, in an interview
yesterday, said there are sufficient maize stocks to meet the
strategic grain reserve requirements and to cushion the country
from the effects of a below normal rainfall season.
</P>
<P>
According to the report,a strongly developed El Nino greatly
increases the possibility of drought in southern Africa.
</P>
<P>
Muchero said that the GMB keeps, part of the strategic
reserves, about 500,000 tonnes, as grain to feed the country for
four months at least. The rest is kept as cash, he said, since
it costs large sums to store grain for long periods. This money
is intended to be used to import grain should the worst happen.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan Minister of Labour and
Social Service Paul Etiang has called on the countrymen to
prepare for severe food shortages, local daily The New Vision
reported today.
</P>
<P>
He made the call at a Parliamentary Committee meeting on
social affairs here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-one of the country's districts are affected chronically
by food shortages due to drought weather, he said.
</P>
<P>
Plants have withered in many districts and only 50 percent of
the harvest was realised last season.
</P>
<P>
However, the minister noted, his government will not declare a
national disaster because the situation had not reached such
levels as to demand international attention.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania, Uganda's neighbour in the same east African region,
has appealed to the international community for 92,000 tons of
food aid to offset the effects of drought in the country.

HARARE, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's Parliamentary Reform
Committee responsible for examining strategies to reform the
parliament has invited members of the public to submit their
contributions.
</P>
<P>
In an advertisement in a local daily today, the
parliamentary reform committee, which was formed last March,
invited oral and written submissions from individuals, interest
groups and the general public on any aspects of parliamentary
reforms.
</P>
<P>
Parliament has formulated a policy which seeks to transform
the house into a more efficient and people oriented parliament.
</P>
<P>
The committee said it would visit the country's eight
provinces to collect people's contributions and report back its
findings to the house.
</P>
<P>
Its terms of reference include reviewing the practice and
procedure of the house, legislative process, committee system,
civic participation in parliament business, conditions of and
support services for members and staff of the parliament as well
as dress code and decorum of parliament.
</P>
<P>
Reforms are being undertaken to strengthen the need for the

<P>
HARARE, October 1 (Xinhua) -- More than 95 percent of the
world's 20 million tuberculosis sufferers are found in the
developing countries, Zimbabwean Minsiter for Health and Child
Welfare Timothy Stamps said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the launching of a three-week national campaign to
curb the TB disease, Stamps said the disease largely affected,

<P>
He said that an estimated over 8.8 million new cases of TB

<HEADLINE> Afghan Uzbek Warlord Killed Mysteriously: Reports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Afghan ethnic Uzbek warlord
Abdul Malik has reportedly met with mysterious death on Tuesday in
Shabarghan, northwest Afghanistan, Afghan sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
Malik, who was holding talks with his former boss Rashid Dostum
to form a possible joint front against the Islamic Taliban
militia, was reportedly poisoned to death by his Dostum's
loyalists in Shabarghan, capital of Jowzjan province, the Afghan
sources said.
</P>
<P>
Maulawi Dilawar, Taliban's representative here, also said that
they have received the report of Malik's death from northern
Afghanistan, but were waiting for the confirmation.
</P>
<P>
Malik took the world by surprise when he revolted against
Dostum, once the strongest warlord in Afghanistan, in late May and
flushed him out from Mazar-e-Sharif, Dostum's headquarters and
around 300 km north of Kabul, with Taliban's support.
</P>
<P>
Again Malik made headlines on the media when he staged another
about-face and launched massive assaults on Taliban only a few
days after they entered Mazar-e-Sharif, forcing the student
militia to repulse from the northern Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Dostum, who has returned to Afghanistan after four months of
exile in Turkey, invited Malik to Shabarghan on September 29 to
discuss a joint front to stop Taliban's further advancement to the
Mazar-e-Sharif.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban, who control two thirds of the Afghan territory,
has been attacking Mazar-e-Sharif in the past two weeks and
claimed they had tightened their stranglehold of the city.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 1 (Xinhua) -- A Hong Kong-bound Philippine
Airlines jet flew back to Manila today after receiving a bomb
threat while it was airborne, the Philippine Air Transportation
Office said.
</P>
<P>
The office said that the PAL 747 TURBO jet 300 flew back to the
Ninoy Aquino International Airport in Manila a few minutes after
taking off when its pilot was informed by the Manila Control Tower
that a bomb was planted inside the plane.
</P>
<P>
It said 125 passengers and six crew members disembarked from
the plane as airport security men with bomb sniffing dogs scoured
the jet for the bomb.
</P>
<P>
The office quoted sources at the aviation security command as
saying that the threat, which turned out negative, could have been
made by a prankster.
</P>
<P>
Last month, over 40 bomb threats were reported in Manila, but
so far the police had failed to determine who were responsible for
the hoaxes.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan-UK Accord on Freezing Ill-gotten Assets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan is likely to sign an
agreement with Britain for the confiscation of assets of the
corrupt acquired through illegal means, local official sources
said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The agreement titled "Avoidance of Corruption Agreement" is
possible to be signed within days, said the sources.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the agreement was a bid to confiscate assets
of Pakistan's former prime minister Benazir Bhutto in the United
Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
However, said the sources, it remained a formidable task to
prove that the assets of Bhuttos in the UK were acquired through
illegal means.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that the Pakistani government was holding
negotiations with the British government for pursuing the attempt
to freeze the accounts of Benazir and her husband Asif Ali
Zardari.
</P>
<P>
About the response of the British government regarding seizure
of the accounts of Benazir and Zardari as demanded by the
Pakistani government, the sources said that "we are optimistic
about the seizure as the response from the other side is very
positive."
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani government has already frozen accounts of Bhuttos
in Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the agreement will also cover confiscation of assets
of corrupt UK citizens who may flee to Pakistan, the sources said.

<HEADLINE> F-16 Issue Tops Pak-U.S. Defense Talks Agenda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 1 (Xinhua) -- The issue of the F-16s, whose
delivery to Pakistan has been withheld by the United States, will
be on top of the agenda when Pakistan and U.S. defense officials
start their three-day consultations on October 15, a senior
official said.
</P>
<P>
"From our point of view, the matter of F-16s is the key issue
as the United States should either release the aircraft or return
the money," the official said.
</P>
<P>
The third meeting of the Pak-U.S. Defense Consultative Group
will take place from October 15 in Washington, the U.S. capital.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Pakistan Defense Secretary Iftikhar Ali
Khan will lead a seven-member delegation comprising officials of
the Ministry of Defense and representatives of the three services,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan has been persuading the United States to settle the
issue either by releasing the aircraft or returning the money it
paid.
</P>
<P>
In his first meeting with U.S. President Bill Clinton in New
York late September, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif also asked
Clinton to resolve the issue.
</P>
<P>
Out of a total of 658 million U.S. dollars which Pakistan has
paid for the F-16s, the U.S. government has so far returned around
128 million dollars while the remaining amount is yet to be
returned.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan officials have also indicated that they are still
considering the option of taking the U.S. government to the court
for the release of the aircraft.

MANILA, October 1 (Xinhua) -- A Hong Kong-bound Philippine
Airlines jet flew back to Manila today after receiving a bomb
threat while it was airborne, the Philippine Air Transportation
Office said.
</P>
<P>
The office said that the PAL 747 TURBO jet 300 flew back to the
Ninoy Aquino International Airport in Manila a few minutes after
taking off when its pilot was informed by the Manila Control Tower
that a bomb was planted inside the plane.
</P>
<P>
It said 443 passengers and crew members disembarked from the
plane as airport security men with bomb sniffing dogs scoured the
jet for the bomb.
</P>
<P>
The office quoted sources at the aviation security command as
saying that the threat, which turned out negative, could have been
made by a prankster.
</P>
<P>
Last month, over 40 bomb threats were reported in Manila, but
so far the police had failed to determine who were responsible for
the hoaxes.

TOKYO, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Public approval rating for
Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto's cabinet plunged 12
percentage points to 44.1 percent, the lowest since his first
cabinet was formed in January 1996, a survey released by a leading
Japanese newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The previous low was in February and April, when the government
approval rating stood at 44.2 percent, the newspaper Yomiuri
Shimbun said.
</P>
<P>
Three thousand eligible voters were polled in the weekend
survey, of which 1,975, or 65.8 percent, reponded.
</P>
<P>
The disapproval rating was a record for Hashimoto's cabinet,
rising to 43.3 percent, up 12.7 percentage points from the last
survey.
</P>
<P>
Analysts attributed the high disapproval rating to Hashimoto's
appointment of convicted criminal Koko Sato to a cabinet post.
</P>
<P>
Sato, convicted of taking bribes in the Lockheed scandal in the
1970s, resigned as chief of the Management and Coordination Agency
just 12 days after his appointment in a cabinet reshuffle.

DHAKA, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh has completed the
evaluation of the bids for its 12 oil and gas exploration blocks
and prospective bidders are to be invited for final negotiations
for awarding the Production Sharing Contract within a few weeks.
</P>
<P>
A source from the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources said
 an evaluation committee of Petro-Bangla, the state oil and gas
company, has just completed the technical evaluation of the bid
offers which are now awaiting the final scrutiny at the highest
level of the government.
</P>
<P>
The sources, however, indicated that though the technical
evaluation of the bid documents had been completed, the names of
the successful bidders might not be announced before the final
round of negotiations is over.
</P>
<P>
The final negotiating round, the sources explained, would deal
with such things like further clarification of bid documents of
the respective companies that emerged to be promising as well as
the nitty-gritty of such intricate things like the rates of cost
recovery and profit splitting.
</P>
<P>
Some 21 companies, including a number of major oil companies,
submitted a total of 36 bid offers -- both individually and in
joint ventures -- for 12 out of 15 open blocks that had been put
up for the second round bidding which closed in mid-July 1997.

<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, September 30 (Xinhua) -- The International Atomic
Energy Agency (IAEA) should pay due attention to the just demand
of the developing countries for peaceful nuclear utilization, a
Chinese official said today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the IAEA annual conference, Chinese representative
Jiang Xinxiong said that in preventing nuclear proliferation, the
world body should not neglect the just demand of its members,
particularly the developing countries, to use nuclear energy for
peaceful purposes.
</P>
<P>
More importantly, he said, the IAEA should not restrict or
jeopardize the peaceful utilization of nuclear technology and the
development of nuclear energy industry in the developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, director of China's State Atomic Energy Agency, noted
that keeping a proper balance between IAEA's two major tasks of
tightening inspections and promoting peaceful utilization is not
only a correct direction for the agency's future work but also a
foundation for its existence and growth.
</P>
<P>
Founded 40 years ago, the IAEA now has 127 member states and
has become most instrumental in promoting the peaceful use of
nuclear energy.

<P>
SANTIAGO, September 30 (Xinhua) -- As economists from the
countries and regions on the Pacific rim began a three-day meeting
here today, a Chinese expert called for closer economic
cooperation in the Asian-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
The fast economic growth in the Asian-Pacific region has
created necessary conditions for promoting regional cooperation,
said Yang Chengxu, president of China's Committee for the Pacific
Economic Cooperation Council (PECC), in his address to the PECC
meeting.
</P>
<P>
Asia-Pacific is a region with political stability, steady
economic growth and diverse exchanges and cooperation, said Yang,
who was also former president of the PECC, a 22-member
semi-governmental grouping established in 1980.
</P>
<P>
He noted that promoting trade and investment liberalization
requires all PECC members to learn from one another.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that countries in this region, which are at
different stages of development, should define their own
priorities and set their own agendas for the liberalization of
trade and investment.
</P>
<P>
He said that PECC members account for 70 percent of China's
foreign trade and 80 percent of China's foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
He pledged that China will continue to work for the common
development of the Asian-Pacific region and the whole world.
</P>
<P>
About 800 officials, businessmen and researchers from the 22
member countries and three observer countries -- Brazil, Argentina
and Uruguay -- are attending the meeting.

Addressing the opening ceremony of the Pacific Economic
Cooperation Council (PECC) conference, he condemned protectionism
as one of the most dangerous threats to Latin America's economic
development.

is the first meeting of its kind held in a Latin American
country," Frei said.
</P>
<P>
The president said that Chile has maintained close economic and
trade ties with other Asian-Pacific countries, with 65.5 percent
of the country's foreign investment coming from them in 1974-1996.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that Chile has favorable geographic and economic
conditions to help build close contacts between Latin American and
Asian-Pacific countries.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that the developed countries should fully liberalize
trade and investment by the year 2010 and the developing countries
by the year 2020 as proposed at the 1994 Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) forum meeting.
</P>
<P>
He said that Chile, though a developing country, will complete
its liberalization process by the year 2010.

WUHAN, October 1 (Xinhua) -- This capital of the Hubei
Province, in central China, has set today as the deadline for
complete prohibition of the use of leaded gasoline, as a way to
curb increasing automobile gas pollution, today's China Daily
reported.
</P>
<P>
High-quality fuels -- non-leaded gas, natural gas and petroleum
gas will soon be used throughout the city, with which automobiles
will reduce 80 percent of their former exhausts.
</P>

</P>
<P>
About 40,000 automobiles that are providing much more pollution
than the average will be replaced during the 1996-2000 period.
</P>
<P>
These measures will help clear the city's air, of which
NOX(nitrogen Oxide) density has been increasing rapidly over the
past few years, a spokesman for local environmental protection
bureau said.
</P>
<P>
Wuhan has more than 200,000 automobiles running in the city
proper each day, and about 20,000 new cars moves onto the roads
every year.
</P>
<P>
Due to worsening air pollution, residents living in the city's
central districts were found to suffer more often from respiratory
tract illness, heart, cerebral vessel and skin diseases, according
to the paper.

recovered in August from July but were still fewer than in the
same month of last year, according to a report by the Hong Kong
Tourist Association (HKTA) available here today.
</P>
<P>
The August figure reached 819,147 as against 658,239 in July,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
"This is evidence that we are on the road to recovery," it
quoted HKTA Executive Director Amy Chan as saying.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, 11.7 million people visited Hong Kong and 1,083,183 of
 them came in August.
</P>
<P>
Rises in August this year were recorded in visitor arrivals
from Canada (up 8.2 percent), Central and South America (up 12.7
percent) and South Africa (up 9.9 percent), the report said.
</P>
<P>
It attributed the decline of visitor arrivals from Japan mainly
 to a sluggish Japanese economy affecting all out-bound travel,
noting that "research indicates the main reasons are the increased
 costs of traveling to Hong Kong due to the weakened yen."
</P>
<P>
"We hope the international coverage given to Hong Kong during
the IMF/World Bank meetings will overcome any lingering
wait-and-see attitude in our major markets. Our message to the
world is 'Come and see the new Hong Kong'," Chan said.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian Ringgit Opens at Historical Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's currency, the
ringgit, today opened at a historical low of 3.2820/70 against the
U.S. dollar since the local unit was floated in 1973.
</P>
<P>
The ringgit, which hit new lows during the past three days,
closed at 3.2405/55 yesterday against the greenback.
</P>
<P>
The new lows were due to nervousness over the market's
direction following the downtrend in regional currencies, a dealer
said.
</P>
<P>
Most players, especially locals in the commercial sector, are
holding short positions on dollars due to its appreciation, he
added.
</P>
<P>
They are anticipating for some good news in the upcoming
budget, which is scheduled to be announced on October 17, he said.
</P>
<P>
The ringgit is expected to trade within a range of 3.27 to 3.30
against the greenback today, the dealer added.
</P>
<P>
The local unit was also lower today against the Singapore
dollar, at 2.1247/93 from yesterday's 2.1152/99, against the
Japanese yen (100) at 2.7042/94 from 2.6715/67, against the
Deutsche mark at 1.8556/95 from 1.8300/33 as well as against pound
sterling at 5.2947/44 from 5.2279/92.

<HEADLINE> Italian GDP Grows 1.6 Percent in 2nd Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Italy's gross domestic product
(GDP) grew 1.6 percent in the second quarter of this year from
that of the first quarter, a rate higher than expected.
</P>
<P>
Compared with the second quarter of 1996, the GDP in the
April-June period this year went up 1.9 percent, the Italian
statistics agency Istat reported today.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Istat had forecast the GDP would gain 1.5 percent
between the two quarters and 1.7 percent for the entire year.
</P>
<P>
In the period, Germany, France and Britain achieved a 1 percent
GDP growth, the United States 0.9 percent while Japan saw a drop
of 2.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
The upturn in Italy was fuelled by a surge in imports of goods
and services which rose 11.7 percent, and a solid increase in
consumer demand which went up 0.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Exports continued to boom, rising 8.8 percent in the second
quarter.
</P>
<P>
Despite a high rise in imports, Italy still gained a trade
surplus of 10.5 trillion lire (6 billion U.S. dollars) in the
quarter.
</P>
<P>
Industrial output registered a 5.1 percent growth and service
sector grew 0.7 percent while agriculture felled 4.9 percent in
the period.
</P>
<P>
Investments, however, were still struggling to take off,
showing no change over the first quarter, Istat said.
</P>
<P>
It said that it is still too early to say if the growth target
of 1.2 percent the government set for the year can be reached
although today's figures give more grounds for optimism.

<HEADLINE> Dini, Gjinushi Discuss Albania's Economic Recovery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Italian Foreign Affairs Minister
Lamberto and Albania's parliament speaker Skender Gjinushi today
discussed how to support economic recovery in Albania.
</P>
<P>
In their talks, they laid out priorities for the international
conference to be held here on October 17, which will lay the
groundwork for helping Albania recover economically from four
months of armed unrest earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
Dini and Gjinushi agreed that the ministerial conference will
assess initiatives taken by international organizations, start an
international aid program and coordinate bilateral programs for
economic and technical assistance.
</P>
<P>
A week after the Rome conference, donor nations will hold a a
meeting in Brussels to draw up a strategy for aiding economic and
financial reconstruction in the Balkan country.
</P>
<P>
The International Monetary Fund and Albanian leaders have been
discussing what form the international aid program will take.
</P>
<P>
At today's talks, Dini reiterated a call on Albania to continue
on the road to normalization which began with the June 29
elections and return to open political dialogue involving all the
parties elected democratically, an Italian Foreign Ministry
statement said.
</P>
<P>
The Albanian crisis began in mid-January when the collapse of
pyramid investment schemes cost many Albanians their lifelong
savings and led to mass protests.
</P>
<P>
The situation went out of control after armed rebels ransacked
military arsenals and took control of cities throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
Peace was finally restored after the Italian-led multinational
peacekeeping force were sent in and elections were held under
international supervision.

<HEADLINE> WB, IMF Hail Sri Lanka's Economic Buoyancy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, October 1 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank and the
International Monetary Fund have hailed Sri Lanka's economic
buoyancy, saying the nation's economic recovery and growth in 1997
were very promising and commendable.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Justice and Deputy Minister of Finance G. L. Peiris
told the Sri Lanka-Korea Economic Committee meeting here on
Tuesday that his country's economic performance has caught the
attention of the two leading money-lending institutions.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that Sri Lanka's budget deficit this year
will be maintained at the targeted figure of 7 percent of the
gross domestic product (GDP). In 1996, the GDP was 696 billion
rupees (12.9 billion U.S. dollars) and the budget deficit, 7.8
percent of the GDP.
</P>
<P>
President Chandrika Kumaratunga, in a message sent to the
meeting, said the government has put in place a suitable policy
framework and the necessary institutional support for the private
sector to play a more dynamic role in the country's development.
</P>
<P>
Toward this end, cooperation between Sri Lanka's business
sectors and those of developed countries is essential and of vital
interest, she said .
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka's economic growth for the whole year of 1997 is
projected at 6 percent, based on the performance of the economy in
the first half year, and the rate would be the highest in the past
10 years.
</P>
<P>
Local economists say the country could have developed faster if
the ethnic war in Northern and Eastern provinces had not hindered
the development of the Indian Ocean island nation.
</P>
<P>
The minority Tamil rebels have been fighting a 14-year
guerrilla war in the region for a separate state of their own. The
war has claimed more than 50,000 lives and cost both sides a
substantial amount of money.

<HEADLINE> China Tightens Control over Imports of Wastes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 1 (Xinhua) -- China has successfully stopped
the once increasing imports of harmful wastes, thanks to the
efforts made by the State Administration of Inspection of Import
and Export Commodities.
</P>
<P>
The administration has adopted strict rules for the inspection
of imported wastes, and ordered traders to have their imports
inspected before shipment and at the first arrival port.
</P>
<P>
These efforts have taken effects, today's China Daily quoted
sources with the administration as saying.
</P>
<P>
During the first seven months of this year, the administration
inspected a total of 3.6 million ton imported wastes, of which
nearly 99 percent were proved unharmful, China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
The quality of the imported wastes has also improved, the
sources said, adding that some Chinese paper manufacturers said
that the imported used paper with a better quality is easier to
recycle.
</P>
<P>
Traders tried in vain to import harmful waste through entry
points in Tianjin, Inner Mongolia and Xinjiang, according to
sources.
</P>
<P>
After the administration's Tianjin branch discovered imports of
more than 70 tons of waste steel with a high degree of radiation,
for example, US exporters had to intercept the shipment of another
2,000 tons of similar, China-bound waste.
</P>
<P>
The administration has also stepped up tempo of drawing up
inspection criteria and related regulations, to decide what is
harmful waste, thus avoiding imports of harmful wastes that will
cause negative environmental impacts, the officials said.

SANTIAGO, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Officials from the countries
on the Pacific rim began a three-day meeting here today to discuss
trade liberalization among them.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening session of the Pacific Economic
Cooperation Council (PECC) -- a 22-member semi-governmental
grouping established in 1980, Chilean Foreign Minister Jose Miguel
Insulza urged the Asian-Pacific countries to commit themselves to
the free flow of goods and services.
</P>
<P>
He said that the prospects for the region's trade growth are
encouraging and the exports of PECC member countries as a whole
are expected to grow eight percent in the next two years.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the member countries are making progress in
implementing the three basic components of Asia-Pacific
cooperation: liberalizing trade and investment, fostering trade
and investment and enhancing economic and technical cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The Asia-Pacific region is by far the most economically dynamic
region in the world and plays a leading role in the process of
world trade liberalization, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The success of the emerging Asian economies has shown that it
is possible to get out of underdevelopment in two or three
generations," he added.

<HEADLINE> Fixed Assets Investment Rises in Shanghai's Pudong New Area </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Fixed assets investment in the
Pudong New Area of Shanghai in the January-August period rose
nearly 46 percent over the same eight-month period last year, to
nearly 21 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
This is partly the result of construction work at some large
local projects like Pudong International Airport, a Sino-American
joint venture, and an integrated circuit plant funded by the
Ministry of Electronics Industry.
</P>
<P>
Average investment for each of the projects this year went up
to 244 million yuan, a big leap from 174 million yuan in 1996.
</P>
<P>
By the end of August the area had a total of 109 projects in
operation, 30 of which were added during the preceding
twelve-month period.
</P>
<P>
Increased spending on infrastructure and the industrial sector
was another reason for increasing investment in fixed
assets. Urban infrastructure cost more than 7.2 billion yuan
during the eight-month period, 2.4 times the 1996 figure.
</P>
<P>
More than 28 percent of investment in the area, 5.9 billion
yuan, was used for industrial projects, and the area put more than
3.9 billion yuan into technological improvements, a 77 percent
rise from the same period in 1996.

<HEADLINE> 48 Foreign Banks Allowed to Open Offices in Myanmar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, October 1 (Xinhua) -- A total of 48 foreign banks have
been permitted to open representative offices in Myanmar since the
country reformed its financial management system in line with the
market-oriented economy introduced in the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Of the total, 44 already have put their offices into operation,
Myanmar Minister for Finance and Revenue Win Tin was quoted by the
official paper The New Light of Myanmar as saying today.
</P>
<P>
The 48 banks are from 16 countries and regions, mostly from
Japan, Thailand, France, Singapore, Malaysia and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
The latest foreign bank representative office, which was opened
here Tuesday, is the Korea Long Term Credit Bank of South Korea,
the fourth South Korean bank with an office in Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
While permitting foreign banks to open representative offices
in the country, Myanmar also allows the local private sector to
engage in banking business.
</P>
<P>
There are now 25 private banks in Myanmar, of which seven are
reportedly allowed to handle foreign exchange transactions.
</P>
<P>
Some of the foreign banks also plan to set up joint-venture
banks in Myanmar after it has entered the second phase of its
financial reform.

<HEADLINE> Italian GDP Grows 1.6 Percent in 2nd Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Italy's gross domestic product
(GDP) grew 1.6 percent in the second quarter of this year from
that of the first quarter, a rate higher than expected.
</P>
<P>
Compared with the second quarter of 1996, the GDP in the
April-June period this year went up 1.9 percent, the Italian
statistics agency Istat reported today.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Istat had forecast the GDP would gain 1.5 percent
between the two quarters and 1.7 percent for the entire year.
</P>
<P>
In the period, Germany, France and Britain achieved a 1 percent
GDP growth, the United States 0.9 percent while Japan saw a drop
of 2.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
The upturn in Italy was fuelled by a surge in imports of goods
and services which rose 11.7 percent, and a solid increase in
consumer demand which went up 0.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Exports continued to boom, rising 8.8 percent in the second
quarter.
</P>
<P>
Despite a high rise in imports, Italy still gained a trade
surplus of 10.5 trillion lire (6 million U.S. dollars) in the
quarter.
</P>
<P>
Industrial output registered a 5.1 percent growth and service
sector grew 0.7 percent while agriculture felled 4.9 percent in
the period.
</P>
<P>
Investments, however, were still struggling to take off,
showing no change over the first quarter, Istat said.
</P>
<P>
It said that it is still too early to say if the growth target
of 1.2 percent the government set for the year can be reached
although today's figures give more grounds for optimism.

<HEADLINE> Fujian Province Carries Out Archeological Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, October 1 (Xinhua) -- East China's Fujian Province has
made considerable effort to carry out a variety of key
archeological projects in recent years.
</P>
<P>
A local cultural official said that local archaeologists have
discovered a number of historic artifacts made of pottery, bone,
stone, and shell in over 30 tombs from the Minhou-Tanshi Cultural
Relic Zone dating back to before the Qing Dynasty (221-207 B.C.).
</P>
<P>
The experts have unearthed over 20,000-sq m of historic ruins
from a township in the Han Dynasty (206 B.C-220), the official
said. The 4,000 pieces of building materials, pottery objects, and
iron and bronze weapons discovered in the ruins prove ancient
Chinese people had mastered high-level industrial techniques in
the smelting and pottery-making process.
</P>
<P>
The archeologists also found many historic relics from ruins of
Xindian Town in Fuzhou, capital city of Fujian. They showed a
close relationship between the local ethnic groups in Fujian and
the central part of China, he said.
</P>
<P>
Experts in the province have found a 235.6 m-long pottery-kiln
in Jianyang, the longest ever discovered in China. Fujian has also
launched a Sino-Australian submarine-archeology project which
located more than 1,000 pieces of pottery for daily-use from an
ancient boat which sank in waters along the coast of
Fujian.

<HEADLINE> Colon Free Zone Seen as Cornerstone For Panama's Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Economic activities in
Panama's Colon free trade zone account for 32 percent of the
country's gross domestic product (GDP), said a Panamanian
economist today.
</P>
<P>
Juan Jovane, director of the Center for National Studies,
underlined the importance of the international trade complex in a
report titled "Global Challenges and Opportunities for Colon Free
Trade Zone."
</P>
<P>
The zone, located on the Atlantic coast 80 kilometers from the
capital, is three times as important as all the U.S. military
bases in the country and the Panama Canal, said the report. The
canal's GDP contribution is 6.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Jovane said the area also contributes to the easing of
unemployment and poverty in Colon province, where 60 percent of
the population are living in poverty.
</P>
<P>
During the first eight months of the year, the zone imported
3.45 billion U.S. dollars worth of products and exported 3.92
million dollars of goods, respectively up 15 percent and 11
percent from the levels of the corresponding period last year.
</P>
<P>
The Colon free trade zone is considered the largest one in
Latin America.

<HEADLINE> Grape Wine Imports Surging in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Grape wine is becoming the
favorite alcoholic drink in China, as statistics show a sharp rise
of imports.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from Beijing Customs show that in the first eight
months of the year, the nation's capital imported 5.43 million
liters of alcoholic drinks, exceeding the totals of imports in
1995 and 1996 combined.
</P>
<P>
Of the total, imports of grape wine accounted for 4.41 million
liters, with a value of 3.27 million U.S. dollars, replacing
whiskey to become the No. 1 beverage on China's list of imported
alcoholic drinks, according to the figures.
</P>
<P>
The sharp rise of the import of grape wine, 89 percent of which
was conducted in general trade, is accompanied by an overall drop
in imported alcoholic drinks, according to local information.
</P>
<P>
Observers believe that the marked rise of imported grape wine
is the result of increased processing demand of wineries,
influence of relevant state policies and international market
factors.
</P>
<P>
The Great Wall Winery Co.Ltd, a leading maker of grape wine,
imported 4.21 million liters of the beverage in the first eight
months of the year.

<P>
ROME, September 30 (Xinhua) -- The first U.N. conference on the
Convention to Combat Desertification (CCD) opened here this
morning with a call for continuos monitoring and improvement of
world weather and climate.
</P>
<P>
"Without continuos monitoring and improvement of weather and
climate, the world community will not be able to react promptly
and effectively to help the population of the drylands, "
said G. Obasi, secretary-general of the World Meteorological
Organization (WMO) at the opening ceremony.
</P>
<P>
He said, "desertification and drought have immense social and
economic implications as more than 100 countries and approximately
250 million people are directly affected by desertification."
</P>
<P>
"In addition, another 1 billion people are at risk from the
adverse social and economic impacts of dryland degradation. Some
70 percent of the 5.2 billion hectares of drylands used for
agriculture around the world are already degraded," said Obasi.
</P>
<P>
Presiding over the opening session, Italian Foreign Affairs
Minister Lamberto Dini said that the Convention to combat
desertification and drought is the instrument to deal with a
problem affecting both the physical integrity of our planet, the
well-being and peaceful socio-economic development of humanity.
</P>
<P>
"The problem before us is not a technical but a political issue
in the most comprehensive sense. Being a common problem, it
requires that the solution must be found together," Dini said. "It
is a responsibility involving the whole of the international
community without exception as it is clearly stated in the
Convention."

and diplomats are taking part in the 11-day event.

<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Northwest China's Tibet Autonomous
Region has set up a multi-level foreign trade system which
registered a total import and export volume of 660 million yuan
(about 82.5 million US dollars) from 1992 to 1996.
</P>
<P>
Tibet's export and import market has extended from several
neighboring countries to 26 countries and regions, including
Japan, the United States and Germany.
</P>
<P>
In addition to farm and textile products, chemical, medical,
architectural and electronic products have also been listed on the
region's export and import list.
</P>
<P>
The regional government has made great efforts to develop its
border trade through various channels, bringing its volume to 50
million US dollars over the past five years.
</P>
<P>
Since Tibet began further carrying out the open policy in 1992,
the region has established 76 foreign-funded businesses and
attracted overseas investment of 50 million US dollars from nine
countries and regions in agriculture, textile and other industries.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, foreign economic and trade industries have also
emerged in Tibet. The region has set up centers in more than 20
comparatively developed cities across China and in foreign
countries to collect information that can be used to spur on
development.
</P>
<P>
So far, Tibet has over 20 businesses of various kinds in the
foreign trade system, most of which are earning good
profits.

<HEADLINE> Greece Does Not Rule Out Possible Clash With Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Greece said today that it
could not rule out the possibility of a clash with Turkey in the
Aegean or on Cyprus following the failure of talks between the two
countries' foreign ministers in New York last week.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters today, Greek government spokesman
Dimitris Reppas said that as long as the crisis remained in
Greek-Turkish relations, there was always a possibility of an
"incident" which would best be avoided.
</P>
<P>
"If there is an incident, it will be due to the fact that
Turkey maintains its expansionist designs against Greece which is
ready to confront such an eventuality," he said.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Greece and Turkey have been strained for
decades due to their differences over the territorial waters,
airspace, the continental shelf and the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
In January 1996, the two countries nearly went to war after
Turkey questioned Greece's sovereignty over Imia, an uninhabited
islet in the Aegean sea.
</P>
<P>
To improve their bilateral relations, the two neighbors have
since early this year taken a series of measures including the
signing of the Madrid communique in July, which drew broad
guidelines for relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
But the fruitless meeting in New York has resulted in the
escalation of war of words between the two countries, casting a
shadow over the peace process.
</P>
<P>
However, the Balkan summit on the Greek island of Crete in
early November might provide Athens and Ankara with another chance
to better their relations.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis would
meet with his Turkish counterpart, Mesut Yilmaz, at the summit to
discuss bilateral relations.

The Dow Jones industrial average fell 46.17 to 7,945.26.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Foreign Minister on Globalization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 30 (Xinhua) -- The developing
countries as a whole continue to suffer the negative impact of
globalization of the world economy, according to Ali Alata,
foreign minister of Indonesia, today.
</P>
<P>
Globalization has indeed brought about an unprecedented surge
in international trade, investment and information flows, but it
has also accentuated the inequities and imbalances of
international economic relations, Alata said in his speech
delivered at the 52nd session of the U.N. General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
The developing countries are marginalized from international
economic decision-making processes. Only the developed economies
have fully benefited from it, he said.
</P>
<P>
Given the sharp fluctuations of international financial flows
and currency manipulation by speculators, financial and monetary
policy systems of developing countries could be crushed overnight
in the anarchy of the globalized marketplace. He said that
globalization, therefore, should be managed so as to soften its
impact on vulnerable economies.
</P>
<P>
He also said that many developing countries are unable to
attract adequate volumes of foreign direct investment. He said
that Indonesia supports the U.N. reform package submitted by the
secretary-general with the goal of helping the developing
economies.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister also indicated that the developing
countries are finding their comparative advantages reduced by an
array of non-tariff barriers and the misuse of anti-dumping
measures and countervailing duties.
</P>
<P>
"Our common aspirations for global economic and social
development will never be realized until all forms of
discrimination are removed from society and opportunity is
afforded equitably to all humanity," he said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Embassy to Nigeria Holds National Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 31 (Xinhua) -- Chinese ambassador to Nigeria
Lu Fengding held a reception party here this evening to celebrate
the 48th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of
China.
</P>
<P>
He also gave a celebration party on Thursday evening in the
embassy office in Abuja, the first time such an event held in the
Nigerian capital.
</P>
<P>
The two reception parties attracted more than 500 government
officials, foreign diplomats, military officers and Nigerian
friends from various walks of life, as well as Chinese working
and living in the country.
</P>
<P>
The participants included former head of state E.A.O.
Shonekan, Internal Affairs Minister Babagana Kingbe, Minister of
Power and Steel Bashir Dalhatu, Minister of Solid Minerals
Development Kaloma Ali, Minister of Women's Affairs and Social
Development Judith Atta, and Director-general of the Foreign
Affairs Ministry Jibril Cjinade.
</P>
<P>
According to Cjinade, it was the first time that so many high
ranking Nigerian government officials attended the National Day
celebration of a country, which reflected the good relations
between Nigeria and China.
</P>
<P>
At the parties, the Chinese ambassador briefed the guests on
the tremendous changes that have taken place in China since its
founding in 1949, particularly after China adopted reform and
opening policies in the late 1970s.
</P>
<P>
He also talked about the just-concluded national congress of
the Communist Party of China, saying that with the newly-elected
leadership, China will be more open so as to create a more
favorable environment for foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
The envoy reiterated that China will stick to its independent
foreign policy and further promote the friendly relations and
trade and economic cooperation with Nigeria.

<HEADLINE> David Stephen Appointed Head of Somalia Political Office </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 30 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan today designated David Stephen as head of the United
Nations Political Office for Somalia (UNPOS) effective on October
1, 1997.

<HEADLINE> LDC Countries Need Stronger Support: Annan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 30 (Xinhua) -- The efforts by the
Least Developed Countries (LDCs) for their economic progress
should be matched by stronger international support, U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan said here today.
</P>
<P>
In his statement at the Seventh LDCs Ministerial Meeting being
held in conjunction with the 52nd session of the U.N. General
Assembly, Annan said international action should meet four broad
objectives, which are:
</P>
<P>
-- a decisive reduction of the debt burden;
</P>
<P>
-- a substantial increase in official development assistance;
</P>
<P>
-- a significant improvement in external trading prospects;
</P>
<P>
-- a further enhancement of the flow of foreign investment and
technology.
</P>
<P>
He said the 48 LDCs, over a quarter of the United Nations
membership, have languished behind the rest of the world in terms
of development in the past five decades.
</P>
<P>
The burden on external debt remains onerous and the surge in
private capital flows has virtually ignored the LDCs, he added.
</P>
<P>
According to the U.N. Conference on Trade and Development
(UNCTAD), the debt stock rose by some 20 billion U.S. dollars or
18 percent to 1,350 billion dollars in the first half of the
1990s.
</P>
<P>
Total net flow of resources to LDCs fell from 17.2 billion
dollars in 1990 to 16 billion dollars in 1995, UNCTAD added in its
1997 report on LDCs.
</P>
<P>
The developed countries' ratio of assistance to gross national
product hit its lowest point so far in 1996, Annan said, adding
that "I would bring to bear all the pressure I can to help reverse
this trend."
</P>
<P>
The U.N. "will make every effort to play a bigger role in
improving the lot of the LDCs," he pledged.
