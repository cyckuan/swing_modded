<HEADLINE> Euro Dives to New Lows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Europe's single currency took
another dive Monday after Finland's Finance Minister Sauli
Niinisto said there were "quite natural reasons" for the
currency's weakness against the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the start of a meeting of finance ministers from
the euro zone's 11 countries, Niinisto blamed the state of the
European Union economy for the currency's troubles, saying that
"we are not doing so well as they are doing in the (United) States
with the economy."
</P>
<P>
Following his statement, the dollar gained again, setting a new
record high against the single currency, before dropping a 10th of
a cent again. In London on Monday afternoon, it took just 1.0145
U.S. dollars to buy one euro, according to a BBC report.
</P>
<P>
The currency received another blow when data published in
Germany confirmed the weakness of the country's economy. Inflation
was virtually down to zero in June, while industrial output in May
fell 2 percent from a year before, according to earlier reports.
</P>
<P>
"Inflation is still low which means the economy is still in
relative standstill," BankBoston currency strategist Jeffrey
Woodruff was quoted by BBC as saying.
</P>
<P>
The European finance ministers are reportedly discussing what
to do about the euro's fall.
</P>
<P>
When the euro was launched in January, its exchange rate had
been set at 1.16675 U.S. dollars. Since then it has lost more than
13 percent of its value against the dollar.
</P>
<P>
Many traders predict that it is now only a matter of time
before the euro and the dollar trade on parity, a move that could
seriously undermine market confidence in the European currency.
</P>
<P>
However, the euro is not the only currency suffering. The Swiss
Franc is at an eight-year low against the dollar, while the UK
pound is hovering at a 35-month low.
</P>
<P>
One purpose of the ministerial meeting in Brussels is to
coordinate policy statements on economic and monetary matters in
the euro zone.

<HEADLINE> Riyadh Calls for Lifting Sanctions on Libya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Saudi King Fahd Ibn
Abdul-Aziz on Monday called for lifting the seven-year
international sanctions imposed on Libya over the Lockerbie crisis.
</P>
<P>
Libya has responded enough regarding the related United
Nations Security Council resolutions, King Fahd said at a weekly
cabinet session held in the kingdom's western city of Jeddah, the
Kuwait News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"There is no justification for further delay," he said,
stressing that the Libyan people "should live without any
obstacles."
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council imposed an arms and air embargo
against Libya in 1992 after Tripoli refused to turn over two
Libyans, who have long been accused by the U.S. and Britain of
blowing up a Pan Am flight in 1988 over Lockerbie, Scotland.
</P>
<P>
After years of international mediations, especially from Saudi
Arabia and South Africa, Libya surrendered the two suspects last
April for trial in Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the U.N. suspended the sanctions and promised to
lift them 90 days after U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan
verifies that Libya has complied with all relevant requirements.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council welcomed last Friday Libya's commitment
to cooperation in the investigation and promised to lift
sanctions as soon as possible.

<HEADLINE> UK Publishes N. Ireland "Failsafe" Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Britain Monday unveiled complex
proposals designed to eject the Irish Republican Army's political
wing Sinn Fein out of Northern Ireland's government unless
republican guerrillas give up their arms.
</P>
<P>
A bill described by Prime Minister Tony Blair as a "failsafe
mechanism" said the province's political institutions would be
suspended if any party failed to meet its commitments on
decommissioning weapons, according to a Reuters report.
</P>
<P>
After the suspension, Britain's Northern Ireland secretary
would call two meetings of the suspended assembly in Belfast to
review the situation, the second ending in a vote.
</P>
<P>
Once the Northern Ireland secretary ended the suspension, the
executive's chief minister and his deputy and other ministers
would be able to resume their offices.
</P>
<P>
The complex six-clause bill will be debated by the House of
Commons Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
But David Trimble, leader of the main Protestant party, the
Ulster Unionists, said after a 90-minute meeting with Blair
earlier Monday that his party still had problems with it and
planned to table amendments.
</P>
<P>
Blair plans to rush the bill through parliament so that
Northern Ireland's devolved government can be put in place with
full powers transferred from Westminster by Sunday, Reuters said.

<HEADLINE> Statistics Canada Reports Tourism Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Statistics Canada reported a 5.4
percent increase in tourists spending in the first quarter of this
year.
</P>
<P>
Tourists spent 9.4 billion Canadian dollars (6.392 billion U.S.
dollars) in the first three months, 5.4 percent higher than that
of the same period of last year, Statistics Canada said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Non-residents spent 2 billion Canadian dollars (about 1.36
billion U.S. dollars) traveling in Canada, as compared with 7.4
billion (about 5.032 billion U.S. dollars) spent by Canadians on
domestic tourism.
</P>
<P>
Statistics Canada put the spending increase by foreign visitors
at 12.8 percent, which is more than three times the 3.5 percent
spending rise by Canadians traveling domestically.
</P>
<P>
The spending increase by foreign visitors was attributed to
strengthening currencies in France, Japan and Britain. Increased
travel by Americans was also considered accountable for the rise.

<HEADLINE> Angola's Human Development Index Continues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, July 12 (Xinhua) -- An official with the United Nations
 Development Program (UNDP) said here Monday that Angola's 1999
human development index continues its downward trend this year.
</P>
<P>
Alieu Sallah, UNDP coordinator in Angola, made the remarks at a
ceremony to launch the agency's 1999 human development report.
</P>
<P>
The report shows that of the 174 countries on the list, Angola
ranks 160th, down from the 157th position last year.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, Angola's human development index
falls into the lower category, even among many under-developed
countries.
</P>
<P>
However, if evaluated against the Southern African Development
 Community members, Angola ranks the 6th owing to its respective
high openness in trade, and its place in oil and diamond export,
second only to South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Sallah believed that since the civil war in Angola has ravaged
people's lives, people in the country still have to make great
efforts to rid Angola of humanitarian crisis.
</P>
<P>
The UNDP report which was launched simultaneously in more than
100 countries Monday also touched on the pros and cons of economic
globalization.
</P>
<P>
Take Internet as an example, Angolans who have access to
Internet only accounts for 0.2 percent of its population, while in
the United States, about 20 percent of its people can now roam on
the information network.

<HEADLINE> Iran's Foreign Debts Stand at 14.89 Billion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Iran's total foreign debts stood
at 14.89 billion U.S. dollars at the beginning of the current
calendar Iranian year which started on March 21, the evening
newspaper Kayhan reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The figure was about 2.77 billion dollars higher than the
amount of 12.117 billion dollars at the beginning of last Iranian
year, the daily quoted a report from the Central Bank of Iran
(CBI) as saying.
</P>
<P>
The amount of foreign debts to become due this Iranian year
will be 7.599 billion dollars and the figures in coming four
years will stand at 2.437 billion, 1.037 billion, 0.547 billion
and 2.468 billion dollars respectively.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said that the country needs to pay off 5.63
billion U.S. dollars of its arrears in the current Iranian
calendar year.
</P>
<P>
Iran failed to pay off its due debts of 3.395 billion dollars
in the past Iranian year because its oil incomes dropped by some
3 billion dollars from the budget projection as a result of the
drop in oil prices in the year.
</P>
<P>
Hit by oil price fall during the past year, Iran was seeking
to reschedule the repayment of its foreign debts, mainly with
Italy and Germany.
</P>
<P>
CBI Governor Mohsen Nourbakhsh said in February that Tehran
reached agreements with its trade partners to reschedule 2
billion dollars of its debts.

<HEADLINE> UNDP: Poverty Pervasive in Developing Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 12 (Xinhua) -- While significant progress has been
made in human development worldwide, poverty continues to be
pervasive in a number of developing countries, according to a
report by the United Nations Development Program (UNDP).
</P>
<P>
The UNDP global human development report for 1999 launched here
Monday by UNDP resident representative Omoefe Oyaide said that
from 1975 to 1997 life expectancy in developing countries
increased from 53 to 62 years while the under-five mortality fell
from 149 to 84 per 1,000 live births.
</P>
<P>
For the sixth consecutive year, Canada ranks first in the human
 development index followed by Norway, the United States, Japan
and Belgium, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
It said Sierra Leone has remained in the last position followed
by Burundi, Burkina Faso, Ethiopia and Niger.
</P>
<P>
Zambia has moved down from 146 to 151 out of the 174 countries
between last year and now. Zambia's slide should not be seen as a
decline in the human development index for the country but may
mean that countries which are worse off have improved at a greater
pace than Zambia, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The index has grown in importance over the years and become an
important barometer of the state of social development and the
human condition globally, it said.
</P>
<P>
Oyaide said globalization is more than the flow of money and
commodities but the growing inter-dependence of the world's people
through shrinking space, time and disappearing of borders.
</P>
<P>
Twenty percent of the world's population who live in the
highest income countries have 86 percent of the world's gross
domestic product (GDP), 82 percent of the world's export market,
68 percent of foreign direct investment and 74 percent of the
telephone lines, she said.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, she noted, the bottom 20 percent in the
poorest countries have only about one percent in each category.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian President Meets Sudanese Counterpart </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
Monday met with his Sudanese counterpart Omar al-Bashir on the
sidelines of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) summit opened
in Algiers, Algeria, in the day.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Mubarak told Egypt's Middle East News Agency
that the talks were held "within the framework of contacts"
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He said the ties between the two countries "are continually
improving," while commenting on whether the meeting indicated
progress in removing tension in bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
The meeting between the two leaders is rare since the
Cairo-Khartoum ties soured in 1995 after Egypt accused Sudan of
masterminding an assassination attempt on Mubarak in Addis Ababa,
Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
Egypt also blamed Sudan for sheltering Islamic militants who
have been waging an insurgency since 1992 in an attempted to
topple the secular Egyptian government.
</P>
<P>
Sudan has denied both charges.
</P>
<P>
The ties have been improving steadily in the recent two years
after the two sides repeatedly expressed readiness to end tensions
and exchanged visits by senior officials. It has been reported
that the two sides are considering a visit to Egypt by the
Sudanese president.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Middle East News Agency said on Monday that
Mubarak has sent a message to al-Bashir about his visits to the
United States and France early this month, a further sign of the
warming-up of the relations.
</P>
<P>
After receiving the message delivered by Egyptian Charge
d'Affaires in Khartoum Desouki Fayed, Sudanese First Vice
President Ali Osman Taha expressed gratitude to Mubarak and lauded
his efforts in restoring Arab unity.

<HEADLINE> First No-Confidence Motion Against New Israeli </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 12 (Xinhua) -- In a sign of strength of the
new government of Prime Minister Ehud Barak, the coalition faction
in the Knesset (Parliament) Monday easily defeated a no-confidence
motion, the first since Barak took office last week.
</P>
<P>
The no-confidence motion, presented by the largest opposition
bloc Likud, was foiled in a Knesset voting after failing to muster
a majority support. The vote was 31 for, 63 against and five
abstained.
</P>
<P>
The Likud has submitted the motion in protest against Barak's
handling of the coalition negotiations and his intention to expand
the cabinet from 18 ministers to 24.
</P>
<P>
During the 42 days of coalition talks since the May election,
Barak had initially preferred the right-wing Likud, which controls
19 seats in the 120-member Knesset, as a coalition partner.
</P>
<P>
But he abandoned the idea after it became obvious that the
internal struggle in the party and its hard-line policy would
stand in the way of his effort to move forward the stalled peace
process.
</P>
<P>
He has finally managed to form a coalition of 75 seats, the
broadest parliamentary majority in Israel in years.
</P>
<P>
In its first meeting since taking office last Tuesday, the
cabinet of Barak approved almost unanimously Sunday a bill which
will expand itself from the present 18 ministers to 24.
</P>
<P>
Barak initiated the bill in an effort to accommodate the large
coalition in his cabinet, but the Likud said it violates Israel's
basic laws on government.
</P>
<P>
The Knesset began a stormy debate on the bill Sunday after a
Knesset committee in charge of procedures agreed to exempt it from
a 48-hour waiting period required by laws before being presenting
for discussion.
</P>
<P>
The bill is almost assured of approval in a vote scheduled
Tuesday afternoon since all ruling partners have agreed to the
government expansion while signing coalition agreements with
Barak.

WASHINGTON, July 12 (Xinhua) -- All the 9,700 refugees who came
to the United States from Kosovo will be offered free flights home
on commercial and charter flights, Clinton administration
officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
About half of the refugees went to live with their relatives in
the U.S., about 200 remained in Fort Dix, New Jersey, and the
others found other places to live in this country.
</P>
<P>
Most of the refugees are expected to take the United States up

spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
David J. Scheffer, the U.S. ambassador-at-large for war crimes
issues, said about 200 of the 4,000 refugees who went through Fort
Dix had provided detailed accounts of war crimes.
</P>
<P>
Scheffer said that information was being turned over to United
Nations prosecutors in The Hague, the Netherlands, and may lead to
additional indictments of war criminals.

PARIS, July 12 (Xinhua) -- King Hassan II of Morocco began
Monday afternoon a state visit to France, during which he will be
the guest of President Jacques Chirac to attend the July 14
Bastille Day military parade on the Champs-Elysee Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
King Hassan II will focus his talks with Chirac and Prime
Minister Lionel Jospin on bilateral economic cooperation and
Morocco's economic reforms aimed at tackling problems of
unemployment, low economic growth rate and foreign debts.
</P>
<P>
The Socialist government of Jospin has promised to help Morocco
carry out social and economic reforms through establishing joint
ventures and making other forms of investment.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Morocco and Algeria are likely to be a big
topic between the leaders of France and Morocco, as France has
strategic security interests in the Maghreb region.
</P>
<P>
Morocco and Algeria have experienced tense relations since
1994, when an armed attack took place on a hotel in Marrakech, in
which Morocco suspected involvement of Algerian security service.
</P>
<P>
On the eve of the visit by the Moroccan monarchy, some human
rights groups have called on the French government to pressure
Morocco to allow an Moroccan opposition leader living in exile in
France to return home.

<HEADLINE> S. African Opposition Against Gun Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 12 (Xinhua) -- The Federal Alliance, an
opposition in South Africa, Monday rejected the government's
proposed new gun law as " short-sighted", saying the draft
legislation would penalize the owners of legally licensed
firearms.
</P>
<P>
"(It) will not contribute one iota toward combating the crime
wave sweeping through South Africa," party spokesman Jan Bosman
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The new law will "render law-abiding citizens defenseless" and
will also open the door for more violent attacks with arms, the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
The tough draft law, leaked to a weekend newspaper, may require
 applicants to undergo psychometric testing. It effectively
prohibits ownership of firearms for lawful self-defense, outlawing
about 90 percent of all licensed firearms. It proposes a six-month
period for gun owners to declare and hand in their guns.
Thereafter, "harsh and severe" measures should be in place to
prosecute those still in possession of illegal firearms.
</P>
<P>
Bosman said the alliance believed that the new gun laws would
not curb the current violence, murders and crimes.

<HEADLINE> Russia to Spend 187 Mln Dlrs to Fix Y2K Bugs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Russian Finance Minister Mikhail
Kasyanov said Monday that Russia will spend an estimated 187
million U.S. dollars to tackle the Y2K problem, almost half of the
originally projected sum of 370 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
He said priority funding would be given to defense and security
agencies.
</P>
<P>
However, the Defense Ministry will receive only 13 million
dollars for fixing the bug. It will have to seek the additional
10.7 million dollars needed from its own sources, the minister
said.
</P>
<P>
The Finance Ministry will receive 6 million dollars while the
State Customs Committee and the Taxation Service Ministry will
have to look for funding on their own.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Russia's State Telecommunications
Committee Chairman Alexander Ivanov said Monday that the
preparation of computer networks to withstand the Y2K bug would be
complete in November.
</P>
<P>
But he warned that some agencies do not seem to be aware of the
dangers and that foreign intelligence services may take advantage
of the situation.
</P>
<P>
He called for the establishment of special task forces to
monitor the situation on the night of December 31.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov also called for fewer flights and the halt of certain
hazardous industrial processes and a switch to manual control in
some production and management fields.
</P>
<P>
He said that there are over 140,000 computer systems and
networks in Russian state offices, one fifth of them vitally
important for the state.

JOHANNESBURG, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Old Mutual, South Africa's
leading insurer, was Monday successfully listed in five stock
exchanges.
</P>
<P>
The company was listed in London, Zimbabwe, Namibia and Malawi
as well as in Johannesburg.
</P>
<P>
The issue price of 11.25 rand was lower than expected, but it
made rapid initial gain. In Johannesburg, it closed at 13.10 rand
(2.18 U.S. dollars) on Monday, according to the SABC television.
</P>
<P>
The listing of Old Mutual, which was demutualized in May this
year, sparked speculation of a six-billion-rand (one billion
dollars) spending spree in South Africa as policy holders swap
their free share for cash.
</P>
<P>
At the initial price of 11.25 rand, the Old Mutual group was
worth 6.1 billion dollars, a valuation which would catapult it
into the FTSE 100 index.

Old Mutual follows mining groups Billiton and Anglo American as

<HEADLINE> UNDP Calls for Re-Writing of Globalization Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 12 (Xinhua) -- A powerful plea for a
re-writing of the rules of globalization -- to make it work for
people and not just for profits -- is made in the Human
Development Report 1999, released here Monday by the U.N.
Development Program (UNDP).
</P>
<P>
Globalization is more than the flow of money and commodities --
it is the growing interdependence of the world's people through
"shrinking space, shrinking time and disappearing borders," the
report said.
</P>
<P>
This offers great opportunities for enriching people's lives
and creating a global community based on shared values, the report
said. But markets, it argued, have been allowed to dominate the
process, and the benefits and opportunities have not been shared
equitably.
</P>
<P>
The result is a "Grotesque" and dangerous polarization between
people and countries benefiting from the system and those that are
merely passive recipients of its efforts, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The fifth of the world's people living in the highest income
countries has 86 percent of the world gross domestic product
(GDP), 82 percent of world export markets, 68 percent of foreign
direct investment, and 74 percent of telephone lines, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
The bottom fifth, in the poorest countries, has about one
percent in each category. One of the foreign direct investment in
developing countries and the countries of Central and Eastern
Europe in the 1990s, more than 80 percent went to just 20
countries, mainly to China, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Such disparities are glaring enough. But the report argued that
the inequitable effects of globalization driven by markets and
profit are far wider and deeper, touching all aspects of human
life, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Care, "the invisible heart of human development," is threatened
because today's competitive global market is putting pressure on
the time, resources and incentive for caring labor, without which
individuals do not flourish and social cohesion can break down.
</P>
<P>
Breakthroughs in technology, such as the Internet, can open a
fast rack to knowledge-based growth in rich and poor countries
alike, but at present benefit the relatively well-off and
educated: 88 percent of users live in industrialized countries,
which collectively represent just 17 percent of the world's
population.
</P>
<P>
The literally well connected have an overpowering advantage
over the unconnected poor, whose voices and concerns are being
left out the global conversation, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Money also talks louder than need in defining the
biotechnology research agenda, the report said. "Cosmetic drugs
and slow-ripening tomatoes come higher on the list than a vaccine
against malaria or drought-resistant crops for marginal land."
</P>
<P>
The "breakneck" speed of globalization is also making people's
lives less secure, as the spread of global threats to well-being
outpaces action to tackle them, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The East Asian financial crisis, for example, will have reduced
global output by an estimated 2 trillion U.S. dollars, putting
millions of people out of work and prompting cutbacks in social
services all over the world. The crisis was not an isolated
accident, the report said, because financial volatility is an
inherent feature of globally integrated financial markets.
</P>
<P>
Job insecurity is also increasing in both industrialized and
developing countries in the wake of economic and corporate
restructuring and the dismantling of social protection measures,
the report said.

<HEADLINE> France Pulls Out Military Advisors From Mauritania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 12 (Xinhua) -- France has pulled out all its
military advisors from Mauritania, as was demanded by the
Mauritanian government, reported Agence France-Presse (AFP).
</P>
<P>
AFP quoted a reliable source in Nouakchott as saying Monday
that all of some 40 French military advisors have left by
different planes by Sunday evening.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the 37 Mauritanian military interns studying in
France have also arrived home, said AFP.
</P>
<P>
Mauritania asked France to pull out its military advisors after
a court in Montpellier, southwest France, accused a Mauritanian
intern, Captain Ould Dah, of "crimes of torture" committed in his
own country 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The court's action greatly angered Mauritania, which also
imposed a visa requirement for all French nationals wishing to
visit the country.

<HEADLINE> UNDP Calls for Efforts to Narrow Gap Between Knows, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 12 (Xinhua) -- In the race to lay claim to
knowledge, the global gap between haves and have-nots, between
knows and know-nots, is widening, said the Human Development
Report 1999, released here Monday by the U.N. Development Program
(UNDP).
</P>
<P>
Writing computer programs and revealing genetic codes have
replaced the search for gold, the conquest of land and the command
of machinery as the path to economic power, the 262-page report
said.
</P>
<P>
The Internet, the worldwide computer link-up, is "the
fastest-growing tool of communication ever," with the number of
users expected to grow from 150 million today to more than 700
million in 2001, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Information and communication technology are tremendous tools
for development and can open a fast track to knowledge-based
growth, a track followed by India's software programming,
Ireland's computing services and the Caribbean's data processing,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
But many of those who most need access cannot obtain it. An
invisible barrier has emerged that "true to its name, (it) is like
a world wide web, embracing the connected and silently, almost
imperceptibly, excluding the rest," the report said.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the report called for a shift of research towards
the needs of the world, rather than just of those who pay. It
recommended the establishment of a group of independent scientists
to identify technological problems that, if solved, would
contribute to human development, particularly of the world's
poorest people, and to human security.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the report called for a review of the intellectual
property rights agreement under the World Trade Organization --
first raised in world trade talks in 1986 to crack down on
counterfeit goods, but now involved in the ownership of life
itself.
</P>
<P>
Although trade and intellectual laws, such as patent
legislation, are increasingly determining the path of nations, the
intellectual property rights agreement was negotiated with little
input from many of the developing countries, which are now feeling
its impact, the report said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, it was negotiated before most governments and
people understood the social and economic implications of patent
on life, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Patent laws pay little attention to the knowledge of indigenous
people, and on what can be owned: "The result: a silent theft of
centuries of knowledge from developing to developed countries,"
the report added.

<HEADLINE> S. African Currency Ends Weaker on Offshore Dollar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 12 (Xinhua) -- South African currency, the
rand, ended weaker against the U.S. dollar Monday, remaining above
the psychological 6.1000 level on offshore dollar demand.
</P>
<P>
The enthusiasm around life insurer Old Mutual's listing failed
to ignite the rand and at 1600 local time (1400 GMT), the currency
was at 6.1150 per dollar from Monday's close of 6.0885.
</P>
<P>
The market was pretty quiet Monday with some dollar demand out
of London and a marginal demand from New York players late Monday
afternoon, market sources said.
</P>
<P>
They said it was probably jobbers looking to make marginal
profit who were active, almost ignoring Old Mutual's listing on
the London and Johannesburg Stock Exchanges.
</P>
<P>
Expectations were that with the listing, there would be rand
demand which would have strengthened the local currency.
</P>
<P>
The local currency opened the session around 6.0950 per dollar
and then firmed slightly to around 6.0750. However the rand's
strength did not last.
</P>
<P>
It soon gave in to offshore dollar demand and weakened to its
intra-day worst level of 6.1310 later in the day. At midday it
was quoted at 6.1125 per dollar level.
</P>
<P>
Market analysts said the reluctant participation of offshore
players could be related to dropping interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The South African banks first announced rate cuts last month.
More rate cuts are expected soon as the South African Reserve Bank
is said to prepare a cut by seven basis points.

<HEADLINE> Britain to Study Breast Milk for Toxins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 12 (Xinhua) -- The British government is launching
a study to probe the extent to which breast milk from British
mothers is contaminated with poisonous chemicals.
</P>
<P>
The study follows a World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) report
released Monday, which found more than 350 chemicals, from
substances such as perfume, suntan lotion and pesticides, in
Britain's breast milk samples.
</P>
<P>
Although many of these are not dangerous, it said British
infants may be taking in 42 times the safe level of dioxins.
</P>
<P>
And according to the WWF, cow's milk, which is used in infant
milk formulas, could be equally contaminated.
</P>
<P>
These poisonous chemicals can build up in the body over time
and cause cancer, immune system damage and hormonal imbalances,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
However, the British government, believing further research is
needed, is telling mothers in Britain not to panic. Government
experts, the WWF and child health specialists also believed that
the benefits of breastfeeding were far too great to stop.
</P>
<P>
"In terms of the safe limits over a lifetime it was not a cause
for concern," said a spokeswoman from the Ministry of Agriculture,
Fisheries and Food.
</P>
<P>
She added that "the total amount that we are talking about fits
quite comfortably into the total amount that somebody is supposed
to get, especially given that environmental exposure to this sort
of thing has been falling over recent years."
</P>
<P>
Government officials announced that a new project is being set
up in northern England, which will recruit about 1,000 mothers
from Yorkshire area to take part in a research project led by
Leeds University.
</P>
<P>
The Leeds survey will attempt to collect a representative
sample of breast milk to form an "archive" of milk samples
reflecting social groups, diets, and number and position of
children in families.

<HEADLINE> World Bank: Reviving Kosovo, A Complicated Challenge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Rebuilding Kosovo after its
recent ordeal will prove a highly complicated challenge for
international policy makers as they meet in Brussels Tuesday to
map out an action plan for the battered province, and the wider
Southeast Europe region, the World Bank said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the bank said in a statement that jumpstarting
Kosovo's stationary economy will only be possible within a broader
strategy of repairing the economies of neighboring countries,
particularly Albania and former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, as
well as Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, and Romania
which also suffered economic losses as a result of hostilities.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press briefing before the inaugural meeting of
the High-Level Steering Group, a special World Bank-European
Commission chaired partnership for coordinating the international
donor response to conflict in the Balkans, World Bank officials
said that reviving Kosovo's economy would be complicated by the
fact that, after years of regional conflict and sanctions imposed
against Yugoslavia, the province was already one of the poorest
areas in southeastern Europe long before the recent hostilities.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics indicate that from 1990 to 1995, Kosovo's
gross domestic product contracted by an estimated 50 percent,
falling to less than 400 U.S. dollars per capita, lower than
Albania, Europe's poorest country.
</P>
<P>
"Available information on Kosovo's economic conditions is
spotty and unreliable at best, but what we do know is that the
province has been battered socially and economically by the recent
hostilities," said Christiaan Poortman, World Bank's southeast
Europe coordinator and country director, who will lead a World
Bank fact-finding mission into Kosovo Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Although it now seems that though there was not the widespread
hunger and destruction that we had once feared, privation and
hardship have been extreme. Restarting economic activity and
producing jobs are two immediate priorities now that many of
Kosovo's refugees have either returned home or are on their way,"
Poortman said.
</P>
<P>
While the suffering of Kosovo's ethnic Albanian refugees has
been the most painfully visible consequence of the recent
conflict, the crisis has also had broader regional impacts, the
bank said.
</P>
<P>
The most recent assessment forecasts, under assumptions, that
economic growth is expected to slow on average by 3-4 percentage
points in 1999 in the six affected countries. The combined
incremental 1999 balance of payments financing gap for these
countries is now estimated at 1 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
"Reviving Kosovo will quickly run into some powerful obstacles
without a regional framework that jumpstarts and improves economic
and social conditions for all the affected countries of
southeastern Europe," said Rory O'Sullivan, the World Bank's
special representative to southeast Europe, based in Sarajevo.
</P>
<P>
This week's debut of the High-Level Steering Group in Brussels
will lay the groundwork for a series of follow-up donor meetings
set for late July and following months, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
A first donor meeting designed to raise funds for the
humanitarian/refugee return program and for civilian
administration will be held on July 28 in Brussels and a second
one be held in mid-autumn to raise reconstruction needs, said the
bank.
</P>
<P>
World Bank officials said their agency plans to provide 60
million dollars to Kosovo over the next 18 months as part of
emergency reconstruction efforts.

<HEADLINE> Trimble: Problem Remains With N.Irish Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Ulster Unionist Party leader David
Trimble said Monday there are "still continuing problems" with
plans put forward by the British government to save the Northern
Ireland peace process.
</P>
<P>
Trimble was speaking after an hour of crucial meeting in
Downing Street with Prime Minister Tony Blair as the British
government prepared to publish its Northern Ireland Bill within
hours.
</P>
<P>
The talks were held to discuss key legislation being put before
the British Parliament as Blair's Thursday deadline for an
agreement on power-sharing approaches.
</P>
<P>
Trimble was shown a draft of the bill, which is designed to
give the unionists the "failsafe" guarantees they require before
they are prepared to take up positions in a Northern Ireland
executive alongside Sinn Fein before the Irish Republican Army
begins handing in its weapons.
</P>
<P>
After leaving Downing Street, Trimble told reporters that
problems remained with the legislation and his party would be
tabling amendments to the bill, but he added that the talking
would continue.
</P>
<P>
Although the bill has already been presented to Britain's House
of Commons, its actual details are not due to be released until
later Monday.
</P>
<P>
The bill is expected to pass all its Commons stages Tuesday
before moving on to the House of Lords Wednesday and Thursday.

<HEADLINE> World Communities Urged to Aid Ethiopia's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia Monday called on
international organizations and donor countries to continue
supporting its national population policy.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the occasion of the World Population Day and the
6th anniversary of the official launching of Ethiopia's population
policy, Ethiopian parliament Speaker Dawit Yohannes spoke highly
of material and financial aid donor agencies offered.
</P>
<P>
Attaching importance to international assistance and technical
support, Dawit also said coordinated endeavors of the mass media
were necessary to bring about changes of attitudes and inculcate
family planning education among the beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia, with a population of 60 million, is Africa's third
most populous country following Nigeria and Egypt. It has been
trying to curb the fast increasing population over the years.
</P>
<P>
Under the Ethiopian national population policy, the number of
children in one family should not exceed four.
</P>
<P>
According to Negussie Tefera, head of the Ethiopian population
office, financial constraints and shortage of skilled manpower had
impacted on the implementation of population program.
</P>
<P>
Negussie urged government bodies and all the people in the
country to streamline their efforts to bring about equitable
population and economic development and improve people's living
standards.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Official Highlights Globalization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Globalization should be an
instrument for greater and faster human development and not
detract from these objectives, Zimbabwean Planning Commissioner
Richard Hove said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Hove was speaking during the official launch of the 1999 United
Nations Human Development Report whose theme is "globalization
with a human face".
</P>
<P>
He said globalization had resulted in unprecedented forces and
the digital revolution had worked their way into societies,
business, governments and everyday lives.
</P>
<P>
Technology and globalization should give developing countries
new opportunities for development, he said.
</P>
<P>
"With globalization, the focus is on attracting investors who
would bring into the developing countries technology, capital,
processing know- how and enter into partnerships with domestic
entrepreneurs," he said.
</P>
<P>
To succeed today, said the official, business and government
must understand globalization which meant openness, deregulation
and privatization.
</P>
<P>
The report said 20 percent of the world population living in
the highest income countries controlled 86 percent of the world
gross domestic product, 82 percent of world exports, 68 percent of
direct investments and 74 percent of world telephone lines.
</P>
<P>
Another 20 percent of the world population living in the
poorest countries only had about one percent of the same sectors,
it added.
</P>
<P>
According to Hove, as long as globalization remained dominated
by economic aspects and the spread of markets, human development
would be unavoidably squeezed.
</P>
<P>
He said Zimbabwe's development was too slow as a result of the
socio- economic difficulties that the country was going through.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwean government was working to ensure that the
various macro- economic variables were brought into alignment, he
added.

<HEADLINE> Kenya, China Enhance Educational Exchange </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Kenya and China are consolidating
 educational ties by signing two agreements on bilateral
educational cooperation, a senior Kenyan official said here
Monday.
</P>
<P>
"The two agreements are great and significant because they
emphasize increasing scholarships in higher education to Kenya and
expansion of horticultural project at Egerton University," said
Stephen Musyoka, Kenyan Minister for Education and Human Resource
Development, upon his return to Nairobi from an official visit to
China.
</P>
<P>
Musyoka and his Chinese counterpart Chen Zhili have signed two
 agreements in Beijing, one covering cooperation between the two
education ministries for the period of the year 2000 to 2005 and
the other on the development of the Third Phase of Co-operative
Project in the field of higher education.
</P>
<P>
"The scholarships (offered by the Chinese government) to Kenyan
students will increase from 10 to 32 in the next two years,"
Musyoka noted.
</P>
<P>
There are about 30 Kenyan students studying in China and the
figure will rise to 60 in a few years, Musyoka added.
</P>
<P>
Musyoka thanked China for sending four coaches to Kenyatta
University to train university and secondary school students in
volleyball, swimming and table tennis.
</P>
<P>
Kenya in return would send four lecturers including former
Olympians in track events to Xi'an Institute of Physical
Education, Musyoka said.

<HEADLINE> U.N., Indonesia Work for Secure Ballot in East Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 12 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations and
Indonesia have been in close contact to improve security
conditions in East Timor for a ballot to determine the future of
the territory, U.N. officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Ian Martin, special representative of U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan, met Monday with Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas
on the preparations for the vote to see whether the 800,000 East
Timorese want special autonomy within Indonesia or independence.
</P>
<P>
The meeting took place in Dili, East Timor's capital, where the
U.N. Mission in East Timor (UNAMET) is based.
</P>
<P>
The UNAMET quoted Alatas as saying that a number of people were
being investigated by the Indonesian authorities for their alleged
involvement in recent incidents in East Timor and action will be
taken to prevent setting illegal roadblocks in the territory.
</P>
<P>
According to an agreement reached between Indonesia, Portugal
and the United Nations on May 5, a "popular consultation" will
take place next month in East Timor, a former Portuguese colony
until 1975 but annexed by Indonesia a year later.
</P>
<P>
Recent violent activities reportedly involving pro-integration
and pro-independence militias have led Annan to delay vote
registration by three days until Saturday. He had already put off
the poll by two weeks from the original date of August 8 because
of security concerns.
</P>
<P>
The "requisite certification" of security conditions and the
opening of registration will be confirmed on July 16 if concrete
progress is made on improving the security situation in East
Timor, Annan told the U.N. Security Council over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
A U.N. spokesman said Monday that the U.N. chief was still
wanting to start registration this week and that Martin would meet
with the Indonesian Task Force Wednesday to assess the progress in
this direction.

He said that China cut the renminbin interest rate on June 10

Since late June, China has seen a slow increase in bank
deposits, which will benefit expenditures and investment, and this

<HEADLINE> Iraq's Fulfilment of Export Quota Depends on Oil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Iraq's fulfillment of the oil
export quota under the sixth phase of the U.N. oil-for-food
program depends on oil prices on the world markets, said an Iraqi
oil official on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Saddam Al-Hassan, executive director of the Oil Marketing
Department in the Oil Ministry, said that Iraq has signed 76
contracts to sell Iraqi cruel oil under the current sixth phase
which started on May 25, the Iraqi News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
He said that Iraq exported 54.8 million barrels of oil valued
at 750 million U.S. dollars in June. And the average daily oil
export reached 890,000 barrels through southern Iraq's Baker
harbor and 950,000 barrels through Turkey's Mediterranean port of
Cehan.
</P>
<P>
Since the fourth phase of the oil-for-food program, Iraq has
been allowed to export 5.2 billion dollars worth of oil in every
six months to buy food, medicine and other basic needs for its
nearly 24 million people.
</P>
<P>
However, Iraq was just able to export 3 billion dollars of oil
in the fourth phase and 3.9 billion dollars in the fifth phase
due to the sagging oil prices on world markets and severe lack of
oil spare parts.
</P>
<P>
The oil prices on world markets have climbed to some 16 dollars
per barrel from last year's record-low 10 dollars.
</P>
<P>
Iraq signed 1,096 contracts worth 590 million dollars under
the fourth and fifth phases of the program to purchase spare
parts for its oil sector, but few of the contracts have been
implemented, said the official.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad has long complained that the U.S. and British envoys
in the U.N. Sanctions Committee have been blocking the approval
of its contracts signed with foreign companies.

<HEADLINE> Xinhua Commentator On Lee Teng-hui's Separatist Remarks (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 12 (Xinhua) -- The Xinhua News Agency released a
commentator's article today denouncing Lee Teng-hui for his "naked
separatist remarks" in an attempt to destroy cross-straits
relations.
</P>
<P>
The article says that Lee intentionally chose this particular
moment when Taiwan's political situation is in a state of change
but when cross-straits tensions have shown signs of easing to
utter his separatist words, just as he did in 1995 when he went to
the United States to advocate "two Chinas" and "one China, one
Taiwan". But, unlike then, this time he is doing it more brazenly.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with a foreign news organization on July 9, Lee
said that cross-straits relations should be "state-to-state" or at
least "special state-to-state relations", so the commentator is
asking everyone who would like to see an easing of tensions in the
Taiwan Straits to be on alert because of Lee's remarks. Cross-
straits relations are at a critical moment now with Wang Daohan,
the president of the Association for Relations Across Taiwan
Straits, preparing to visit Taiwan, the article says.
</P>
<P>
Lee's recent remarks were straightforward proof that his
repeated statements that he will not pursue a policy of "Taiwan
independence" and will never give up his pursuit for unification
of the country in the future were false.
</P>
<P>
There are only a few months left for Lee to stay at his current
post so he is too impatient to wait to show his true colors, the
article says.

<TEXT>
<P>
The commentator says that the "one China" principle laid the
foundation for steady development of cross-straits relations and
that it is only with this principle that progress has been made in
cross-straits relations.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwanese authorities have been publicly proclaiming their
commitment to the "one China" principle and The Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) and Taiwan's Strait
Exchange Foundation (SEF) had reached a consensus on this
principle, the commentary says. But Lee is now flagrantly
violating the fundamental principle, undermining the foundations
of exchanges and cooperation between ARATS and SEF, while keeps
talking on about crystallizing mutual trust in the course of
exchanges and building stable relations on the basis of mutual
trust.
</P>
<P>
This is cheating Taiwan compatriots and the public elsewhere,
the article says and questions whether stability, peace, and
security, which are much wanted by the Taiwanese, have ever been
on Lee's mind when he is publicly poisoning cross-straits
relations and threatening stability across the straits.
</P>
<P>
Under the guise of democracy and public opinion, Lee has been
vigorously dragging the Taiwanese into the mire of "Taiwan
independence" by taking advantage of his political position and
his separatist remarks have mainly been used for foreigners and
were intended to mislead international public opinion and to get
foreign forces to intervene to make the Taiwan issue "an
international issue", the article says, but, "the trouble-maker is
doomed to fail."
</P>
<P>
Solving the Taiwan issue and reunifying the motherland has been
the common aspiration of all Chinese, including the Taiwanese
compatriots, the article says, and warns Lee and his likes not to
play with fire and risk the fortune and prospects of the Taiwanese
in betting on a politics.

<HEADLINE> N.Ireland March Passes Peacefully </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 12 (Xinhua) -- The most important Protestant
parade of the Northern Ireland marching season passed off
peacefully Monday amid tight security as efforts to secure a
political solution in the province continue.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 20,000 members of the Protestant Orange Order, who
believe the province should remain part of the United Kingdom, are
taking to the streets of Belfast for their traditional 12 July
parades.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of troops were on hand to keep the Orangemen and
nationalist residents apart. Police have put barricades to block
off the Ormeau Road area in south Belfast, a mainly nationalist
district which is a likely flashpoint.
</P>
<P>
However, according to reports from Belfast, there was no
incident at the most feared flashpoint, the barring of a local
lodge at Ormeau Bridge.
</P>
<P>
Because of residents' objections, one group of Orangemen were
prevented from marching through Ormeau Road, its traditional
route. Instead, the Parades Commission allowed them to re-route to
join the main Belfast Orange parade.
</P>
<P>
In protest at this decision, up to 20,000 Orangemen from all
over the city were converging on Ormeau Park, which is right
beside the flashpoint area.
</P>
<P>
Robert Saulters, the head of the Orange Order, has called for a
trouble-free day but did not rule out the possibility of trouble
later on as the parade continues.
</P>
<P>
"No matter what is run anywhere, football matches, anything,
there can be violence," he said.
</P>
<P>
Monday's march took place at a crucial time in the peace
process of Northern Ireland as the UK Government is due to unveil
legislation designed to break the deadlock in the Northern Ireland
peace process.

<HEADLINE> Iranian People Called to Join Protests Against </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Political parties in Iran on
Monday called on the people to join university students to
protest a recent unauthorized crackdown on students by the
security forces (police).
</P>
<P>
In a joint statement, 15 main political groups from both
moderate and conservative factions called on the people to hold a
gathering at the Tehran University Wednesday afternoon to protest
"the brutal attack on students by a group of willful security
forces," the Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) reported.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that such an act cannot be regarded as a
natural accident rather it should be looked upon as part of
premeditated plan targeting the achievements of the May 23, 1997
presidential elections, in which President Mohammad Khatami won a
landslide victory over the conservatives.
</P>
<P>
Thanking President Khatami for defending universities, it
voiced sympathy with the students injured in the incident and
called for arrest of the masterminds and perpetrators of the
bloody incident.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the student Basij, a paramilitary body, of the
Tehran University also announced to hold a gathering in front of
the university on Tuesday "to protest and unveil the invisible and
visible hands" behind the police attack on the university
dormitory complex on Thursday night and Friday.
</P>
<P>
In the wake of continued student protests, clashes erupted
again on Monday noon between students and the police as students
attempted to hold demonstrations outside the Tehran University
campus in defiance of the ban on illegal gatherings by
the Supreme National Security Council (SNSC).
</P>
<P>
Around the Vali-Asr Square in downtown Tehran, a group of
university student demonstrators threw stones and sticks at
policemen as they were trying to disperse and round up students.
</P>
<P>
Several angry demonstrators dragged down two plainclothesmen from
a motorcycle and set fire to it while others chased the policemen
into lanes.
</P>
<P>
Calm returned to the square one hour later, only after the
police used tear gas to disperse the students while police
helicopters hovered overhead around the square.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, eyewitnesses said that a shot was fired by a
motorcyclist, who was believed to be a member of the hard-line
Ansar Hezbollah (Friends of the God Party), in another gathering
of over 1,000 students and university staff and professors
gathered at the Tehran University campus.
</P>
<P>
Students believed that Ansar Hezbollah joined hands with the
police to crack down the student rally on Thursday night
protesting the approval of the new press law and the closure of
the leading moderate daily Salam (Hello).
</P>
<P>
Students said that at least seven students were killed by
the police, even if the SNSC announced on Sunday that no student,
but a military officer off-duty, was killed in the crackdown and
all the 200 arrested students have been released.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Tabriz University in northwestern Iran on
Monday confirmed that a religious student was shot dead and
several others injured on Sunday during protests in the university.
</P>
<P>
Iranian leaders have expressed concern that the student
protests would be misused by "opportunists" against the Islamic
system.
</P>
<P>
Condemning the police attack as "unacceptable," Iran's Supreme
Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei cautioned that students should watch
out and identify the enemies.
</P>
<P>
Iran's moderate President Khatami also called on students to
cooperate with the government in restoring law and order and
avoiding conflicts.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Government Urged to Save Prisoners from </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 12 (Xinhua) -- A Lebanese prisoners' rights group
Monday called Lebanese authorities to make every efforts to save
Lebanese prisoners held in an Israeli jail in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
"We called on the country's president, prime minister and house
speaker to use their power as much as possible to save Suleiman
Ramadan and his colleagues," said an appeal issued by the National
committee for Lebanese Held in the Israeli Prison of Khiam.
</P>
<P>
"We asked Lebanese government to summon ambassadors in Beirut
of the United Nations Security Council's five permanent member
states to brief them the situation in Khiam prison," the appeal
added.
</P>
<P>
It said scores of Lebanese prisoners at the notorious Khiam
jail suffered severe bruises in a clash with Israeli troops in its
occupied border zone in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The Israelis used tear gas canisters, whips and clubs to subdue
the prisoners' mutiny and five mutineers were taken to hospital in
nearby Marjayoun for treatment.
</P>
<P>
Among them is Ramadan, who has only one leg and whose other leg
was amputated after he developed gangrene in Khiam.
</P>
<P>
The clash was reportedly triggered by an attempt by the
prisoners to stage a huger strike to mark the July 14 Day of
Solidarity for Lebanese held in Israel.
</P>
<P>
The committee said that 130 Lebanese are jailed at Khiam
without trial for participation in the resistance movement or
collaborating with Lebanese guerrillas in attacks against Israeli
forces and its ally South Lebanon Army (SLA).
</P>
<P>
The militia has been running the jail under the supervision of
Israel that set up a self-declared security zone in south Lebanon
in 1985 in a bid to protect its north from Lebanese guerrillas'
cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanon's resistance movement spearheaded by
Hezbollah, or Party of God, has been fighting trying to oust
Israeli forces and SLA out of the country.

<P>
ALGIERS, July 12 (Xinhua) -- African leaders participating in
the on- going 35th summit of the Organization of African Unity
(OAU) have been urged to get access to Internet, the so-called
information highway.
</P>
<P>
The appeal was made by Mark Malloch Brown, administrator with
the United Nations Development Program (UNDP), when addressing a
press briefing here Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
He said Africa's poverty is at least in part attributed to its
general absence of access to advanced technology.
</P>
<P>
"Africa, which accounts for some 10 percent of the world's
population, has only 0.1 percent Internet access rate, the lowest
in the whole world," he said.
</P>
<P>
The hi-technology on the Internet can provide many
opportunities of business for African countries in dire need of
technical guidance, Brown added.
</P>
<P>
African leaders gathered here for the three-day summit of the
continental organization, which started Monday. As many as 46
heads of state and government and 2,400 delegates attended the
opening ceremony of the summit.
</P>
<P>
The summit, the last of this century, is widely regarded as one
of paramount importance to the future of the 53-member bloc and
the whole continent as a whole.

<HEADLINE> Egypt to Move Pharaonic Temple due to Ground Water </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Minister of Culture Farouk
Hosni said on Monday that Egypt will relocate a 2,600-year-old
Pharaonic temple to protect it from the rising subterranean water.
</P>
<P>
Hosni told reporters that the Temple of Hibis in al-Kharga
Oasis, 500 kilometers south of Cairo, will be moved to a new site
some 500 meters away.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's leading construction firm, Arab Contractors, will
dismantle all statues, obelisks and columns in the temple, which
covers 1,200 square meters, and put them in place on the new site,
he said.
</P>
<P>
The project is estimated to cost 20 million Egyptian pounds
(5.88 million U.S. dollars) and scheduled to be completed in two
and a half years, according to the minister.
</P>
<P>
It will be Egypt's largest project of the kind since the
rock-cut Temple of Ramses II in Abu Simbel near the border with
Sudan was dismantled and reerected under a UNESCO project in 1968
to protect it from flooding by the creation of the Lake Nasser
behind the Aswan High Dam on the Nile.
</P>
<P>
The temple was first built by King Bsmatik II of the 24th
dynasty around 660 B.C. to worship ancient Egypt's chief deity,
Amon. It also hosted statues of Amon's wife, Mut, the goddess
Isis, her husband, Osiris, and their son Horus.
</P>
<P>
The temple was rebuilt in 510-490 B.C. during the reign of
Darius who was the first Persian to occupy Egypt. Persian invaders
maintained Pharaonic deities to appease their conquered subjects
and prevent insurgences.
</P>
<P>
Mohammed el-Saghir, a leading archaeologist of Pharaonic
antiquities, said the temple has been deteriorating because of
rising underground water that was eating away at the foundations.
</P>
<P>
The temple has to be moved to a dry site in time in an effort
protect the antiquities, el-Saghir said.

The medals were presented to the two countries for their
efforts in helping African refugees, according to an official with
the committee in charge of the medal.
</P>
<P>
The conditions of this symbolic and significant distinction are

assistance, said the official with the OAU committee who refused
to be identified.
</P>
<P>
The OAU, which chooses to attribute the two prizes, one for a

country, also consider other criteria for the award, such as the
traditions of receiving massive displaced people and their
participation in the re-establishment of peace, the official said.

There are about 6.5 million refugees in Africa, which is
plagued by armed conflicts and instability in many parts of the

PARIS, July 12 (Xinhua) -- France urged on Monday the rebel
forces of the Democratic Republic of Congo (D.R.Congo) to adopt
the truce agreement signed last Saturday in Lusaka by six African

"The truce agreement signed in Lusaka by the leaders of the
countries concerned makes up without dispute an important step
toward a solution of the crisis of the Great Lakes," said the
French Foreign Ministry in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"France calls on the rebellion to join it without delay and on
all sides to respect its application, so that this chance of re-
establishing peace and security and shortening the sufferings of
the people in this region not be missed," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
Six Africa countries including Rwanda, D.R.Congo, Uganda,
Angola, Zimbabwe and Chad, which involved in the war in the D.R.
Congo, signed the agreement, but the rebels did not.
</P>
<P>
A leader of the Congolese Rally for Democracy (CRD), one of the
main rebel forces, said on Monday in Kigali, Rwanda, that it is
not bound by the truce.
</P>
<P>
The rebels have not signed the agreement because the leader of
CRD, Emile Ilunga, and the leader of another rebel force the
Movement de Liberation du Congo (MLC), Jean-Pierre Bemba, dispute
over who should be the right one to sign it.

<HEADLINE> UK Holds U.S. Embassy Bomb Suspects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Two Egyptians appeared in a British
court Monday on suspicion of involvement in last year's bomb
attacks on U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
The two suspects, Ibrahim Hussein Adbel Hadi Eidarous, 42, and
Adil Muhammad Abdul al-Majid Bari, 39, were arrested by Scotland
Yard Sunday after receiving extradition warrants from the United
States.
</P>
<P>
Their appearance before London's Bow Street Magistrates Court
Monday is believed to be the beginning of a legal process which
the U.S. hopes will lead to the extradition.
</P>
<P>
The Americans have made it clear that they believe the two men
were part of a conspiracy to murder on the attacks over the U.S.
embassies on August 7, 1998, which killed at least 215 people in
Nairobi and 11 in Dar es Salaam.
</P>
<P>
U.S. extradition warrants allege that the two Egyptians
conspired with Islamic militant Osama bin Laden to murder American
nationals.
</P>
<P>
Bin Laden, a Saudi dissident, is at the top of the FBI's wanted
list. He is believed to be coordinating militant Islamic groups
who have dedicated themselves to waging a holy war against
Americans.
</P>
<P>
Prosecuting lawyer Arvinder Sambei, representing the U.S.
government, said both Eidarous and Bary had handled documents
claiming responsibility for the bombings and that both were found
in possession of false passports.
</P>
<P>
Both men were silent in court but their British lawyers denied
they were involved in the attacks, saying the case is "a cocktail
of surmise and sensationalized hypothesis."

<HEADLINE> Chinese Aid Materials for Yugoslavia Reach Romanian Port </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, July 12 (Xinhua)-- Three batches of Chinese aid
materials, worth of 10 million yuan (1.1 million U.S. dollars),
have reached the Romanian port city of Constanta on the last-leg
of shipment to the Yugoslav capital Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
The Romanian Red Cross Society (RRCS), which will be
responsible for the railway transport of those goods provided by
its Chinese counterpart, held a grand reception ceremony in
Constanta on Monday, said reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
While praising both the Chinese and Yugoslav peoples as the
friends of his people, Dumitru Toma, secretary-general of the
Constanta office of the RRCS, promised in the ceremony to quickly
and safely convey this batch of medicine, food and tents to the
destination.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslav Counselor to Romania Dragan Rkovic thanked China for
providing large amount of medicine to his country. Most Yugoslav
pharmaceutical firms, which were severely damaged by the NATO
bombing, would take time to recover and China's aid at this time
was especially precious, he added.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Chinese Consul-General to Constanta Chen
Guangzhong hoped the Yugoslav people would unite together to
rebuild their country
</P>
<P>
During the NATO airstrikes against Yugoslavia, the Chinese Red
Cross Society airlifted a batch of blood products to Yugoslavia
via Romania.

<HEADLINE> Over 400,000 Somalis Facing Starvation: FAO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 12 (Xinhua) -- More than one million people in
Somalia are facing serious food shortages, with over 400,000 at
risk of starvation, the United Nations Food and Agriculture
Organization (FAO) said in a press release available here Monday.
</P>
<P>
In a special report released in Italian capital Rome Monday,
the FAO said the food outlook in Somalia in 1999 is extremely
grim.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. organization attributed the famine condition in the
Horn of Africa country to insufficient rains, unusually hot
weather, the long- lasting civil war and uncontrolled crop pests
and diseases.
</P>
<P>
The rain season starting last April has largely failed, the FAO
said, adding that intensified fighting between different factions
has aggravated the situation.
</P>
<P>
Factional fighting and insecurity have not only curtailed
commercial and economic activities, but also forced large numbers
of people to move in search for food and safety, it noted.
</P>
<P>
Malnutrition is reported to high and increasing. The already
precarious food supply situation is expected to worsen in the
coming months with renewed fighting in some areas and more
population displacement.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that some 70,000 people have been displaced by
food shortages and insecurity, the FAO said in its report.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. organization has estimated that the total emergency
food aid requirements stand at 52,000 tons for 1998/99 ending in
July this year.
</P>
<P>
Some one quarter of the requirements has been delivered, it
added.

<HEADLINE> Pak Urges Int'l Community to Help Settle Kashmir Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan Monday said now the
ball is in the court of international community which should press
New Delhi for an "expeditious political settlement" of the Kashmir
dispute.
</P>
<P>
Pakistani Foreign Office spokesman Tariq Altaf told a news
briefing that now that the Mujahideen (freedom fighters) have
decided to "disengage" in Kargil, the international community has
an opportunity to press for an expeditious political settlement of
the dispute for which dialogue should be resumed "as quickly as
possible".
</P>
<P>
"The ball is in the court of international community - the
responsibility to address the Kashmir dispute is universal so that
a Kargil-like situation does not reappear," he said.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan, he said, has been calling for dialogue to address the
Kashmir issue and the international community "should use its
influence and bring New Delhi to negotiating table for settlement
of the dispute".
</P>
<P>
The spokesman referred to U.S. President Bill Clinton's
commitment and "personal interest" in the intensification of the
efforts and the process of dialogue for resolution of the issue.
</P>
<P>
He said this Kargil episode has made the larger issue of
Kashmir dispute very clearly visible on the international horizon.
</P>
<P>
"The Mujahideen's cause has been very widely publicized and it
has been understood that this dispute should be resolved if we
wish to see peace and security in the region," he asserted.

<HEADLINE> Latvian President Urged to Block Language Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Eighteen Latvian public
associations, mostly ethnic Slavs, Monday urged President Vaira
Vike-Freiberga not to sign into law a controversial bill on an
official language passed by parliament last week.
</P>
<P>
The bill, if not revised, would fan the flames of ethnic strife
and would be "dangerous for the state and society," the groups
said in an appeal published in Riga, the Latvian capital.
</P>
<P>
The signatories of the appeal included the Russian Community of
Latvia, the Baltic-Slav Society, the Human Rights Committee, the
War Veterans' Organization of Latvia, the Ukrainian Union of
Latvia, the Promen Belarussian Society and the Armenian Society of
Latvia, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The Latvian parliament Thursday passed a bill mandating the use
of the Latvian language at most public functions and in business,
even those involving only Russian speakers, who account for 40
percent of the population.
</P>
<P>
Russia reacted immediately after the draft law was passed,
condemning it as "openly discriminatory" and complaining to the
Council of Europe and the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe.
</P>
<P>
Council of Europe Secretary-General Daniel Tarschys said the
draft law failed to comply with Latvia's international
commitments, while the European Commission warned that the
proposed law might prevent the European Union from starting
accession talks with Latvia.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Latvia's New Party also urged President
Vike-Freiberga not to endorse the controversial draft law and
asked her to return the draft to parliament for reconsideration,
</P>
<P>
"The New Party maintains that the law passed is imperfect,
clearly politicized and fails to meet the interests of Latvian
society or the strategic interests of the country," the party said
in an appeal.
</P>
<P>
Vike-Freiberga plans intensive talks with various parties until
Thursday, after which she will make up her mind, Interfax said.
</P>
<P>
The New Party, which came up with a case against the planned
law when parliament was still debating it, had particularly strong
objections to a provision that would ban the use of any language
other than Latvian at public events.
</P>
<P>
The party also had fears about proposed language restrictions
for private business.

<P>
ALGIERS, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Algerian President Abdelaziz
Bouteflika said here Monday afternoon that ravaging conflicts
would exert in-depth implications on society and therefore called
for stability and security in Africa.
</P>
<P>
In a speech delivered after he was elected chairman of the
Organization of African Unity (OAU) at the opening ceremony of the
35th OAU summit, he said the impact of persistent conflicts on
inter-African relations and particularly on the fate of thousands
of displaced people is politically unacceptable and morally
unbearable.
</P>
<P>
"This is unacceptable because such a situation does not emanate
from fatality," he said.
</P>
<P>
"In truth, this problem of conflicts, because of its acuteness
and persistence, refers basically to the problem of collective
security in Africa," Bouteflika added.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that attention should be focused on the
strengthening of a set of doctrines capable of harmonizing the
concepts, at the African level and in relation with the United
Nations as the main organ responsible for peacekeeping and
security in the world.
</P>
<P>
A genuine policy of conflict prevention and overall recovery of
the continent depends greatly on the pursuit and intensification
of efforts for economic development and integration at the
regional and continental levels, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Burteflika was elected President of Algeria in April this year
and will take up a one-year rotating chairmanship of Africa's
biggest organization.

<HEADLINE> Kashmir Issue Effectively Internationalized: Sharif </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif said Monday the Kashmir freedom fighters' successes in
Kargil along the Line of Control and Pakistan's diplomatic
initiative have effectively internationalized the Kashmir issue.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the nation over radio and television Monday night,
Sharif said that the Mujahideen (freedom fighters)'s capture of
Kargil along the Line of Control (LoC) was basically to draw the
world's attention to the Kashmir issue.
</P>
<P>
He made it clear that the appeal by the Pakistani government to
the Mujahideen to disengage from the Kargil heights is not a
defeat.
</P>
<P>
The Mujahideen had a complete success in their mission, Sharif
said, adding that "they gave practical form to our stand that
Kashmir is a nuclear flash point."
</P>
<P>
He said that the Kashmir movement would continue and would meet
its logical conclusion of freedom. "The Kashmir movement will
continue with more vigor, and Kargil is a significant pause in the
struggle for Kashmir," he added.
</P>
<P>
"The Mujahideen by vacating the heights have produced an
opportunity to resolve the Kashmir issue bilaterally with the
interest and pressure of world powers," said Sharif.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan, he said, had given diplomacy another chance despite
India's "belligerent and aggressive action" along the Line of
Control in Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
"Our diplomacy was not based on rashness, and our initiative
was not taken under any pressure or confusion," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the latest visit to Pakistan by U.S. General
Anthony Zinni, Sharif said Pakistan made it clear to the United
States that Kargil was not an isolated episode, it was part of the
larger Kashmir issue.
</P>
<P>
On his visit to the United States last week, Sharif said the
U.S. government saw reason in Pakistan's stand. U.S. President
Bill Clinton admitted that Kashmir was the main issue affecting
peace and security in the region.
</P>
<P>
"Unless the Kashmir issue is resolved, South Asia will continue
to face the danger of war," said Sharif.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the joint statement issued after his talks with
Clinton, Sharif said that with normalcy at the LoC, Pakistan and
India would start bilateral talks on all outstanding issues
including the Kashmir dispute.
</P>
<P>
Sharif noted that Clinton also assured to take "personal
interest" in resolving the Kashmir issue. "This assurance was
unprecedented," he added.

<HEADLINE> German FM, Greek leaders Meet in Athens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, July 12 (Xinhua) -- German Foreign Minister Joschka
Fischer held talks here Monday with Greek leaders on the Balkan
reconstruction, relations between the European Union (EU) and
Turkey as well as Greek-Turkish ties, and the latest developments
in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Fischer, who arrived here Monday for a visit, met with Greek
Prime Minister Costas Simitis, Parliament President Apostolos
Kaklamanis and his Greek counterpart, George Papandreou.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after the talks, Fischer stressed that Thessaloniki,
the largest city in northern Greece, must be the seat of the
agency for the reconstruction of the Balkans. The decision made by
the EU leaders in Rio de Janeiro must be respected because the EU
believes that Greece could play a significant role in the
reconstruction of the Balkans, he said.
</P>
<P>
The EU leaders decided in late June to base its agency for the
Balkan reconstruction in the northern Greek port city of
Thessaloniki, but certain European countries are now trying to
move the agency to Pristina, capital of the Yugoslav province of
Kosovo. Greece has expressed its hope that the EU will not change
its decision, and said that it will respond in a convincing manner
to those opposed to the choice of Thessaloniki.
</P>
<P>
The German minister praised Greece for its effective
contribution to the positive conclusion of the crisis in Kosovo
and its constructive role in the stability pact reached for the
region.
</P>
<P>
As for the EU's ties with Turkey, Fischer said that Turkey must
get closer to the EU by making significant steps of progress in
the sector of human rights.
</P>
<P>
There could be no such rapprochement for as long as the death
penalty is implemented in the country, he added.
</P>
<P>
On the relations between Greece and Turkey, Fischer hailed the
initiative for the talks between Papandreou and his Turkish
counterpart, Ismail Cem, in New York, saying that it gave hope for
the future in their bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
He also backed Cyprus' efforts to join the EU, and said that
the island's steady course toward its accession into the EU must
continue.

SEOUL, July 12 (Xinhua) -- FIFA vice president Chung Mong-joon
said Monday the "best way" to solve the conflict between his world
soccer governing body and the Asian Football Confederation (AFC)
was that South America gives up half a berth for the 2002 World

Chung, also chairman of the South Korea Football Association,

berth.
</P>
<P>
This was a unanimous conclusion reached by the 43 members in
AFC, who had 4.5 berths for the finals after European soccer body
UEFA offered half a berth, Chung added.
</P>
<P>
Chung said he had informed FIFA of the AFC position, warning
that AFC may not take part in the World Cup draw slated for
December in Japan if FIFA rejects the proposal.

<HEADLINE> Belgrade Demands Respect for Sovereignty, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslavia Monday urged the
U.N. mission (UNMIK) and international peacekeepers (KFOR) in
Kosovo, the Serbian province, to fully respect the sovereignty and
territorial integrity of the Balkan country.
</P>
<P>
This aims to create a safe environment for the multi-ethnic
society and set up an interim transitional administration in
Kosovo under relevant Security Council resolution, it said.
</P>
<P>
In his letter to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, Yugoslav
Foreign Minister Zivadin Jovanovic said, "I should like to
underscore once gain the important need for KOFR and UNMIK, in the
performance of their mandates, fully to abide by the principle of
the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Federal Republic
of Yugoslavia."
</P>
<P>
He also called upon the U.N.-sanctions military and civilian
units in Kosovo to show "respect for, and the unity of, the legal,
economic and monetary institutions of the Republic of Serbia and
those of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia."
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister also denounced a "document" signed in
Pristina, provincial capital of Kosovo, on July 2, "under the
auspices of UNMIK and KFOR."
</P>
<P>
The "document" was singed by Bishop Artemije and Momcilo
Trajkovic, and by one of the leaders of "the Kosova Liberation
Army," the separatist and terrorist organization, Hashim Tachi,
Jovanovic said.
</P>
<P>
The "Joint Statement" was signed by the alleged
"representatives fo the Serbian people" who "were really not
elected, and therefore they do not enjoy legitimacy, and cannot
either represent or make undertakings on behalf of anyone but
themselves," said the foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
"United Nations representatives in Kosovo and Metohija do not
have the powers to choose or proclaim arbitrarily Serb or other
representatives of any national community, and to promote them as
participant of the political process," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Providing sponsorship for these and similar activities by the
United Nations mission (UNMIK, KFOR) is therefore in contravention
of the letter and spirit of Security Council Resolution 1244
(1999), and it represents an attempt to manipulate the sentiments
and interests of Serbs in the province of Kosovo," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the foreign minister asked Annan to take steps,
according to relevant Security Council resolutions, to ensure the
full compliance with the Security Council resolution, especially
with regard to guarantee of a safe environment and full protection
of citizens and their property, and an end to terrorist acts such
as daily murders and kidnapping of civilians, burning of homes and
entire villages, destruction of Serbian medieval monasteries and
cultural sites.
</P>
<P>
He also demanded respect for the laws and principles of the
State governed by the rule of law by everyone, in accordance with
the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Yugoslavia.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Troops to Withdraw Soon From DRC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 12 (Xinhua) -- The withdrawal of Zimbabwean troops
from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) is expected to start
within the next three to four months, following the signing of a
ceasefire agreement signaling the end of the 11-month war in that
country.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwean Defense Minister Moven Mahachi told the Zimbabwe
News Agency here Monday that the peacekeeping forces from the
Organization of African Unity (OAU) and the United Nations (UN)
would have been deployed to the DRC by November this year.
</P>
<P>
Ideally, he said they wanted at least 30,000 peacekeeping
troops deployed to enforce any truce and police the peacekeeping
process. But Zimbabwe would not be sending any troops for the
peacekeeping process.
</P>
<P>
"Yes, our troops will be coming home. The ceasefire agreement
entails a period of three to four months. We think that within
the next three to four months they will be able to come home. The
reason for allowing this period is that we can not leave a
vacuum," Mahachi said.
</P>
<P>
However, Mahachi could not specify how many Zimbabwean soldiers
were deployed in the DRC for security reasons.
</P>
<P>
"We have never wanted to disclose but when the actual
withdrawal starts, we will reveal the figures," he said.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe, together with Chad, Namibia and Angola, deployed
troops to the DRC when Tutsi rebels backed by Uganda and Rwanda
launched an attack on DRC President Laurent Kabila's forces in
August last year.
</P>
<P>
Mahachi said his ministry was in the process of submitting
names of missing persons who might have been captured to the
International Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement signed in Zambian capital Lusaka Saturday
evening, hostages should be released by Wednesday, and OAU
observers were expected on the ground within 15 days from the
signing and exchange of prisoners of war to take place within 30
days.
</P>
<P>
Asked how effective the agreement was without the signatures of
the rebels, Mahachi said all the rebels had accepted the peace
accord.
</P>
<P>
"The delay does not mean that they disagree with the ceasefire
agreement.
</P>
<P>
It was a problem of who should sign. We are not hoping for the
worst," he said.

<P>
HARARE, July 12 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government will have
 resettled 616 families on prime agricultural land by the end of
August this year, as the country continues its land reform
program, a top government official said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Joseph Msika, national chairman of the Land Reform and

<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, July 12 (Xinhua) -- The parliaments of the Community of
 Portuguese-Speaking Countries opened its second forum here Monday
 with all seven speakers advocating the establishment of a
communication network to enhance ties among them.
</P>
<P>
Almeida Santos, speaker of Portuguese parliament and executive
chairman of the forum, said at the opening ceremony that the
parliaments of the Portuguese-speaking countries should not only
strengthen exchanges in information and experience among
themselves, but also expand relations with parliaments of other
countries.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the parliaments of the community, which groups
Mozambique, Angola, Cape Verde, Guinea Bissau, Sao tome &AMP;
Principe, Portugal and Brazil, should take advantage of new
technologies to reinforce their democratic systems.
</P>
<P>
The two-day meeting aims to exchange information and
experiences among parliaments of member states and discuss
parliament's role in future democratic system.
</P>
<P>
One of the other major goal of the forum is to discuss the
challenges facing the parliaments in the globalization process.
</P>
<P>
The Parliament Forum of the Community of Portuguese-Speaking
Countries was established in Portugal in 1998. On the same year,

<HEADLINE> 14 Islamic Militants Go on Trial in Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 12 (Xinhua) -- An Egyptian court on Monday began
the trial on 14 terrorist suspects, including three minors, for
the killing of policemen and Egypt's Coptic Christians.
</P>
<P>
The hearing in the State Security Court in Cairo was procedural
and the court adjourned the trial until October 11 for further
preparations, the country's Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
They are charged with killing nine policemen and Coptic
Christians, robbing banks and jewelry shops in four southern
governorates in 1995-97.
</P>
<P>
Their secondary charges include membership in an outlawed
insurgency group and sheltering extremists. The news agency did
not specify the name of the group.
</P>
<P>
Egypt usually slaps harsh punishment on Islamic militants. If
convicted, the defendants will face a maximum penalty of death.
</P>
<P>
The minors, who are aged between 15 to 17, will face a maximum
of 15 years' imprisonment, if convicted. They would serve their
first year in a juvenile correction facility until they become of
age.
</P>
<P>
Muslim extremists launched an insurrection in 1992 in an
attempt to overthrow Egypt's secular government and replace it
with strict Islamic rule. At least 1,200 people, mainly policemen
and Islamic militants, have died in the campaign.

<HEADLINE> France, Iraq Hold Talks on Proposal to U.N. Council </HEADLINE>

<P>
PARIS, July 12 (Xinhua) -- French and Iraqi officials have been
holding talks in Baghdad, New York and Paris on a French proposal
for lifting economic sanctions on Baghdad, which Paris plans to
present to the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
Agence France-Presse quoted the chief of the French section of
interests in Baghdad, Andre Janier, as saying that the talks with
Iraqi officials have been constructive and positive.
</P>
<P>
"We talk with the Iraqi authorities each day on the subject of
French ideas, either in Baghdad, or with the Iraqi diplomats in
Paris, or in New York through contacts of French and Iraqi
diplomats," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that France wishes to take into account all the
positive elements in the British proposal and the Russian proposal
on Iraq, so that all the members of the U.N. Security Council can
accept it.
</P>
<P>
The French diplomat estimated that the U.N. Security Council
has "attained an impasse" over Iraq.
</P>
<P>
It is only through dialogue between different member countries
of the Council can a solution be found, he said.
</P>
<P>
The British proposal includes a 120-day renewable suspension of
the embargo on Iraqi exports, if the Iraqi government meets its
commitment on disarmament.
</P>
<P>
The French proposal includes a 100-day renewable suspension of
embargo on both exports and imports by Iraq, and the establishment
of a new regime of supervision of Iraqi armament to replace the
U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM).

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Willing to Join UN Peacekeeping Force in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian Foreign Minister
Jakaya Kikwete said here Monday that his country will be ready to
take part in the United Nations peacekeeping force in the
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) if asked to do so.
</P>
<P>
Kikwete, who has just returned from DRC peace talks in Lusaka,
Zambia, told a press conference that the UN peacekeeping force
will be arriving in DRC in six months, and a team of observers
consisted of the UN and the Organization of African Unity (OAU)
personnel will be formed.
</P>
<P>
He said the negotiation team in Lusaka resolved that Zambian
President Frederick Chiluba, who is the mediator of the DRC peace
talks, should go to Boma and Kisangani in the vast central African
nation on his return from the on-going OAU summit in Algiers,
Algeria, to get the two rebel leaders to be represented by a
single signatory.
</P>
<P>
On refugees, Kikwete said arrangements will be made to
facilitate their return to their homeland except those who have
valid reasons for continued stay.
</P>
<P>
Six African countries involved in the DRC conflicts signed a
peace deal in Lusaka Saturday to end their confrontation since DRC
rebels took up arms

against President Laurent Kabila last August.
</P>
<P>
However, the rebels have not inked the agreement as leaders of
two factions, Emile Ilunga of the Congolese Liberation Movement,
and Congolese Rally for Democracy's Ernest Wamba dia Wamba, have
both claimed the right to sign for the rebel side.

<P>
ABU DHABI, July 12 (Xinhua) -- The United Arab Emirates (UAE)
is among countries that perform best in human development,
according to a United Nations report released on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The report assessed the quality of life in 174 countries based
on real income, life expectancy and educational standards, and it
divided the countries into three lists based on the rich and poor
quality of life, the official WAM news agency said.
</P>
<P>
The UAE, ranked 43, was put in the first list which realized a
high record in human development, the agency said, adding that
other Gulf countries in the first list included Kuwait, Bahrain
and Qatar.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia and Oman came in the second list which comprised
95 countries including Arab countries such as Libya, Lebanon,
Jordan, Syria, Egypt and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Sudan and Yemen came in the third list which included 35
countries of low development.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. report said that the increasing trend toward
globalization did not have to be a bad thing provided governments
took into account more than just trade issues when they were
considering international policy.
</P>
<P>
The aim is to put human concerns at the center of the
globalization debate, to focus on the global interdependence of
people and not just of financial flows, WAM quoted the report
as saying.

<HEADLINE> Gore Announces Anti-crime Agenda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 12 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Vice President Al Gore
Monday proposed photo licenses for all new handgun owners while
announcing a broad anti-crime agenda.
</P>
<P>
Crime had dropped across the nation since President Clinton's
anti-crime bill was passed, but those measures were only the
beginning, Gore said in a speech at the Boston Police Department.
</P>
<P>
Gore, the Democratic presidential front-runner, proposed
tougher penalties for those who commit crimes in front of
children, for repeat drug abusers and for those who commit hate
crimes, calling on Congress to pass the Hate Crimes Prevention
Act.
</P>
<P>
School shootings this year in Colorado and Georgia, have turned
gun control into a major issue in the 2000 presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
"I will insist on a policy of zero tolerance toward guns and
drugs in our schools," he said.
</P>
<P>
Cheap, easily concealed handguns, known as "junk guns" or
"Saturday night specials," would be banned under his proposal.
</P>
<P>
Gore said if he was elected as president he would oppose any
effort to loosen federal restrictions on concealed weapon and
fight any attempt to give the gun makers special legal protection.
</P>
<P>
"I make this pledge today," Gore said. "If the people of this
country entrust me with the presidency, I will fight to protect
American families by launching the most effective and
comprehensive anti-crime strategy our nation has ever seen."
</P>
<P>
Gore said earlier that he supports raising the age for handgun
possession from 18 to 21; barring juveniles from possessing
assault weapons or large-capacity ammunition clips; imposing new
penalties for adults who sell guns to minors; and requiring safety
locks on guns.
</P>
<P>
As vice president, Gore cast the tie-breaking vote in the
Senate earlier this year in favor of a bill that would have
required a three-day check period for purchase of a gun at a gun
show and safety locks on firearms. The measure was ultimately
defeated in the House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
Gore's anti-crime package also includes a "Stay Clean to Stay
Out" policy that says defendants in drug-related crimes who are
awaiting trial must get off drugs to stay out of jail.
</P>
<P>
He suggested increasing use of computers in law enforcement,
investing in software that community police could use to map and
target high-crime areas.
</P>
<P>
Other features of the anti-crime package include establishment
of "gang-free zones," more aid for professional development and
retraining of police officers and increased spending on
after-school programs for youths and anti-drug efforts.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 12 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Security
Council on Monday urged rebel leaders in the Democratic Republic
of Congo to sign the cease-fire agreement as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Council members "strongly" urged them to resolve differences
and sign the pact, council president Malaysia's Agam Hasmy said in
a press statement after the council met on the matter.
</P>
<P>
While expressing their dismay at the rebel leaders' move, the
15 council members emphasized that earnest efforts to find a
peaceful solution to the conflict in D.R. Congo "should not be
held hostage to the internal division among the rebels".
</P>
<P>
"In this regard, they called upon the Governments of Rwanda and
Uganda and other governments who have influence, to make all the
necessary effort so that the rebel movements sign this agreement
and also for the rebel movements to abide by the cease-fire
pending their signature of the agreement," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Presidents of D.R. Congo, Namibia, Rwanda, Uganda, Zimbabwe and
the defense minister of Angola signed the agreement in Lusaka,
Zambia on Saturday, capping two weeks of hectic negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The six countries were involved in the one-year conflict in

<HEADLINE> Nigeria to Quicken Privatization Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABUJA, July 12 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government has set a
December deadline for the completion of the first phase of its
privatization program, Vice-President Abubakar Atiku said here
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The phase would affect government-owned companies involved in
banking, cement production and oil, Atiku told a meeting of the
30-member presidential consultative committee on the
rehabilitation of the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
"We would carry out the privatization without compromising
transparency," the vice-president said of the exercise which was
suspended by the former military government after allegations that
it was an opportunity to reward military officers and their
cronies.
</P>
<P>
He also said President Olusegun Obasanjo has set performance
targets for ministers, which focus on "institutional reforms and
policy areas", to evaluate them.
</P>
<P>
Atiku urged members of the committee to devise "ways to restore
the country's economy," which is grappling with an external debt
burden estimated at 30 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
"The ultimate test is how much empirical improvement we can
bring to the quality of life of the citizenry," he said of the
government whose campaign promise was to "make Nigeria great
again".
</P>
<P>
In another development, the vice-president announced Monday
that the country would set up a joint commission with South Africa
to coordinate economic transactions between them.
</P>
<P>
Atiku told a four-member South African delegation that
preliminary discussion on the commission was held with his South
African counterpart Jacob Zuma during the recent Southern African
Economic Summit.
</P>
<P>
He told the visiting delegation that Nigeria would invest in
the steel, telecommunications and gas sectors.
</P>
<P>
"Increased economic collaboration between both countries would
be to our mutual benefit," Atiku said.
</P>
<P>
"Our commitment to privatization should provide an opportunity
for South African companies to invest in our economy," he added.

<HEADLINE> Human Development Report 1999 Launched in 100 World </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 12 (Xinhua) -- The Human Development
Report 1999 is being launched Monday in Algiers, Beijing, London,
New York and 100 other world capitals.
</P>
<P>
The 10th in an annual series prepared by an independent team of
experts commissioned by the U.N. Development Program (UNDP), this
year's report is on the theme "Globalization with a Human Face."
</P>
<P>
The report argued that the benefits of globalization are not
shared equitably. For instance, 85 percent of the foreign direct
investment in developing and transition countries in the 1990s
went to only 20 countries and industrialized countries hold 97
percent of all patents worldwide.
</P>
<P>
The report also found that the largest single export industry
in the United States is not aircraft or automobiles, but
entertainment, which grossed more than 30 billion U.S. dollars for
Hollywood in 1997.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, globalization can enrich the lives of
people everywhere, but only when rules and institutions exist for
stronger, more representative governance that allows for
opportunities to be captured more equitably.
</P>
<P>
Every year since 1990, the UNDP has commissioned the Human
Report by an independent team of experts to explore major issues
of global concern.
</P>
<P>
The report looks beyond per capita incomes as a measure of
human progress by also assessing it against such factors as
average life expectancy, literacy and overall well-being. It
argues that human development is ultimately "a process of
enlarging people's choices."
</P>
<P>
This year's report focuses on the positive and negative aspects
of globalization. It argues that while many millions of people are
being further marginalized by their lack of access to new
technologies, including the Internet, growing inequalities are not
inevitable.
</P>
<P>
The report recommends, among other things, stronger social
policies and actions to buffer the effects of today's "bust and
boom" economy. It urges policy-makers to balance their concern for
profits with concern for people disenfranchised by the turmoil of
the global marketplace.

<HEADLINE> Year 2000 Proposed as Year of Peace for Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALGIERS, July 12 (Xinhua) -- The year 2000 was proposed here
Monday afternoon by Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo as the
Year of Peace and Security in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening ceremony of the three-day 35th summit
of the Organization of African Unity, Obasanjo said: "I see the
beginning of a new dawn of hope and prosperity for Africa."
</P>
<P>
The goal for the peace year, Obasanjo said, is to see an Africa
that is at peace with itself and is able to compete on equal
footing with other regions in an "increasingly globalizing and
borderless world."
</P>
<P>
The need for security and stability is a prerequisite for
development and progress, he said.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo expressed his gratitude to those who worked to achieve
the recently-concluded peace agreements on Sierra Leone and on the
Democratic Republic of Congo, where armed conflicts have brought
Africa under world attention for war and instability.
</P>
<P>
The peace agreements, he said, are a result of their tireless
efforts and staunch belief in the priceless advantage of peace in
places where the citizens can look forward to a life free of
hostilities.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo said that with the completion of the process of
decolonization, Africans have the historic opportunity to forge
the future of their continent in terms of economic and social
development.

<HEADLINE> Three U.S. Hospital Deaths Tied to Respiratory Disease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 12 (Xinhua) -- A hot-water tank at Harford
Memorial Hospital in Maryland State of the United States is the
likely cause of an outbreak of Legionnaires' disease that has
killed three elderly patients and sickened two others, said
reports reaching here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The latest fatality was a patient in the hospital June 18-28,
before health officials discovered the bacteria there, the reports
quoted hospital spokesman Robert Netherland as saying.
</P>
<P>
The man, whose name was not released, was readmitted to the
hospital last Friday and died that evening. Test results came back
last Saturday confirming he had the bacteria that causes
Legionnaires' disease.
</P>
<P>
Another unidentified patient died June 26, and Elizabeth M.
Cox, 79, died last Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Officials believe a hot water tank at the hospital was the
probable source of the bacteria. Water samples taken from the tank
and pipes tested positive for the bacteria.
</P>
<P>
Health officials said last Friday that additional cases were
possible because the incubation period for the disease is two to
10 days.
</P>
<P>
The hospital has been calling more than 400 recent patients to
ask them about symptoms and offer free testing if needed.
</P>
<P>
Legionnaires' is a form of pneumonia caused by a common
bacteria often found in air conditioning cooling towers, water
tanks, whirlpool spas and humidifiers. The disease takes its name
from a deadly outbreak at the Pennsylvania American Legion
convention held in Philadelphia in July 1976.

<HEADLINE> Australian Leader Says "Unhappy" over U.S. restriction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Australian Prime Minister John
Howard expressed unhappiness on Monday to U.S. President Bill
Clinton over U.S. restriction of lamb imports from this Ocean
country.
</P>
<P>
Howard held a one-to-one meeting with Clinton at the White
House, mainly discussing the issue of Washington limiting lamb
imports from Australia.
</P>
<P>
"I made it plain to him (Clinton) that that issue caused a
greater adverse reaction in Australia on a trade matter than any
other trade issue that I could remember," Howard told reporters
after his talks with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
The United States on Wednesday took steps to limit lamb
imports and imposed tariffs after U.S. ranchers complained that
surging shipments of Australian and New Zealand lamb were
driving them out of business.
</P>
<P>
The White House said in a statement that lamb imports will be
limited to the amount bought in 1998, or 31,851 metric tons, and
will be subject to a 9 percent tariff for the first year. The
measures will be enforced from July 22.
</P>
<P>
Both Australia and New Zealand, whose farmers produce about
95 percent of all lamb imported by the United States, have
strongly objected to any import restrictions.
</P>
<P>
Howard said the Australians "are very unhappy; very, very
unhappy."
</P>
<P>
"We made it very plain that the thing that particularly upset
us was the imposition of a tariff on the in-quota area," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Howard, who is here on a working visit, said he had told
Clinton that Australia would "pursue our remedies in the World
Trade Organization."
</P>
<P>
Howard came to Washington to discuss issues on security,
economy and trade between the two countries, but Australia's
anger over lamb import limit put a damper on the talks.

<HEADLINE> SADC Seeks Extension of EU Trade Concessions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Trade officials from the
14-nation Southern African Development Community (SADC) Monday
called for the European Union (EU) trade concessions for the
region to be extended by another 10 years.
</P>
<P>
The trade officials are holding a two-day meeting in Botswanan
capital Gaborone to make preparations for a meeting of trade
ministers on a free trade agreement in the region, Agence France
Presse (AFP) reported.
</P>
<P>
"The member states seek a waiver from the WTO (World Trade
 Organization) on the current trade arrangement to be continued
for  another 10 years," SADC Chief Economist Chingu Mwila was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
"But the EU says the trade preferences could only be continued
for another five years," Mwila said.
</P>
<P>
"The main reason why the SADC member states want a 10-year
waiver is that they still want to restructure their economies
before any reciprocal arrangement could be entered into," he said.
</P>
<P>
The concessions were granted in terms of the Lome Convention's
provisions granted to African, Caribbean and Pacific countries,
due to expire next year.
</P>
<P>
"The fear is that regional industries across the board would
not compete favorably with those from EU," Mwila said.
</P>
<P>
He said the recommendation will be taken to the ministerial
meeting scheduled for Gaborone Wednesday. It will also be
presented to the WTO ministerial conference to be held in the
United States next year.
</P>
<P>
SADC trade officials are also expected to debate a free trade
agreement among countries in the southern Africa.
</P>
<P>
AFP quoted diplomatic sources as saying at the weekend that
member states agreed on the main principles of trade
liberalization, but officials were yet to reach consensus on
"finer details".
</P>
<P>
South African Trade and Industry Minister Alec Erwin last week
told a regional meeting of the World Economic Forum that the talks
were "well down the track."
</P>
<P>
Erwin said some aspects of an agreement could be implemented by
the beginning of the year 2000, but warned that the road ahead was
fraught with difficulty, given the growing trade imbalances that
exist between the 14 SADC states.
</P>
<P>
Inter-trade between SADC nations has risen from six percent to
20 percent since the democratization of South Africa in 1994.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that when parts of the protocol come into effect
early next year it will rise up to 35 percent.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Urged to Do More to Isolate Taliban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 12 (Xinhua) -- A group advocating closer
U.S.-Afghan relations on Monday urged President Bill Clinton take
more actions to isolate Afghanistan's Taliban movement besides
economic sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The Afghanistan Foundation said this should include reaching
out to political moderates of the country and establishing a
special U.S. envoy for the central Asian nation.
</P>
<P>
"It would be good if the president would take the lead on
this," said former House Representative Don Ritter, chairman of
the foundation.
</P>
<P>
Clinton last week issued an executive order imposing sanctions
on the Taliban movement for its protection to Saudi-born Osama bin
Laden who is alleged to be behind the bombing of two U.S.
embassies in Africa last August.
</P>
<P>
Ritter told a news conference that the sanctions, though
important, was mostly symbolic as the trade between U.S. and
Afghanistan last year was a relatively small $24 million.
</P>
<P>
He said the Clinton administration should do more to bring
international pressure to "weaken and transform the Taliban."
</P>
<P>
"If the administration does not, it would be appropriate for
Congress to take look at this," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the Taliban "must hand over or at very least expel"
bin Laden so that he could stand trial.

<HEADLINE> Worldwide System Management Software Market Climbing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Revenues in the worldwide
system management software market are steadily climbing, expecting
to reach 11.3 billion U.S. dollars this year, according to a
report released Monday.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, they rose 16 percent to 9.7 billion dollars, and by
2003, they will top 18 billion dollars, said the new report from
U.S. market research firm International Data Corporation (IDC).
</P>
<P>
The need to keep business-critical applications running at peak
efficiency and with high availability is driving demand for a wide
variety of system management tools, IDC said.
</P>
<P>
System management software manages computer systems in an
enterprise. Depending on an organizational philosophy, system
management may include network management or be a part of it.
</P>
<P>
According to IDC, U.S. vendors are benefiting the most from
this market's upswing. In 1998, their revenue growth was three
times larger than non-U.S. vendors'. U.S. companies increased
their revenues almost 18 percent to 8.7 billion dollars in 1998.
International vendors, on the other hand, increased their revenues
by less than six percent to 1.1 billion dollars. As a result, U.S.
companies accounted for a dominating 89 percent of the overall
market worldwide.
</P>
<P>
Storage management was the largest segment of the overall
system management software market with revenues of 2.67 billion,
reflecting the importance of data protection on all platforms.
Performance management was the second-largest segment with 2.28
billion dollars. The fastest-growing segment, however, will be
change and configuration management, earning a compound annual
growth rate of 22 percent from 1998 to 2003, IDC said.

<HEADLINE> Greece Criticizes Turkey for Statement on Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Greece Monday criticized
neighboring Turkey for a statement made by Prime Minister Bulent
Ecevit concerning the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press briefing, Greek government spokesman
Dimitris Reppas said that Ecevit's statements on Cyprus
constituted an unprecedented provocation to the international
community.
</P>
<P>
With his statements, the Turkish premier placed Turkey outside
the framework of international legality, he said, adding that his
claims ultimately achieved the exact opposite from the intended
result, confirming the provocative and aggressive character which,
in violation of any concept of law, characterized Turkey's policy.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish premier reportedly said Sunday that the Cyprus
problem ceased existing after the creation of the Turkish Cypriot
state and the entire world had to understand the reality of an
independent Turkish state on Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriots-controlled
south and the Turkish Cypriots-dominated north in 1974 when
Turkish troops landed on the island in the wake of a failed coup
seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
In 1983, the Turkish Cypriots proclaimed a breakaway Turkish
Republic of Northern Cyprus, which has been recognized only by
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The U.N.-sponsored talks between the two sides of the island
have failed to make any progress in finding an overall and lasting
solution to the division of Cyprus or toward reuniting it under a
federal system.

<HEADLINE> Landslide Kills 15 People in Western Romania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Fifteen people are reportedly
dead and dozens injured on Monday in a landslide caused by
torrential rain and floods at a dam in the Western Romania Retezat
Mountains.
</P>
<P>
On Monday morning, the upper waters of the Rau Mare river in
the western county of Hunedoara flooded the construction side of
the dam and weakened it by removing several rocks, then a wall of
mud and water hit the houses sheltering some 100 families employed
at the construction of the dam. The mud covered houses up to the
first floor, an eyewitness was reported as saying.
</P>
<P>
According to Nicolae Stanca, prefect of Hunedoara, 22 people
had been injured and 13 were reported missing. The rescue teams
reached the disaster area by helicopters and flew the injured
persons to hospitals.
</P>
<P>
The rescue teams tried to evacuate families out of the disaster
area, but some workers refused to leave saying they wanted to find
the missing ones.
</P>
<P>
Two school camps were also in the disaster area, but out of
danger. All measures for their being transferred to other similar
camps in the county were taken, authorities in charge reported.
</P>
<P>
In the latest 24 hours, storms and torrential rains flooded
thousands of houses and caused huge damages in western and central
Romania, when the southern and eastern Romania were still facing
the long-lasting heat wave which has killed at least 20 people.
</P>
<P>
Meteorologists are not announcing any weather improvement.
Moreover, they are saying that temperatures may increase by two or
three degrees and reach over 40 grades Celsius. Heavy rains and
storms may also occur any time.

UNITED NATIONS, July 12 (Xinhua) -- A United Nations
Development Program (UNDP)-supported project has developed a blood
transfusion device which can be used easily in medical emergencies
in developing countries, UNDP reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The new device called "EAT-SET" and invented by Nigerian
medical researcher Oviemo Ovadie allows for rapid recovery and
safe reinfusion of blood for patients with internal bleeding, the
organization said in its latest weekly UNDPFLASH.
</P>
<P>
The device, which can be operated manually and in rural ares
without sufficient electricity supply, offers developing countries
a low-cost alternative to expensive high-tech equipment used by
hospitals in the industrialized world, the weekly said.
</P>
<P>
UNDP said it helped the inventor acquire a patent and
intellectual property rights to the device which is already used
in several Nigerian Hospitals.

<HEADLINE> Russia, U.S. Settle Dispute on Steel Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Russia and the United States
reached a comprise Tuesday on the two countries' long-running
dispute over steel trade.
</P>
<P>
According to Russian Trade Minister Mikhail Fradkov, the two
sides signed two agreements earlier Tuesday, one suspending U.S.
anti-dumping investigations against Russian exporters of hot-
rolled steel, and the other setting quotas on Russian steel
exports to the United States during a five-year period.
</P>
<P>
In what Fradkov described as a compromise following lengthy
and complicated talks, the U.S. agreed to increase delivery quotas
by 30-40 percent as compared with the initial proposal.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Fradkov said, restrictions have been lifted on
Russian wire and instrument-quality steel and quotas raised for
stainless steel exports.
</P>
<P>
He said the agreements provide for regular consultations on
the possible revision of these decisions and that the next
consultations on Russian steel export terms will be held in
Washington at the end of July in the framework of talks between
Russian Prime Minister Sergei Stepashin and U.S. Vice President Al
Gore.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreements, Russia would be able to export 2.3
million tons of hot-rolled steel in 2000-2003 and 1.7 million tons
of cold-rolled steel in 1999-2003, worth a total of 1.2 billion U.
S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, exports of Russian zinc-plated steel will decrease
by 40,000 tons from the 1998 level, pig iron by 200,000 tons, hot-
and cold-rolled rods by 100,000 tons. The decreased export would
cost Russian producers 250 million dollars in five years.
</P>
<P>
However, the minister said, failure to reach a comprise could
cost Russia 1.5 billion dollars in the period.
</P>
<P>
Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin
meanwhile acknowledged that the package of Russian-U.S. agreements
do not fully meet Russian interests.
</P>
<P>
The agreement package "does not fully meet the interests of
the Russian metallurgical industry and contains several very tough
provisions for Russia."
</P>
<P>
"The recent problems with Russian exports to the U.S. have
largely been caused by the fact that under U.S. legislation Russia
does not have the status of a country with a market economy," the
Interfax news agency quoted Rakhmanin as saying.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said Moscow would "consistently and firmly work
for such a status, resolutely raising the question in our contacts
with Americans, including high level contacts."

MOSCOW, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Russia regrets that the
demilitarization of the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) is not
proceeding at a more rapid pace, spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin said
Tuesday.

"The contingents of the international peacekeeping forces in
Kosovo from NATO member nations are obviously not doing everything

Commenting on the latest opposition demonstrations in

interfere in this area of internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
"The main principle is non-interference in the affairs of
Yugoslavia," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
International efforts should be concentrated on rendering "
nondiscriminatory aid to the Yugoslav people to help stop the
grave economic and humanitarian crisis caused by three months of

<HEADLINE> Russia Voices Concern Over Latvian Language Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
MOSCOW, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Russia expressed "serious concern"
Tuesday on a language bill passed by the Latvian parliament last
week, saying it "would force minorities to assimilate rather than
integrate into society."
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin said the bill,
which cleared the Latvian parliament last Thursday, "fully ignores
all the proposals of lawmakers from national minorities,
disregards many recommendations" from the OSCE High Commissioner
for National Minorities Max van der Stoel, and strips the
languages of that country's ethnic minorities of "any legal status.
"
</P>
<P>
The bill mandates the use of the Latvian language at most
public functions and in business, even those involving only
Russian speakers, who account for 40 percent of the population.
</P>
<P>
The enactment of the bill with such wording would "force
minorities to assimilate rather than integrate into society,
strain relations between ethnic groups in Latvia, deal a tangible
blow to the improvement of Russian-Latvian relations, and throw a
challenge to the international community," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
He urged the Baltic country's leadership to "display state
wisdom and use its constitutional right" and return the bill to
parliament for revision.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, protests against the language law continued Tuesday
in Riga, the Latvian capital, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
About 100 people, with their mouth tied up with black bands,
were protesting outside the Presidential Palace, holding signs
such as "Language Dictatorship Leads to Kosovo," and "Integration -
Yes, Assimilation - No," Interfax said.
</P>
<P>
The protests came after an appeal Monday from 19 Latvian
public organizations, representing primarily Slavic nations, to
President Vaira Vike-Friberg to veto the legislation.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Media Continue Refuting Lee Teng-hui's Separatist Remarks ( 1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 13 (Xinhua) -- The official Chinese newspaper
People's Daily is to publish a commentator's article tomorrow to
refute Lee Teng-hui's long-standing intention to split China's
territorial integrity and sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
 Lee said on July 9 in an interview with a German radio
station that cross-straits relations should be defined as "state-
to-state or at least special state-to-state relations" and this
was echoed by other Taiwanese officials, who said that relations
between the Chinese mainland and Taiwan have developed from
relations between "two equal political entities" to relations
between "two states" and that cross-straits talks are "bilateral
talks between two states."
</P>
<P>
Those separatist remarks by the Taiwan authorities show their
intention of splitting China's territorial integrity and
sovereignty, the articles says.
</P>
<P>
In fact, it says, the essense of Lee's remarks is to
separate Taiwan from China and undermine the "one China" principle.
</P>
<P>
 The Taiwan authorities have long been carrying a policy of
creating "two Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan" or "the
independence of Taiwan". In the past several years, they had tried
different ways to make their separatist motive known, but Lee
still resorted to some disguises. By saying he was pursuing a "
divided China" and "seeking national reunification", he had
deceived the Chinese people including Taiwan compatriots and the
international community, the article says.
</P>
<P>
 But this time, Lee has torn off his masks and shown his
separatist intention clearly.

<TEXT>
<P>
The world knows that there is only one China and that Taiwan is
an inalienable part of the Chinese territory and sovereignty, the
article points out. It argues that, although Taiwan and the
mainland have yet to be reunified, the fact remains that Taiwan is
part of China and China has sovereignty over Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
 In the face of this fact, anyone having ulterior motives,
including Lee Teng-hui, is overestimating his own strength, like
an insect trying to dig up a tree, the commentator says.
</P>
<P>
 The reunification of the motherland is the sacred goal of
every nation in the world and China is no exception, the article
says. In China, where unity has been much valued, any attempt to
divide the country, block its reunification, or create obstacles
in the path of development of cross-straits relations is
traitorous and will be resolutely opposed to by all the Chinese
people, including Taiwan compatriots.
</P>
<P>
The commentator says that Taiwan compatriots, along with the
people of the motherland, are expecting an all-round development
of the cross-straits relations and increasing the pace of national
reunification, and those who challenge their efforts are doomed to
fail.
</P>
<P>
Those who act perversely against the will of the Chinese
people will be despised by history and be considered criminals by
the whole nation, the commentator warns.

Responding to a question on the fresh offer of dialogue made by
Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif Monday night, an External
Affairs Ministry spokesman said, "Our future dealings with
Pakistan will be governed by the sequence of steps already spelt
out."
</P>
<P>
He said that the first essential step was a "total clearing up"
of remnants of "armed intrusion and aggression."
</P>
<P>
"Till this is not completed to our satisfaction," he continued,
"no other steps will be taken."
</P>
<P>
After complete withdrawal, he said Pakistan would have to
reaffirm the inviolability and sanctity of the line of control
(LoC).
</P>
<P>
Pakistan, he indicated, would have to abandon encouraging and
abetting terrorism and "dismantle the entire network set up in
Pakistan territory for the purpose."
</P>
<P>
Maintaining that India's commitment to the Lahore process and
the composite dialogue remained, he said New Delhi "would like to
renew the dialogue process and expects that Pakistan will take the
needed steps for that to become possible."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Indian troops Tuesday inched towards the line of
control, overrunning the strategic Bajrang post, as operations
continued to flush our remaining Pakistani infiltrators in Kaksar,
Batalik and Drass sectors.
</P>
<P>
In the last 24 hours there was no artillery fire in Mukoh
valley and Kaksar areas.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: U.N. Report Sheds More Light on Globalization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Globalization, a dominant
force in the 21st century's last decade, is shaping a new era of
interaction among nations, economies and people, for better or for
worse.
</P>
<P>
A new report on human development, commissioned Monday by the
U.N. Development Program (UNDP), dwelled on the pros and cons of
globalization, characterized by the current "shrinking space,
shrinking time and disappearing borders."
</P>
<P>
More than 1.5 trillion U.S. dollars are now exchanged in the
world's currency markets each day, and nearly a fifth of the goods
and services produced each year are traded. However, globalization
is more than the flow of money and commodities.
</P>
<P>
While increasing interdependence among peoples and nations
worldwide, globalization is compounding the gap between rich and
poor nations and intensifying the Western dominance of the world's
economic and cultural markets.
</P>
<P>
Opening many opportunities for millions of people around the
world, globalization is creating new threats to human security --
in both rich and poor countries. In the globalization world of
shrinking space, shrinking time and disappearing borders, people
are confronting new threats to human security -- sudden and
hurtful disruptions in the pattern of daily life.
</P>
<P>
For example, globalization creates financial volatility and
economic insecurity, job and income insecurity, health and
cultural insecurity, personal and environmental insecurity, and
political instability.
</P>
<P>
However, poor countries are being growingly marginalized in the
process of globalization, which demands technological advancement
and quality governance. The report warned that the glaring,
growing inequalities in the distribution of wealth pose a
"dangerous polarization" between rich and poor countries.
</P>
<P>
Globalization, as it has been allowed to proceed so far, has
also been driving a deeper wedge between rich and poor countries,
and among people within countries. People in 85 countries are in
fact worse off in many respects than they were a decade ago. In
short, the world fails to share the benefit of globalization
equitably.
</P>
<P>
The 262-page report, the 10th such program since 1990,
concluded that the so-called "rules of globalization" should be
rewritten to save the 60 countries that are worse off than they
were in 1980 from falling even further behind.
</P>
<P>
The report recommended faster debt relief, redirection of aid
to the poorest countries and a task force to review "global
governance." It also endorsed a tax of one American cent on
lengthy E-mails to raise 70 billion U.S. dollars a year that could
be used to connect the world's people who cannot afford to pay the
access to Internet, the world's computing link-up.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the report urged a new vision for national and
international policymaking to balance concern for profits with
concern for people disenfranchised by the turmoil of today's
global market.
</P>
<P>
The report called for comprehensive approaches to global
threats to human security such as HIV/AIDS, international crime,
human rights abuses by multinational corporations and transborder
pollution such as acid rain.
</P>
<P>
The report called upon the world community to support the
development of technologies for the poor and build a more
representative and coherent system of global governance, to buffer
the effects of a "boom and bust" economy and address the needs of
the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
"The aim is to put human concerns at the center of the
globalization debate, to end the polarization between the
connected and unconnected, to focus on the global interdependence
of people and not just of financial flows -- to make globalization
work for people, not just for profits," Dr. Richard Jolly,
principal coordinator of the report, explained.

<HEADLINE> Lion's Share of Rebuilding Kosovo Fund Unclear At G7 Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Brussels, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Group of Seven (G7) finance
ministers and world financial representatives failed Tuesday to
find who will pay the lion's share of the international aid for
Kosovo reconstruction after a meeting here on a strategy for
rebuilding the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, entitled "High Level Steering Group on Economic
Reconstruction in the Balkans", will also focus on the evaluation
of economic consequences of the Kosovo war.
</P>
<P>
German Finance Minister Hans Eichel said that Europe would not
bear the rebuilding costs on its own in return for the United
States' having paid for the lion's share.
</P>
<P>
But he said the U.S. and Japan had agreed to pay part of the
aid bill for reviving Balkans economies affected by the war.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, World Bank President James Wolfensohn declared that
G7 countries agreed to supply only humanitarian aid to Yugoslavia,
but look for ways to support Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
"It was recognized that no assistance would be provided to the
former Republic of Yugoslavia other than humanitarian aid, which
would address the most urgent and essential human needs," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I think the issue in Kosovo is not just money...it's
reconstruction of the morale and spirit of people that have been
brutalized," he said.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the U.S. Secretary Lawrence Summers said
Washington would favor sending economic aid to Montenegro,
reiterating that Serbia would not receive a penny in aid as long
as President Slobodan Milosevic remained in power.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the European Union is talking of putting up about
510 million U.S. dollars for the Balkans reconstruction, while the
World Bank has said that it will commit 60 million U.S. dollars to
Kosovo at the this stage.
</P>
<P>
EU Officials confirmed that western governments and
international agencies were increasingly hopeful that the Kosovo
aid bill would be smaller than they originally estimated.

<HEADLINE> Ulster Unionists Table Amendments to N.Irish Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Ulster Unionists and the opposition
Conservatives Tuesday tabled several amendments to the Northern
Ireland arms and devolution bill being rushed through the British
Parliament.
</P>
<P>
The bill, to be debated later Tuesday before the House of
Commons, provides for a suspension of all institutions set up
under the Good Friday Agreement and a wholesale review if
decommissioning does not occur.
</P>
<P>
But Ulster Unionists and Conservatives said they are still
unhappy about the guarantees being offered about what will happen
if the Irish Republican Army fails to disarm.
</P>
<P>
What it lacks, the unionists argue, is a definite timetable for
the destruction of weapons stockpiles to take place and the
certainty the IRA's political wing, Sinn Fein, will be expelled
from the executive unless arms disposal starts on time.
</P>
<P>
Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble, who is also Northern
Ireland's first minister, is proposing the IRA be given four weeks
from the establishment of the executive to begin decommissioning.
</P>
<P>
The Conservatives also want an end to the early release of
paramilitary prisoners if the IRA fails to disarm, Conservative
leader William Hague has told the BBC.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Tony Blair, who has chosen a high-risk strategy
to get the executive in place by the weekend, Tuesday met John
Hume and Seamus Mallon, leaders of the moderate nationalist Social
Democratic and Labor Party (SDLP), ahead of the debate.
</P>
<P>
Blair wants the SDLP to help Trimble by making clear that they
would be prepared to continue in government without Sinn Fein
should it be excluded from the executive.
</P>
<P>
Dr Marjorie Mowlam, the Northern Ireland secretary, earlier
promised to study the amendments being tabled, but she also gave a
strong hint the government would force the bill through the
Commons using its parliamentary majority.

<HEADLINE> Russia Speeds Talks Over Space Launch From Kazakhstan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Sergei
Stepashin Tuesday dispatched his deputy, Igor Klebanov, to Astana
to negotiate with Kazakhstan to seek permission to launch a cargo
ship from the Baikonur cosmodrome to the Mir space station.
</P>
<P>
The trip was arranged following a telephone conversation
earlier Tuesday between Stepashin and Kazakh President Nursultan
Nazarbayev, the government information department said.
</P>
<P>
Klebanov has the mission of conducting talks to settle the
entire range of problems related to the operation of Baikonur, the
Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Kazakhstan suspended all launches from Baikonur in the wake of
last Tuesday's crash of a Russian booster rocket, which could have
unpredictable ecological consequences for the Central Asian
republic because 66 tons of fuel with toxic components was sprayed
over its territory.
</P>
<P>
Space officials warned that Russia's 136-ton Mir space station
may spin out of control and crash down to Earth if Kazakhstan does
not permit a cargo ship carrying critical supplies to blast off
from Baikonur by the end of the week.
</P>
<P>
Russia still plans to launch the Progress M-42 cargo craft from
the cosmodrome Wednesday to deliver control equipment that would
allow the station to be operated from the ground if its main
computer breaks down.
</P>
<P>
Kazakhstan has so far remained unwilling to lift the ban on all
Baikonur launches that it imposed after a Proton rocket crashed
into the Kazakh steppe on July 5.
</P>
<P>
"We will not lift the ban until at least preliminary results of
the Proton crash investigation are available," Nurlan Usimbayev,
deputy head of the Kazakhstan Aerospace Agency, said.
</P>
<P>
These results are expected only sometime next week, The Moscow
Times quoted officials as saying at the Khrunichev plant, the
makers of the Proton rocket.
</P>
<P>
If not carried out by Sunday, the launch of the Progress ship
would have to be postponed for another month, said Yury Koptev,
general director of the Russian Aviation and Space Agency.
</P>
<P>
This delay would leave Mir's three-man crew with too little
time to install and test the control equipment before they are
scheduled to leave the station on August 23, Koptev said.
</P>
<P>
"We are now trying to make our Kazakh colleagues understand
that the lack of such a launch will lead us to a situation where
it is equally possible that fragments (of Mir) will fall onto
heads in Kazakhstan and Russia... or any other country within the
range of 51 degrees of latitude," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Increased export of
agricultural produces in eastern Ethiopia has earned more than 670
million birr (about 83 million U.S. dollars) in hard currency for
the country in 1998/99.
</P>
<P>
The income earned in the past fiscal year ending on June
30,1999, exceeds that of the previous year by 57 percent, the
Ethiopian News Agency reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The stated sum of money was obtained from the export of coffee,
fruits, vegetables, corns and khat (a stimulant chewed as tea) to
the neighboring countries, Europe and the Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
The bulk of coffee went to Japan, Saudi Arabia, Britain and
Switzerland while a significant amount of khat, fruits, vegetables
and corns had been exported to Djibouti and Lebanon, according to
the Dire-Dawa Export Trade Branch Office.
</P>
<P>
Dire-Dawa, an eastern city and the second largest one of

<HEADLINE> Iran Blasts U.S. for Interference in Internal Affairs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Iran on Tuesday blasted the United
States for "interference" in its internal affairs as Iranian
students continued their protests against police crackdown on
students.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Ministry Spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi said that
the remarks by some U.S. officials on the recent Iranian police
crackdown on students are examples of their interference in Iran's
internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
Iran will never allow foreigners to exploit the internal issues
of Iran for political objectives, the Islamic Republic News Agency
(IRNA) quoted the spokesman as saying.
</P>
<P>
Iran, as an independent and free state, will uphold the rule of
law concerning the current events in Iran and will act with
transparency and according to law, said Asefi.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman's remarks came after a U.S. official said on
Monday that the recent student protests in Iran reflect an
intensifying struggle of those who support the moderate President
Mohammad Khatami for the future of the Iranian politics.
</P>
<P>
A U.S. State Department spokesman on Monday also called on
Iran to respect the international norm concerning protests and
demonstrations, reports reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Monday warned
the students that the "enemies" were behind the police assault on
the Tehran University dormitory on Thursday and Friday.
</P>
<P>
Condemning the unauthorized police assault as "unacceptable,"
Khamenei called on the students to "watch and identify the evil
hands of the enemies."
</P>
<P>
Following Khamenei's speech, Iran's conservative-dominated
police tightened their control on the streets leading to the
Tehran University where students gathered in the past five days to
protest the police crackdown on a student rally protesting the new
press law and the closure of the leading moderate daily Salam
(Hello).
</P>
<P>
Clashes were reported on Tuesday as thousands of students
intended to stage demonstrations in the Tehran University in
defiance of the ban on any illegal gatherings.
</P>
<P>
IRNA confirmed that clashes occurred between anti-riot police
and a group of "rioters who attempted to create tensions."
</P>
<P>
The police, armed with shields and batons, used tear gas to
disperse the "rioters who are believed to be backed by terrorist
groups and tried to create clashes with police," the agency said.
</P>
<P>
The police also blocked the streets leading to Tehran
University and a police helicopter was hovering overhead
broadcasting government announcements on loudspeakers that any
assembly or demonstration was unauthorized.
</P>
<P>
Eyewitnesses said that plainclothes policemen shot into the
air as street battles erupted between students and
policemen. Policemen fired tear gas to disperse students and
students hurled stones and clubs back.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Tehran main bazaar closed on Tuesday, the first
time in the six days of student protests.

<HEADLINE> Rebels Continue to Attack Govt Forces: DRC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 13 (Xinhua) -- President Laurent Kabila of the
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) said Tuesday that rebels
fighting to oust him are continuing attacking his government and
allied positions despite a peace agreement signed in Zambian
capital Lusaka last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"They (rebels) are still attacking us," Kabila told the
Zimbabwe News Agency after his meeting with Zimbabwean President
Robert Mugabe in Algiers where they are attending the on-going
35th summit of the Organization of African Unity (OAU).
</P>
<P>
"They attacked Belenge this morning and yesterday Kabinda," the
DRC president said, without giving details on casualties.
</P>
<P>
He noted that nothing on the ground had changed since the
signing of the Lusaka peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
Southern African Development Community (SADC) countries
together with Rwanda and Uganda signed the peace agreement to end
the 11-month conflict which has pitted at least six African
countries against each other.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said it was still early to judge whether the rebels
would adhere to the peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that the allied forces including Zimbabwean,
Angolan and Namibian troops, which are fighting on the side of
Kabila against the rebels allegedly backed by Rwanda and Uganda,
would continue to be vigilant as the other parties might violate
the agreement.
</P>
<P>
"We are watching very carefully on the development taking
place," Mugabe said. "When you go into an agreement at the nature
we signed, you do not doubt the commitment if the other parties,
but you have to remain vigilant as one side might violate it."
</P>
<P>
To ensure that no violations were made, the OAU leaders and
United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan would discuss the
modalities of sending observers and peace-keepers to the DRC, said
the Zimbabwean president.
</P>
<P>
According to Mugabe, Zambian President Frederick Chiluba who is
 mediating on the ending of the conflict said that he would go to
Goma and Bukavu in Rwanda on a mission to ensure that the rebels
sign the agreement.
</P>
<P>
The rebels did not sign the agreement in Lusaka because of a
split in the main rebel movement, the Rally for Congolese
Democracy (RDC).
</P>
<P>
"The rebels have no strength to fight on their own," Mugabe
said. "If they refuse to sign the agreement and continue to
fight, then we will know that their master, Rwanda is still aiding
them."
</P>
<P>
He added that Rwanda's commitment to the honoring of the
agreement would be judged on whether the rebels sign the peace
accord.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a senior Rwandan army commander said on condition of
 anonymity Tuesday that rebels in the DRC could fight on to take
capital Kinshasa even if foreign powers involved in the war pulled
out.
</P>
<P>
But Tanzanian Foreign Minister Jakaya Mrisho Kikwete said that
without outside help the rebels would be a spent force and their
campaign to wrest control of the vast central African country from
Kabila would fizzle out.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Averts Dangerous War in South Asia: PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif Tuesday once again defended his latest efforts to defuse
the situation in Kargil, describing it as one of the "courageous
and farsighted steps" to avert a dangerous war in South Asia.
</P>
<P>
Sharif made this remark while addressing the parliament members
of the ruling Muslim League and its allies at the Prime Minister's
House, in a bid to take the parliamentarians into confidence on
his recent visit to the United States where he agreed to persuade
the Mujahideen to vacate the positions they occupied in Kargil.
</P>
<P>
He categorically stated that the measures to de-escalate the
situation taken by the government were not due to any weakness but
in the larger interest of peace and progress of the peoples of
South Asia.
</P>
<P>
He said the steps will open the way for solution of the Kashmir
problem as "now the international community, including the United
States, are involved in it".
</P>
<P>
He said U.S. President Bill Clinton has committed to taking
personal interest in the Kashmir issue. China and Islamic
countries also expressed concern over the situation along the Line
of Control and assured their support to Pakistan, added Sharif.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said after the positive response of the
Mujahideen to Pakistan's appeal to withdraw from Kargil, the ball
is in India's court to address the root cause of tension, the
Kashmir issue.
</P>
<P>
He urged India to resume dialogue with Pakistan as soon as
possible because there is "no other better way" than dialogue for
solution to outstanding issues.

<HEADLINE> Nearly 17,000 Die of Militancy in Kashmir: India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Nearly 17,000 people, including
1,416 security personnel, have died of militancy in Kashmir since
1989, according to an Indian government report released here
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Fifteen top political leaders and 110 other politicians were
also killed while Indian security forces gunned down 7,687
militants in counter-insurgency operations, said the report, which
was submitted to the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC).
</P>
<P>
Of the 16,850 killed in the decade, the central government said
719 were Hindus, 45 Sikhs and 6,219 Muslims.
</P>
<P>
As many as 563 foreign mercenaries were killed by the security
forces while 135 were arrested, the report added.
</P>
<P>
During these turbulence years, 2,491 innocents were abducted,
20 of them being foreigners and 135 women.
</P>
<P>
While 809 of them were released, in most cases after extortion,
torture and exchange of militants, 1,036 were brutally murdered by
the abductor, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The decade-long insurgency also took a high toll on social and
economic development in the disputed area with militants
destroying or burning down 758 educational institutions, 1,264
government buildings, 9 hospitals and 243 bridges.
</P>
<P>
The Indian government admitted that hundreds of thousands of
people, most of whom were Kashmiri pundits, were forced to migrate
out of the valley following attacks and threats by militants and
fundamentalist groups.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Economy Improves Slightly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Japan's economy has improved
slightly helped mainly by a recovery in personal consumption, the
Economic Planning Agency (EPA) said in its monthly report released
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The EPA revised its assessment upward for the second
consecutive month following a June report in which the agency said
the economy "has stopped declining."
</P>
<P>
It is the first time in 20 months the agency used a phrase to
show an improvement in the economy. The agency last used the
phrase "recovery" in November 1997, and removed the phrase in
December 1997 following collapses of major financial institutions
such as Yamaichi Securities Co. and Hokkaido Takushoku Bank.
</P>
<P>
The improvement in the July report reflects the recent
improvement in corporate confidence, suggesting recovery in
personal consumption and a slight decline in May's unemployment
rate, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
The agency, however, warned if Japan's employment situation
remains severe, it would reduce household incomes, cooling down
consumer confidence again.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the agency expressed a cautious view, saying the
improved assessment does not mean the agency is declaring the
economy has bottomed out or is on a recovery track.
</P>
<P>
They said it is possible that the economy is still only on a
temporary ascent in a general trend of descent.
</P>
<P>
"Unless we are confident the upward trend will continue, the
bottoming out will not be declared," the official said.

<HEADLINE> China's Exports Show Signs of Recovery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Despite a decline of 4.6 percent
in the first half of the year, China's exports showed some signs
of recovery during the period, according to the latest Customs
figures.
</P>
<P>
Statistics released today by the General Administration of
Customs show that China's exports reached 83 billion U.S. dollars
between January and June. Imports during the period surged 16.6
percent to 75 billion U.S. dollars, bringing the total trade
volume to 158 billion US dollars, up 4.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
The figures also show that compared with the corresponding
period last year, exports decreased 7.9 percent in the first
quarter, but only 1.3 percent in the second quarter. The recovery
between the first and second quarters of the year was the first in
21 months, since the Asian financial crisis began in the fall of
1997.
</P>
<P>
Trade experts here noted that the recovery in exports was
mainly due to China's exports to the United States and the
European Union remaining positive. China's exports to the United
States grew 8.4 percent and those to the EU, 0.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
In addition, China's exports to the Republic of Korea (ROK),
Japan and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN),
which had been severely hit by the financial crisis, have regained
positive growth. Exports to the ROK in particular have maintained
a double-digit growth rate for four consecutive months.
</P>
<P>
Exports of machinery and electronic products, which account for
the lion's share of China's export volume, rose 9.9 percent to 33.
32 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Imports of cooking oil, timber, and sawed wood, commodity oil,
pharmaceuticals, rolled steel, paper and paper boards, and
machinery and electronic products have all shown a strong growth
rate.

<HEADLINE> Portuguese-speaking States Urged to Approve </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, July 13 (Xinhua) -- The Mozambican Anti-landmine
Campaign has called upon the parliaments of the Community of
Portuguese-speaking States to approve the Ottawa Convention, which
bans production, use and stock of lethal land mines, as soon as
possible.
</P>
<P>
The anti-landmine group said in a statement carried by the
Noticias newspaper that the use of lethal land mines is violation
of basic human rights.
</P>
<P>
The statement urged the heads of parliament of Mozambique,
Brazil, Portugal, Angola, Cape Verde, Guinea Bissau and Sao Tome
and Principe to rethink of the issue of land mines and to support
the Ottawa Convention so as to make the whole world free from such
mines by the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
The seven members of the Community of Portuguese-speaking
States have signed and approved the anti-landmine convention, but
more than 50 countries have not approved the treaty.
</P>
<P>
The statement expressed regret that the Angolan government and
the rebel National Union for Total Independence of Angola (UNITA),
against the convention, are still using lethal land mines, killing
and maiming innocent people, and women and children in particular.
</P>
<P>
It called upon Portugal, the only member of the Community of
Portuguese- speaking States which is able to produce lethal land
mines, to stop the mine production and destroy the land mines in
stock.
</P>
<P>
It further asked the Portuguese-speaking countries to exert
influence upon the governments concerned in a bid to help the
victims of land mines and accelerate the demining process around
the world.

<P>
BEIJING, July 13 (Xinhua) -- China will issue treasury bonds
with a value of 50 billion yuan to private investors on July 16.
</P>
<P>
This will be the second issue of treasury bonds to individuals
this year, the first batch having been issued in March.
</P>
<P>
The registered bonds include 35 billion yuan worth of three-
year bonds and 15 billion yuan worth of five-year bonds.
</P>
<P>
The three-year bonds have an annual interest rate of 3.02
percent, and the five-year bonds have an annual interest rate of 3.
25 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Finance announced the decision to issue the
bonds after issuing 20 billion yuan worth of treasury bonds to
corporate investors today.
</P>
<P>
Since the interest rates on savings deposits have been
significantly reduced and are expected to be cut even further,
individual investors are enthusiastic about buying treasury bonds
which have higher interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The registered bonds will be sold at banks and post offices
across the country from July 16 to August 31. However, previous
issues have shown that the bonds will be sold out far sooner than
the later date, and in some big cities such as Beijing they may be
sold out in less than one week.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria to Recruit 10,000 Police Before Year 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian police authorities are
planning to boost its manpower with the enlistment of about 10,000
recruits into various police colleges before the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
No fewer than 2,000 of the 4,000 currently in training are
expected to pass out and join the police force later this year,
the Guardian newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
But of the groups which make up the 4,000, only less than 500
have been paid salaries since January when police again resumed
recruitment after a four-year break, said the paper.
</P>
<P>
Those paid are recruits in group two at the Ikeja Police
College, Lagos, expected to pass out in September along with other
recruits in training at Maiduguri, Kaduna and Orji River, Enugu
police colleges.
</P>
<P>
Police owes these four groups of recruits who were enlisted in
January, April, May and June, five million naira and needs about
the same amount to provide basic facilities and logistics for more
recruits.
</P>
<P>
Inspector-General of Police Musiliu A.K. Smith told commandants
of the four police colleges at the weekend to provide details of
their needs to the authorities before Monday to enable the
Presidency and the Police Affairs Ministry to provide money for
such items before next recruitment.
</P>
<P>
The police also said they would soon begin the recruitment of
drivers as constable into the force.
</P>
<P>
Paddy Ogon, spokesman of the Lagos State Police Command, told
reporters Monday that the Police Force Headquarters has directed
the state command to recruit able-bodied men into the force as
recruit constable drivers.
</P>
<P>
Ogon said that the decision was a result of the determination
of the present administration to strengthen the manpower of
police, to enable it to rise up to the challenges facing the force
in the present civil rule.

<HEADLINE> Quebec Nurses Suspend Strike for 48 Hours </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Striking Quebec nurses suspended
their strike for 48 hours on Tuesday and returned to work in
efforts to negotiate a deal on pay hike with the provincial
government.
</P>
<P>
The 48-hour suspension of the strike, held up for more than two
weeks since June 26, came after the 47,500 nurses voted 93 percent
in favor of a truce decision, which called on both sides to go
back to the negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
The Quebec government has accepted the offer and the first
round of talks is expected to be held on Tuesday following the
nurses' demand for an immediate catch-up pay rise of 10 percent
plus another six percent over two years.
</P>
<P>
So far the government's offer has been a five percent over
three years.
</P>
<P>
"The period of negotiations is 48 hours and no more than 48
hours,"the federation of nurses declared Monday.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, the government already reached a tentative
agreement with ambulance technicians who were threatening a
general strike on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Local reports described the salary of Quebec nurses as the
lowest among their unionized fellows in the country, with their
minimum at 30,340 Canadian dollars (about 20,631 U.S. dollars) and
the maximum at 44,072 (about 29,968 U.S. dollars).

<HEADLINE> Cambodia Improves in Human Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia ranks 137th out of 174
countries in the U.N. Development Program (UNDP) Human Development
Index for 1999, a slight improvement from last year's ranking of
140th, a local newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The UNDP report, which reflects such factors as life
expectancy, education and income, puts Cambodia ahead of Laos,
Pakistan and Nepal, although Cambodia lags behind many Asian
countries.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, life expectancy in Cambodia is 53.4
years, more than 13 years shorter than the world average, the
Cambodia Daily said, while the adult literacy rate is at 66
percent, 12 points below the global average and more than five
points below the average of all developing countries.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, per capita annual income in Cambodia in 1998
was 249 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The human poverty index shows that 70 percent of Cambodia's
population does not have access to safe water and about four out
of 10 persons don't have access to good sanitation. The index also
shows that more than half of Cambodian children younger than five
are underweight.
</P>
<P>
But a UNDP representative in Phnom Penh said that "while many
socio-economic indicators in Cambodia remain low, the report
suggests that a slow but steady improvement in human development
is taking place."
</P>
<P>
"Overall equality in Cambodia is significantly improved,"
Matthew Varghese, UNDP project coordinator added. He also noted
that the poverty rate in Cambodia declined from 39 percent in 1994
to 36 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
UNDP officials suggested investment in education, health and
human resources to help Cambodia improve its ranking.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Taxation Sees Record Half-Year Growth (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 13 (Xinhua) -- China saw a record half-year
growth of tax revenue during the January-June period, with the
growth rate standing at 19.6 percent on an annual basis.
</P>
<P>
According to the State Administration of Taxation (SAT), the
country took in 497.5 billion yuan (about 60 billion US dollars)
in taxes over the first six months this year, an 81.4-billion-yuan
increase over the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
This was the first time since 1994 that the country met the tax
schedule for a half-year period, achieving 52.2 percent of the
annual target.
</P>
<P>
Commissioner of the SAT, Jin Renqing, told a national meeting
of directors of taxation offices here today that this was the best
achievement of the country's taxation system in years. The half-
year growth rate of tax revenue was over twice the ratio for the
same period of last year, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to SAT statistics, the rapid growth of import taxes,
value-added taxes, corporate income taxes, and consumption taxes
contributed to the surge of tax revenue in the past six months.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to increasing imports and the county's crack down on
smuggling, import tax skyrocketed by 107.5 percent year-on-year to
49.3 billion yuan over the period.
</P>
<P>
Value-added taxes increased by 13.9 percent to 188.1 billion
yuan, while consumption taxes increased by ten percent to 39.3
billion yuan.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria to Strengthen Inter-Africa Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian Commerce Minister Mustafa
Bello has assured that his government would give much attention to
intra-Africa trade with a view to strengthening economic
integration in the continent.
</P>
<P>
During his talks with visiting South African Minister of Trade
and Industry Alec Erwin in capital Abuja Monday, Bello said that
the Nigerian government would particularly strive to improve its
economic relations with South Africa.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Times newspaper Tuesday quoted Bello as saying that
such economic cooperation with South Africa would involve the
establishment of a bilateral trade agreement between the two
nations to provide a legal framework for their entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
It will also involve the establishment of trade offices in both
 countries on reciprocal basis for the purpose of easy access to
the other's market, he said.
</P>
<P>
The South African trade minister described the economies of
both countries as the biggest in the continent, saying that more
business interaction should be encouraged in the continent.
</P>
<P>
"The thinking is that our economies are the biggest in Africa,
but we can't develop Africa by trading with Europe and the United
States alone but by trading within Africa," said Erwin.
</P>
<P>
According to him, South Africa has received a draft trade
agreement from Nigeria but insisted that an investor protection
agreement be entered to safeguard South African business interests
in the most populous African country.
</P>
<P>
Erwin pointed out that investors feel safe when an agreement
protecting their interests is in place.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Taxation Sees Record Half-Year Growth (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jin said that the record growth of tax revenue was based on
stronger economic performance rather than increasing burdens on
corporations.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the country's investment in fixed assets has
spurred the production of raw materials, and that value-added
taxes from the petroleum, construction materials, chemical and
textile sectors have seen an all-round increase over the past six
months.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of this year, the SAT has taken over the
levying of income taxes on state-owned enterprises from the
Ministry of Finance, and this has helped boost corporate income
tax revenue by 13.2 billion yuan during the January-June period.
</P>
<P>
Excluding contingent factors, the actual growth rate of tax
revenue was 11.7 percent year-on-year for the period, 3.5
percentage points higher than the economic growth rate.
</P>
<P>
However, Jin said, the country's lackluster consumer market has
caused a slump in the growth rate of operation taxes, which grew
by only 8.1 percent, the lowest growth rate for the first half-
year ever. Operation taxes from the financial and insurance
sectors saw negative growth over the period due to decreasing
interest rates and a surging deposit-loan ratio.
</P>
<P>
He said that the taxation situation for the second half of the
year allows for no optimism, and predicted that the monthly growth
rate of tax revenue would decrease continuously over the next six
months.
</P>
<P>
However, he pointed out that the record growth in the first
half year has ensured that the country will meet the target of
increasing tax revenues for the year.
</P>
<P>
Local economists predict that the country's tax revenue may
reach one trillion yuan (121 billion US dollars) this year.
</P>
<P>
Jin said the country is planning to give further tax deductions
to enterprises to stimulate economic growth in the next six months.

BEIJING, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Li Ruihuan, chairman of the
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC)
National Committee, met here this afternoon with Ion Diaconescu,
chairman of the Chamber of Deputies of the Romanian Parliament,
and his party.
</P>
<P>
Despite changes in the international situation, and in the
domestic situations of both countries, friendly relations between
China and Romania have been developing steadily since the two
countries forged diplomatic ties 50 years ago, Li said, adding
that the Chinese are happy over any progress made by Romania.
</P>
<P>
The years since China began reforms and opening-up have brought
significant improvements in the people's living standards, Li said,
while pointing out that difficulties and problems still exist.
</P>
<P>
A densely populated country of weak national strength, China
will require a long time of hard work before it will attain the
development level of the industrialized countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We like to hear praise, but we are even more aware of the
reality we are facing," Li said.
</P>
<P>
Diaconescu said that the friendship between Romania and China,
based on the principles of mutual-respect and peaceful co-
existence, boasts a long history and will never change. He also
suggested that leaders of the two countries continue to exchange
visits to further enhance their friendship.
</P>
<P>
Romania has always considered Taiwan to be a province of China,
and this stand will never change, he stressed.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Creates 300,000 Jobs for Crisis-hit Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 13 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government has
facilitated new jobs for nearly 300,000 Asian financial
crisis-displaced workers in the past year, an official report said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the one-year performance report of the Department
of Labor and Employment (DOLE), the government also put over
34,000 other dislocated ones back on their feet by providing them
with a total of 525 million pesos (13 million U.S. dollars) in
loans.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, it gave rice subsidies worth 10 million pesos
(250,000 dollars) combined to 76,923 sugar workers and their
families over the past 12 months, the report added.
</P>
<P>
With more and more factories closing shop and firing workers a
year ago at the height of the Asian crisis, the DOLE was ordered
to intensify its employment-facilitation assistance to job
seekers, especially the newly unemployed ones, the report said.
</P>
<P>
"The efforts resulted in the placement of 296,733 job
applicants in new locally available jobs," the DOLE said. "This
somewhat eased the effects of the displacements."
</P>
<P>
The DOLE said it was able to assist this big number of job
seekers over the past year through "stronger networking" of its
regional offices with local-placement centers run by local
government units.
</P>
<P>
As for those who failed to bag new jobs, the government helped
ease the impact of the crisis on 34,267 displaced workers and
their families by extending to them loans through social security
system.
</P>
<P>
A rice subsidy program for sugar workers was likewise
implemented in addition to the cash bonuses and other regular
benefits enjoyed by them.

SHANGHAI, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Residents of China's largest
metropolis spend more than 50 billion yuan on food annually, a

</P>
<P>
Local expenditures on foodstuffs have been rising for 10 years
as a result of improved local living standards.

Nowadays, the people of Shanghai prefer to buy food and drinks

There are now more than 1,000 supermarkets scattered across every
residential neighborhood in the city.
</P>
<P>
There is also a wide variety of food choices now available,
including everything from Chinese-style delicatessen, Western-

<HEADLINE> Iranian Police Breaks Up Protest Rally </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Iran's conservative-dominated
police on Tuesday broke up a rally, protesting against police's
crackdown on students, and arrested a number of people, the
Islamic Iranian News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The protesters, labeled by IRNA as "rioters," threw stones and
clubs at the policemen who were trying to disperse them in front
of the main gate of the Tehran University.
</P>
<P>
But the agency did not say how many protesters took part in the
demonstration and how many of them were arrested.
</P>
<P>
The demonstration came after the Tehran University students
announced to end their five-day sit-in at the university campus to
protest the bloody crackdown by the police on university students
on Thursday and Friday.
</P>
<P>
Despite of the students' announcement, "a group of rioters
staged an illegal demonstration in front of the university
Tuesday morning," IRNA said, adding that the same group also
tried to create further tension in several points in Tehran
Monday night.
</P>
<P>
The police, armed with shields and batons, used tear gas to
disperse the "rioters who are believed to be backed by terrorist
groups and tried to create clashes with police," the report said.
</P>
<P>
The police also blocked the streets leading to Tehran
University and a police helicopter was hovering overhead
broadcasting government announcements through loudspeakers that
any assembly and demonstration was unauthorized.
</P>
<P>
Following the speech of Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah Ali
Khamenei on Monday, students announced to end their sit-ins and
the student Basijis (military volunteers) also canceled their
rally scheduled to be held Tuesday afternoon in front of Tehran
University.
</P>
<P>
Condemning the unauthorized police assault on students at the
Tehran University dormitory, Khamenei warned that the students
should watch and identify the "evil hands of the enemies."
</P>
<P>
He said that "our main enemies in spying networks are the
designers of the plots" of assaulting Tehran University dormitory
following a student rally protesting the closure of the leading
moderate daily Salam (Hello).
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Propagation Organization (IPO) on Tuesday called
on the Iranian people to hold a rally on Wednesday to support
Khamenei's speech and reiterate loyalty to Khamenei and the
Islamic revolution.
</P>
<P>
The IPO said that the enemy's plots aimed at paralyzing the
police, sowing discord among the system's official and
organization and causing disturbances in the country.

<HEADLINE> Angolan Army to Launch Massive Attack Against </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Angolan Deputy Minister of Defense
Armado Cruz Neto has said that the Angolan government troops are
preparing for a decisive offensive against the UNITA rebels soon.
</P>
<P>
The Journal of Angola newspaper Tuesday quoted the official as
saying that the rebel forces of the National Union for Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA) are launching sneak attacks on the
government army.
</P>
<P>
The rebels are mainly engaged in planting land mines along the
roads, ambushing the government convoy fleets, bombing the
strategic towns and attacking villages, said Neto.
</P>
<P>
Despite the constant attacks by the rebels, the government
troops are controlling the general situation of the country, he
added.
</P>
<P>
The deputy minister disclosed that the government troops have
advanced at several front lines, citing the successful operation
in the town of Sanza Pombo in northern Uige Province and the
central city of Huambo.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan government said repeatedly that it would launch a
large- scale offensive during the dry season so as to wipe out the
military forces of the UNITA led by Jonas Savimbi.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the UNITA forces have reportedly been launching
sneak attacks on innocent people to create a wave of refugees and
exert political and social pressure upon the Angolan government in
a bid to delay the destructive hit from the army.

<HEADLINE> Peace Efforts on Congo (K) to Continue: SADC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALGIERS, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Since the rebels in Congo (K) did
not sign on the cease-fire agreement inked by regional leaders,
peace efforts would continue so as to achieve an everlasting peace
in the vast central African country.
</P>
<P>
Kaire Mbuende, Executive Secretary of the Southern African
Development Community (SADC), told reporters here Tuesday
afternoon that after the on- going summit of the Organization of
African Unity (OAU), efforts will continue to resolve the
differences that have arisen among rebel groups.
</P>
<P>
The rebel groups, namely the Congolese Rally for Democracy
(RCD) and the Movement for the Liberation of Congo, did not reach
agreement on who should represent all the rebel groups.
</P>
<P>
This contention on representation results from their grave
differences in strategy and tactics which led to a major split
among the two RCD factions recently.
</P>
<P>
The regional summit on Congo (K), scheduled for June 26, was
postponed several times as ministers were trying to iron out their
key differences on the modalities of cease-fire and deployment of
neutral peace-keeping forces.
</P>
<P>
The war erupted in early August of 1998 and quickly spilt into
a regional war with Zimbabwe, Angola, Namibia and Chad sending
troops to fight for Congolese President Laurent Kabila while
Uganda and Rwanda backing the rebel forces.
</P>
<P>
Many efforts have been taken trying to restore peace and
ceasing the conflict in the third largest African country.
</P>
<P>
But only the recent summit in Zambian capital Lusaka yielded
results acceptable to all the players.

<P>
NEW DELHI, June 13 (Xinhua) -- The Reserve Bank of India will
auction 25 billion rupees (575 million U.S. dollars), or 12.32
percent, of government stock maturing in 2011.
</P>
<P>
The auction will be held on July 25. With this, the bank said,
the government will complete 52 percent of its budgeted borrowing
program of 835.71 billion rupees (19.2 billion U.S. dollars) for
1999-2000.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said that the auction will suck out liquidity from the
money market and lead to tightness. The paper is currently trading
at 101.30/40 rupees (2.33 U.S. dollars) level.
</P>
<P>
The price is likely to go down in the coming days on account of
tight liquidity conditions as no significant inflows are expected,
they added.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Govt's austerity to reshape economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 13 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian Federal Government
Monday served notice of a painful adjustment process in the
country's endeavor to to reshape its battered economy,.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian, a leading Nigerian newspaper Tuesday quoted
Vice-President Atiku Abubakar enjoined citizens to gird their
loins for more sacrifice, and indicated that the government is
poised against what he termed the prevailing propensity of many to
make easy money from inflated contracts as well as the lack of
competition in the economy.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the task of reconstructing the economy has
become compelling and demanding that enough be declared the moral
equivalent of war. But the war cannot be successfully prosecuted
by the government alone, but by stake-holders of particularly the
private sector and ordinary citizens.
</P>
<P>
Speaking Monday at the State House, Abuja while inaugurating a
22-member Presidential Consultative Committee on the
Revitalization of the Economy, he said: "As a matter of fact, we
foresee a process of painful adjustment for everybody because many
organizations and individuals have become used to making easy
money from inflated contracts, and from the distortions or lack of
competitiveness in the economy."
</P>
<P>
As the new panel, which he heads, settles down to business, he
said it must preoccupy itself with earnestly systematizing,
harmonizing and prioritizing economic policies to ensure their
speedy translation into concrete achievements, measurable either
in quantitative or qualitative terms.
</P>
<P>
The ultimate test, according to the vice-president, is how much
 empirical improvement the government can bring to the quality of
life of the citizenry. "We will not be talking about GDP or GNP,
but the citizen's purchasing power, the reliability of utilities,
access to and cost of his children's education, and his ability to
feed, clothe and house himself," he said.
</P>
<P>
Vice President Abubakar observed that the nation had never
lacked ideas about the nature, ramifications and even the
solutions to her economic problems, pointing out that such ideas
had assumed overflowing dimensions on how to reconstruct the
economy.

<HEADLINE> Chinese MacArthur Award Winner Praised </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An official with the Chinese Artists Association said today
that the talented Xu deserves this recognition.
</P>
<P>
"We are happy that he was given the award, a sign that the
latest development in Chinese art has aroused interest in the West,
" the official said on the condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
He added that this indicates the international community has
gradually accepted Chinese art, and the dialogue between East and
West will continue into the 21st century because of the efforts of
pioneers like Xu.
</P>
<P>
Some media reports said that Xu expresses unique views through
his works.
</P>
<P>
Xu, 44, now resides in New York. He was one of 32 people, and
the only Chinese, granted the award by the John D. and Catherine T.
MacArthur Foundation on June 22.
</P>
<P>
After graduating from China's Central Fine Arts Institute in
the 1980s, Xu became an action artist, creating a number of
controversial works.
</P>
<P>
His best-known works include "A Sealed Book" featuring
unreadable Chinese characters, "Ghost Haunting" with strange
marks on the Great Wall, and "Cultural Animals" depicting sexual
intercourse between animals.
</P>
<P>
Some artists disparage Xu's artistic experiments, while others
appreciate his style.
</P>
<P>
Xu was given the award because he has used traditional Chinese
methods to explore contemporary Chinese arts, according to the New
York-based foundation.
</P>
<P>
There were 1,000 candidates for the award, which is given every
year to the most talented figures in politics, economics, science
and arts. The amount of the award given to Xu was 315,000 U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Xu did not know he was a candidate until the names of the
winners were announced.

<HEADLINE> Manila Takes Measures Against Portfolio Investments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Learning its lesson from the Asian
financial crisis, the Philippine government has excluded the
short-term portfolio investments from its computations of net
capital inflows into the country.
</P>
<P>
Edgardo Espiritu, secretary of the Department of Finance, said
Tuesday that instead of being lulled by these "hot" investments,
the government has put in place several reforms that would make
the economy conducive to long-term investments.
</P>
<P>
"Now we are ready for these portfolio investments or what we
call 'hot money.' We no longer include them when we compute our
net inflows," Espiritu told a meeting.
</P>
<P>
He said these "hot money" give economies a false sense of
confidence without considering the need to install measures that
would attract long-term investors.
</P>
<P>
Economists have pointed to the proliferation of these portfolio
investments made by currency speculators in several Asian
countries that led to the financial crisis in 1997.
</P>
<P>
These short-term investors poured their money into robust
economies and immediately pulled them out at the slightest sign of
instability.
</P>
<P>
To attract long-term investments, the Philippine government set
in place several measures to lower the costs of doing business in
the Philippines, including the reduction of mandatory reserve
requirement and overnight borrowing and lending rates.
</P>
<P>
The government has also urged Congress to immediately pass
several economic reform measures such as the General Banking Act,
the Power Sector Reform Bill and the proposed retail trade
liberalization law to encourage more investors to do business in
the country.

<HEADLINE> Air Lanka Renames to Seek Int'l Recognition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka on Tuesday renamed its
national carrier Air Lanka as Sri Lankan Airlines to prepare it
for the next millennium as an international airline.
</P>
<P>
In a ceremony held here to welcome the arrival of a new Airbus
A340, the first aircraft of the airline with the "Sri Lankan"
logo, Air Lanka Chairman Wickremasinghe unveiled the airline's new
logo, name and colors.
</P>
<P>
To most people in the west, Sri Lanka is still referred to as
the former name "Ceylon". The name "Air Lanka" is not easily
identified with Sri Lanka, said Wickremasinghe.
</P>
<P>
He said the renaming is expected to strengthen the projection
of the country in the international marketplace and the linkage of
the airline as the country's international airline.
</P>
<P>
Wickremasinghe listed other successful Asian examples in the
same vein as Singapore Airlines, Japan Airlines, Malaysia Airlines
and others.
</P>
<P>
Besides the new aircraft obtained today on a dry lease from
Airbus Industries of Europe for five years, Sri Lankan Airlines
will take delivery of six Airbus A330 beginning in October this
year at a cost of some 540 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Wickremasinghe said the airline is also planning to fly to new
destinations in November, including Beirut, Stockholm and Sydney.
</P>
<P>
The ceremony was also addressed by Minister of Tourism and
Civil Aviation Dharmasiri Senanayake and the airline's director
Gary Chapman.
</P>
<P>
Air Lanka, established in 1979, now flies 26 destinations in 20
countries in Europe, the Middle East, South Asia and the Far East.
Its current fleet consists of four Lockheed Tristar L1011, three
Airbus A340, and two Airbus A320 aircraft.

the market back.
</P>
<P>
The all industrials index climbed 34.6 points to 5311.0, while
the all resources index shed 7.2 to an even 1300.0.

</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- In a report on Internet published on Monday, the United
Nations Development Program (UNDP) denounced the monopoly of rich
countries of the new information technology. It also proposes that
a tax be imposed on sending e-mails and obtaining a license for
opening an internet site in order to finance access by the poorest
countries.
</P>
<P>
-- Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika delivered his
message of opening and national reconciliation through the African

<HEADLINE> African Leaders Urged to Renew Commitment to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALGIERS, July 13 (Xinhua) -- United Nations High Commissioner
for Refugees (UNCHR) Sadako Ogata Tuesday appealed to African
leaders to renew their commitment to millions of refugees and
displaced people in the continent.
</P>
<P>
The senior U.N. official made the appeal at a press conference
here Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
Meeting here with heads of state attending the 35th summit of
the Organization of African Unity (OAU), she told them that peace
and development were the only hope for resolving the continent's
refugees' crisis.
</P>
<P>
"The progress toward peace in Sierra Leone and Congo (K) has
raised hopes for countries where civilians have suffered fro
years. UNCHR is there, caring for refugees and ready to help them
go home, but their return will depend on whether the peace can be
sustained," the High Commissioner said.
</P>
<P>
The call for political settlements echoed the message Ogata
carried to Rwanda, Burundi and Congo (K) during an eight-day
mission in June.
</P>
<P>
Promising her office will continue to press for more solidarity
with Africa, she cautioned that little support would come before
successful conflict resolution.
</P>
<P>
"Solutions for the millions of uprooted Africans have to be
part of a new commitment to peace and reconciliation. Answers can
be found in the provisions of the OAU Refugee Convention -- one of
the cornerstones to the organization itself -- and in the will of
the continent's leaders," she added.
</P>
<P>
Ogata hailed the creation of an OAU award for service to
refugees, awarded Monday to Tanzania and Cote d'Ivoire in Africa.
</P>
<P>
This year marks the 30th anniversary of the OAU Convention
Governing the Specific Aspects of Refugee Problems in Africa, as
well as a Cooperation Agreement between the African body and the
UNCHR.
</P>
<P>
UNCHR has nearly 2,000 staff members in 42 countries in Africa.
And it spends more than one million dollars a day on refugees in
Africa. The continent's 6.5 million refugees and displaced persons
represent almost one third of the people of concern to UNCHR
worldwide. UNCHR has to date received 87.4 million U.S. dollars of
164 million dollars needed for six emergency operations in Africa
this year.

<P>
DHAKA, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh incurs a loss of over 10
billion taka (206.2 million U.S. dollars) because of traffic jam
while several thousand lives are lost due to road mishaps a year,
The Daily Star newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed by Nazmul Hossain, former Bangladesh Road

as a major cause of death and injury in Bangladesh and also to
improve road-safety in the communities through local community
participation in the design, as well as the implementation of
road-safety programs.

<TEXT>
<P>
ALGIERS, July 13 (Xinhua) -- The cease-fire agreement on the
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), which was recently signed in
Lusaka, Zambia by all the countries involved in the conflict, will
facilitate refugee work in the country.
</P>
<P>
United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNCHR) Sadako
Ogata made the remarks at a news briefing here Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
She said that she met Congolese President Laurent Kabila Monday
evening and they discussed the refugee issue and expressed
optimism over UNCHR's more and deeper operations in Congo (K).
</P>
<P>
The high commissioner also touched on issues of refugees in
Ethiopia, Eritrea, Western Sahara and Sierra Leone, adding that
her office was ready to enable more refugees on the continent to
access emergency humanitarian aid.
</P>
<P>
On the Angolan refugees now flooding into Congo (K), the
official said that President Kabila promised to handle this issue
according to the will of the refugees. They could remain in Congo
(K) if they wanted to, she said.
</P>
<P>
The 11-month armed conflict in Congo (K) generated hundreds of
thousands of refugees who fled to neighboring countries including
Tanzania, Uganda and others.
</P>
<P>
She urged leaders of countries participating in the conflict to
honor and implement the cease-fire agreement in earnest, because
she noted peace and stability is the only hope for resolving the
refugee crisis in the Great Lakes region.

<HEADLINE>   Manila Tells Traders to Avoid Currency Speculation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 13, (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government Tuesday
asked individuals, financial institutions and currency dealers not
to engage themselves in currency speculation as this will affect
the exchange rate of the Philippine peso against the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
Finance Secretary Edgardo Espiritu told a meeting that some
people speculate in the hope of earning good profits over a short
period when they sense that there are changes in financial policy
developments in the market.
</P>
<P>
The top financial official urged these people to conduct their
businesses fairly and squarely, particularly at a time when the
domestic economy is already on the road to recovery.
</P>
<P>
He said a trader who is able to buy dollars in bulk from
speculators will be forced to sell his notes on the ground that
the dollars in his possession might shed their value, he said.
</P>
<P>
Espiritu also stressed that there is a need to lower further
the present interest rate because the Philippines, among Asian
countries, still commands the highest interest rates and the
country's inflation rate has gone down to a reasonable level.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, he discounted claims by former central bank
governor Gabriel Singson that there is danger that some traders
might resort to currency speculations owing to low interest rates
in the market.
</P>
<P>
Instead, he clarified that there are other sources where the
government can resort to such as the remittances of overseas
Filipino workers which already rose by 7 percent in the first
quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
He added that the value of exports rose by 30 percent during
the same period, a sign that the country will not run out of its
14- billion-dollar reserves.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Moves up in U.N. Development Listing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, July 13 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Development
Program (UNDP) said that Uganda has gained more economic and
political development over the past years.
</P>
<P>
UNDP representative to Uganda Daouda Toure made the remarks
when launching the 1999 UNDP Human Development Report in Kampala
Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to a UNDP report, Uganda is ranked the 158th of the
174 countries, up from 160th last year.
</P>
<P>
This indicates that Uganda is now the 17th poorest country in
the world, up from the 14th poorest last year.
</P>
<P>
Uganda still has potential for improvement if the current
economic and poverty eradication policies are pursued, Toure said,
adding that this east African country still lagged behind compared
to its neighbors like Kenya and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
On the occasion, Ugandan Minister for the Presidency Ruhakana
Rugunda called for fairer rules in international cooperation and
trade and for the effective participation of the poor countries in
designing such rules and regulations.
</P>
<P>
Rugunda also reiterated his government's commitment to poverty
eradication.
</P>
<P>
The report titled "Globalization With a Human Face" blames
globalization for the wide disparities between the developed and
the least developed countries.
</P>
<P>
It shows that the rich countries that constitute only 20
percent control 86 percent of the world gross domestic product
while the poorest countries control only one percent.
</P>
<P>
It also shows that the richest countries control 82 percent of
the export of goods and services, 68 percent of foreign direct
investment and have 93.3 percent of Internet users while the
poorest countries have only one percent or less of each.

<HEADLINE> Kenya's Inflation at Single Digit Level: C. Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's inflation remained within
the single digit range due to the sustained slowdown in the
expansion of money supply, according to the the Central Bank of
Kenya.
</P>
<P>
The central bank said in its monthly economic review for July
that underlying inflation accelerated in June this year but
remained on the five- percent target set by the bank, the Daily
Nation newspaper said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The month-on-month inflation increased to five percent in June
from 2.5 percent and 4.5 percent in April and May respectively.
</P>
<P>
The average annual inflation declined to 6.2 percent in June
from 6.7 percent in May and 7.3 percent in April, the review said.
</P>
<P>
The bank report noted that a policy of restrained monetary
expansion together with the improved availability of basic
foodstuffs, particularly in the first quarter of 1999, led to the
decline in inflation.
</P>
<P>
To maintain low inflation, the central bank said underlying
month-on- month inflation will be confined to within five percent
in the year to June 2000.
</P>
<P>
Inflation within this range would be achieved by ensuring that
money supply expands by no more than 10 percent, the bank added.

<HEADLINE> Worldwide Cross-Industry Application Software Market Expands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Worldwide sales of business
application software, such as accounting, human resources and
customer service systems that are used across industries are
steadily rising.
</P>
<P>
According to a report released Monday by U.S. market research
firm International Data Corporation (IDC), revenues in the
worldwide cross-industry application market increased 17.6 percent
to 28.3 billion U.S. dollars in 1998. They are expected to
increase 17 percent and exceed 33 billion dollars this year and
reach 66 billion dollars by 2003.
</P>
<P>
Demand for e-commerce functionality is one the many factors
contributing to the growth of cross-industry application software,
IDC said. The increasing popularity of customer relationship
management (CRM) applications is also driving this market
expansion.
</P>
<P>
According to the IDC's 1998 data, Microsoft was the leading
vendor across all application markets, earning almost three
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
CRM applications will become increasingly adopted by companies
of all sizes, said the IDC, adding that faced with growing
competition, businesses currently need to provide better customer
support if they hope to retain their customers.
</P>
<P>
The IDC splits the cross-industry applications market into
accounting, human resources/payroll, materials management, project
management, maintenance management, sales forces automation,
marketing automation, customer support and field service, word
processing, and business performance measurement.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, accounting was the largest segment, earning over six
billion dollars or accounting for 21.5 percent of the market.
</P>
<P>
According to the IDC, demand for cross-industry applications is
strongest in the United States, which accounted for just less than
50 percent of worldwide revenues with 13.8 billion dollars. By
2003, the country will account for more than 50 percent with 34.3
billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> United States Vowed to Increase Tariffs on EU Products </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 12 (Xinhua) -- The United States has vowed to take
firm and swift action to increase tariffs on products from the
European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky made the remarks
after arbitrators of the World Trade Organization (WTO) ruled here
Monday that the United States lost 116.8 million U.S. dollars per
year because of the continuation of the European Union's import
ban on hormone-treated beef.
</P>
<P>
"The arbitrators' decision today confirms that under WTO rules,
the EU must pay a price for failing to comply with its WTO
obligations, "she said. "The EU must understand that as a result
of its failure to comply with its WTO obligations, the United
States will act firmly and swiftly under its WTO rights to sharply
raise tariffs on imports from the EU in an amount equivalent to
the trade damage."
</P>
<P>
In a press release here Monday, the United States claimed that
it would exercise its WTO rights by imposing 100 percent tariffs
on a list of EU products with an annual trade value of 116.8
million dollars. The list of products and other details regarding
the tariff increases will be announced soon.
</P>
<P>
The trade dispute over the EU's beef policies dates back to the
1980s. In December 1985, the EU adopted a directive on livestock
production restricting the use of natural hormones to therapeutic
purposes, banning the use of synthetic hormones, and prohibiting
imports of animals, and meat from animals, to which hormones had
been administered.
</P>
<P>
The WTO arbitrators also determined that Canada suffered a loss
of 11.3 million Canadian dollars (about 7.6 million U.S. dollars)
per year from the EU beef import policy.
</P>
<P>
According to the United States, on all occasions of the Food
and Drug Administration's testing, the six hormones subject to
this trade dispute have always been found to be safe.
</P>
<P>
In late December 1987, the United States announced an increase
in duties on selected European products in response to the EU
hormone directive and related measures, but immediately suspended
this action to promote a negotiated solution of the issue.
</P>
<P>
Following the entry into force of the WTO Agreement on the
Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (SPS) on
January 1,1995, the United States and Canada filed complaints
against the EU's hormone-treated meat ban.
</P>
<P>
On August 18, 1997, a WTO dispute settlement panel issued its
report finding that the hormone ban is not based on scientific
evidence, a risk assessment, or relevant international standards
in contravention of the EU's obligations under the SPS agreement.
</P>
<P>
On February 13, 1998, the WTO dispute settlement body gave the
EU 15 months to implement WTO rulings. Complaining that the EU
took no actions to implement the WTO rulings by the deadline of
May 13,1999, the United States exercised its WTO rights by
requesting authorization to suspend tariff concessions on EU goods
with an annual trade value equivalent to annual lost exports of U.
S. beef, estimated by the United States as equal to 202 million
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The EU requested arbitration over the amount of lost U.S. beef
exports, insisting that the amount was only about 53 million
dollars.

<HEADLINE> Scientists from Mainland, HK, Taiwan Join in Arctic Research </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SNOW DRAGON SHIP, July 13 (Xinhua) -- A scientist from Taiwan,
Ruey-Gang Chang, went aboard the Snow Dragon Expedition Ship
anchored a mile off Nome, Alaska today to join 124 scientists and
journalists on their voyage to the North Pole.
</P>
<P>
Another scientist, from Hong Kong, is expected to join the team
at Tuktoyaktuk, Canada. This is the first time that Chinese
scientists from the mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan have cooperated
in a polar research activity.
</P>
<P>
"I feel honored to take part in China's first government-
sponsored Arctic expedition. And I hope that cooperation between
scientists from the mainland and Taiwan will be enhanced," said
Chang, a surveyor from Taiwan's Ming Hsin Institute of Technology.
</P>
<P>
Chang will collaborate with professor E Dongchen of Wuhan
Technology University of Surveying and Mapping in conducting
research on absolute gravity at the North Pole.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwanese scientist saluted the captain of the ship before
he went aboard today, saying, "I am proud of China's scientific
advancement."
</P>
<P>
E Dongchen said he will continue his cooperation with Chang on
China's 16th expedition to the South Pole and other research in
the future.
</P>
<P>
E Dongchen, director of the Antarctic Surveying and Mapping
Research Center of China, has taken part in four expeditions to
the South Pole and one expedition to the North Pole, and the
founder of Chinese polar surveying and mapping.
</P>
<P>
He said invaluable first-hand data will be gained on absolute
gravity research during this expedition with the aid of the world'
s only portable absolute gravimeter.
</P>
<P>
Polar researcher Rebecca Lee from Hong Kong joined the
expedition when the ship left Shanghai a few weeks ago. She has
previously been to the Arctic Circle six times, but this is her
first voyage to the Arctic Ocean on a Chinese ship.
</P>
<P>
"I think this present research is very important, and I'm
willing to make contributions to China's scientific development,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
Scientists from the Republic of Korea and Japan, and a
navigator from Russia are also aboard the polar expedition ship.

<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Japan on Tuesday welcomed the latest
agreement reached by Pakistan and India aimed at ending the
conflict in the disputed Kashmir area.
</P>
<P>
Japanese Foreign Minister Masahiko Komura said he hopes the two
South Asian countries would quickly realize a cease-fire under
their weekend accord.
</P>
<P>
"We hope for an early end to the fighting, with both India and
Pakistan restoring the Line of Control," Komura told a press
conference.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan and India reached the agreement over the weekend to
restore the Line of Control, the de facto borderline in Kashmir
that divides the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The Line of Control was established following an agreement
signed by the two countries in 1972, which also requires them to
resolve all disputes through bilateral talks.
</P>
<P>
Tensions between Pakistan and India have been high since the
alleged intrusion of Pakistan-backed Muslim forces into the Indian-
controlled part of Kashmir in May.

<HEADLINE> Non-Traditional Exports Grow in Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's non-traditional exports
have registered the highest growth rates among all sectors
although the country's economic performance has somewhat been
negative for most of the past eight years, according to the
Exporter Audit of Export Board of Zambia.
</P>
<P>
While copper exports previously earned about 80 percent of the
country's foreign exchange revenue, the non-traditional exports
now are accounting for about 33.2 percent of its foreign exchange
earnings, said the newsletter issued by the export board available
here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The country's exporting companies have increased from 188 in
1997 to 248 in 1998, the highest number of exporting firms since
1987, according to the newsletter.
</P>
<P>
On Zambia's export markets, the European Union continues to be
the major destination for its non-traditional exports accounting
for 34 percent of the total followed by the Common Market for
Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) region with about 28 percent.
</P>
<P>
South Africa has become one of the largest markets because of
the declining exports to the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)
due to the war in that country.
</P>
<P>
Constraints facing the non-traditional exports include lack of
access to export credit guarantee and export insurance scheme.
</P>
<P>
The Export Board of Zambia has urged the government to give
more incentives to exporters such as those contained in the 1993
Investment Act. The incentives have been removed.
</P>
<P>
Should all areas of concern be amended and the target of
increasing non-traditional exports to 400 million U.S. dollars
from current 300 million dollars be achieved, Zambia could within
a few years significantly reduce its dependence on copper exports,
said the Audit.

<P>
LAGOS, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo
Monday officially presented the much desired Niger-Delta bill to
the National Assembly, parliament of the country, for
consideration and eventual passage into law before leaving for the
Algiers OAU summit.
</P>
<P>
The bill, which Obasanjo promised in his tour to the
conflicting Warri region last month, was aimed at seeking a
fundamental solution to the crises raging in the oil rich southern
Niger delta for decades.
</P>
<P>
The bill proposes the setting up of a Niger-Delta Development
Commission to look into and manage the social development in the
region, where poverty is believed to be the main reason behind the
unrest. The unrest claimed hundreds of lives in the conflict in
Warri city and its environ last month.
</P>
<P>
Necessary objections, raised by the governors of Rivers,
Bayelsa, Cross Rivers, Akwa-Ibom, Edo and Ondo States, were
reflected in the bill, This Day newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The percentage to be contributed by the oil companies has been
moderately adjusted to reflect the realities on the ground.
</P>
<P>
Nearly all of the country's oil output yields in the region,
yet most people here are living on a tight margin, which
translates into hatred between different ethnic groups and
assaults on the foreign oil company staff.

<HEADLINE> Egypt to Sell Public Stake in Joint Banks, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Egypt has decided to sell the public
stake in 15 joint banks and companies, the Egyptian Gazette
newspaper reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made on Monday during a meeting of the
Ministerial Committee on Privatization, headed by Prime Minister
Kamal El-Ganzouri, Minister of Cabinet Affairs Talaat Ahmed Hammad
said.
</P>
<P>
The committee approved the sale of the public stake in the
International Islamic Bank for Investment and Development, Banque
Misr-America and Egypt-Iran Bank, Hammad said, without mentioning
the amount of the public shares in the banks.
</P>
<P>
Egypt began to privatize 314 state-owned enterprises in 1995 in
a bid to upgrade the efficiency and competitiveness of the
enterprises. So far, more than one third of the selected have been
privatized.
</P>
<P>
But the government is cautious when it comes to the
privatization of the national banks for fear that the step may
give rise to financial turmoil. The would-be selling of the public
stake in joint banks appears to be a test in the financial sector.
</P>
<P>
The privatization committee also ratified the selling of the
public shares in the Alexandria Company for Carbon Black in the
petrochemical industry, which is estimated at 134 million Egyptian
pounds (39.41 million U.S. dollars), or 8.9 percent of the
company's total capital, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
The committee agreed on the selling of Egypt's shares in the
Egyptian-Kuwaiti Company to the Kuwaiti partner. The public stake
in the Building and Reconstruction Company and the Egyptian
Agricultural Company for Seeds Production will also be sold.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Farmers Call for Permits to Export Maize </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Zambian farmers have called on the
government to allow them to export their maize to enable them to
meet their loan obligations, the Times of Zambia newspaper
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
President of the Zambia National Farmers Union Ajay Vashee has
said that since the government will not buy local maize this year,
it should issue the farmers permits to export their maize to
neighboring countries,
</P>
<P>
The Zambian Food Reserve Agency does not have the required 50
billion kwacha (about 20 million U.S. dollars) to buy maize this
year because it has not recovered the money the farmers borrowed
in form of fertilizer.
</P>
<P>
The Zambian government has in turn refused to commit any more
money to the agency to enable it to buy maize.
</P>
<P>
Vashee said the food reserve agency should be held responsible
for the whole situation for acting irresponsibly by engaging in
unprofitable business of dishing out fertilizer to desperate
small-scale farmers and failing to buy local maize for strategic
reserve.
</P>
<P>
The union leader urged the agency to secure money to buy maize
to ensure price stability in local maize market.
</P>
<P>
The maize prices are dropping on the local markets because this
year farmers have produced more maize than demand.
</P>
<P>
Vashee said leaving the situation at its current position will
force the farmers to sell maize at give-away prices.
</P>
<P>
If the farmers do not meet their loan obligations, they will be
 subjected to no further funding from lending financial
institutions next season.
</P>
<P>
Early this month, the government said that it is impossible for
it to find money to buy maize for strategic reserves because this
will put more pressure on the state budget of this year.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 13 (Xinhua) -- The Vietnamese parliament speaker
has stressed his country's keenness on strengthening cooperation
with Egypt in all fields.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian Gazette newspaper reported on Tuesday that
Chairman of the Vietnamese National Assembly Nong Duc Manh told
Egyptian Prime Minister Kamal El-Ganzouri during a meeting on
Monday that Vietnam gives priority to the agricultural cooperation
with Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Nong, who arrived in Cairo on Sunday, discussed with
El-Ganzouri various ways of bolstering the economic and trade
cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The two men also reviewed the developments of the Middle East
peace process, which is hopeful to make progress now that the
moderate Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak has taken office.
</P>
<P>
Nong Duc Manh also held talks on Monday with Egyptian Deputy
Prime Minister and Minister of Agriculture Youssef Wali on
necessary steps to accelerate cooperation between the two
countries, the pro-government newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The two sides discussed the possibility of exchanging expertise
in the agricultural field, including joint efforts to improve the
productivity of sugar cane and rice through genetic engineering
and advanced irrigation machines.
</P>
<P>
Wali told Nong that Egypt is keen to implement the trade
agreements and the education cooperation pact signed recently with
Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
Both Wali and Nong underlined the importance of consolidating
the parliamentary cooperation between Egypt and Vietnam.

<HEADLINE> International Truce Panel Convenes in South </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 13 (Xinhua) -- The international monitoring group
overseeing the cease-fire in south Lebanon Tuesday started its
first session since Israel launched a massive air strike on
Lebanon in June.
</P>
<P>
The group is to hear a record 37 complaints, of which 16 filed
by Lebanon and 21 by Israel at Naqoura near Israeli border, where
the United Nations peacekeeping force is headquartered.
</P>
<P>
The majority of the protests stems from the violence last
month in which Israel warplanes killed 10 Lebanese and destroyed
the country's two power stations, a telephone relay station and
three bridges.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese President Emile Lahoud instructed the Lebanese
delegation to press for a condemnation of Israeli air raids.
</P>
<P>
But a Western diplomat source expected the meeting to be
concluded swiftly with an accusation on both Israel and Lebanese
guerrillas of violating the cease-fire agreement reached by two
sides.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-brokered deal, which ended the 16-day Israeli blitz
on Lebanon in April 1996, prohibits any attacks from or on
civilian targets in both countries.
</P>
<P>
The panel, consisting of representatives from the United
States, France, Syria, Lebanon and Israel, was established to
monitor the implementation of the agreement, but has no power to
act.
</P>
<P>
Former Israeli government of Benjamin Netanyahu, which launched
last month's raid, believed the panel useless for curbing violence
in south Lebanon and left the meeting to be handled by the new
government under Ehud Barak.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-declared security zone in south Lebanon in
1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from Lebanese
guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanon's resistance movement spearheaded by the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, has been fighting to
oust Israeli forces and its ally South Lebanon Army out of the
country.

<P>
ABU DHABI, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC)
countries are considering a unified system of traffic penalties in
their efforts to stamp out reckless driving.
</P>
<P>
Under the planned system, if a driver registered in the United
Arab Emirate (UAE) commits an offense in any of the other five
countries, namely Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar and Bahrain,
the penalty will be imposed on him, the Gulf News daily reported
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A computer record will register where and when the offense
takes place and motorists who are repeatedly stopped for traffic
violations could lose their license.
</P>
<P>
According to UAE traffic department officials, the issue will
be discussed at the next annual meeting of GCC heads of traffic in
Saudi Arabia. The meeting was expected to be held next year.
</P>
<P>
The implementation of the system will help reduce road
accidents, which are a major cause of deaths in the region, the
newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The officials also confirmed reports that the UAE will ban the
use of hand-held mobile phones while driving as of October 1.
</P>
<P>
Drivers who want to make phone calls on the road will have to
use hands-free sets, together with microphones and speakers, the
officials said.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 13 (Xinhua) -- The United States government
has proposed informally that South African President Thabo Mbeki
visit Washington in August this year, the Business Day newspaper
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
No official invitation has been issued to avoid any appearance
of a snub should Mbeki demur, the paper said. However, the matter
is being discussed by diplomats in both countries. August 12 to
13 are the dates on offer.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here are worried that the proposal may be jumping the
gun, coming so soon after Mbeki's inauguration and at a time when
his first priority for official travel would logically be Africa,
the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Although the U.S. Congress is in recess in August, one U.S.
official said, Congress members would change their holiday plans
and return to Washington if Mbeki visited the U.S.
</P>

Meanwhile, Mbeki and U.S. Vice-President Al Gore are due to
meet in New York in late September when Mbeki attends the opening
of the United Nations General Assembly.

<P>
BEIRUT, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese living standard measured
by real per-capita income improved to 5,940 U.S. dollars compared
with last year's 4,977 dollars, a United Nations report said.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Star Tuesday quoted the report as saying that the
longevity in Lebanon rose from 69.3 years to 69.9. In addition,
the country's literacy dropped from 92.4 percent in 1998 to 84.4
percent this year.
</P>
<P>
In the ninth annual U.N. Human Development Report which listed
174 countries, Lebanon has dropped from 1998's 66 to 69 this year
in terms of life expectancy, educational attainment and adjusted
real income.
</P>
<P>
"It's the application of new measurements and data which
resulted in Lebanon's lower standing," said Yves de San, the
U.N.'s resident coordinator in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
"Had the same methodology and data been applied as last year,
Lebanon's ranking would have actually been 57. So, we are actually
better off this year," he added.
</P>
<P>
Canada topped the list for the sixth consecutive year.
</P>
<P>
In the Middle East, Lebanon ranked higher than Jordan, Syria
and Egypt, but came behind Libya, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar,
Bahrain and Kuwait.

BEIJING, July 13 (Xinhua) -- China and Australia announced here
today that they have concluded bilateral negotiations on all
issues concerning China's admission into the World Trade
Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
The two sides said in a joint press communique issued here that
they have "decided to conclude their overall bilateral

</P>
<P>
The joint press communique said that China and Australia
confirmed the outcome of bilateral WTO negotiations during
Australian Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade Tim
Fischer's visit to China last May.
</P>
<P>
By announcing the conclusion of bilateral talks on China's WTO
accession, Australia has become the second major country, after
Japan, to complete bilateral WTO negotiations with China. Japan
and China announced the conclusion of their talks last Friday.
</P>
<P>
China's bid to enter the multi-lateral trade organization has
lasted for 13 years, and thus far China has completed bilateral
negotiations on WTO membership with a dozen member states.
</P>
<P>
China's bid made significant progress during Premier Zhu Rongji
's visit to the United States last spring when the U.S.
administration voiced firm support for China's entry into the WTO
in 1999.
</P>
<P>
However, the U.S.-led NATO's attack on the Chinese embassy in
Belgrade on May 8 resulted in a standstill of the talks between
China and the United States.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S.-led missile attack against the Chinese embassy in
Belgrade has damaged the good atmosphere of negotiations. Only
after U.S.-led NATO has made a response satisfactory to China and
a good atmosphere is reinstated can talks be resumed," Trade
Minister Shi Guangsheng said.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Firms Strive for Operating Tanzania's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 13 (Xinhua) - Five foreign companies are
contending for operating the Tanzania Harbors Authority's
container terminal, according to the Presidential Parastatal
Sector Reform Commission (PSRC).
</P>
<P>
The commission has invited all short-listed potential investors
to collect bidding documents and to submit technical bids by
September this year, the Guardian newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Executive Chairman of the reform commission, John Rubambe, said
Monday that the winning bidder or consortium of bidders will lease
and operate the container terminal for a period of 10 years.
</P>
<P>
The commission has pre-qualified five potential investors from
a list of eleven local and foreign companies which collected and
submitted the pre-qualification documents.
</P>
<P>
The five companies are: Terminal Contenedores de Barcelona of
Spain, Hutchison Port Holdings (Hong Kong), Britain's Mersey Docks
and Harbors Company, International Container Terminal Services Inc
(the Philippines), and A.P. Moller of Denmark.
</P>
<P>
Under the privatization arrangements, the lease holder will be
required to market the container vigorously in addition to
developing the facility to keep pace with demand, and increase its
competitiveness, Rubambe said.
</P>
<P>
The lessee is also expected to promote the use of the container
terminal for the handling of transit cargo to neighboring
countries and to assist importers and exporters in arranging for
movement of their cargo, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Tanzanian Presidential Parastatal Sector Reform Commission
was set up in the 1992/93 fiscal year to coordinate the
divestiture of this east African country's parastatal sector.
</P>
<P>
The strategy for privatization of Tanzania Harbors Authority is
to turn it into a landlord port, which means the ownership of the
harbor is in the hands of the government but commercial operations
will be privatized.

<HEADLINE> China to Step up Popularization of Quality Grain Seeds (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 13 (Xinhua) -- China has worked out a series of
measures to accelerate the development and popularization of good
quality grain seeds to meet farmers' increasing demand following
the country's readjustment of its grain production mix, a Ministry
of Agriculture (MA) official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Due to good grain harvests for the past four consecutive years,
China has put an end to chronic grain shortages and has basically
balanced grain supply and demand.
</P>
<P>
Therefore the central government has decided to phase out price
protection for poor quality grain and oversupplied grain varieties
such as the spring wheat in northeast China, early long-grained
rice in south China, and winter wheat in areas south of Yangtze
River.
</P>
<P>
Farmers across China, regardless of profit or loss during the
summer harvest, have all come to realize that good quality grain
will bring them greater income in the long run.
</P>
<P>
"China in not in short supply of good quality grain seeds, but
the problem is that they are far from popular for a variety of
reasons," said Chen Youquan, deputy chief of the Seed and Plant
Quarantine Division under MA's Crop Production Department.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, priority will be given to cultivating and
popularizing good quality seeds, which have won state approval for
nationwide use, " he said.
</P>
<P>
To date, China has developed and approved 186 varieties of
high quality wheat, rice, maize, cotton and soybean seeds for
nationwide use, he said.
</P>
<P>
Of this total, more than 40 varieties of wheat and rice seeds
can be used in areas where the spring wheat of northeast China,
early long-grained rice of south China, and winter wheat south of
the Yangtze River are now grown.
</P>
<P>
China will also allow market forces to play a key role in
quickening the process of developing and popularizing quality
seeds, and encourage the establishment of enterprises that will
combine the functions of development, popularization, and sales of
these seeds, he said.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Muslim Intellectuals Support No Presidential Candidate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 13 (Xinhua) -- The powerful Indonesian Muslim
Intellectuals Association (ICMI) does not back up any presidential
candidate, including incumbent President B.J. Habibie, ICMI
General Secretary Adi Sasono said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"ICMI did not give support to any candidate. There was also not
back-up statement," Adi said, referring to the ICMI's two-day
congress in Bandung, capital of West Java, last week.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the end of the ICMI's congress on Sunday, Acting
Chairman Achmad Tirtosudiro said the association's members believe
there is no better and more acceptable presidential candidate than
Habibie.
</P>
<P>
"But because ICMI is not a political party that can nominate a
person, the aspirations of its members are accommodated in the
chairman's note," Tirtosudiro said.
</P>
<P>
Before attending a hearing with the parliament commission V
here, Adi said the congress did not discussed Habibie's bid for
another term in office.
</P>
<P>
"ICMI alone, as a body, did not give support to any
presidential candidates," he added.
</P>
<P>
Initiated by students in Malang, East Java, in 1990, the
association's longtime chairman was Habibie. It developed rapidly
by soliciting the support of former president Soeharto and many
high-ranking officials. It was considered instrumental in the
entry of several close Habibie associates into Soeharto's
cabinets.
</P>
<P>
Habibie inherited the presidency on May 21 last year from
Soeharto following mass riots in Jakarta, which killed more than
1,000 people.
</P>
<P>
After the June 7 general election, Habibie has been nominated
for the 1999/2004 term of presidency by the ruling Golkar Party.
He is in competition with Megawati Soekarnoputri, leader of the
Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (DPI-P) which has been in
lead in the vote counting.
</P>
<P>
The People's Consultative Assembly, the country's highest
decision-making body, will meet in November to elect the country's
next president.

<HEADLINE> China to Step up Popularization of Quality Grain Seeds (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As part of this process, China will introduce more good quality
grain seeds from overseas and encourage foreign seed research
institutions and companies to set up joint-ventures in the country,
Chen said.
</P>
<P>
More than 300 varieties of quality grain seeds have been
introduced since the government launched a program called the 948
Project, three years ago.
</P>
<P>
Of the 300 varieties, 77 performed well in regional trial
plantings, and the trial growing acreage now has expanded to more
than 400,000 hectares.
</P>
<P>
But, Chen noted, China will not rely only on imported quality
seeds to meet domestic demand, and imported varieties will not be
allowed for nationwide use until they pass trial plantings and win
state approval.
</P>
<P>
"Some varieties of grain seeds abroad are indeed of good
quality, but they may not be adaptable to China's local
environment, so the import of quality seeds should be conducted in
a careful manner," said Liu Xu, head of the Institute of Crop
Germplasm Resources under the Chinese Academy of Agricultural
Science.

XINING, July 13 (Xinhua) -- A four-week summer camp for Sino-
American cultural and language exchange opened Monday in this
capital of northwest China's Qinghai Province.
</P>
<P>
Students from American universities will present a brief

living in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the students will host a series of exchange
activities including preparing Chinese dish, sports competitions,

</P>
<P>
Fred Wagner, the camp organizer from the United States, said
this summer camp aims to provide the students with a greater
understanding of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the camp will promote friendship between Chinese

<HEADLINE> Symposium On International Humanitarian Law Opens (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 13 (Xinhua) -- China opened a symposium on
international humanitarian law today, marking the centennial
anniversary of the first Hague Peace Conference and the fiftieth
anniversary of the signing of four Geneva conventions on
humanitarian law.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Society of International Law, the Red Cross Society
of China, and the United Nations Association of the People's
Republic of China are co-sponsoring the three-day symposium.
</P>
<P>
"Today, we are here to mark the centennial anniversary of the
Hague Peace Conference and the fiftieth anniversary of the signing
of the four Geneva conventions, not only for their contributions
to international law and human progress, but also for their
principle of the peaceful settlement of international disputes and
international humanitarian law and relevance to contemporary
reality," said Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan in a written
speech read at the opening ceremony.
</P>
<P>
It remains an important task for all governments and peoples of
the world to ensure strict observance of the principle of the
peaceful settlement of international disputes and effective
implementation of international humanitarian law with a view to
realizing universal and lasting international peace, he said.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from 26 countries, including China, gathered in
1899 in the Hague for a peace conference, creating a precedent for
regulating war and peace through the convocation of international
conferences and the formulation of international treaties.

<P>
The Hague Peace Conference adopted the Hague Convention for the
Peaceful Settlement of International Disputes and the Hague
Convention Respecting the Laws and Customs of War on Land. They
thus laid a foundation for further efforts to ban wars through
international law and to establish principles and regimes for the
peaceful resolution of international disputes.
</P>
<P>
Fifty years ago, the famous Geneva Conference enacted the
historic Four Geneva Conventions, which further promoted the
development of humanitarian law.
</P>
<P>
Despite certain inevitable limitations of this peace conference
and the two conventions, they reflected the strong desire of the
people of the world for peace and against war, and they also
represented a new starting point in the human effort to seek world
peace, said Xie Qimei, president of the United Nations Association
of the People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
"Though international law has made considerable progress in the
past 100 years, serious problems regarding violations of the
humanitarian spirit have occurred, and continue to occur, under
the banner of humanitarianism," Ma Jun, deputy president of the
Chinese International Law Association, said.
</P>
<P>
Experts and scholars from academic and research bodies and
relevant official organs are participating in the symposium.

Diplomats from Russia, the Netherlands and Switzerland, and
representatives from the United Nations Development Program

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Skids Down U.N. Human Development Index </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 13 (Xinhua) -- The sharp reduction in life
expectancy caused by HIV and AIDS has knocked South Africa down
the United Nations human development index ranking to 101st out of
174 countries.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Development Program (UNDP) said in its 1999 human
development report that although South Africa's overall ranking
declined, performance improved in almost all areas except life
expectancy.
</P>
<P>
It estimated that 51 percent of South Africans are not expected
to live to 60, compared with 11 percent of those living in
industrialized countries and an average of 28 percent for all
developing countries.
</P>
<P>
The report, available here Tuesday, analyzed the changes in the
human development index, which ranks 174 countries in terms of
life expectancy, education and income.
</P>
<P>
It placed Canada, for the sixth consecutive year, on the top of
the list and Sierra Leone at the bottom.
</P>
<P>
The UNDP cautioned that due to changes in methodology, it was
difficult to compare this year's and last year's rankings.
</P>
<P>
However, changes emphasized the effect on South Africa,
Botswana, Namibia, Zimbabwe and other countries in southern Africa
of rapidly declining life expectancy resulting from the impact of
HIV and AIDS.
</P>
<P>
Among African countries, only Libya is ranked ahead of South
Africa at the 65th, which falls immediately behind Albania, but
ahead of Indonesia, India, Azerbaijan and most African countries
including Zimbabwe, Tunisia, Egypt, Morocco and Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
This year's report focused on the negative effects of
globalization and proposed mechanisms to bring "globalization back
on track" and "to make globalization work for people".
</P>
<P>
It showed widening disparities between developing and developed
 countries as well as the growing gap between rich and poor.
</P>
<P>
One fifth of the world's population living in the
highest-income countries have 86 percent of the world's gross
domestic product.
</P>
<P>
The report called for measures to restructure and ensure
greater accountability of international institutions such as the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Trade Organization
(WTO), and to ensure that the developing countries have a more
effective voice in the WTO.
</P>
<P>
It also proposed that developing countries adopt regional
frameworks covering minimum labor and environmental standards to
help ensure protection "against the undermining influence of
global competition".
</P>
<P>
The UNDP insisted that the report, which backed IMF moves to
sell gold reserves to finance debt relief for poor countries, was
not an attempt to oppose globalization or Bretton Woods policies.
Its focus was to ensure that the benefits derived from
globalization were shared equitably.

SNOW DRAGON SHIP, July 13 (Xinhua) -- As the Chinese ship Snow
Dragon carrying 124 scientists and journalists nears the Arctic
Circle, enthusiasm for China's first research expedition to the
North Pole is surging in the country.
</P>
<P>
More than twenty reporters representing 13 newspapers, news
agencies, and TV and radio stations are aboard ship and have been
transmitting a great many stories about the expedition.
</P>
<P>
This is China's first government-sponsored research expedition
to the Arctic, and signals a notable achievement for Chinese
scientific research, said Zhang Dengyi, director of the State
Oceanic Administration.
</P>
<P>
The research data gathered by the expedition will be collected
at the State Archives Bureau and the China Revolutionary Museum.
</P>
<P>
Experts say this Arctic research is of great importance to
China, as the Arctic region is believed to influence global
climate changes, and the data is expected to help China increase
the accuracy of its forecasting of floods and other natural
disasters.
</P>
<P>
The popularization of oceanic knowledge has increased the
interest of the ordinary Chinese in the expedition. In a letter
written to a journalist aboard the Snow Dragon, one Chinese
citizen said that the spirit of exploration represented by this
North Pole voyage is the common treasure of the whole world.

<HEADLINE> Pacific Islanders Lag Behind Rest of Population in New Zealand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Pacific islanders in New
Zealand, like Maoris, are worse off in employment, income, health,
education and housing than the rest of the population and there is
little sign that things will get better, an official report
published here Tuesday shows.
</P>
<P>
The report by the Pacific Island Affairs Ministry of New
Zealand on the social and economic status of Pacific islanders
said there are significant gaps between islanders and the rest of
the population.
</P>
<P>
There is little indication that the position of Pacific Island
communities will get much better in key areas in the short to
medium term, it added.
</P>
<P>
"The urgency of these issues cannot be understated. Many areas
are in a state of crisis," the report said.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, Pacific islanders' unemployment in New
Zealand in 1996 was 15.3 percent, compared with 4.6 percent of
Europeans and 15.5 percent of Maoris.
</P>
<P>
Pacific islanders' median income in 1996 was 12,400 New Zealand
dollars (6,498 U.S. dollars), compared with 15,600 New Zealand
dollars (8,174 U.S. dollars) for the total population.
</P>
<P>
Pacific islanders also had the highest national rates of
meningococcal disease (11 times the rate for Europeans), measles,
rheumatic fever, heart disease, obesity, unplanned pregnancies and
abortion.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, 26 percent of Pacific Island students left school with
no qualification, compared with 17 percent of non-Pacific
islanders.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, 34 percent of overcrowded homes were occupied by
Pacific islanders, compared with 16 percent by Europeans and 40
percent by Maoris.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand has a population of about 3.8 million. Pacific
islanders make up 5 percent of the population.

<HEADLINE> Congolese Refugees to Stay in Zambia Until Truce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Refugees in Zambia will not return
to Congo (K) until the cease-fire agreement signed in Lusaka last
Saturday is implemented.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) said
until the cease-fire accord is fully implemented, it would
continue to look after the refugees who fled the Democratic
Republic of Congo (DRC) when conflict broke out there early last
August.
</P>
<P>
The Zambia Daily Mail newspaper Tuesday quoted UNHCR assistant
program official Musango Kayombo as saying that although the
cease-fire pact had been signed, it was too early for the UNHCR to
consider repatriating the refugees because it was not clear
whether peace would be restored immediately.
</P>
<P>
Kayombo said that the UNHCR would only think of repatriating
the refugees when the restoration of peace in the third largest
African country becomes more certain.
</P>
<P>
"We are not in a hurry to send the refugees back to their
country. We would like to make sure that they are returning home
to peace," he said.
</P>
<P>
Kayombo said the UNHCR would visit affected places to assess
the situation and make sure that peace is in place before
repatriating the refugees.
</P>
<P>
Currently, there are nearly 70,000 Congolese refugees in
Zambia, mainly in the provinces of North-Western, Luapula,
Northern and Western while Lusaka and the Copperbelt also host
some.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Police Enforce New Transport Rules Strictly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan police have impounded over
200 public service vehicles in its move to ensure that the
newly-introduced Transport Licensing Board (TLB) rules were
adhered to.
</P>
<P>
The country-wide crackdown on those defiant vehicles known as
"matatus" was taken shortly after a bus strike in protest against
TLB regulations which require a new license fizzled out Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Kenya's major newspapers reported Tuesday that more than 4,000
matatu owners in Kenyan capital Nairobi crowded government offices
to apply for the new certificates Monday.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan Traffic Commandant Samwel Angote issued a stern warning
that police countrywide will deal firmly with any private-owned
vehicles that would be found violating the TLB rules.
</P>
<P>
A three-month road license costs matatu owners 2,000 shillings
(about 28 U.S. dollars) and an annual license from 2,000 shillings
to 4,000 shillings (about 56 dollars), according to the TLB Act.
</P>
<P>
Matatu owners had complained that the new rules would put them
out of business.
</P>
<P>
However, Kenyan traffic authorities said that the fee for a new
license would cover advance tax, insurance fee and a public
service vehicle sticker, which enable matatu owners to compensate
victims of road accidents.
</P>
<P>
Just for the past two weeks, matatu-involved accidents have
reportedly claimed more than 30 lives in this east African
country.

<HEADLINE> World Cup Title Brings U.S. Women's Team $1 Million Bonus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 12 (Xinhua) -- After winning the World Cup
trophy, the U.S. women's soccer squad won something really
tangible today: one million U.S. dollars cash.
</P>
<P>
In a thank you gesture for winning the cup, the U.S. Soccer
Federation is giving the team $1 million - up from $250,000.
</P>
<P>
The players were stunned. "We heard it might be hefty, but not
this much," forward Tiffeny Milbrett said.
</P>
<P>
Divided among 20 players, the amount comes to $50,000 a player.
Milbrett, however, said the team will vote shares to support
personnel, such as loyal intern Lori Spitler.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Soccer Federation President Robert Contiguglia said the
bonus was only right, because the tournament World Cup drew more
than 650,000 fans and made a surplus.
</P>
<P>
The players partied into the early hours Sunday but showed no
fatigue later in the day for events at Disneyland and in downtown
Los Angeles. They are in New York today, and all the talk shows
want them.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Meets with Romanian Guest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jiang recalled his state visit to Romania in 1996, and said he
was deeply impressed by the warm hospitality he received there. He
also referred to Romanian President Emil Constantinescu's visit to
China in 1997, during which the two leaders held fruitful talks in
a candid and cordial atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
This year marks the 50th anniversary of diplomatic ties between
the two countries, and their friendship over half a century has
been deeply rooted in the hearts of the two peoples, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
He added that bilateral cooperation in the political, economic,
and cultural fields have also expanded, and stressed this is not
only the common wish of the leaders of both countries, but also
the unanimous aspiration of the two peoples.
</P>
<P>
Jiang described Romania as one of China's important European
cooperative partners, and said China respects the development
course chosen by the Romanian people, and is willing to establish
a stable, long-term and comprehensive friendship geared to the
21st century and based on the principle of mutual respect,
equality, mutual benefit, and non-interference into each other's
internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
Diaconescu, who is also chairman of the Romanian National
Peasants' Party, said the current visit, first ever for him, to
China has left him with a deep impression.
</P>
<P>
He said China is a friend of Romania, and although political
changes have taken place in Romania in recent years, its friendly
policy toward China remains intact. Romania is eager to continue
its friendship with China, which has been fostered through decades
of effort, and to strengthen bilateral cooperation and mutual
support in international affairs.

<HEADLINE> China's Role Important to WTO: Australian FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Australia believes that China will
"substantially strengthen the operation" of the World Trade
Organization (WTO) when it becomes member of the global trading
system, Foreign Minister Alexander Downer said here today.
</P>
<P>
Prior to his departure for Shanghai at noon, Downer told a
press conference that Australia does see China's accession to the
WTO as a very important international objective in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Downer arrived in Beijing Sunday for a five-day official visit.
During his stay here, Chinese President Jiang Zemin met with him.
The Australian foreign minister also had separate talks with
Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan and Foreign Trade Minister
Shi Guangsheng.
</P>
<P>
"We are satisfied now with the terms of Sino-Australian
bilateral negotiations on China's accession to the WTO," Downer
said.
</P>
<P>
"This deal we have done with China will give Australia
substantial access to the Chinese market, and we believe that
China, as a member of the WTO, will substantially strengthen the
operation of the global trading system," he added.
</P>
<P>
Trade volume between the two countries exceeded five billion U.
S. dollars worth last year. Australia is China's 9th largest trade
partner, and China is Australia's 5th largest trade partner.
</P>
<P>
"I have been pleased with the visit, and I regard the visit as
a complete success," the Australian foreign minister said.
</P>
<P>
He also extended a welcome to the approval by China to list
Australia as a destination for Chinese tourists, saying: "This
will lead to not only an upsurge in the number of tourists going
to Australia, but it will also help to develop the people-to-
people contacts and understanding between both peoples."
</P>
<P>
According to him, strong bilateral relationships are based on
mutual understanding between both governments and communities of
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The Australian foreign minister said the next round of human
rights dialog between the two countries is expected to take place
next month in Beijing. "We are very positive about the way the
dialog is developing," he said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Research Ship Navigation Guided by Satellite System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SNOW DRAGON, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists will adopt
a satellite guidance system developed domestically to navigate a
Chinese research ship on the Arctic Ocean.
</P>
<P>
The shipboard meteorological satellite processing system will
assist the Xuelong (Snow Dragon) Expedition Ship, carrying 124
scientists and journalists on an expedition to the North Pole, to
move along the correct route to the Pole.
</P>
<P>
The ship will soon enter the Arctic Ocean after a journey of
more than 3,560 nautical miles which began in Shanghai at the
beginning of July.
</P>
<P>
The system operators aboard the Xuelong can position themselves
at any moment according to cloud pictures transmitted by
meteorological satellites, explained Dr. Xie Simei, who led the
development of the system which was sponsored by the State Oceanic
Environmental Forecast Center and the China Aerospace Corporation.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Xie, who is also aboard to supervise meteorological and ice-
forecasting functions for the Xuelong's maiden voyage to the North
Pole, said the system is able to operate under adverse
circumstances, including as extremely high or low temperatures and
violent vibrations.
</P>
<P>
The system was proven effective during two expeditions to the
South Pole by Chinese scientists, helping the research ships to
shorten the voyages and save time and fuel, Xie said.
</P>
<P>
"I would like to see a bright future for the application of the
system in China aboard several thousand ocean-going cargo vessels
and research ships," she added.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Gets 3.2b Dollars of Local Investment Offers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 13 (Xinhua) -- The Board of Investment (BOI) of
Bangladesh received local investment offers amounting to around
155 billion taka (about 3.2 billion U.S. dollars) in the June
1996- June 1999 period, press reports said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The offers were received against 4,230 projects in the period
with an estimated employment opportunities for more than 550,000
people, BOI sources were quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The rate of registration of the local investment with the BOI
during the three years grew 1.77 times over that of the five
previous years.
</P>
<P>
Now the BOI is conducting a survey on 2,695 projects registered
between June 1996 and June 1998 to assess the rate of
implementation, they said, adding that among the 1,094 projects
recently surveyed by the BOI, 438 projects are already in
operation, 112 are to go into production soon and the rest in
different phases of implementation.
</P>
<P>
The BOI sources attributed the increase to the facilitating
steps taken by the government to raise the local investment.
</P>
<P>
Banks and financial institutions disbursed long-term loans for
new industries to the tune of 7.98 billion taka (about 164.5
million dollars) in 1996, and the similar disbursement soared to
nearly 10.3 billion taka (about 212.4 million dollars) in 1997 and
11.4 billion taka (about 235.1 million dollars) in 1998, they
stated.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government has also permitted two banks to float
a government guaranteed bond and to sell bonds to mobilize
resources for industrial investment.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the government has also taken up a 46-million-dollar
project for the development of the financial institutions with the
assistance of the World Bank, which will provide 40 million
dollars for industrial investment through the financial
institutions.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Begins Exporting Cattle to Malaysia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 13 (Xinhua) -- After decades of livestock import,
Thailand is now exporting Thai-bred cows to its Asian neighbors
and the first batch of cows has been shipped to Malaysia by truck,
the Bangkok Post said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Chockchai Group of Thailand will deliver 200 heifers to
Malaysia this year, the newspaper quoted Choak Bulakul, president
of the group as saying.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia expects to import a total of 500 heifers from Thailand
in the near term.
</P>
<P>
Choak said Thailand has reached a stage where other countries
are recognizing the ability of Thai farmers as
international-standard producers of cows.
</P>
<P>
He said Malaysia has turned to Thailand rather than traditional
suppliers such as New Zealand and Australia because the animals in
Thailand are better suited to its tropical climate, environment
and farm management.
</P>
<P>
Besides, Thailand gains an export advantage due to cheaper
transport costs, he said.
</P>
<P>
Choak suggested the government strengthen Thailand's position
as a key livestock supplier in the region.
</P>
<P>
Chochai Group's farm was the first in Asia that successfully
carried out embryo transfers in 1985.

TAIYUAN, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Chinese archaeologists have
unearthed 180 valuable funeral objects while excavating a 2,000-
year-old tomb in north China's Shanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
The unearthed cultural relics include bronze and jade wares,
weapons, musical instruments, coins, and carriage parts dating the
Warring States Period (475-221 B.C.).
</P>
<P>
The archaeologists said that it is unusual to unearth such a
great number of items from a single tomb, which was protected by a
thick layer of anti-theft stone.
</P>
<P>
The tomb, discovered in Changzi county, is 12 meters under the
earth and is exquisitely designed. The corpse is in a fully rotten
state but the archaeologists have picked up a jade mask which is
believed to have been used for protecting the face of corpse.
</P>
<P>
The discovery is important for the study of the Warring States,
a chaotic period of time prior to the first unification of China
in 221 B.C., the archaeologists said.

<HEADLINE> White House Raps Republicans Over Tax Cut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 12 (Xinhua) -- The White House slammed
Republican lawmakers on Monday for proposing to cut taxes by some
800 billion dollars over the next decade, saying the proposals are
dangerous and potentially explosive.
</P>
<P>
President Clinton sent his top aides to criticize the
Republican proposals hours before he was to meet Republican Senate
majority leader Trent Lott, House Speaker Dennis Hastert and House
Majority Leader Dick Armey to discuss how to use 2.9 trillion
dollars in projected budget surpluses over the next decade.
</P>
<P>
"It's puzzling, disturbing and disappointing that the
Republicans now put forward a tax cut plan that leaves zero for
Medicare over a 10-year period," said Gene Sperling, who chairs
the White House's National Economic Council.
</P>
<P>
Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers said America's prosperity
would be "put at risk by the dangerous reversal of course that
would be represented by huge tax cuts."
</P>
<P>
The proposals would swell the national debt, erode expected
budget surpluses and fail to provide money to meet existing
obligations, he said. "The tax cuts are potentially explosive."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Republican leaders questioned whether President
Clinton was looking for partisan fights rather than legislative
solutions.
</P>
<P>
"I'm still trying to figure out if he really wants to get
things done -- cooperate on Social Security, Medicare, taxes, even
trade -- or is he going to go the partisan route," Trent Lott said
in an interview.
</P>
<P>
The Republicans said Clinton is more interested in spending the
surpluses than in returning some of it to the taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
The exchange of criticisms between the two sides has soured
Clinton's meeting with the Republicans on Monday evening, which
was mainly to discuss Clinton's plans to reform Medicare that
offers health insurance to 38 million elderly Americans.
</P>
<P>
White House has proposed spending about 374 billion dollars on
Medicare, about 127 billion dollars more on defense and about 200
billion dollars more on other domestic programs, leaving 250
billion dollars for targeted tax cuts and 132 billion for interest
payments.
</P>
<P>
Republican proposals under discussion include a House plan to
cut taxes by 864 billion dollars over the next 10 years, chiefly
through a 10 percent reduction in income tax rates, and a Senate
plan to cut taxes by nearly 800 billion dollars over 10 years.

<P>
LONDON, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Jordan Formula One team chief Eddie
Jordan on Monday said he hoped Damon Hill's fifth-place finish at
Sunday's British Grand Prix was enough motivation to keep the
former world drivers' champion racing.
</P>
<P>
Jordan said: "After Damon's performance I am not so sure he
will want to stop", "It is up to him but the team is behind him
and would like him to continue if he can drive the way he drove (
at Silverstone)."
</P>
<P>
38-year-old Hill hinted at quitting immediately after crashing
out of the French GP last month and was still undecided about
racing at Silverstone until days before Sunday's race.
</P>
<P>
The British Grand Prix was expected to the last for the 1996
world champion but, with testing scheduled for Wednesday in Italy,
Hill still hasn't notified the team of his decision.

<HEADLINE> Sixty Percent of Government Departments Open Websites </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 13 (Xinhua) -- About 60 percent of Chinese
government departments will go on-line this year, according to the
Ministry of Information Industry (MII).
</P>
<P>
So far, more than 720 government departments have opened Web
pages on the Internet to send out information about their
functions, programs, regulations and activities.
</P>
<P>
This represents a big step forward for the country's
information industry as well as for those government developments,
said an official with the MII.
</P>
<P>
The year 1999 is described as the year for government
departments to go onto the Internet. The idea of creating
electronic government was initiated by the China Telecom and the
State Economic and Trade Commission.
</P>
<P>
"The move has improved efficiency, and increased political
transparency," said Wang Yuxin, from the China Telecom, the
backbone of Chinese information super-highway.
</P>
<P>
For a lot of Chinese on the street, it is still not an easy
thing to get across the guarded gate of a government compound in
Beijing. To reach the government through the Internet help unwrap
the mysteries.
</P>
<P>
The government departments that have opened websites include
ministries of the State Council such as the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs and Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Commission, as
well as provincial governments.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Education has opened on-line schools and the
Ministry of Labor and Social Security offers information on
employment through its portal.
</P>
<P>
Some ministry officials even make public their personal E-mail
addresses on the Internet to solicit public opinions.
</P>
<P>
According to the MII estimation, 80 percent of Chinese
government departments will have their own websites next year.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Sues Toyota over Faulty Smog-control Computers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 12 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Justice Department
Monday charged Japanese automaker Toyota with putting faulty smog-
control computers on 2.2 million 1996-1998 vehicles.
</P>
<P>
The department, on behalf of the Environmental Protection
Agency, filed a civil lawsuit against the Japanese company under
the Clean Air Act in U.S. District Court here, seeking to have the
computers repaired and the company fined up to 58.5 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit was filed after Toyota rejected a U.S. government
settlement offer last week that might have cost it 100 million
dollars in civil fines.
</P>
<P>
Toyota is the first automaker that has refused to settle a
Clean Air Act case with the U.S. government.
</P>
<P>
Since 1995, Cadillac, Honda, Ford and seven heavy-duty diesel
engine makers have reached multimillion-dollar Clean Air Act
settlements with the U.S. government.
</P>
<P>
"We're asking for an appropriate penalty and notifying the
court that the parameters are somewhere between zero and 58
billion dollars," said Joel Gross, chief of Justice's
environmental enforcement section.
</P>
<P>
In response to the lawsuit, Senior Vice President of Toyota
Motor Sales USA, the company's U.S. subsidiary in California, said,
"Toyota continues to be disappointed that despite our vehicles
having the best in-use emission performance in the industry, this
matter has not yet been resolved in a mutually agreeable manner."
</P>
<P>
He argued that regulators had reinterpreted their rules after
Toyota's equipment was approved.

<HEADLINE> Panama to Ask U.S. to Clean Military Bases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Panama's Foreign Minister
Jorge Eduardo Ritter said here Monday that his country will turn
to the world community for help in pressing the United States to
clean contaminated military bases in Panama.
</P>
<P>
Ritter said that Panama would go to international organizations
or forums for political support to press the United States to
ultimately take the responsibility.
</P>
<P>
But U.S. authorities refused to clean up the polluted areas
with the excuse that no technology could serve this purpose.
</P>
<P>
Panamanian President Ernesto Perez Balladares had earlier urged
the United States to make reparations for material and human
damage caused by abandoned bombs in its former military bases.
</P>
<P>
Ritter noted that two decades back during the negotiations on
the Torrijos-Carter Treaties, Panama had received international
support for the complete withdrawal of American troops and the
hand-over of the inter-oceanic route of the Canal.
</P>
<P>
Under the treaties, United States should return the Canal to
Panama and pull out all its troops at midday of December 31, 1999.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government bears moral and legal obligations to honor
these treaties, which anticipate the cleaning of the areas
contaminated by toxic substances and non-detonated munitions,
Ritter said.
</P>
<P>
The Torrijos-Carter treaties also contemplate the juridical
obligation of the United States to make reparations for the 21
victims of the explosions of abandoned bombs left by the U.S.
forces.

<HEADLINE> Hungary Wishes to Improve Ties with Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Hungarian Foreign Minister
Martonyi Janos said here on Monday that Hungary wishes to improve
and develop relations with Russia.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the press after talks with visiting U.S. Defense
Secretary William Cohen, Janos said that the Hungarian-Russian
relations grew somewhat tense recently, but Hungary hopes that
tension will be gradually eased and relations be pulled back to
the normal track of development.
</P>
<P>
He said that Hungary is pleased with Russia's efforts in the
settlement of Kosovo crisis and believes that its bonds with
Russia will also grow in that direction.
</P>
<P>
The accession of Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic to the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization on March 12 caused great
discontent in Russia. Things grew worse on April 10 when Russia's
convoy carrying humanitarian goods for Yugoslavia was held for
more than 40 hours at the Hungary-Ukraine border, which evoked
strong protests from Russia.
</P>
<P>
Consequently Russia indefinitely postponed Hungarian Foreign
Minister's trip to Russia originally scheduled for late May.
</P>
<P>
In early July, Hungary closed its air space to six Russian
planes carrying Russian forces to join the international
peacekeeping operation in Kosovo, only to further strain the
already sour Hungarian-Russian relations.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Govt Pledges to Promote Security in E.Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 13 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government is
constantly trying to promote peace in East Timor especially in the
run-up to the U.N.-run direct ballot on the future of the
territory, a ministerial delegation said Monday while visiting
East Timor.
</P>
<P>
The delegation, consisting of 16 ministers led by Coordinating
Minister for Political Affairs Feisal Tanjung, flew in on Monday
for a one-day visit for talks with East Timor leaders and U.N.
representatives.
</P>
<P>
Tanjung said the success of the ballot rests on support from
all parties, including regional state agencies, social figures,
military, police and all components of the community in the
territory.
</P>
<P>
"President B.J. Habibie has given directives on how to conduct
the poll in a peaceful, orderly, honest and fair manner. To that
end, all concerned parties in East Timor should maintain a
conducive situation and keep alert against the possibility of
security disturbance detrimental to the whole process of the poll
and the credibility of Indonesia," the Antara News Agency Tuesday
quoted the president as saying.
</P>
<P>
The visit came two days after U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
warned that poor security -- which is the responsibility of the
Indonesian police -- threatened the ballot.
</P>
<P>
Annan held that Indonesia is responsible for delaying the start
of the voter registration by three days from Tuesday. He said the
process would only begin on Friday if tangible improvements in
security were witnessed.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Ali Alatas said the number of ministers in the
delegation "shows our government's determination, our sincerity
and our seriousness to really implement what we have agreed to do
on the basis of the New York agreement."
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement signed in New York in May with the United
Nations, Indonesia and Portugal agreed that the East Timorese
would vote on August 8 on whether they accept an offer of broad
autonomy under Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
But last month Annan delayed the vote by two weeks, citing
logistical and security reasons. Annan will decide on Friday
whether the vote will go ahead as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
If the vote goes ahead, East Timorese will choose between
independence or autonomy within Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Alatas said everybody agreed the security situation is
continually improving and preparations for the ballot have been
going well.
</P>
<P>
Defense Minister Gen. Wiranto said the security forces would
play their part in keeping peace.
</P>
<P>
"The Indonesian government and its security apparatus will try
their best to create a conducive situation to enable registration
to run peacefully and smoothly," Wiranto added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, U.N. Deputy Special Envoy for East Timor Frances
Vandrell said after meeting Alatas that the Indonesian government
was giving serious attention to promoting peace in East Timor in
the run-up to the direct ballot.
</P>
<P>
The former Portuguese colony of East Timor was integrated into
Indonesia in 1976 in a move never recognized by the United
Nations, which still considers Portugal as the administering power
of the territory.

<TEXT>
<P>
YICHANG, HUBEI, July 13 (Xinhua) -- About 66,000 Chinese and
foreign tourists besieged at the Three Gorges Dam area by recent
flooding have all been transferred to safe places.
</P>
<P>
Temporary locks at the Three Gorges Dam site on the Yangtze
River have been shut down twice for seven days since June 30
because of the rising water level caused by heavy rainfalls on the
upper reaches of the river.
</P>
<P>
The Yichang city government has mobilized 1,700 motor vehicles
to transfer the 66,000 tourists, including 1,500 foreigners, from
358 ships.
</P>
<P>
According to Three Gorges Project Development Corporation
officials, ships can pass through the locks safely only when the
water flow is slower than 45,000 cubic meters per second.
</P>
<P>
The temporary locks have reportedly been reopened on Saturday
as the water level of the river has begun declining.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Predict Plentiful Mines in West China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, July 13 (Xinhua) -- A group of Chinese scientists have
predicted that there are plentiful mineral resources in west China,
which has great potential to push the country's economy in the
21st century.
</P>
<P>
The formation of the mines was a result of the collision of
three continental plates 800 million years ago, which lifted
minerals 80 kilometers under the earth to a height that is ideal
for exploitation, according to scientists from the Tianjin
Geological and Mineral Research Institute.
</P>
<P>
"This is the most typical collision we have ever found since
the German developed the Continental Drift Theory early this
century," said Lu Songnian, who is responsible for the research
work.
</P>
<P>
He said that in a 900-km strip in Gansu Province and another
800-km one in Qinghai Province there bury more than a dozen
valuable minerals, including gold, bronze, zinc, lead, diamond and
jade.
</P>
<P>
"The finding will be significant for easing the anticipated
shortage of nonferrous metal resources which the Chinese economy
badly needs in the next century. It will also help for turn the
poverty-stricken western part into a flourishing region," Lu said.
</P>
<P>
He added that detailed research is under way to unveil the
secrets of the mineral strips.

<HEADLINE> Mongolian President Hails Coming Visit by Chinese President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ULAN BATOR, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Mongolian President Nachagyn
Bagabandy has said that the forthcoming state visit by Chinese
President Jiang Zemin to Mongolia will be of great significance
for the development of relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The visit, scheduled for July 15-17, is an important event
which will promote the mutual understanding and trust, Bagabandy
said in an interview with the Chinese correspondents here.
</P>
<P>
October 16, this year, marks the 50th anniversary of the
establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The Mongolian president, who has visited China three times with
the latest in December last year, noted that it is the unshakable
policy of his country to pursue the long-term and steady good
neighborly relations and cooperation with China based on equality
and mutual benefit.
</P>
<P>
China is one of the countries with which Mongolia will develop
relations with priority, added the president.
</P>
<P>
The development of the Mongolian-Chinese relations is not only
in the fundamental interests of the two peoples, but also
conducive to peace, stability and progress of the entire Asian-
Pacific region, he said.
</P>
<P>
Pleased with the economic relations with China, he said, China,
whose trade volume with Mongolia in 1998 quintupled over the 33.6
million U.S. dollars in 1990, has become a major trade partner of
Mongolia.
</P>
<P>
Bagabandy suggested that the two countries promote cooperation
in large-scale projects such as mining, expansion of traffic links
and the construction of natural gas pipes and power lines linking
Russia and China.
</P>
<P>
The president said that Mongolia will make all efforts to
further boost ties with China in line with the pact on developing
friendship and cooperation between Mongolia and China, signed in
1994, and the joint statement on the development of bilateral
relations oriented toward the 21st century, signed in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Uncovers 28m U.S. Dollars in Corruption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's finance ministry had
uncovered 11,536 corruption cases involving 183.64 billion rupiah
(28 million U.S. dollars) from April 1997 to the end of last
month, The Jakarta Post reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Bambang Subianto said that more than 76
percent of the corruption was linked to tax fraud.
</P>
<P>
"These findings are related to the wrongdoing by various
parties," Bambang said.
</P>
<P>
Bambang, however, declined to disclose the names of those who
had either failed to pay taxes or were involved in tax fraud.
</P>
<P>
He said the government had conducted further investigations
into 6,166 corruption cases covering 27.56 billion rupiah (4.2
million dollars).
</P>
<P>
Bambang's announcement was part of the government's third-stage
report on the results of the national campaign against corruption,
collusion and nepotism, particularly during the 32 years of former
president Soeharto's rule.
</P>
<P>
Bambang said the government has revised various past
regulations which provided tax relief and other privileges to
certain institutions and companies.
</P>
<P>
The minister also announced new criteria on companies required
to submit annual financial reports to the government in a bid to
improve transparency and increase government tax revenue.
</P>
<P>
Under the new regulation, companies which must submit annual
financial reports include those with minimum assets of 25 billion
rupiah (3.81 million dollars) or those which have bad debts at
local banks.
</P>
<P>
The government stipulated last year that companies with minimum
assets of 50 billion rupiah (7.62 million dollars) were required
to submit annual financial reports.
</P>
<P>
Bambang said foreign companies operating in Indonesia were also
obliged to submit annual financial reports.
</P>
<P>
The compulsory reporting would help the government build a
strong database in designing various policies including tax and
investment, he added.

<HEADLINE> Philippines' Mayon Volcano Causes 2 Earthquakes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 13 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' Mayon Volcano
caused two volcanic earthquakes and one short duration harmonic
tremor during the past 24 hours, the Philippine Institute of
Volcanology and Seismology (Phivolcs) said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In a report, the institute said that its instruments also
observed moderate steaming activities in the past observation
period.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, ground deformation measurements showed no unusual
volcano edifice change, the institute said.
</P>
<P>
In view of the foregoing observations, the institute reiterated
Alert Level 2 for the volcano, which is about 330 kilometers
southeast of Manila.
</P>
<P>
Alert Level 2 means the public should not venture inside the
delineated six-kilometer radius permanent danger zone and the
seven-kilometer safety buffer zone in the southeast sector.
</P>
<P>
The institute also warned residents near the footslopes of
Mayon to be aware of rockfall occurrences and the presence of
loose volcanic debris that may be transported downslope.
</P>
<P>
On June 22, Mayon's mild eruption rained ash over surrounding
towns of the volcano.
</P>
<P>
Mayon's last major eruption in 1993 killed 78 people and
affected 17,119 others.

<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, July 12 (Xinhua)-- Bulgaria may reap a GDP growth of 1.5
percent for 1999 as a result of its economic restructuring and the
current account deficit is likely to account for 5.5 percent of
GDP, said International Monetary Fund (IMF) mission official Juha
Kahkonen at a news conference here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The IMF mission has completed its second review of the three-

<P>
The IMF Board of Directors will discuss the results of the
review in September, and a favorable decision may be expected on
the floating of the fifth loan of 70 million U.S. dollars to the
Eastern Europe country, Kahkonen said.
</P>
<P>
A four to five percent GDP growth and an inflation below two
percent are expected for Bulgaria in 2000, Kahkonen said, adding
that a drop in the current account deficit is also projected.

<P>
LONDON, July 12 (Xinhua) -- English Premier League football
club Chelsea defender Michael Duberry is to join Leeds United in a
transfer deal thought to be worth 4.5 million pounds.
</P>
<P>
The deal is subject to a medical but the defender is in Leeds
and it is hoped that he will sign later on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Leeds chairman Peter Ridsdale said: "Michael is having a
medical today and we have agreed personal terms."
</P>
<P>
"As soon as he passes the medical, we will sign him, so
hopefully that will be tonight."
</P>
<P>
While Duberry is set to join the west Yorkshire club, another
player is set to leave.
</P>
<P>
Striker Clyde Wijnhard has met with Huddersfield officials to
thrash out a possible one million punds move to the McAlpine
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
Now Leeds are waiting to hear the outcome of those discussions.
</P>
<P>
"We're waiting to hear if Clyde has agreed personal terms. He
has met them but we haven't heard what has happened yet," Ridsdale
added.
</P>
<P>
But Leeds are refusing to comment on the possible signing of
Michael Bridges from Sunderland.
</P>
<P>
The forward pulled out of a deal to take him to Tottenham and
Ridsdale is wary of speaking out before negotiations have begun.
</P>
<P>
"We are making no comment about that at this stage," Ridsdale
said.
</P>
<P>
"Clearly, after what happened with Spurs last week, it is
inappropriate to make any comment. If and when there is any
comment,we will say it," he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Mexican Cement, CEMEX,
announced on Monday its creation of a subsidiary in Asia, with an
initial capital of 950 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
In a communique, CEMEX, the largest cement company on the
American continent and one of the three biggest in the world, said
that CEMEX Asia Holdings (CAH), the new company, will have its own
capital of 800 million dollars, to which another 150 coming from a
group of institutional investors will be added.
</P>
<P>
Among them are Asian Infrastructure Fund II (AIG) and Special
Investments (GIC), the investment subsidiary of the Government of
Singapore Investment Corporation.
</P>
<P>
The aim of the new subsidiary is "to take advantage of
investment opportunities of cement assets in Asia", said the
communique.
</P>
<P>
"This agreement marks an important step in our financial
strategy designed to support CEMEX's negotiating plan in Asia,"
said Rodrigo Trevino, corporate financial director of this holding,
which has a production capacity of 61 million tons a year.
</P>
<P>
Trevino said that CEMEX will keep on "analyzing growth
opportunities" in Asia and the creation of CAH "will give
financial flexibility for continued attraction of investment
alternatives."

CEMEX's main partner in this new company, Asian Infrastructure
Fund II, has an asset of 1.7 billion dollars and has investments
in financial capital instruments in China, India, Korea, the

<HEADLINE> Warmer Climate Could Cause Ice And Snow In Northwestern China To Melt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Arid northwestern China could have
more water from glaciers in the next 50 years because of global
warming, Chinese scientists say, and this will be important for
China's strategy to develop the Northwest.
</P>
<P>
Water running off glaciers in northwestern China will increase
by 50 percent if the temperature rises one degree centigrade in
the next 40 years, according to Prof. Kang Ersi, of the Chinese
Academy of Sciences' Lanzhou Institute of Glaciology and
Cryopedology.
</P>
<P>
Kang has studied glaciers in the region for more than ten years
and says that, although the glaciers in the Northwest are
shrinking as a result of global warming, they are in the
hinterland and the change is not so apparent.
</P>
<P>
The change will not change by more than five percent by 2030,
but the water resources from melted snow and ice will gradually
increase, Kang says, and glaciers will help alleviate the aridity
in the Northwest and help the economic and social development and
environmental protection of the region.
</P>
<P>
China has the largest number of mountain glaciers at a low
latitude in the world, on a 58,000-sq.km. area. About 60 percent
of China's glaciers are in the Qilian, Tianshan, and Kunlun
Mountains in the Northwest and are a major water source of rivers
and underground water in the region. Over a billion cubic meters
of thawing water from glaciers on Qilian Mountain run into the
Shiyang, Shule, and Heihe rivers.
</P>
<P>
The Northwest, a priority in China's overall development plan,
is rich in natural resources, particularly land resources, but for
many years shortage of water has bottlenecked its economic growth.

<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Costa Ricas President Miguel
Angel Rodriguez arrived Monday in Guatemala for a working visit.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here said that during the visit the Costa
Rican president and his Guatemalan counterpart Alvaro Arzu will
review bilateral issues and the Central American integration.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents will discuss the situation arising from the
Sunday earthquake in northwest Guatemala, which killed at least
one people and injured 32 others besides property damage.
</P>
<P>
The most affected zone by the quake of 6.1 degrees on the
Richter scale was Izabal department.
</P>
<P>
Spokespersons from Costa Rica's Foreign Ministry said that
Rodriguez and Arzu will also look into agreements designed to
regulate regional trade.
</P>
<P>
Central America has been passing through a difficult and slow
restructuring stage in its lengthy process of integration since
the five countries -- Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Honduras, El Salvador
and Guatemala decided in 1991 to negotiate a new trade agreement
between them.
</P>
<P>
The process was affected in recent weeks by increasing tensions
between Costa Rica and Nicaragua due to a dispute over navigation
rights on the border river San Juan.

WASHINGTON, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Pete Sampras, now ranked third

Boston.

Sampras and his Davis Cup teammates were together for the first

</P>
<P>
Despite a hot streak and entreaties from teammate Todd Martin,
Sampras insisted that as a late arrival on a team that has earned
a quarter-final berth without him, his place is in doubles with
partner Alex O'Brien.
</P>
<P>
Only injuries to Jim Courier or Martin, the current singles duo,
could make him reconsider, Sampras said.

<HEADLINE> Mexico's Income from Crude Rises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Mexico's income from crude oil
increased by 500 million U.S. dollars in the first half of the
year owing to a rise in share prices of the commodity at an
international level, finance analysts said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Specialists of the Mexican Financial Group BBV-Probursa said
the amount could offset the increase of public debt caused by the
rise of share prices by a quarter point in interest rates in the
United States last month.
</P>
<P>
In December 1998, Aztec crude price reached its lowest
historical level, fixing itself at 7.67 dollars per barrel, but it
rebounded in the past three months, with Mexico's mixture rated 15.
93 dollars at the end of June.
</P>
<P>
BBV-Probursa analysts attributed the hike of crude prices to a
reduction of stocktaking in the United States for the third
consecutive week and the climbing of carbides prices in the summer.

<HEADLINE> Alesi Rules out Role as Schumacher Stand-in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Ex-Ferrari driver Jean Alesi on
Monday ruled out returning to the Italian Formula One team as a
temporary stand-in for injured former world champion Michael
Schumacher.
</P>
<P>
"I would love to race for Ferrari, but only if Michael was
there too," Alesi told Italy's RTL radio.
</P>
<P>
"I'm not interested in replacing him for these two months, it
really doesn't interest me at all," said Alesi, who drove for the
team from 1991 to 1995 when he was replaced by outspoken Briton
Eddie Irvine.
</P>
<P>
"Michael is a friend and I am fond of Ferrari, but I can't go
there under these conditions," added Alesi.
</P>
<P>
The Frenchman, currently under contract with the Sauber team
which uses Ferrari-based engines, had been tipped by some as a
possible stand-in for the former world champion.
</P>
<P>
Schumacher broke his right leg on Sunday in a first lap crash
at the British Grand Prix and a Ferrari spokesman said he could be
out for six to eight weeks.
</P>
<P>
The injury means Schumacher's title hopes are over and Ferrari
are now looking to Briton Eddie Irvine, currently second equal in
the standings with Schumacher, to try and bring home their first
drivers' title since 1979.

<HEADLINE> Hatch Launches Presidential Election Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 12 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Senator Orrin Hatch from
Utah made his first presidential campaign trip to New Hampshire
Monday, vowing to beat the Republican front-runner, Texas Governor
George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
"There's no question that I've been in tougher circumstances,
no question that I've had to fight the establishment in Washington
and there's no question I've been able to bring people together,"
he said in New Hampshire, which holds the nation's first primary.
</P>
<P>
Describing himself as the more experienced candidate and the
candidate of the people, Hatch, a 22-year veteran of the Senate,
said he could beat the Texas governor with only 12 million
dollars to 15 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Hatch noted his own experience, including his past chairmanship
of the Senate Labor Committee and his current chairmanship of the
Senate Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
He said a key reason for entering the already-crowded
presidential race was Bush's rapid ascent in the polls and his
success in fund-raising.
</P>
<P>
"Money should not decide elections. It ought to be ideas," he
said.
</P>
<P>
With Hatch's participation, a total of 12 presidential
hopefuls are competing for the Republican nomination for
presidential candidate.

<HEADLINE> Schumacher 'Comfortable' in Hospital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Ferrari team driver Michael
Schumacher is in a "comfortable" condition at hospital after
breaking his right leg in Sunday's British Grand Prix.
</P>
<P>
But the German will have to stay a second night at Northampton
General Hospital, whose chief executive David Wilson gave further
details at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
The 30-year-old was airlifted to the hospital from the nearby
Silverstone circuit to have several metal pins inserted into the
leg to hold the broken bones in place.
</P>
<P>
The hospital chief said the surgery had been successful and
that the Ferrari driver was due to begin physiotherapy.
</P>
<P>
"Michael Schumacher had a comfortable night. He is taking
fluids and had a good breakfast," said Wilson on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"His wounds are healing well and he is moving his legs.
</P>
<P>
"He will stay at the hospital at least until tomorrow," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Schumacher is regarded as one of the fittest drivers in Formula
One racing, but is still likely to miss the next six weeks of
action, including three Grand Prix.
</P>
<P>
However Ferrari manager Jean Todt told the news conference that
the accident could have been far worse.
</P>
<P>
"Michael was lucky just to break his right leg," said the
Frenchman.
</P>
<P>
"A few years ago I would have feared the worst for him but
thanks to all the safety improvements over the past few years his
injury was not as bad as it would have been then."
</P>
<P>
Schumacher's Ferrari left the track on a bend and slammed into
a tyre barrier at more than 200 kph.
</P>
<P>
Todt is confident his No one driver will return before the end
of the season, even if the team are still unsure of the exact
reason behind the accident.
</P>
<P>
"He has a good spirit," he said. "We don't know precisely what
happened yet. It was probably he had a brake problem but we have
to investigate."
</P>
<P>
But Todt refused to give further details about who would drive
Schumacher's car during his absence and suggested that an
announcement would be made later in the week.
</P>
<P>
"Luca Badoer is testing for us today, but that was already
planned, and then we will do some more testing on Tuesday before
making a decision," he said.
</P>
<P>
Badoer drives races for the small Minardi team, but is
contracted to Ferrari as their test driver.
</P>
<P>
Despite the setback, Todt refused to give up hopes of a first
drivers championship for the team since 1979.
</P>
<P>
"Eddie Irvine has shown he can win races and he could prove
more than a match for Mika Hakkinen," said Todt.
</P>
<P>
Irvine finished second in Sunday's race and is now eight points
behind championship leader Hakkinen, who did not finish.
</P>
<P>
After the accident Irvine joined with race winner David
Coulthard to criticise safety at the Silverstone track.
</P>
<P>
Schumacher's car skimmed the surface of a gravel trap and
crashed heavily into a tyre wall, with both safety features
failing to dramatically reduce the Ferrari's speed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile Damon Hill is under pressure to decide whether he is
continuing his Grand Prix career until the end of the season.
</P>
<P>
Hill finished fifth in Sunday's race but his Jordan team need
to know whether he is ending his career now, or at the end of the
season.
</P>
<P>
The Silverstone-based team begin a three-day test in Italy on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
If Hill does decide to retire, Formula 3000 driver Nick
Heidfeld has been lined up as a replacement.

<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, July 13 (Xinhua) -- A 210-meter embankment on a small
tributary of Yangtze River, which collapsed in recent flooding,
has been repaired.
</P>
<P>
The Dongjing River joins the main stream of the Yangtze near
the city of Wuhan and the city of Xiantao in Hubei Province. On

sides of other embankments.
</P>
<P>
The Wuhan Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters
organized people to repair the dangerous cave-in and, after more
than a week, the emergency repair work was completed with 20,000
cu.m. of earth and stone and new platforms being built inside the
embankments, according to Pan Rongzhou, chief engineer of the
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
The second flood crest on the Yangtze was expected to pass

<HEADLINE> Brown to Sue over 'Bigot' Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Scotland football coach Craig Brown
has repeated his emphatic denial of allegations of religious
bigotry and said he will take legal action to clear his name.
</P>
<P>
The News of the World reported that Mr Brown, 59, was recorded
singing "hate-filled anti-Catholic" songs on an answerphone
message to his girlfriend, following an Old Firm match between
Glasgow rivals Rangers and Celtic.
</P>
<P>
And he declared: "I'm not going to resign because of an untrue
allegation."
</P>
<P>
He told BBC Radio Scotland: "I find it preposterous that I
could be accused of religious bigotry because there is not an
ounce of bigotry in me."
</P>
<P>
Mr Brown has been working in London but said he had an
appointment to see his solicitor when he returned to Glasgow,
after which he would make a statement.
</P>
<P>
"Any alleged songs or tape will be discussed when this
situation goes further and I don't wish to extend on that," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"But I wish to totally and completely refute any suggestion of
bigotry and I would defy anyone with whom I've worked in football
for 40 years or anyone who knows me, to make that accusation.
</P>
<P>
"I would say to you that there is not an ounce of bigotry in me
and that's emphatic and I think that could easily be proved and I
will be happily extending my attempt to prove that."
</P>
<P>
Asked if he was concerned about his reputation, Mr Brown said:
"Anything that's detrimental concerns you a little but I worry
more about the truth and I know the truth therefore I don't have
that inner worry, I can assure you."
</P>
<P>
On Sunday Mr Brown, a former player with Glasgow Rangers who
has been Scotland coach since 1993, said he intended to take legal
action.
</P>
<P>
"I have already taken legal advice and will have a full
consultation at the beginning of the week with a view to issuing
legal proceedings against the News of the World for defamation,"
he said.

<HEADLINE> EU Compensates for Banning Canadian Beef </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, July 12 (Xinhua) -- The World Trade Organization (WTO)
has ruled the European Union (EU) pay 11.3 million Canadian
dollars (about 7.68 million U.S. dollars) in compensation for
banning Canadian beef.
</P>
<P>
Canadian Trade Minister Sergio Marchi Monday confirmed
reception of the WTO arbitration, saying it "vindicates Canada's
position that the EU ban is arbitrary and unjustified."
</P>
<P>
But the minister held the compensation as less than asked for.
"Obviously, we wish the award had been higher," said Marchi.
</P>
<P>
The minister also warned that Canada would move to retaliation
if EU failed to honor the compensation ruling quickly.
</P>
<P>
By the end of July, the Canadian government will announce the
final list of EU products to be subjected to tariff increases,
unless EU lifts the ban imposed since 1989, according to official
sources.
</P>
<P>
Canada has recently requested authority from the WTO Dispute
Settlement Body to retaliate against EU, saying EU is baseless in
judging Canadian beef to be produced with growth hormones.

<HEADLINE> Romania to Issue First Plastic Banknote to Mark </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Romania's National Bank (central
bank) Monday announced that it would soon issue a plastic 2000 lei
banknote, worth about 12 U.S. cents, to mark the August 11 total
sun eclipse and the millennium.
</P>
<P>
The new banknote, to be launched on August 2, will be the first
in Europe to be made of plastic. Around 50 million banknotes are
to be issued on the occasion in this east-European country with a
population of 22 millions.
</P>
<P>
The banknote will depict the solar system on the recto side
with the Sun represented on the left, mentioning the total sun
eclipse in August. The verso side of the note will depict
Romania's map in the colors of the red, yellow and blue national
flag, marking the country's area where the sun eclipse will be
best seen.
</P>
<P>
Romania is considered to be the main attraction point for the
viewing of the eclipse, the point of most visibility of the
eclipse being situated very close to Ramnicu-Valcea town of
southern Romania. Bucharest will be the only European capital city
to be right in the center of the totality path and also has the
only solar telescope in Europe that can be used during the
eclipse.
</P>
<P>
More than ten countries worldwide are currently issuing such
plastic notes, which were first used in Australia 12 years ago.

WASHINGTON, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Seven people were found shot to
death Monday in Atlanta, capital of Georgia State of the United
States, with the only survivor an 11-year-old boy who hid a closet
for hours after he was wounded, reports reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
Five adults and two children were found shot to death in a
house in Atlanta City. The motive for the shootings was unclear,
but police were investigating whether one person killed the others
and himself.
</P>
<P>
"The possibility does exist that one of the persons inside, who
is also deceased, is responsible for all the shootings and that
injury to himself was self-inflicted," Deputy Police Chief C.B.
Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
Police stayed outside the house for more than an hour because a
dog was barking inside, raising safety concerns. Inside, officers
found at least one weapon and bodies throughout the house. The boy
told police the shooting started around 6 a.m. (local time).

<HEADLINE> Semiconductor Equipment Companies Showing Optimism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ENGELES, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Semiconductor equipment
companies worldwide are showing increasing optimism about
prospects for business, expecting the industry to grow nine
percent this year.
</P>
<P>
This means semiconductor equipment sales in 1999 will reach
23.8 billion U.S. dollars, according to a report released Monday
by Semiconductor Equipment and Materials International (SEMI), a
California-based international trade association.
</P>
<P>
SEMI conducted a survey among 85 of its member companies in the
United States, Europe and Japan. Respondents represent about 80
percent of the total sales volume for the global semiconductor
equipment industry. Industry optimism carries into predictions for
2000 and 2001, with annual increases of 18.3 and 21.8 percent
respectively.
</P>
<P>
By product category, the survey results indicate sales of wafer
process equipment should rise to 15.6 billion dollars in 1999, 9.8
percent above the 14.2 billion dollars in sales posted in 1998.
Sales of assembly and packaging equipment are expected to increase
to 1.7 billion dollars, up 13.3 percent from sales in 1998. Test
equipment sales should reach 4.6 billion dollars, up 4.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
"The results of this survey express renewed confidence among
equipment manufacturers about the prospects for growth in the
semiconductor industry," SEMI quoted its president Stanley Myers
as saying. "Our members are well-positioned to benefit from the
introduction of advanced semiconductor manufacturing technology as
well as from the continued expansion of new applications for
semiconductors."
</P>
<P>
Semiconductor capital equipment market worldwide stood at 21.8
billion dollars in 1998, down almost 21 percent from a year ago.
The ongoing industry recovery will result in global sales of 28.1
billion dollars in 2000 and 34.3 billion dollars in 2001,
according to SEMI.
