Indonesian flag carrier to lay off 3,000 workers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Flag carrier Garuda Indonesia will lay
off at least 3,000 of its nearly 13,000 workers beginning in early
October, a newspaper reported Wednesday.
	   The employees are being dismissed as part of a massive
restructuring program, The Jakarta Post quoted Robby Djohan,
president of the airline, as saying.
	   The debt-laden airline has fallen victim to Indonesia's worst
economic turmoil in decades. With 80 percent of its operating costs
in dollars, Garuda has been hit hard by the rupiah's sharp fall
over the last year.
	   Djohan said Tuesday that the layoff process would be gradual and
some workers might be moved to Garuda subsidiaries or its
maintenance facility at Jakarta's international airport. However,
Garuda plans to sell the dlrs 300 million facility as a
cost-cutting measure.
	   Djohan said he was confident that creditors would agree with
Garuda's proposal to roll over up to dlrs 300 million of the
airline's dlrs 400 million in overseas debt.
	   ``They must accept it. After all, they gave us short-term loans
when they knew that the loans would be used for long-term
programs,'' the Post quoted him as saying.
	   Garuda currently operates 50 aircraft.

Rafter survives first-round scare
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with late match &QL; 
 &UR; By LARRY SIDDONS &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Patrick Rafter survived a first-round scare from
an underdog from Morocco, coming back from two sets down to win as
he opened defense of his U.S. Open championship.
	   Never has a defending singles titlist at the U.S. national
championships lost in the first round, but the Australian came
about as close as possible before rallying to beat Hicham Arazi
4-6, 4-6, 6-3, 6-3, 6-1 Tuesday night.
	   It was the fourth time Rafter has rallied from a two-set deficit
to win and his ninth straight five-set win. He is 10-2 overall in
five-setters.
	   Arazi appeared to be in control of what would have been by far
the biggest upset of the tournament's first two days, up two sets
and two points away from a 3-1 lead in the third.
	   But he came unglued after a line call went against him at that
point and argued repeatedly with umpire Norm Chryst of the United
States the rest of the way.
	   Television replays showed the call, on a crosscourt backhand at
deuce, was very close but it was unclear from the tape if the ball
was in or out.
	   Rafter, the ponytailed third seed, hurt himself with mistakes in
the first two sets but steadied as Arazi unraveled.
	   His serve-and-volley game took him from 1-2 down in the third
set through the rest of the match without dropping serve, and he
built a 5-1 lead in the final set as Arazi was given a warning for
his arguments.
	   ``I hate umpires, guys in the chair, I hate them!'' Arazi
screamed at Chryst at one point. Later, on a changeover, he told
Chryst: ``Why don't you just get out of here and I don't see your
face no more!''
	   Rafter just focused on the court and will play a match he said
he didn't expect to reach.
	   ``Down 2-0 I figured I had a fine vacation coming, be able to
watch Pearl Jam,'' he said. ``But I hung in there and came back.''
	   Rafter said he was too slow on his volleys at the start, but
also indicated that Arazi's antics may have spurred him on.
	   ``There were a few things out there that annoyed me tonight,''
he said. ``I wanted to make a point.''
	   Greg Rusedski, last year's runner-up and the sixth seed this
time, also survived a five-set battle of 120-mph (190-kph) serves
with Wayne Ferreira, 4-6, 7-6 (7-2), 5-7, 7-6 (9-7), 6-4.
	   Before Rafter and Arazi took the main court to close the card,
the top of the wide-open women's field had been featured, including
a spectacular victory by fifth-seeded Venus Williams.
	   The 18-year-old, the runner-up a year ago, so dominated and
frustrated her opponent, Elena Wagner, that the German even tried
to serve underhand after all else had failed.
	   ``I was laughing, she was laughing, everybody was laughing,''
Williams said. ``There was no other alternative for her at that
moment in time.''
	   That unusual tactic merely helped finish off a 6-1, 6-0 victory
by Williams.
	   Earlier in the day, Lindsay Davenport showed a muscle game in a
6-0, 6-2 victory over Catalina Cristea.
	   The hottest player on the women's tour with three straight West
Coast victories this summer and the Open's No. 2 seed, Davenport
had no problems against the world's 75th-ranked player, only
moments when things could have gone a bit better.
	   All the better for a player so attuned to what her body has to
say.
	   ``My elbow has been bothering me, so I hope I can have more
short matches this week,'' she said.
	   Davenport took just 16 minutes to complete a first-set shutout.
	   In the second set she had some hiccups _ six wasted break
points, for instance, and an embarrassing volley into the net on a
rare venture from the baseline _ but nothing worth more than a
frustrated squeal.
	   Cristea, a 22-year-old from Romania, tried to punch it out with
Davenport, but she was badly overmatched. Davenport's shots started
high and hard, clipping the lines and corners and skittering away
from Cristea. Davenport saved the only break point against her and
allowed just eight points on her serve.
	   ``I think my serve has been a big plus in what I've done these
weeks and months,'' Davenport said. ``I've worked on it, changed
some things, and I'm definitely holding my serve more.''
	   Williams held serve and more, never facing break point and
almost doubling Wagner's 31 points.
	   And then came the underhand serve.
	   It was Wagner's first serve at 0-30, and the second _ more
conventional, except for direction _ sailed wide, giving Williams
triple-match point. It took five deuces and some of the best tennis
of the night by Wagner, a 26-year-old German ranked 68th, before
the inevitable came. A forehand winner wrapped it up.
	   Wimbledon champion Jana Novotna, seeded third, scored a 6-4, 6-3
victory over Jennifer Capriati, who is in the midst of another
comeback from personal wanderings.
	   French Open champion Arantxa Sanchez Vicario, the fourth seed,
won 6-2, 6-2 over Kristina Brandi.
	   Eighth-seeded Steffi Graf, a five-time champion trying to find
the spark that gave her a Grand Slam sweep a decade ago, survived a
second-set blip to beat Corina Morariu 6-2, 3-6, 6-1.
	   Former Australian Open champion Mary Pierce, the 12th seed, also
needed three sets before beating Meike Babel 6-1, 4-6, 6-2. And
Anna Kournikova, seeded 15th, beat Lea Ghirardi 6-1, 6-3.

Pro golfer Cary Middlecoff dead at 77
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEMPHIS, Tennessee (AP) _ Cary Middlecoff, a two-time U.S. Open
champion and winner of the 1955 Masters, has died of heart failure.
He was 77.
	   Middlecoff, who died at Allen Morgan Health Center on Tuesday,
leaves no immediate survivors.
	   A former dentist, Middlecoff won 40 professional golf
tournaments and is tied for seventh on the PGA's career victory
list.
	   When back surgery forced Middlecoff to retire from competitive
golf in 1963, he had about dlrs 290,000 in career earnings and was
among the sport's leading career money winners.
	   ``Now they make that much in a week,'' Middlecoff once told
reporters.
	   He won the U.S. Open in 1949 and 1956.
	   ``He's the greatest player we've ever had and his record bears
that out,'' Dick Horton, executive director of the Tennessee Golf
Association, told The Commercial Appeal of Memphis. ``In these
modern times with so much parity, I don't think anybody could ever
equal the record he had.''
	   Middlecoff considered his 1956 U.S. Open title at Rochester, New
York, as ``probably my greatest accomplishment in golf.'' But, he
had no greater appreciation for a site than Augusta National Golf
Club, home of the Masters, where he also was a two-time runner-up.
	   ``I still love the place,'' Middlecoff said in 1994. ``I dearly
loved playing there.''
	   Middlecoff had been in poor health for several years. A fall at
his home in 1993 resulted in a severe head injury. He had not
played golf, even casually, since the early 1990s.
	   ``He was a long, straight driver and long-iron player and a
great putter,'' recalled Tommy Bolt, 82, who played on the tour
with Middlecoff.
	   Inducted in 1992, Middlecoff is a charter member of the
Tennessee Golf Hall of Fame. He won the Tennessee Amateur four
straight years, starting in 1940.
	   On the PGA Tour, he was the leading money winner for the decade
of the 1950s. He won the Vardon Trophy in 1956 for the lowest
average score on tour. In 1986 he was inducted into the PGA World
Golf Hall of Fame.

 &UR; Students protest; Suu Kyi says government incapable of talks

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ About 400 university students staged a
protest behind locked campus gates Wednesday in the biggest public
show of discontent during recent stepped-up agitation against
Myanmar's military regime.
	   Traffic police diverted cars from roads passing in front of the
Yangon Institute of Technology about an hour after the
demonstration erupted, but there was no immediate sign of riot
police or troops being called in to break up the protest.
	   The students did not appear to try to leave the campus. Senior
teachers were seen negotiating with them and shouted slogans were
heard. It was the first major confirmed protest since police broke
the brief occupation of an intersection by 200 students last week.
	   The institute, a hot-bed of anti-government sentiment, had been
closed since the last wave of student protests two years ago but
was recently reopened so students could finally study and take
their long-postponed final exams.
	   Earlier, Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi said in a rare
interview that the government may use force to resolve its latest
confrontation with the pro-democracy opposition, possibly banning
her party.
	   ``This government always believes in violence and the use of
force to resolve problems,'' Suu Kyi told foreign journalists
Tuesday. ``They never think of resolving problems through
negotiations, through reasonable give and take.''
	   Just over a week ago, Suu Kyi was described as dehydrated and
severely weakened after a 13-day standoff on a bridge outside the
capital, where she stayed in a mini-van that authorities refused to
let pass so she could visit supporters in the provinces.
	   But in Tuesday's interview at the home of Tin Oo, vice chairman
of her National League for Democracy, Suu Kyi looked fit and gave a
spirited defense of her stepped-up agitation against the government
on the 10th anniversary of a failed uprising against military rule.
	   ``They accuse us of confrontation, but I can't think of anything
more confrontational than putting people in prison simply because
they have expressed a different point of view,'' Suu Kyi said.
	   Suu Kyi, 53, who has spent most of the past decade under house
arrest or close restriction, said that the democratic opposition in
Myanmar, also known as Burma, is more united than at any time since
the country's abortive elections in 1990.
	   Her party overwhelmingly won the elections, but the military,
which has ruled Myanmar since 1962, refused to honor the result. In
the past few weeks, the NLD has threatened to finally convene the
legislature on its own.
	   The government has responded that doing so would violate laws
carrying long prison terms and result in the party being banned.
	   Suu Kyi said it was ``quite possible'' the government would ban
her party and put its leaders in jail and noted that five members
of the parliament had been detained in the past two weeks.
	   There was strong support for the NLD's call to open parliament,
she said, and expressed no disappointment that hit-and-run protests
attempted by students last week had not drawn thousands of people
into the streets.
	   ``Considering the amount of repression and the amount of
surveillance to which the students are subjected, the fact that
they managed to get these demonstrations going one after the other
showed a certain amount of organization and resolve,'' she said.
	   She accused the ruling State Peace and Development Council of
destroying the economy and being insincere in its expressed
willingness to hold a dialogue with the opposition.
	   Suu Kyi was scheduled to meet Wednesday with foreign diplomats,
a move which may antagonize the government.
	   A U.S. Embassy spokesman told The Associated Press by telephone
in Bangkok, Thailand, that the get-together would discuss relations
between her party and the government ``to foster dialogue, national
reconciliation and a peaceful transition to democracy.''
	   Authorities have occasionally blocked Suu Kyi from meetings with
diplomats. The government opposes foreign sympathy for Suu Kyi and
has criticized the foreign press and diplomats for working with her
to allegedly destabilize the country.

Wall Street recovery primes the pump in Asia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By THOMAS WAGNER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Despite its volatility and remaining question
marks, Wall Street's dramatic U-turn from big losses to a big gain
sent Asia's three main stock indexes opening higher Wednesday.
	   In Tokyo, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 103.65 points,
or 0.72 percent, to end the morning session at 14,473.28.
	   If the gains continue, it could be the third straight day of
improvement in the benchmark. But many people believe the Tokyo
Stock Market still has a long way to go, given the fact that the
index had sunk to a 12-year low Friday.
	   In Singapore, where the stock market has undergone one bad day
after another lately, the Straits Times Index climbed 1.1 percent,
or 8.91 points, to 832.24, soon after trading opened.
	   Dealers credited the gain to the overnight rebound of 288.36
points, or 3.8 percent, on the Dow Jones industrial average.
	   One trader on the scene in Singapore called Wednesday's activity
``bargain hunting at its best.''
	   In Hong Kong, the blue-chip Hang Seng Index jumped 313.22
points, or 4.4 percent, to 7,375.69 in early trading, as investors
bought back shares they had sold last week when a government buying
spree pushed share prices up, said Josephine Hui, a research
director at Celestial Asia Securities.
	   The index had slumped 2.9 percent Tuesday and 7.1 percent
Monday, the day the government took a breather from its efforts to
step in and discourage speculators in the market.
	   The news form Wall Street and from Russia, where U.S. President
Bill Clinton was meeting with the beleaguered Boris Yeltsin, had
little effect on the local Hong Kong market, Hui said. ``Government
intervention is distorting the picture. We can't use the normal
economic factors to analyze market movement,'' he said.
	   Given how long Asia's financial crisis has battered its stock
and currency markets, it was hard to imagine that Wall Street's
one-day recovery would be any more than a respite in Asia.
	   However, Monday's 512-point plunge on the Dow Jones had raised
concerns in Asia about whether the region's 14-month financial
crisis had spread to the West, especially Russia.
	   Just before Tuesday's rebound on Wall Street, an editorial
appearing in Japan's Yomiuri newspaper had warned readers:
	   ``It is even possible that the plunging markets could trigger a
global depression, which would in turn throw the entire
international economic system into chaos.''
	   Wednesday's trading on the Nikkei also could benefit from some
good news about Japan's efforts to revive its economy, the second
largest in the world and a crucial factor in Asia's future.
	   For weeks, a stalemate in parliament has been preventing the
administration of Japan's new prime minister, Keizo Obuchi, from
using taxpayer money to prop up Japan's troubled banks.
	   But on Wednesday, Naoto Kan, head of the country's largest
opposition party, reportedly indicated that he has dropped his
opposition to the Obuchi administration bailout plan.
	   Uncertainty over the fate of the legislation _ and the entire
banking system _ has unnerved investors both in Japan and abroad.

	   A week ago, Suu Kyi was described as dehydrated and severely
weakened after a 13-day roadside standoff against authorities on a
bridge outside the capital. Her doctors wanted to keep her under
observation, but Suu Kyi said Tuesday her health was fine.
	   ``They can observe me while I work,'' she joked.
	   At the home of Tin Oo, vice chairman of her National League for
Democracy, Suu Kyi looked fit and gave a spirited defense of her
renewed campaign against the government on the 10th anniversary of
a failed uprising against military rule.
	   ``They accuse us of confrontation, but I can't think of anything
more confrontational than putting people in prison simply because
they have expressed a different point of view,'' Suu Kyi said.
	   Suu Kyi, 53, who has spent most of the past decade under house
arrest or close restriction, said that the opposition in Myanmar,
also known as Burma, is more united than at any time since abortive
elections in 1990.

	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ About 400 university students staged a
protest behind locked campus gates Wednesday in the biggest public
show of discontent during recent stepped-up agitation against
Myanmar's military regime.
	   Traffic police diverted cars from passing in front of the Yangon
Institute of Technology an hour after the demonstration erupted,
but there was no immediate sign of riot police or troops being
called in to break it up.
	   The students did not appear to try to leave the campus. Senior
teachers were seen negotiating with them and shouted slogans were
heard. It was the first major confirmed protest since police broke
the brief occupation of an intersection by 200 students last week.
	   The institute, a hotbed of anti-government sentiment, had been
closed since the last wave of student protests two years ago. It
was recently reopened so students could finally study and take
their long-postponed final exams.
	   Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi said in a rare interview Tuesday
that the government may use force to resolve its latest
confrontation with the pro-democracy opposition, possibly banning
her party.
	   ``This government always believes in violence and the use of
force to resolve problems,'' Suu Kyi told foreign journalists.
``They never think of resolving problems through negotiations,
through reasonable give and take.''
	   A week ago, Suu Kyi was described as dehydrated and severely
weakened after a 13-day roadside standoff against authorities on a

As flood threat recedes, China worries about killer diseases
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ With the Yangtze River's latest flood crest
weakening Wednesday, Chinese officials warned that diseases
threatened to spread in crowded refugee camps.
	   Dikes protecting major cities were holding, but the surge this
week from rain-swollen upper Yangtze River tributaries would likely
keep floodwaters high for weeks, state media reported.
	   The heavy flooding in the northeast and in the Yangtze basin
this summer has killed more than 3,000 people nationwide and left
millions homeless, according to government statistics.
	   Along the Yangtze, China's longest river, the floods are the
worst since 1954, when 30,000 people died, about 90 percent of them
from contagious diseases after floodwaters receded.
	   Health officials are closely monitoring diseases and have not
reported any epidemics, the China Daily on Wednesday quoted Wang
Zhao, the Ministry of Health official in charge of disease control,
as saying.
	   Conditions along the Yangtze are ripe for diseases to spread.
The weather is still hot, flood victims and livestock are crowded
together in refugee camps, and drinking water is limited.
	   So far intestinal diseases are spreading in flooded areas along
the Yangtze, and to a lesser extent in the northeast, Wang said.
	   In the far northeast, the biggest worry for the million homeless
flood victims is cold weather. Frosts are expected this month, and
winter brings daily temperatures well below zero.
	   Meanwhile, a group of 80 scientists issued an open letter
calling for protection of wetlands as a means of flood control, the
state-run Xinhua News Agency reported late Tuesday.
	   The letter called for a halt to exploitation of wetlands along
rivers.
	   Many homes and factories have been built in wetlands along the
Yangtze River that once soaked up floodwaters. The storage capacity
of huge freshwater lakes along the river has dropped by as much as
50 percent because of reclamation and silting caused by erosion,
Xinhua reported.
	   Wetlands also have been destroyed along the Nen and Songhua
rivers in the northeast, where flooding as severe as this summer is
rare, the scientists said.
	   Premier Zhu Rongji, who visited flooded areas in the northeast
on Tuesday, said environmental laws were not being enforced. Like
other officials in recent weeks, Zhu said the floods were due in
part to rampant deforestation and the soil erosion and silting of
riverbeds it brings, state media reported Wednesday.
	   The ruling Communist Party and central government ``attach great
importance to afforestation and conservation of soil and water,''
China Daily quoted Zhu as saying. ``Unfortunately, implementation
of related policies has been far from satisfactory.''

Clinton returning to tip scales in search for Belfast compromise
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SHAWN POGATCHNIK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Northern Ireland's fragile
peace agreement owes its achievement and survival to a flurry of
factors _ few more pivotal than the unprecedented interest of an
American president.
	   Bill Clinton's return to Belfast on Thursday may influence, too,
whether peace prospects blossom or wither once again.
	   Mark Durkan, a negotiator for Northern Ireland's major Catholic
party, the Social Democratic and Labor Party, said both sides of
Northern Ireland's divide well remember Clinton's ``phenomenal''
visit in 1995, ``when he expressed with honesty and integrity the
steps ahead we needed to take.''
	   ``We're hoping, as we face another difficult hurdle down the
road to peace, he can help us again,'' Durkan said. ``We couldn't
have made it this far without him.''
	   Clinton's 1992 campaign pledge to intervene in Northern
Ireland's long-running ``troubles'' went against the grain of
American foreign policy.
	   The conflict had virtually no geopolitical significance to U.S.
interests, and getting involved could irritate Britain, America's
No. 1 ally in times of global trouble.
	   Yet Clinton did just that, identifying himself with efforts to
win two Irish Republican Army cease-fires and to help the
IRA-allied Sinn Fein party punch above its weight in the political
battlefield.
	   Leaders of Northern Ireland's pro-British Protestant majority _
the people primarily responsible for founding the province 77 years
ago, when the rest of Ireland won independence _ remain bitterly
divided over Clinton's determination to coax them toward compromise
with Sinn Fein.
	   But under the supervision of his envoy, former U.S. Sen. George
Mitchell, negotiations produced April's agreement on how
Protestants and Catholics should govern Northern Ireland together.
	   Politicians on both sides cited Clinton's surprise phone calls
hours before the accord was finally struck as providing vital
reassurance.
	   During this visit, Clinton will be expected again to put
positive pressure on the two most polarized supporters of that
accord, Sinn Fein and the major Protestant party, the Ulster
Unionists, to keep ``taking risks for peace.''
	   Even though they're supposed to become partners in Northern
Ireland's envisioned cross-community government, Ulster Unionist
leader David Trimble isn't even on speaking terms with Gerry Adams,
leader of the IRA-allied Sinn Fein party.
	   Trimble is now the elected head of the agreement's central
pillar, a 108-member legislative Assembly, which is Clinton's first
scheduled stop Thursday.
	   Adams expects to be given one of 12 Cabinet seats in a new
executive administration drawn from that Assembly. Trimble,
however, says that won't happen _ and he won't even talk to Adams _
until the IRA formally renounces the use of violence as a political
tool.
	   In Clinton's key Belfast speech in 1995, he turned the
traditional IRA slogan of ``our day will come'' on its head,
pointedly declaring to ``the men of violence ... your day is
over.''
	   In a statement Tuesday, Adams called the violence ``a thing of
the past, over, done with and gone.''
	   Clinton hailed the comment ``as an important contribution to
building the trust and confidence necessary to make the Good Friday
accord a reality.''
	   In his earlier visit, Clinton made a point of detouring into
Catholic West Belfast to shake Adams' hand on a street corner.
Clinton's openness to Sinn Fein has helped make Adams the
best-known Irish politician in America, and its party coffers have
swelled thanks to Clinton's earlier lifting of a fund-raising ban.
	   Within 10 weeks of Clinton pressing the flesh with Adams,
however, the IRA abandoned its 1994 truce with a truck bomb in
London. The outlawed group called a new truce in July 1997 to allow
Sinn Fein to enter the peace negotiations, but senior IRA defectors
formed a new group determined to press on with attacks designed to
destabilize Northern Ireland.
	   The dissidents are now observing their own ``suspension'' of
operations after one of their car bombs killed 28 people last month
in Omagh, the worst single atrocity since Northern Ireland's civil
unrest began in 1969.
	   When Clinton visits the religiously mixed town Thursday
afternoon, it will almost certainly provide the emotional climax of
his trip.
	   The only people pillorying Clinton's visit are the ones who
resent U.S. intervention in the conflict _ the most hard-line and
insular Protestants who condemn the peace process as a series of
unwarranted concessions to IRA supporters.
	   One of the hard-line members of the new Assembly, Oliver Gibson
of Omagh, lost a niece in the bombing. His disrespect for Clinton
carries a doubly personal edge.
	   ``Clinton lied to his nation, even to his own family, about his
personal immorality. Now he's coming to Omagh to tell us how to
behave and to hijack our very real grief,'' Gibson said. ``Using
our suffering to smother his own domestic troubles is going to be
hard to stomach.''

Suu Kyi says military regime solves problems only by force
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Myanmar

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ Looking fit and recovered from her recent
roadside standoff with authorities, Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi
said in a rare interview that the military regime ``always believes
in violence and the use of force to resolve problems.''
	   Wearing a traditional yellow jacket with matching flowers in her
hair, Suu Kyi met foreign journalists Tuesday at the home of Tin
Oo, the vice chairman of her National League for Democracy.
Security is too tight around her own home for such meetings.
	   A week ago, Suu Kyi was described as dehydrated and weakened
after a 13-day standoff on a bridge outside the capital, where she
stayed in a mini-van that authorities refused to let pass so she
could visit supporters in the provinces.
	   But Tuesday, she gave a spirited defense of her stepped-up
agitation against the government on the 10th anniversary of an
uprising against military rule that failed in bloodshed.
	   ``They never think of resolving problems through negotiations,
through reasonable give and take,'' Suu Kyi said.
	   ``They accuse us of confrontation, but I can't think of anything
more confrontational than putting people in prison simply because
they have expressed a different point of view.''
	   Suu Kyi, 53, who has spent most of the past decade under house
arrest or close restriction, said that the democratic opposition in
Myanmar, also known as Burma, is more united than at any time since
abortive elections in 1990.
	   Her party overwhelmingly won, but the military, which has ruled
since 1962, refused to honor the result. In the past few weeks, the
NLD has threatened to finally convene the legislature on its own.
	   The government has responded with warnings of long prison terms
and banning the party. Suu Kyi called both ``quite possible'' and
noted that five members of the parliament had been detained in the
past two weeks.
	   She praised 18 foreign democracy activists who came to the
country last month and distributed anti-government leaflets as
``brave.'' They were detained for a week and deported.
	   ``Some Burmese people have told me that they were doing for us
what we should be doing for ourselves,'' she said.
	   Suu Kyi expressed no disappointment that hit-and-run protests
attempted by students last week had not drawn thousands of people
into the streets. Generally, Myanmar's people are too afraid to
instigate any unrest.
	   ``Considering the amount of repression and the amount of
surveillance to which the students are subjected, the fact that
they managed to get these demonstrations going one after the other
showed a certain amount of organization and resolve,'' she said.

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ It's all there. The gruff, raspy voice. The feisty
charisma. The appeal to voters sick of the status quo.
	   Conservative lawmaker Makiko Tanaka _ daughter of Kakuei Tanaka,
a 1970s prime minister Japan still loves to hate _ is as quotable,
boisterous and ready for a fight as her father ever was.
	   She is also rapidly becoming one of the most popular politicians
in the country.
	   ``Many politicians just can't come up with new ideas, or even
questions,'' Makiko Tanaka said at a news conference recently.
``Some are hopeless idiots.''
	   Having a loud mouth isn't usually an asset in Japanese politics.
But then again, neither is being a woman, or having a convicted
bribe-taker for a father.
	   But a vast ocean of voter disillusionment has opened up amid
Japan's economic and political woes, and Tanaka has taken
advantage.
	   The recession is deepening, and there seems to be no end in
sight to the bad-debt crisis that has Japan's once mighty banks
fighting off rumors of imminent collapse.
	   Washington is worried that Tokyo's political procrastination
will worsen the Asian economic crisis.
	   Discontent among Japanese voters was evident when the
long-ruling Liberal Democratic Party suffered a devastating setback
in parliamentary elections in July.
	   Tanaka, though a member of that party, has often been outspoken.
	   Summing up the feelings of many Japanese, she called the party's
vote to select a new prime minister a ``garage sale.'' Then she
called the winner, Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi, ``Mr. Ordinary.''
	   Tanaka has a firm regional powerbase, and since Obuchi's
election in July has become one of the most sought-after interviews
on Japanese television, broadening her national appeal.
	   She has called for smaller central government, increased
disclosure and more public debate on important issues, instead of
the usual backdoor negotiations and pro forma voting along party
lines.
	   ``Tanaka is a capable politician,'' said political commentator
Minoru Morita. ``She is a rare type of politician in harmony-loving
Japan, the kind that loves to pick a battle.''
	   Ordinary voters agreed.
	   ``She speaks her mind, what she says makes sense, and she is not
swayed by those around her,'' said Noriyuki Koyasu, a 31-year-old
Tokyo resident who says he would like to see Tanaka become prime
minister.
	   Of course, it is too early to tell whether her growing
popularity is a passing fad or a genuine step toward the top.
	   Japan has never had a female prime minister. The last time a
woman made such inroads in politics was in 1989, when Takako Doi, a
Socialist, led an opposition victory in parliamentary elections.
	   But Tanaka comes from hardy stock. Her father was the epitome of
the self-made _ and self-destroyed _ man.
	   With only a grade school education, he worked his way into
politics by building a loyal following. By 1972, he was head of the
ruling party's most powerful faction and became prime minister.
	   But influence-peddling charges and corruption scandals dogged
him. After leaving office in 1974, he was convicted in 1983 of
accepting dlrs 3.5 million in bribes from Lockheed Corp., in return
for promoting the sale of its jets.
	   He died in 1993, while his case was being appealed to the
Supreme Court.
	   Tanaka defends her father.
	   ``He did the best he could,'' she said. ``I respect my father.
And I am proud of him.''
	   First elected in 1993 from her father's rural district in
Niigata Prefecture, the younger Tanaka is more cosmopolitan than he
was. She attended high school in Pennsylvania, graduated from
prestigious Waseda University in Tokyo and speaks English well.
	   She has also abandoned the factionalism and political
machine-making that her father has come to symbolize. That could
well keep her from advancing much further than her highest post to
date _ director of the Science and Technology Agency.
	   Factional support remains a key to becoming head of the party,
and thus prime minister. But Tanaka has no factional affiliation,
and that cuts her out of most of the more important party business.
	   For now, Tanaka admits, she has little choice but to watch party
leaders bumble along with their attempts at economic reform.
	   ``Politicians are like a group of people sitting together
passing around a time bomb to the next person,'' she said. ``All
they care about is that the bomb doesn't go off when it's in their
lap.''

Japan's highest court finds voting disparity constitutional
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The Japanese Supreme Court ruled Wednesday that the
outcome of a 1995 national election was constitutional despite a
wide disparity between voting power in rural and urban districts, a
court spokesman said.
	   Japan's highest court rejected an assertion by nine plaintiffs
who filed the suit that a disparity ratio of 4.97 urban votes to
one rural vote violated the Japanese constitution, said the
spokesman, who declined to be named.
	   The decision allows the results of the 1995 upper house of
Parliament polls to stand.
	   The case was closely watched in Japan because it was the first
ruling since the passage of legislation in 1994 designed to narrow
a longstanding bias which favors voters from sparsely-populated,
but heavily-represented areas.
	   Even though most Japanese live in one of a handful of major
cities, there are far fewer politicians elected to represent urban
districts than rural districts.
	   Not surprisingly, the ruling Liberal Democratic Party enjoys
widespread support from Japan's farming community.

Leading Australian trainer dies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Leading Australian racehorse trainer
Tommy Smith died Wednesday after suffering a stroke on Tuesday, his
assistant said.
	   Smith, who won a record 33 consecutive training championships in
Sydney, was one day short of his 80th birthday.
	   ``T.J. has died. We're not sure of the exact time,'' Pauline
Blanche, his longtime assistant said.
	   Smith was taken by ambulance to Sydney's St. Vincent's Private
Hospital after suffering a stroke Tuesday morning while preparing
for a walk with his wife Valerie.
	   He remained in a critical condition in a coma until his death
Wednesday afternoon.
	   Smith won the Sydney premiership 33 times from 1952-53 but was
narrowly eclipsed by Brian Mayfield Smith in 1985-86.
	   Smith came from poverty-stricken circumstances in the New South
Wales bush town of Jembaicumbene, where he was born in 1918,
eventually making a list of the Australia's top 200 earners with an
estimated wealth of more than Australian dlrs 30 million (U.S. dlrs
18 million) in the early 1990s.
	   Brash, irrepressible and outspoken, Smith unashamedly enjoyed
all the rewards of his early toil and his love of champagne and
Rolls Royces is well-documented.
	   Smith trained some of Australia's legendary horses, including
Tulloch, Kingston Town, Redcraze and Gunsynd. He won two Melbourne
Cups, the biggest and richest event on Australia's racing calendar,
with Toparoa (1955) and Just a Dash (1991).
	   He is survived by wife Valerie, daughter Gai Waterhouse, a top
trainer, and grandchildren Thomas, 16 and Kate, 14.

Confusion reigns over new Malaysian exchange rules
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Panicky customers flooded banks
with calls while financial analysts scratched their heads over
Malaysia's new foreign exchange curbs, which experts say could
further hurt the country's already struggling economy.
	   Seeking clarification, hundreds of expatriates called banks
Wednesday to find out if accounts had been frozen by the new
directive on converting the Malaysian ringgit to other currencies
and repatriating them out of the country.
	   The answers, however, didn't help.
	   While one large multinational bank told a customer that no
transactions were allowed without a central bank permit, it told
another client that he could make a one-time withdrawal of 10,000
ringgit (dlrs 2,600).
	   ``It's going to close down our bank's Treasury department,''
said a banker at another foreign bank.
	   ``Our customers are confused. Right now, we're confused over
whether they're supposed to apply for approval, or whether it's
us,'' said the banker, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   Confusion spread across the border with Singapore where many
Malaysians have stashed away their savings because interest rates
are higher. Tuesday's fiat said such money would be useless paper
unless brought back within a month.
	   ``I have received so many calls from offshore banks who don't
know what has happened,'' said Simon Mahadevan Flint, a
Singapore-based financial analyst who advises banks in the region.
	   ``It has knocked the foreign exchange market sideways,'' he
said.
	   On Tuesday, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad announced widespread
barriers to check the relentless slide of the ringgit. Measures
included a fixed exchange rate, curbs on trading of the ringgit and
repatriating money overseas.
	   The rate was fixed at 3.80 ringgit to one U.S. dollar Wednesday,
far lower from where the currency had been trading.
	   The government hopes to bring in 20 to 30 billion ringgit (dlrs
5 to 7 billion) locked in overseas accounts, but economists fear
the measures could choke foreign investments.
	   ``Exchange controls mean a lot of inconvenience for
multinationals and it may make them rethink and reposition
themselves,'' said Mohamad Ariff, director at the Malaysian
Institute of Economic Research, a government-funded think tank.
	   The new controls to insulate the economy from external shocks
could affect Malaysia's trade links with the world.
	   ``Trade is our life blood and foreign investment forms the
backbone of our economy,'' Mohamad said.
	   ``I don't think the measures have been thought through.''
	   Exports and imports total about 130 percent of Malaysia's gross
domestic product.
	   A staggering 44 percent of all capital investment in the
manufacturing sector is from foreign companies, according to the
Malaysian Industrial Development Authority.
	   Despite a global slowdown, Malaysia last year approved foreign
direct investment worth 11.4 billion ringgit, then equivalent to
about dlrs 4 billion.
	   Companies such as U.S.-based Dell Corp. and IBM manufacture
computers here for global markets and Japanese car makers own huge
assembly plants in Malaysia. Japan is Malaysia's largest trading
partner, while the United States is second.
	   Most of these companies employ tens of thousands of expatriate
executives, engineers and workers, all of whom would be affected by
Tuesday's regulations on repatriating savings and converting
currency.
	   ``I'm panicking. I've got ringgit here, and they're telling me
it's stuck,'' said an American who has been working in Malaysia for
three years.
	   With the move, Malaysia became the first country in the region
to curb buying and selling of its currency since the turmoil
erupted a year ago.
	   The International Monetary Fund reacted with horror and even
Thailand, whacked harder by the crisis than Malaysia, said Kuala
Lumpur had gone too far.
	   ``In general, the IMF believes that any restrictions imposed on
movement of capital (are) not conducive to building investor
confidence,'' said a spokesman in Washington.
	   Kiettisak Meecharoen, the Bank of Thailand's assistant governor,
told reporters that his country would not resort to such steps and
had appropriate controls in place.

was up 317.63 points, or 4.5 percent, to close the morning session
at 7,380.10.
	   The index had plunged 2.9 percent Tuesday and 7.1 percent
Monday, when the government halted its costly two-week stock buying
spree.
	   ``There's a number of factors boosting the market today
(Wednesday), mainly the rebound on Wall Street,'' said Percy
Au-Young, dealing director at DBS Securities in Hong Kong.
	   The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 288.36 points, or 3.6
percent, to close at 7,827.43 on Tuesday. It was more than half of
Monday's 512-point loss.
	   Analysts noted falling local interbank rates and a recovery in
regional markets helped bolster market sentiment.
	   Josephine Hui, research director of Celestial Asia Securities,
however, discounted overseas factors, saying the advance was fueled
by investors buying back shares they sold at higher prices last
week.
	   ``Government intervention is distorting the picture,'' she said.
``We can't use the normal economic factors to analyze market
movement.''
	   On Tuesday, Hong Kong stocks plunged after Standard and Poor's
slashed the territory's credit rating, citing recent government
intervention in the stock and stock futures markets to fend off
speculators.
	   The government, which already has spent an estimated 15 percent
of its dlrs 96 billion in foreign reserves, has so far stayed on
the sidelines.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in top 5 grafs with Akeyasu arriving at court, heavy
security. Verdict expected by 0800 GMT &QL; 
 &UR; By KARIN DAVIES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ARUSHA, Tanzania (AP) _ A U.N. tribunal has taken more than four
years to render a single verdict in one of the swiftest genocides
in history, the killing of 500,000 minority Tutsis in Rwanda.
	   A judgment was expected Wednesday when the International
Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda rules on the case against Jean-Paul
Akayesu, a former mayor charged with 15 counts of genocide, crimes
against humanity, torture, and rape. The trial began in January
1997.
	   The judgment on Akayesu would be the first by an international
court on the crime of genocide, which was created in a 1948 U.N.
treaty.
	   Akayesu, ex-mayor of the central Rwanda village of Taba, is
charged with ordering the killings of 2,000 Tutsis who had sought
his protection.
	   Security was tight as Akeyesu arrived at the court Wednesday
morning. An additional checkpoint had been set up, and Akeyesu wore
a bulletproof vest, as did the Kalashnikov rifle-carrying police
who escorted him.
	   Prosecutor Pierre Prosper, in closing arguments in March, had
argued that Akayesu knew of crimes against Tutsis, ``and at times,
was present during their commission, but failed to prevent them,
and actually aided and abetted their commission.''
	   The tribunal, based in Arusha, Tanzania, was set up in November
1994 but had not yet reached a verdict in any case, a gap that has
been criticized by Rwandans. The maximum penalty the tribunal can
impose is life imprisonment.
	   On Friday, the tribunal is scheduled to sentence former Prime
Minister Jean Kambanda, who led Rwanda's government during the 1994
genocide. Kambanda pleaded guilty in May and promised to testify
against other alleged ringleaders of the slaughter.
	   The United Nations said Kambanda was the first person ever to
plead guilty to genocide charges before an international tribunal.
	   All those accused in the post-World War II Nuremberg and Tokyo
trials pleaded innocent to charges including murder and
extermination. A total of 19 people were sentenced to death in
those proceedings.
	   Rwandan Hutu extremists plotted the 3-month-long genocide, which
began in April 1994. Most of the killings were carried out by
peasants who used machetes or nail-studded clubs against their
neighbors. Tutsi-led rebels ousted the Hutu government in July 1994
and ended the killings.
	   The tribunal is holding 31 people in Arusha, four of whom are on
trial. Another person is in custody in Texas. Eight others have
been indicted, but not apprehended.
	   Rwandan courts _ in proceedings condemned by many foreign
lawyers as unjust _ have tried at least 330 people for involvement
in the genocide, and 116 have been sentenced to death. More than
125,000 people are imprisoned and awaiting trial.
	   On April 24, a Rwandan firing squad executed 22 people convicted
of genocide, the first executions for the slaughter.
	   If found guilty, Akayesu will not be sentenced immediately, the
tribunal said. Several European countries have volunteered to
incarcerate convicts, but the tribunal would prefer those found
guilty serve their sentences in African countries.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Tokyo will protest at the United Nations the firing
of a missile by North Korea over Japan into the Pacific Ocean,
government officials said Wednesday.
	   The missile launch Monday has also brought the government under
scrutiny for what some see as an overly slow, fumbling response to
crisis.
	   The Defense Agency acknowledged Wednesday that it waited more
than eight hours before disclosing to the public that the missile
had landed not in the Sea of Japan, as initially reported, but in
the Pacific Ocean, just some 500 kilometers (300 miles) off the
eastern coast of Japan.
	   ``We must make North Korea understand that this kind of action
will be costly,'' Foreign Minister Masahiko Komura said.
	   Japan plans to file a protest in the United Nations, both in the
Security Council and the General Assembly, officials said.
	   The missile launch has shaken Japan and heightened fears about
Asian security. It has also served as a chilling reminder of the
nation's vulnerability to attack.
	   The first news of the missile came from the U.S. military at
about noon (0300 GMT) Monday.
	   Japan, which has no independent missile-monitoring system, did
not know about the firing until it received word from U.S. forces.
	   The original report said the missile _ believed to be a test of
the new Taepo Dong 1 missile _ had landed in the Sea of Japan,
about midway between Russia and the western coast of Japan.
	   Later, about 3 p.m. (0600 GMT) the Defense Agency learned from
the U.S. military and its own forces that the missile had landed in
the Pacific, said agency spokesman Tatsuhiko Fukui.
	   But it was not until after 11 p.m. (1400 GMT) that a news
conference was held to announce that.
	   The fact that the missile had landed in the Pacific was critical
because it proved North Korea has the capability to strike any part
of Japan, including U.S. bases that house some 50,000 troops.
	   When North Korea fired its last missile five years ago, it
reached only as far as the Sea of Japan.
	   Fukui, the agency official, said Monday's missile appeared to be
two-stage, with the booster, or first stage, falling into the Sea
of Japan. The second stage landed in the Pacific, with the warhead
falling nearby, he said.
	   A two-stage missile has two engines, with the first dropping
after it burns up its fuel and a second that ignites after that, to
propel it further.
	   ``We did not want to unnecessarily fan the fears of the public.
We wanted to wait on the announcement until we were more certain of
the facts,'' Fukui said. ``We do not think we were too slow. We
don't want to cry wolf.''
	   But others were more critical.
	   ``Crisis management gets nowhere,'' said the headline of
Wednesday's national Mainichi newspaper. TBS TV commentator Tetsuya
Chikushi accused the government of taking a condescending view
toward ordinary people and withholding information.
	   ``Nothing is working to respond to the crisis. I don't feel
safe,'' said Kazunobu Imura, a 46-year-old owner of a health food
store.
	   ``The system doesn't seem to be functioning,'' said Takashi
Suzuki, a 32-year-old temporary worker. ``We want to know more.''
	   Charges of shoddy crisis management are not new to Tokyo. Prone
to bureaucratic foot-dargging, Japan came under fire for the same
reason after the 1995 Kobe earthquake that killed more than 6,000
people.
	   More recently, Japan has been chided as a procrastinator in
implementing badly needed reforms that many feel is the first step
toward pulling the economy out of a recession.
	   In response to North Korea's missile, Tokyo has decided to drop
further talks to establish diplomatic ties with North Korea.
	   It has also ruled out additional food aid and suspended work on
a project to build nuclear reactors there with the United States,
Europe and South Korea. Japan had previously promised dlrs 1
billion for the project.

Games organizers trying to avoid investigation, says victims'
</HEADLINE>
spokesman &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Organizers of the Maccabiah Games,
where four Australians died in a bridge collapse last year, were
trying to avoid proper investigation by offering early
compensation, a victims' spokesman said Wednesday.
	   Colin Elterman, whose daughter Sasha spent 10 months in a
critical condition after being thrown into a Tel Aviv's polluted
Yarkon river when the bridge collapsed, was responding to news that
an Israeli parliamentary committee investigating the tragedy was
considering giving compensation to families before a court
determined who was to blame.
	   Eliezer Zandberg, a lawmaker on the committee, expressed hope
that accelerating the compensation process would help heal the
wounds between Israel and the Australian Jewish community.
	   ``There's no dispute about the legal rights of people who were
hurt and their families,'' Zandberg said. ``Waiting to determine
who is responsible for the collapse would only prolong their
suffering.''
	   Israel and the Maccabi World Union have each pledged U.S. dlrs
500,000 to be shared by victims' families, said Micha Goldman, the
lawmaker who heads the committee. Part of the money has already
reached some families, Goldman said.
	   Five people are on trial for criminal negligence resulting in
the bridge collapse.
	   But Elterman is concerned that the compensation angle was being
pushed so MWU chiefs could keep their jobs.
	   ``They are trying to trade off compensation for proper
investigation,'' Elterman said. ``There's no way we will buy that.
That's frankly immoral. We want compensation, but we want
resignations too.''
	   He said the families of the victims wanted the resignations of
at least the MWU president and chairman.
	   The parliamentary committee was formed in July after victims'
families threatened to wage an international campaign against
Israel and future Maccabiah games. The families had complained that
not enough action was taken to determine the causes of the
accident.

Army reinforcements patrol streets of riot-torn Indonesian town
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHRISTOPHER TORCHIA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ The military threatened tougher action
Wednesday against looters after two days of deadly rioting in a
northern town in which mobs damaged hundreds of Chinese-owned
buildings.
	   Crowds gathered in the streets of Lhokseumawe on the northern
tip of Sumatra island, but there were no reports of violence.
Anti-riot officers were out in force, bolstered by hundreds of
fresh troops called in from nearby towns.
	   Hundreds of ethnic Chinese fled the town in Aceh province after
stone-throwing mobs attacked their shops and burned buildings on
Monday and Tuesday. Residents said riot police shot and killed two
people, fueling the anger of rioters who resent the Indonesian
military.
	   ``We've used strong measures to crack down on the rioters,''
said police Maj. Amrin Remico, warning of more stern action. He did
not confirm that officers killed two people, one of whom suffered a
head wound.
	   Security forces have fired warning shots and tear gas and
briefly detained dozens of looters. At other times, they have
mingled with rioters, apparently willing to let them vent their
anger.
	   The unrest erupted Monday after more than 660 Indonesian
soldiers left Aceh in a conciliatory gesture by the military, which
is accused of atrocities in the province. Mobs quickly turned on
the ethnic Chinese, a traditional scapegoat.
	   The violence forced the military to send 400 troops back into
Aceh to patrol and help guard a natural gas refinery and other
state-run industrial sites. It raised fears that armed forces chief
Gen. Wiranto might reverse the earlier decision to withdraw troops,
citing security concerns.
	   ``I appeal to the people to be patient and stay calm since we
have promised the government that Aceh is now safe,'' The Jakarta
Post quoted Gov. Syamsuddin Mahmud as saying.
	   A total of 1,000 police and soldiers are now deployed in
Lhokseumawe.
	   On Tuesday, looters rampaged through the business district,
grabbing sacks of rice and bottles of soybean ketchup, boxes of
noodles, fans and electrical wiring. Many shops were empty,
abandoned by their owners.
	   Ninety prisoners, meanwhile, were at large after crowds stormed
the town prison Monday night and freed most of the inmates. Dozens
have since surrendered and the prison chief said more were expected
to turn themselves in.
	   ``Some have contacted us to say they will come back to the
prison after the situation calms down,'' said warden Kustopo
Widodo.
	   Three prisoners who refused to flee are linked to the Free Aceh
Movement, a small group of separatist rebels that became a rallying
cry for rioters who waved a guerrilla flag. Some shouted, ``Free
Aceh!''
	   But rioters ended up targeting the ethnic Chinese minority,
viewed with suspicion partly because it dominates business in
Indonesia, now struggling through its worst economic crisis in
three decades.
	   The riots are the worst since unrest helped oust former
autocratic President Suharto in mid-May. About 1,200 people died in
street violence in Jakarta, the capital.
	   Suharto's successor, B.J. Habibie, is implementing democratic
reforms but fears abound that Indonesia's economic crisis and the
strain on millions of poor people could lead to bigger riots.

Fourteen East Timorese political prisoners go on hunger strike
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DILI, Indonesia (AP) _ Fourteen political prisoners in an East
Timor jail have begun a hunger strike to demand freedom for an
imprisoned rebel chief and other detainees, an official said
Wednesday.
	   The hunger strikers want independence in East Timor, a former
Portuguese colony that was invaded by Indonesia in 1975 and annexed
a year later.
	   Thirteen inmates began the strike Monday at Bekora prison on the
outskirts of Dili, the capital of the disputed territory, said
prison chief Mayun Mataram. Another joined the protest Wednesday.
	   They are among 22 political inmates currently at the jail.
	   The protesters are demanding the release of Jose Alexandre
Gusmao, the separatist rebel leader of East Timor who was arrested
in 1992 and is serving a 20-year term in Jakarta's Cipinang
penitentiary.
	   Mataram said five hunger strikers fainted Monday evening, but
they later recovered after being treated at the prison clinic.
	   ``The strike is still underway and we along with a physician
will keep monitoring their condition,'' he said.
	   At least 89 political prisoners are being held in East Timor.
	   The United Nations is sponsoring negotiations between Indonesia
and Portugal, East Timor's former colonial master, to find a
solution to the dispute.
	   President B.J. Habibie has offered to release Gusmao and grant
some autonomy to East Timor in return for international recognition
that the territory is part of Indonesia.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ U.S. President Bill Clinton presses his no-pain,
no-gain message with Russia's stubborn parliament leaders Wednesday
after final meetings with President Boris Yeltsin that have so far
yielded measures to ease nuclear nerves but little else.
	   With the Kremlin and the nation enveloped in the fallout of a
wrenching transformation from communism to capitalism, Clinton's
advice is to stay the course, but be sure to pay your taxes and
your debts.
	   ``There aren't any painless solutions,'' he told students at
Moscow State University of International Relations on Tuesday.
	   Clinton's advice to Yeltsin carries the weight of the American
president's own political and personal woes. Beyond attempting to
stiffen the Russian leader's resolve it came with no offer of
specific help.
	   Together they are taking the kind of steps that marked past
summits to control nuclear arms. Two agreements are to be signed.
One aims to reduce U.S. and Russian arsenals of plutonium and the
other to share information on missile launch tests.
	   Also, Britain is pledging to provide five days' notice of all
test launches of its Trident submarine missile systems.
	   Yeltsin insisted Tuesday he would not give up on democratic
reforms or on his appointment of Viktor Chernomyrdin, the
Communist-era fuel and energy boss, to return as prime minister.
	   But the Communist-led Duma refuses to approve Chernomyrdin, and
the standoff threatens to push Russia into early elections or
dissolve the parliament if it rejects the prime minister a second
and third time.
	   Clinton faces long odds in his meetings with Duma and regional
leaders, including Communist partly leader Gennady Zyuganov. The
president is also facing reporters at a joint news conference with
Yeltsin this morning.
	   ``The past two years in Russia's life have been full of stormy
political events, great laborious work on reforming the economy,''
Yeltsin said in dinner remarks. ``Soon there were disappointments,
too, and unfulfilled hopes. But we've never lost the conviction in
the necessity of the transformations we're carrying out.''
	   U.S. officials said Russia's power struggle was too uncertain to
predict what kind of economic remedies would be embraced.

Devastating fires approach Indian reservation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ Devastating fires that have been raging
for two weeks in central Brazil are quickly approaching the
country's largest Indian reservation, killing wildlife and
livestock and endangering the lives of thousands of Indians.
	   Federal Indian Bureau spokesman Roberto Lustosa said by phone
Tuesday that the fires were less that four kilometers (2.5 miles)
from the Xingu National Park that covers an area of 2.6 million
hectares (6.4 million acres) in the state of Mato Grosso.
	   The reservation is inhabited by some 4,000 Indians of various
tribes that live in 17 villages.
	   ``So far the fire has only destroyed grassland and underbrush,
but it is dangerously close to the reservation and to virgin forest
land,'' Lustosa said. ``The situation is critical.''
	   He did not know if any of the reservation's villages were in any
immediate danger or if there were plans to evacuate the Indians.
	   Brazil's environmental protection agency placed the area on red
alert after detecting fires covering areas of up to 50 hectares
(124 acres).
	   It said it still did not know how big an area had been swept by
the fires. Press reports said some 150,000 hectares (370,000 acres)
have been destroyed.
	   The situation is further aggravated by at least three months
without rain.
	   On Tuesday, 40 firefighters were flown to the town of Sao Jose
do Xingu, just outside the reservation, 1,500 kilometers (930
miles) northwest of Sao Paulo.
	   There they will join 30 firemen from Mato Grosso state who have
been battling the flames since Monday. Another 40 firemen were
expected to reach the area Wednesday.

Dollar lower against yen, Japanese stocks rise
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITTING
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with late morning trading &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar fell against the Japanese yen
Wednesday morning amid lingering concern over the recent volatility
on Wall Street. Tokyo stocks gained moderately.
	   The U.S. currency bought 137.17 yen at late morning, down 1.05
yen from late Tuesday in Tokyo and also below its late New York
level of 139.25 yen overnight.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 103.65 points,
or 0.72 percent, ending the morning session at 14,473.28. It had
gained 261.74 points, or 1.86 percent, the previous day.
	   The dollar fell as low as 135 yen in New York Tuesday on
nervousness about the plunge in U.S. stock prices Monday, but then
strengthened as the Dow Jones industrial average recovered, traders
said.
	   On Tuesday, the Dow rose 288.36 points, or 3.8 percent, to
7,827.43 _ the second-biggest point gain in history.
	   Still, on Wednesday in Tokyo, U.S. hedge funds were selling the
dollar on remaining uncertainty over the direction of U.S. stock
prices, traders said.
	   While most Japanese investors bought it on the notion the recent
falls in the Dow may have ended with Wall Street's rebound Tuesday,
some U.S. hedge funds sold the currency on sentiment to the
contrary.
	   The two forces thus offset each other to hold the dollar just
above 137 yen, traders said.
	   ``U.S. investors seem still worried about U.S. stock prices,''
said Tetsu Aikawa, senior trader at Sanwa Bank. ``Some of them are
continuing to unwind their dollar-long positions on a large
scale.''
	   The Japanese government welcomed the more robust yen, with a top
official saying the currency was turning the tide against the
dollar.
	   ``I think a trend of correction has begun,'' said Haruhiko
Kuroda, head of the international bureau at Japan's Ministry of
Finance.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, prices advanced as investors were
reassured by Tuesday's hefty gains on Wall Street.
	   A report that an opposition party backs a ruling party plan for
dealing with troubled banks also buoyed the market, they said.
	   Naoto Kan, leader of the Democratic Party of Japan, said in an
interview published Wednesday by the Mainichi newspaper that his
party won't block a plan to inject public funds into sickly banks
if they fully disclose the extent of their financial woes.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section of the exchange was up 13.90 points, or 1.25 percent,
to 1,124.05. On Tuesday, it rose 3.66 points, or 0.33 percent.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese government
bond rose to 1.100 percent from Tuesday's finish of 1.075 percent,
driving its price down to 112.40 yen from 112.60 yen.

China detains Taiwanese reporter
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ A Taiwanese reporter was detained in
northwestern China after police found news clippings about regional
independence movements and Taiwanese politics in his luggage, his
employers said Wednesday.
	   Police allowed Lee Fu-chung to return to his hotel at about 2:00
a.m. Wednesday (18:00 GMT Tuesday) after being questioned in
Urumqi, the capital of the Xinjiang region, said the Central Daily
News, a newspaper owned by Taiwan's ruling Nationalist Party.
	   Lee had been invited by the Xinjiang government to report on the
annual trade fair held in the ancient Silk Road city, the paper
said. For reasons still unclear, Lee was picked up and questioned
by police, who discovered the documents in his luggage after a
search, the paper said.
	   Following the convictions of Taiwanese businessmen on spying
charges and the murder of a Taiwanese politician in northeastern
China, Lee's detention is likely to feed Taiwanese concerns about
their safety in China.
	   An editor at the paper, who gave her surname as Wang, said its
reporters routinely bring along background files of clippings about
the areas they are visiting.
	   Taiwan's official Central News Agency said Chinese police had
charged Lee with violating the terms of his reporting assignment,
and forced him to sign a confession of wrongdoing.
	   Independence activists are waging a low-level struggle against
Chinese rule in Xinjiang, located in far western China and mostly
populated by Uighurs and other non-Chinese peoples.
	   China and Taiwan divided politically in 1949, and Beijing
continues to view the island as a breakaway province.

Wall Street recovery primes the pump in Asia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: New thruout to UPDATE with Singapore and Hong Kong markets
still higher at midday, Japan closing higher, U.S. and Japanese
finance ministers to meet in San Francisco on Friday.
 &UR; By THOMAS WAGNER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Wall Street's dramatic U-turn from big losses to a
big gain sent Asia's three main stock indexes higher Wednesday,
despite the region's ongoing economic woes.
	   In Tokyo, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 103.65 points,
or 0.72 percent, during the morning session. But by the end of the
day, the gain had fallen to only 6.99 points, or 0.05 percent, for
a close of 14,376.62.
	   Although it was the Nikkei's third straight day of improvement,
many people still believe the Tokyo Stock Market has a long way to
go since it sank to a 12-year low on Friday.
	   In Singapore, where the stock market has undergone one bad day
after another lately, the Straits Times Index climbed 1.1 percent,
or 8.91 points, to 832.24, soon after trading began. By midday its
advance had slipped to 0.4 percent.
	   Dealers credited the gain to the dramatic overnight rebound of
288.36 points, or 3.8 percent, on the Dow Jones industrial average.
In fact, one trader on the scene in Singapore called Wednesday's
activity ``bargain hunting at its best.''
	   In Hong Kong, shares were sharply higher, also lifted by the
strong rebound on Wall Street, traders said. The blue-chip Hang
Seng Index opened with nearly a 250-point advance, and ended the
morning session up 317.63, or 4.5 percent, at 7,380.10.
	   Investors also were buying back shares they had sold last week
when a government buying spree pushed share prices up, said
Josephine Hui, a research director at Celestial Asia Securities.
	   The Hang Seng Index had slumped 2.9 percent Tuesday and 7.1
percent Monday, the day the government took a breather from its
efforts to step in and discourage speculators in the market.
	   The news form Wall Street and Russia, where U.S. President Bill
Clinton was meeting with the beleaguered Boris Yeltsin, was one of
several factors affecting the Hong Kong market, Hui said.
	   Given how long Asia's financial crisis has battered its stock
and currency markets, it was hard to imagine that Wall Street's
one-day recovery would be any more than a respite in Asia.
	   The Dow's volatility and the big losses it has suffered since
July have left some economists wondering whether the U.S. economy
could slow down and slip into a recession.
	   When the Dow plunged 512 points on Monday, it raised concerns in
Asia about whether the region's 14-month-old financial crisis had
spread to the West, especially Russia.
	   The Russian crisis, widely regarded as the country's worst since
the fall of Communism, already has begun to batter European
companies, economies and stock markets.
	   In fact, just before Tuesday's dramatic rebound on Wall Street,
an editorial in Japan's Yomiuri newspaper had warned readers: ``It
is even possible that the plunging markets could trigger a global
depression, which would in turn throw the entire international
economic system into chaos.''
	   Questions also remain about the future of Japan, the world's
second largest economy and a crucial factor in Asia.
	   For weeks, a stalemate in parliament has been preventing the
administration of Japan's new prime minister, Keizo Obuchi, from
using taxpayer money to prop up the nation's troubled banks.
	   But Naoto Kan, the leader of Japan's largest opposition party,
reportedly has dropped his opposition to the Obuchi administration
bailout plan.
	   Uncertainty over the fate of the legislation _ and the entire
banking system _ has unnerved investors both in Japan and abroad.
	   The United States often has criticized Japan for failing to
revive its own economy, and a breakthrough in the banking reform
debate could benefit Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa.
	   On Friday, he is scheduled to meet in San Francisco with U.S.
Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and with U.S. Federal Reserve
Chairman Alan Greenspan.

New Minister urges flag change
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ New Cultural Affairs Minister
Marie Hasler wants to replace New Zealand's flag, which features
Britain's Union Jack, with a new ensign based on the silver fern
symbol.
	   ``For some years I have believed our existing flag no longer
catches the essence of contemporary New Zealand,'' said Hasler, who
was appointed in Sunday's reshuffle. ``It is not just that it is
barely distinguishable from the Australian ensign or even that it
too much reflects our former colonial status. Rather it has become
over time almost meaningless.''
	   She said a national debate should be started to decide on a new
design.
	   ``Changing the flag need not diminish our English and European
heritage, but it would give explicit recognition that we are now a
really distinctive and independent culture _ one that is symbolic
of all its inhabitants, which isn't really the case at present,''
Hasler said. ``While I personally find it hard to improve on the
elegant simplicity and power of the silver fern on a black
background I would like the nation to discuss it and give the
Government a signal as to their thoughts.''
	   The silver fern is a common logo for New Zealand's sporting
teams, including the famous All Blacks rugby outfit. New Zealand's
flag features a combination of the Union Jack and stars and is
similar to the design of near neighbor Australia's flag.

Prince Harry joins Prince William at Eton
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Prince Harry headed for the playing fields of Eton
on Wednesday, following his brother to the elite boarding school
favored by royals for centuries.
	   The school is just across the River Thames from Windsor Castle,
a weekend base for the princes' grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II.
	   Red-haired Harry, easy-going and said not to be too academically
inclined, was with his mother, Princess Diana, and his father,
Prince Charles, to see William sign Eton College's historic
entrance book three years ago.
	   The 13-year-old prince traveled with his father Tuesday night
from Balmoral, the queen's estate in Scotland where the royal
family marked the first anniversary of Diana's death Monday, and
stayed overnight at Highgrove, Charles' country residence.
	   William, 16, planned to leave Scotland later on Wednesday to
return to school.
	   Fees at Eton, founded by King Henry VI in 1440 and educator of
notables from William Pitt to Percy Bysshe Shelley, are about
15,000 pounds (dlrs 24,000) a year per pupil.

Hundreds of students protest; Suu Kyi meets diplomats
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with reports of other protests, Suu Kyi meeting
diplomats, grafs 5-7

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ About 400 university students staged a
protest behind locked campus gates Wednesday in the biggest public
show of discontent during recent stepped-up agitation against
Myanmar's military regime.
	   Traffic police diverted cars from passing in front of the Yangon
Institute of Technology an hour after the demonstration erupted,
but there was no immediate sign of riot police or troops being
called in to break it up.
	   The students did not appear to try to leave the campus. Senior
teachers were seen negotiating with them and shouted slogans were
heard. It was the first major confirmed protest since police broke
the brief occupation of an intersection by 200 students last week.
	   The institute, a hotbed of anti-government sentiment, had been
closed since the last wave of student protests two years ago. It
was recently reopened so students could finally study and take
their long-postponed final exams.
	   There were reports of other protests, but none could be
confirmed.
	   Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi meanwhile met diplomats in
Yangon, a move that could antagonize the government, which feels
hostile foreign nations are using the pro-democracy movement she
leads to destabilize the country.
	   There were no immediate details on the talks.
	   In a rare interview, Suu Kyi said Tuesday that the military
government may use force to resolve its latest confrontation with
the opposition, possibly banning her party.
	   ``This government always believes in violence and the use of
force to resolve problems,'' Suu Kyi told foreign journalists.
``They never think of resolving problems through negotiations,
through reasonable give and take.''
	   A week ago, Suu Kyi was described as dehydrated and severely
weakened after a 13-day roadside standoff against authorities on a
bridge outside the capital. Her doctors wanted to keep her under
observation, but Suu Kyi said Tuesday her health was fine.
	   ``They can observe me while I work,'' she joked.
	   At the home of Tin Oo, vice chairman of her National League for
Democracy, Suu Kyi looked fit and gave a spirited defense of her
renewed campaign against the government on the 10th anniversary of
a failed uprising against military rule.
	   ``They accuse us of confrontation, but I can't think of anything
more confrontational than putting people in prison simply because
they have expressed a different point of view,'' Suu Kyi said.
	   Suu Kyi, 53, who has spent most of the past decade under house
arrest or close restriction, said that the opposition in Myanmar,
also known as Burma, is more united than at any time since abortive
elections in 1990.
	   Her party overwhelmingly won the elections, but the military,
which has ruled since 1962, refused to honor the result. In the
past few weeks, the NLD has threatened to finally convene the
legislature on its own.
	   The government has responded by threatening long prison terms
and banning the party. Suu Kyi said both were ``quite possible''
and that five members of the parliament had been detained in the
past two weeks.
	   There was strong support for the NLD's call to open parliament,
she claimed, and expressed no disappointment that protests
attempted by students in the past week had not drawn crowds into
the streets.
	   ``Considering the amount of repression and the amount of
surveillance to which the students are subjected, the fact that
they managed to get these demonstrations going one after the other
showed a certain amount of organization and resolve,'' she said.
	   She accused the government of destroying the economy and being
insincere in its expressed willingness to hold a dialogue with the
opposition.

	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Six out of nine people transporting a
dead relative for burial were killed when their van collided with a
bus Wednesday on a rural road north of Manila, police said.
	   A passenger in the bus was also killed and several others in
both vehicles were injured in the accident in Baliwag in Bulacan
province, police said.
	   Police inspector Rolando Morales said the southbound van veered
into the opposite lane for unknown reasons and smashed into the
bus, which was traveling to the northern province of Nueva Ecija.
	   The van overturned and the bus fell into a shallow canal beside
a rice field, Morales said. The van's occupants were heading to
Batangas province, south of Manila, to bury their relative.

U.S., Japanese software firms settle dispute over novelty stickers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A Japanese computer software vender known for its
``Print Club'' machines used to make novelty photographic stickers
said Wednesday that it has settled a patent dispute with a United
States-based rival.
	   Tokyo-based Atlas Co. and California's American Photo Booth Inc.
ended a 10-month legal dispute Monday by signing a cross-licensing
agreement which acknowledges each other's technology, said an
official of the Japanese company, who declined to be named.
	   The agreement paves the way for Atlas to expand Print Club sales
in the U.S. where demand for its machines, which print out postage
stamp-sized self-portraits, had leveled out at about 1,000 units,
the official said.
	   Atlas refused to disclose details of the agreement.
	   Last November, the Japanese company sued American Photo Booth
for allegedly using technology which Atlas had licensed from
ImageWare Software Inc., another California-based company. Two
months later, American Photo Booth, which sells a novelty sticker
machine called ``Sticker Station,'' lodged a counter suit.
	   The novelty stickers have become wildly popular among Japanese
young people since the machines were introduced three years ago.
	   Atlas, a pioneer in the business, has sold more than 20,000 of
the machines in Japan and also exports to the U.S. and neighboring
countries in Asia.

Unpaid teachers strike in Siberia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ About 11,000 teachers went on strike Wednesday in
Siberia to demand unpaid wages, a day after students returned from
their summer vacation, a news agency reported.
	   The teachers from 399 schools in the Altai region, 3,000
kilometers (1,850 miles) east of Moscow, said they would strike for
three days, Interfax said. Schools were closed.
	   But they warned if they were not paid 117 million rubles (about
11.7 million dlrs) in overdue wages they would resume their protest
later this month or in October.
	   Unpaid wages is a chronic problem for millions of workers
throughout Russia.

Overseas assets of suspects in Thai bank scam to be frozen
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thai prosecutors have found billions of
baht worth of overseas assets belonging to suspects in a Thai bank
scandal and ordered them frozen, a newspaper reported Wednesday.
	   The Nation reported that the assets were located in Switzerland,
Canada and Russia. No precise figure was given. The baht is
currently trading at 40 to dlrs 1.
	   The Nation reported that several politicians were among the
suspects in the scandal, which involved borrowing money from the
Bangkok Bank of Commerce with insufficient collateral and never
repaying it. No names were given.
	   The Bangkok Bank of Commerce was the center of Thailand's
biggest-ever banking scandal. In 1996, directors revealed that it
had bad debts approaching 75 billion baht (dlrs 3 billion at the
time).
	   The bank's troubles triggered a loss of confidence in the Thai
banking system that led to floating the baht a year later, the move
that triggered the Asian economic crisis.
	   So far, no one has been convicted of any wrongdoing in the bank,
though violations of Thai banking regulations were legion. After
being kept alive by the government for the past two years, the bank
was closed as part of recent financial reforms.
	   Direk Sunthornket, a deputy attorney general, was quoted as
saying that the recent closure could make it harder to locate
witnesses and documents that can bring suspects to court.
	   Rakesh Saxena, the bank's adviser, has been blamed by Thai
authorities for most of the shady practices at the bank. He has
fled to Canada and is fighting attempts to extradite him.

Marsh not surprised by England lineup
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Crowd favorite Phil Tufnell won't be
back to entertain Australian fans, but otherwise England's Ashes
cricket team was pretty much what was expected by the hosts for
this season's five-test series.
	   Tufnell was an object of derision on his first Australian tour
because of his poor fielding, a famous banner at the SCG
proclaiming ``chuck it here Phil, and I'll throw it in for you.''
	   Australian coach Geoff Marsh said he expected Tufnell to be
selected to go head-to-head with Australian spin star Shane Warne,
who is on target to return in time for the series starting in
November.
	   Instead, England brought back Peter Such to partner Robert Croft
as the front-line spinners.
	   ``There's no real surprises, not that I know a lot about the two
spinners,'' Marsh said Wednesday.
	   ``I know our guys rate Tufnell pretty highly on the test scene
but Croft bowled well for them in the West Indies and has bowled
well for them at other times.''
	   in the other borderline call, John Crawley claimed the last
batting spot over Graeme Hick, who had a successful stint in
Sheffield Shield cricket with Queensland earlier in his career.
	   Marsh said he also thought Kiwi-born quick Andy Caddick might
have added shine to a pace attack headlined by Darren Gough, Angus
Fraser, Dominic Cork and Alan Mullaly.
	   ``I guess the only surprise is we thought Caddick might come out
but really they've rewarded guys for doing well throughout the
summer,'' Marsh said.
	   Before this week's sobering loss to Sri Lanka, England had been
celebrating both its series win over South Africa and news that
Warne's recovery from shoulder surgery could continue into the
Ashes series.
	   But Marsh warned England not to get too hopeful as Warne was
becoming increasingly confident of recovering from shoulder
surgery.
	   ``Shane's very keen to play the first Test and some Shield games
before it,'' Marsh said. ``The thing about Shane Warne is he loves
playing cricket, loves being involved and around the team, is a
great bowler and is great to have in the dressing room.
	   ``I don't know the medical side of it at the moment but I've
spoken to Shane and he's very confident about it all.''

Bomb defused near Sri Lanka's popular tourist resort
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Sri Lankan police defused a bomb found
in an abandoned bag near a telecommunication center in Hikkaduwa, a
popular sea resort in the south, the area's police chief said
Wednesday.
	   P.R.P. Senanayake could not say who may have planted the bomb,
which was discovered late Tuesday, but said it appeared to be
locally made.
	   Hikkaduwa, about 100 kilometers (60 miles) south of Colombo, is
visited by a large number of Western budget travelers. The area is
know for its coral reefs.
	   Police have blamed the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, the
main rebel group fighting for an independent Tamil homeland, for
previous attacks on the government's telecommunication facilities.
In the past six months, there have been seven such attacks in Sri
Lanka.
	   The bomb had the potential to disrupt telephone facilities and
tourism in the area. Tourism is Sri Lanka's fourth largest foreign
exchange earner.
	   Many Tamils, who make up 18 percent of Sri Lanka's population of
18. 5 million, accuse the majority Sinhalese of widespread
discrimination in education and jobs. More than 54,000 people have
been killed since the war began in 1983.

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DURBAN, South Africa (AP) _ As heads of state of developing
countries gathered Wednesday for a Nonaligned Movement summit,
last-ditch talks to end fighting in Congo involving troops from as
many as six countries were stealing the spotlight.
	   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan flew into Durban on Tuesday,
where he planned to hold talks with regional leaders on a peace
plan. Notably absent from the summit was Congo President Laurent
Kabila, who appears to have the upper hand on the battlefield and
has refused to participate in peace talks.
	   ``We need to find a way of getting everybody to talk,'' Annan
said in comments to The Associated Press Tuesday night after he met
with President Nelson Mandela.
	   Mandela's peace initiatives have stalled and Annan's
participation could provide a much-needed boost. Annan's agenda for
Wednesday, the opening day of the heads of state summit, was
unclear, but he could meet on the sideline of the summit with the
leaders of Angola, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Uganda and Rwanda, who were
all expected at the summit.
	   Zimbabwean, Angolan and Namibian troops are fighting alongside
Kabila's forces. Kabila says Rwandan and Ugandan troops are
supporting Congolese rebels, although the leaders of the two
countries deny it.
	   South African President Nelson Mandela and his new wife Graca
Machel _ widow of Mozambican leader and black liberation leader
Samora Machel _ greeted the heads of state Wednesday morning.
	   Cuban President Fidel Castro and Mandela exchanged an especially
warm embrace.
	   ``Fidel, Fidel, Fidel,'' Mandela said as he threw his arms
around Castro, dressed nattily in a grey business suit. The two
ageing revolutionaries hugged, then Castro embraced Mrs. Machel.

Reports: several Indonesian provinces face food shortages
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Food shortages are threatening
thousands in a number of Indonesian provinces following failed
harvests and distribution problems, the official Antara news agency
reported Wednesday.
	   Indonesia is undergoing its worst economic crisis in decades and
the price of rice has soared, compounded by a drought that ruined
many harvests. The government is importing rice and international
donors are shipping staple foods into the country.
	   Government officials worry speculators are jacking up prices of
rice, so many people can't afford to buy it even though supplies
are adequate in some areas.
	   About 1,800 people in West Java province have already run out of
rice and another 84,000 are in danger, Antara said.
	   ``The situation could develop into a famine if the local
government fails to handle the problem well,'' Memet Hamdan, a
local official, was quoted as saying.
	   He said the local administration was preparing to build
stockpiles of rice for emergency use and would try to prevent
brokers from attempting to buy rice from farmers at lower prices
and then resell it.
	   Rice prices have skyrocketed from 1,000 rupiahs (9 U.S. cents)
per kilogram early this year to between 4,000 and 5,000 rupiahs (37
and 46 U.S. cents) per kilogram.
	   Thailand and China have sent 14,450 metric tons of rice to East
Kalimantan province to help ease the shortage of food following a
prolonged drought that hit the province last year.
	   ``With this fresh supply of rice, East Kalimantan now has 29,300
metric tons in stock, enough to meet local demands for three
months,'' Antara quoted Nico Manfe, a government official in the
provincial capital of Samarinda, as saying.
	   Other provinces that reportedly face food shortages include East
Nusa Tenggara, East Timor and Irian Jaya.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian lawmakers agreed Wednesday to hold their
second vote on whether to confirm Viktor Chernomyrdin as prime
minister on Friday.
	   The State Duma, the lower house of parliament, overwhelmingly
rejected Chernomyrdin on the first vote on Monday.
	   Under the Russian Constitution, the president can present his
candidate for prime minister three times. If lawmakers reject the
candidates each time, the president must dissolve parliament and
call new parliamentary elections.

Dollar lower against yen, Japanese stocks rise
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with closing stocks, mid-afternoon dollar, bond &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar fell against the Japanese yen
Wednesday amid lingering concern over the recent volatility on Wall
Street. Tokyo stocks were marginally higher.
	   The U.S. currency bought 137.64 yen at mid-afternoon, down 0.58
yen from late Tuesday in Tokyo and also below its late New York
level of 139.25 yen overnight.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 6.99 points,
or 0.05 percent, ending the day at 14,376.62. It had gained 261.74
points, or 1.86 percent, the previous day.
	   The dollar fell as low as 135 yen in New York on Tuesday on
nervousness about the plunge in U.S. stock prices Monday, but then
strengthened as the Dow Jones industrial average recovered, traders
said.
	   On Tuesday, the Dow rose 288.36 points, or 3.8 percent, to
7,827.43 _ the second-biggest point gain in history.
	   Still, U.S. hedge funds in Tokyo on Wednesday were selling the
dollar on remaining uncertainty over the direction of U.S. stock
prices, traders said, while most Japanese investors bought it on
the notion the recent falls in the Dow may have ended with Wall
Street's rebound Tuesday.
	   The two forces thus offset each other to hold the dollar just
above 137 yen, traders said.
	   The Japanese government welcomed the more robust yen, with a top
official saying the currency was turning the tide against the
dollar.
	   ``I think a trend of correction has begun,'' said Haruhiko
Kuroda, head of the international bureau at Japan's Ministry of
Finance.
	   Tokyo stocks gave up most of their early gains because of
renewed pessimism over bank reform at home and the outlook for
global financial markets, traders said.
	   Earlier in the day, the market rose moderately following the
rebound of New York stocks and reports that the ruling Liberal
Democratic Party and the opposition are getting closer to a
compromise on the bank reform debate.
	   Naoto Kan, leader of the Democratic Party of Japan, said in an
interview published Wednesday by the Mainichi newspaper that his
party won't block a plan to inject public funds into sickly banks
if they fully disclose the extent of their financial woes.
	   But investors were cautious about what might happen to the
reforms, traders said.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section of the exchange was up 8.61 points, or 0.78 percent,
to 1,118.76. On Tuesday, it rose 3.66 points, or 0.33 percent.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese government
bond fell to 1.070 percent from Tuesday's finish of 1.075 percent,
driving its price up to 112.62 yen from 112.60 yen.

Games organizers trying to avoid investigation, says victims'

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Organizers of the Maccabiah Games,
where four Australians died in a bridge collapse last year, were
trying to avoid a proper investigation by offering early
compensation, a victims' spokesman said Wednesday.
	   Colin Elterman, whose daughter Sasha spent 10 months in critical
condition after being thrown into a Tel Aviv's Yarkon river when
the bridge collapsed, was responding to news that an Israeli
parliamentary committee investigating the tragedy was considering
giving compensation to families before a court determined who was
to blame.
	   Eliezer Zandberg, a lawmaker on the committee, expressed hope
that accelerating the compensation process would help heal the
wounds between Israel and the Australian Jewish community.
	   ``There's no dispute about the legal rights of people who were
hurt and their families,'' Zandberg said. ``Waiting to determine
who is responsible for the collapse would only prolong their
suffering.''
	   Israel and the Maccabi World Union have each pledged U.S. dlrs
500,000 to be shared by victims' families, said Micha Goldman, the
lawmaker who heads the committee. Part of the money has already
reached some families, Goldman said.
	   Five people are on trial for criminal negligence resulting in
the bridge collapse.
	   But Elterman is concerned that the compensation angle was being
pushed so MWU chiefs could keep their jobs.
	   ``They are trying to trade off compensation for proper
investigation,'' Elterman said. ``There's no way we will buy that.
That's frankly immoral. We want compensation, but we want
resignations too.''
	   He said the families of the victims wanted the resignations of
at least the MWU president and chairman.
	   The parliamentary committee was formed in July after victims'
families threatened to wage an international campaign against
Israel and future Maccabiah games. The families had complained that
not enough action was taken to determine the causes of the
accident.

Riot police take up positions as students protest
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS grafs 1-6 to UPDATE with protest continuing, no
arrests, riot police take up positions &QL; 
 &UR; With BC-Myanmar-Suu Kyi Interview

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ Riot police took up positions outside a
university Wednesday during a protest by nearly 500 students, the
biggest show of discontent so far in recently agitation against
Myanmar's military regime.
	   The riot police, equipped with clubs and shields, stood by as
senior teachers negotiated with the students to end the protest at
the Yangon Institute of Technology. Gates to the campus were locked
and the students did not try to reach the streets.
	   A spokesman for the government, in a fax to The Associated Press
in Bangkok, Thailand, said there had been no arrests and that
school authorities were handling the problem.
	   Traffic police closed roads passing by the institute, a hotbed
of anti-government sentiment that had been closed since the last
wave of student protests two years ago. It was recently reopened so
students could finally study and take their long-postponed final
exams.
	   Student sources said many of the grievances were related to the
crash courses for the exams, but the government has in the past
seen student unrest as a cover for the pro-democracy opposition.
	   The protest was the first major confirmed demonstration since
police cleared the brief occupation of a nearby intersection by 200
students last week. There were reports of other protests Wednesday,
but none was confirmed.
	   Meanwhile, pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi met diplomats
in Yangon, a move that could antagonize the government, which feels
hostile foreign nations are using the movement she leads to
destabilize the country.
	   There were no immediate details on the talks.
	   In a rare interview, Suu Kyi said Tuesday that the military
government may use force to resolve its latest confrontation with
the opposition, possibly banning her party.
	   ``This government always believes in violence and the use of
force to resolve problems,'' Suu Kyi told foreign journalists.
``They never think of resolving problems through negotiations,
through reasonable give and take.''
	   A week ago, Suu Kyi was described as dehydrated and severely
weakened after a 13-day roadside standoff against authorities on a
bridge outside the capital. Her doctors wanted to keep her under
observation, but Suu Kyi said Tuesday her health was fine.
	   ``They can observe me while I work,'' joked Suu Kyi, looking
fit.
	   At the home of Tin Oo, vice chairman of her National League for
Democracy, Suu Kyi gave a spirited defense of her renewed campaign
against the government on the 10th anniversary of a failed uprising
against military rule.
	   Suu Kyi, 53, who has spent most of the past decade under house
arrest or close restriction, said that the opposition in Myanmar,
also known as Burma, is more united than at any time since abortive
elections in 1990.
	   Her party overwhelmingly won the elections, but the military,
which has ruled since 1962, refused to honor the result. In the
past few weeks, the NLD has threatened to finally convene the
legislature on its own.
	   The government has responded by threatening long prison terms
and banning the party. Suu Kyi said both were ``quite possible''
and that five members of the parliament had been detained in the
past two weeks.
	   There was strong support for the NLD's call to open parliament,
she claimed, and expressed no disappointment that protests
attempted by students had not drawn crowds into the streets.
	   ``Considering the amount of repression and the amount of
surveillance to which the students are subjected, the fact that
they managed to get these demonstrations going one after the other
showed a certain amount of organization and resolve,'' she said.
	   She accused the government of destroying the economy and being
insincere in its expressed willingness to hold a dialogue with the
opposition.

Opposition stands firm on demands as political crisis worsens
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROBIN McDOWELL &QC;

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Thousands of people renewed protests
Wednesday against strongman Hun Sen, refusing to accept the
decision by government panels he controls that he won the
parliamentary elections July 26.
	   Round-the-clock protests against Hun Sen entered their 10th day
as eyes turned toward King Norodom Sihanouk, the constitutional
head of state, to resolve the deepening political crisis Thursday
when he receives Hun Sen in the northern city of Siem Reap.
	   Thousands of student-led demonstrators gathered in front of the
Royal Palace in Phnom Penh, where the king is not in residence, in
a symbolic appeal for the monarch to convince Hun Sen to properly
address hundreds of alleged election irregularities.
	   The National Election Committee and the country's highest
appeals body, the Constitutional Council, have rejected all of the
opposition's complaints from the polls. Both bodies are controlled
by Hun Sen's supporters.
	   ``We believe that only Your Majesty can resolve this current
political crisis and return the Kingdom of Cambodia to the path of
democracy,'' the students said in a petition.
	   Joined by motorbike and pedicab drivers and laborers, they then
marched through the capital, clogging traffic for an hour.
	   They held aloft banners reading: ``Cambodian people do not need
Hun Sen anymore'' and ``Hun Sen is a killer'' and `Students want
democracy.''
	   Many then returned to a park, dubbed ``Democracy Square'' by the
protesters, outside the National Assembly where thousands of people
have camped in a tent city to protest Hun Sen.
	   The protest showed that the official declaration Wednesday that
Hun Sen's ruling Cambodian People's Party had won the elections had
done little to ease the country's worsening political crisis.
	   The tally, which mirrored preliminary results announced three
weeks ago, gave Hun Sen a slight majority of 64 of the 122 National
Assembly seats with just 41 percent of the popular vote.
	   However, he still lacks the two-thirds majority needed to form a
new government and the opposition has refused to join a coalition
or support a new government until its complaints are addressed.
	   Prince Norodom Ranariddh, leader of the royalist FUNCINPEC party
and the king's son, said Wednesday he has urged Sihanouk to refrain
from urging a coalition with Hun Sen.
	   Sihanouk did so in the early days after the election, to no
avail. Ranariddh, who was deposed by Hun Sen as co-prime minister
in a bloody coup last year, said Wednesday that no such partnership
would be formed.
	   Sam Rainsy, the other main opposition leader, said he believes
the demonstrations will not ease.
	   ``In fact, I think it will increase,'' Sam Rainsy said.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ U.S. President Bill Clinton presses his no-pain,
no-gain message with Russia's stubborn parliament leaders Wednesday
after final meetings with President Boris Yeltsin that have so far
yielded measures to ease nuclear nerves but little else.
	   Clinton and Yeltsin held their second round of talks in private
at the Kremlin, while Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov
bluntly summed up the high stakes in this country's internal power
struggle: ``President Yeltsin is pushing the nation to a civil
war.''
	   With the Kremlin and the nation enveloped in the fallout of a
wrenching transformation from communism to capitalism, Clinton's
advice is to stay the course, but be sure to pay your taxes and
your debts.
	   ``There aren't any painless solutions,'' he told students at
Moscow State University of International Relations on Tuesday.
	   Clinton's advice to Yeltsin carries the weight of the American
president's own political and personal woes. Beyond attempting to
stiffen the Russian leader's resolve it came with no offer of
specific help.
	   Together they are taking the kind of steps that marked past
summits to control nuclear arms. Two agreements are to be signed.
One aims to reduce U.S. and Russian arsenals of plutonium and the
other to share information on missile launch tests.
	   Also, Britain is pledging to provide five days' notice of all
test launches of its Trident submarine missile systems.
	   In urging Yeltsin not to abandon reform, Clinton is preaching to
the choir. The Russian leader insisted Tuesday he would not give up
on democratic reforms or on his appointment of Viktor Chernomyrdin,
the Communist-era fuel and energy boss, to return as prime
minister.
	   But the Communist-led Duma refuses to approve Chernomyrdin, and
the standoff threatens to push Russia into early elections or
dissolve the parliament if it rejects the prime minister a second
and third time.
	   Clinton faces long odds in his meetings with Duma and regional
leaders, including Communist partly leader Zyuganov.
	   ``The past two years in Russia's life have been full of stormy
political events, great laborious work on reforming the economy,''
Yeltsin said in dinner remarks. ``Soon there were disappointments,
too, and unfulfilled hopes. But we've never lost the conviction in
the necessity of the transformations we're carrying out.''
	   U.S. officials said Russia's power struggle was too uncertain to
predict what kind of economic remedies would be embraced.

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Interior Minister Jean-Pierre Chevenement has been
hospitalized to undergo surgery, his aides said Wednesday.
	   The 59-year-old leftist minister, in charge of the nation's
police and security forces, entered Val-de-Grace military hospital
Tuesday night for a ``benign operation'' that had been planned long
in advance, a spokesman said on customary anonymity.
	   Chevenement did not appear ill before he was hospitalized, and
he held meetings on schedule Tuesday before entering Val-de-Grace.
He was scheduled to leave the hospital early next week.
	   Chevenement held a number of other ministry portfolios during
his political career, including defense, industry, education. After
three years as defense minister, he resigned in 1991 to protest
France's involvement in the U.S.-led Gulf War coalition against
Iraq.

Malaysia fixes currency exchange rate
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Singapore halting trade, EDITS to conform &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia's central bank confirmed
Wednesday that the country's currency has been fixed at 3.80 to the
U.S. dollar, far stronger than what it was trading in the markets.
	   The move seems to contradict earlier statements by government
officials that the ringgit rate would not be fixed and that the
currency would be determined by supply and demand in the local
market.
	   In a last-ditch effort to save its embattled economy, Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad announced Tuesday that the government
would ban trading of the ringgit outside the country. The measure
was one on a sweeping list of capital controls that included
halting the trade of Malaysian shares overseas.
	   Confused by what the measures mean, Singapore's stockbroking
houses indefinitely halted trading on the Kuala Lumpur Stock
Exchange, traders said Wednesday.
	   Traders said the move will hurt the stockbroking houses,
particularly international ones, as Malaysian markets account for
``a good chunk'' of their business.
	   Malaysian shares account for about a quarter of trading on the
Singapore Stock Exchange.
	   Mahathir said reverting to a fixed exchange rate would fend off
currency speculators and help insulate its fragile economy from
further global shocks.
	   The ringgit has been strengthening since the announcement,
rising to 3.8 ringgit against the U.S. dollar compared to 4.2 a day
earlier.
	   Analysts and currency dealers said that the new exchange rate is
an attempt to strike a balance between being strong and stable, yet
allowing the Southeast Asian nation to competitively price its
exports against neighboring economies.

Police investigating poisoned tea in supermarket
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Poisoned tea has been found on a supermarket shelf,
but the store manager who took a sip immediately spat it out and
was not injured, police said Wednesday.
	   The discovery of the cyanide-laced can of tea Tuesday was the
latest in a series of poisonings in Japan, which has long boasted a
reputation as a low crime society.
	   In July, four people died and dozens fell ill after eating
arsenic-laced curry served at a community festival n Wakayama,
western Japan.
	   Last month, poisoned tea served at an office in Niigata, 260
kilometers (160 miles) northwest of Tokyo, made 10 people ill. Then
a fake diet drink mailed to some Tokyo homes sent one teen-ager to
the hospital.
	   There have been no arrests in any of the cases.
	   Hiromu Nonaka, chief government spokesman, was quoted by Kyodo
News agency as urging police Wednesday to do more to solve the
poisonings, calling them ``dirty conduct that heightens social
unrest.''
	   In the latest case, the manager took the tea can off the shelf
because it was dented, police spokesman Yuji Kinoshita said. When
he drank from it, it was so bitter he spat it out, he said.
	   The can had a tiny hole in the bottom through which the poison
appeared to have been inserted, and the hole had been covered up,
Kinoshita said.
	   Police suspect that someone posing as a customer put the can on
the shelf. The Tokyo police lab is running tests on the tea.

As flood threat recedes, China worries about killer diseases
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with report of typhoid fever in grafs 9-10 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ With the Yangtze River's latest flood crest
weakening Wednesday, Chinese officials warned that diseases
threatened crowded refugee camps. Deadly typhoid fever already has
broken out in the flooded northeast.
	   Dikes protecting major cities were holding, but the surge this
week from rain-swollen upper Yangtze River tributaries would likely
keep floodwaters high for weeks, state media reported.
	   The heavy flooding in the northeast and in the Yangtze basin
this summer has killed more than 3,000 people nationwide and left
millions homeless, according to government statistics.
	   Along the Yangtze, China's longest river, the floods are the
worst since 1954, when 30,000 people died _ about 90 percent of
them from contagious diseases after floodwaters receded.
	   Health officials are closely monitoring diseases and have not
reported any epidemics, the China Daily on Wednesday quoted Wang
Zhao, the Ministry of Health official in charge of disease control,
as saying.
	   Conditions along the Yangtze are ripe for diseases to spread.
The weather is still hot, flood victims and livestock are crowded
together in refugee camps, and drinking water is limited.
	   Intestinal diseases are spreading in flooded areas along the
Yangtze, and to a lesser extent in the northeast, Wang said.
	   A ministry team recently reported a 52 percent jump in cases of
infectious disease in flooded Heilongjiang province, in the
northeast, compared to the same period last year, the state-run
Xinhua News Agency said. Most cases involved typhoid fever and
dysentery, it said.
	   There was ``mounting danger from a possible major outbreak of
epidemics'' in the northeast, Xinhua said.
	   But the biggest worry for the million homeless flood victims in
the northeast was cold weather. Frosts are expected this month, and
winter brings daily temperatures well below zero.
	   Meanwhile, a group of 80 scientists issued an open letter
calling for protection of wetlands as a means of flood control,
Xinhua said.
	   The letter called for a halt to exploitation of wetlands along
rivers.
	   Many homes and factories have been built in wetlands along the
Yangtze River that once soaked up floodwaters. The storage capacity
of huge freshwater lakes along the river has dropped by as much as
50 percent because of reclamation and silting caused by erosion,
Xinhua reported.
	   Wetlands also have been destroyed along the Nen and Songhua
rivers in the northeast, where flooding as severe as this summer is
rare, the scientists said.
	   Premier Zhu Rongji, who visited flooded areas in the northeast
on Tuesday, said environmental laws were not being enforced. Like
other officials in recent weeks, Zhu said the floods were due in
part to rampant deforestation and the soil erosion and silting of
riverbeds it brings, state media reported Wednesday.
	   The ruling Communist Party and central government ``attach great
importance to afforestation and conservation of soil and water,''
China Daily quoted Zhu as saying. ``Unfortunately, implementation
of related policies has been far from satisfactory.''

Cambodian guard robs French bank, shoots manager

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ A French-owned bank has been robbed
by one of its own guards, who shot the manager in the leg and stole
more than dlrs 300,000, police said Wednesday.
	   Employees at Credit Agricole Indosuez, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said that the Cambodian guard entered the building from
a side door around closing time Tuesday and held his colleagues at
gunpoint.
	   Jimmy Thinamisan, the bank's Filipino manager, who was in a
meeting on the second floor, was shot when came down the stairs and
walked in on the robbery.
	   Thinamisan underwent emergency surgery at the capital's Calmette
Hospital and was to be flown to Singapore for further treatment.
The bank was scheduled to reopen late Wednesday.
	   The robber escaped. Police said they are investigating the
robbery, the second of a bank in recent years. The first was at the
Malaysian-owned Maybank.

Aboriginal concern over funding reports
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Prime Minister John Howard was
accused Wednesday of pandering to supporters of Pauline Hanson's
One Nation Party by refusing to rule out a purge of the Aboriginal
and Torres Strait Islander Commission.
	   Conservative leader Howard refused to deny reports that he
intended to gut the government-funded ATSIC. Populist MP Hanson
wants to stop funding to ATSIC, claiming it is discriminatory
because it gives grants to Aborigines which are denied to other
Australians.
	   ATSIC commissioner Geoff Clarke said Howard, facing an Oct. 3
poll, was trying to divide the community to be reelected.
	   ``This is obviously a One Nation stunt, it is obviously to try
and win back votes from the One Nation supporters,'' Clarke told
Australian Broadcasting Corp. radio.
	   Howard told a radio interviewer that he was looking for
accountability and decentralization of Aboriginal services.
	   Newspapers reported Wednesday that Howard's office had driven
top-level talks about policy changes under which ATSIC would lose
responsibility for key issues like employment and housing.
	   These areas make up around two thirds of the budget of ATSIC,
which was formed as an elected body in 1990 to give indigenous
people, rather than government departments, management of their own
affairs.
	   ``What I want to do is make sure that the provision of resources
for health, education and housing in relation to Aboriginal affairs
is done effectively,'' Howard said. ``I am not going to make any
commitments either way about administrative arrangements. In due
course, there will be an Aboriginal affairs policy issued.''
	   ATSIC chairman Gatjil Djerrkura said he did not want to discuss
policy during the election campaign, but said of the reports, ``If
true, it would become difficult for Aboriginal and Torres Strait
Islander people to distinguish between Howard, Hanson and
(Aboriginal Affairs Minister John) Herron.''
	   Howard chose Djerrkura, a successful Aboriginal businessman from
Australia's Northern Territory, to head the commission, which
handles many development and other programs for Australia's 386,000
Aborigines, who are now a small minority in the country's mostly
white population of more than 18 million.
	   Howard's domestic critics have accused him of being too eager to
impress Hanson's supporters with threats of crackdowns on
Aboriginal funding.
	   The government ordered a tough audit of ATSIC programs soon
after it took office in 1996.
	   Hanson's party made its electoral debut in the recent Queensland
poll, claiming 11 seats and 23 percent of the vote. The Oct. 3 poll
will be its first national election.

Korea's conglomerates discuss swapping businesses
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SANG-HUN CHOE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ South Korea's five biggest
conglomerates were near agreement Wednesday on swapping or merging
major overlapping subsidiaries, industry officials said.
	   President Kim Dae-jung has been insisting on the shakeup, even
threatening to withhold loans from state-controlled banks unless
the bloated, debt-ridden conglomerates restructured themselves.
	   Mostly family-run enterprises known as ``chaebol,'' South Korean
conglomerates have been accused of overexpanding and over
diversifying during the country's boom years, sowing the seeds for
its financial crisis.
	   An announcement on the planned swaps could come as early as
Thursday, said the Korean Federation of Industries, a lobby of
conglomerates.
	   The industry shakeup involved aerospace, train manufacturing,
power plant and oil refinery subsidiaries of the nation's top five
conglomerates _ Samsung, Hyundai, Daewoo, LG and SK.
	   The final shape of the agreement, however, hinged on
negotiations between Hyundai and LG, which discussed merging their
computer chip-making subsidiaries _ Hyundai Electronics and LG
Semicon.
	   Combined, Hyundai and LG supply 18 percent of the world's
computer memory chips.
	   Hyundai hoped to take over LG Semicon while handing over its
petrochemical business to LG, South Korean news media said. But LG
was insisting that the two semiconductor makers be merged and run
as a joint venture.
	   The International Monetary Fund demanded a reorganization of the
conglomerates when it granted South Korea a record dlrs 58 billion
bailout in December.
	   President Kim said the restructuring was essential to create a
leaner, more competitive industrial sector and restore foreign
investor confidence in South Korea's battered economy.
	   A typical South Korean conglomerate has 40 to 50 cross-funded
subsidiaries.
	   At least eight of them collapsed under heavy debt last year,
saddling banks with billions of dollars in bad loans and fueling
the financial turmoil still besetting the nation.
	   The government has already shut down 14 merchant banks and 55
financially weak businesses. Most of those firms, however, were
only relatively insignificant subsidiaries of the conglomerates.

Indonesia, Thailand fined for bizarre match
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAUL ALEXANDER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Indonesia and Thailand have been fined
unspecified amounts for a Tiger Cup match that both teams tried to
avoid winning, officials said Wednesday.
	   They also were warned about their on-field performance and could
face further punishment after the eight-nation competition ends
Saturday if they are found to have brought the sport into
disrepute.
	   The results of the bizarre match, which Thailand ``won'' when
Indonesia put the ball into its own net as time was running out,
will be allowed to stand, with Thailand facing Vietnam in Hanoi and
Indonesia staying in Ho Chi Minh City to play Singapore.
	   The Hanoi match had been scheduled for Wednesday _ Vietnam's
National Day _ but was postponed to Thursday while organizers and
soccer officials decided how to handle the fiasco.
	   Both teams have admitted that they did not want to play Vietnam,
particularly on National Day in Hanoi, where boisterous fans have
packed the 20,000-seat stadium.
	   Tournament officials tried their best to put a positive spin on
the situation, saying they wanted to look ahead to the rest of the
tournament. The organizing committee would not disclose the size of
the fines and said there had been precedents.
	   They specifically pointed to a 1982 Germany-Austria match in
which the teams deliberately played to a scoreless draw.
	   ``FIFA was very angry with what happened, but the result stood,
and the committee felt that the same thing applied here,'' Group A
match commissioner Tan Eng Yoon was quoted as saying by Singapore's
The Straits Times newspaper.
	   Teerachai Wutitham, manager of the Thai national team, explained
Thailand's thinking in trying to finish second in its group,
meaning it would stay in Ho Chi Minh City and face Singapore:
	   ``This will allow us to remain at the same stadium and will give
us an extra two days of rest. Essentially, this gives us an
advantage in every respect. As far as the rankings are concern, we
will take second place, regardless.''
	   But there also were hints that both Indonesia and Thailand
feared that Vietnam had fixed an earlier match that ended in a draw
after Singapore had two goals disallowed for questionable offsides
calls. Vietnam vehemently denied anything illegal.
	   Last season's Vietnamese national championship was battered by
reports of matchfixing. Local press reports have said at least 74
players and managers were involved. Several players have been
arrested or suspended.
	   In addition, Sports Minister Ha Quang Du has said some members
of the Vietnamese women's soccer team have been approached by
bookies about fixing matches.

	   SUBIC BAY FREEPORT, Philippines (AP) _ The dismissed chief of
the Philippines' premier industrial estate shook hands with his
successor Wednesday after giving up a two-month fight to keep his
post.
	   Richard Gordon's decision to yield the chairmanship of the Subic
Bay Metropolitan Authority followed a Supreme Court ruling Tuesday
that he had failed to present a convincing argument for why his
ouster by President Joseph Estrada should be overturned.
	   ``I said once the Supreme Court decides, I will step down,''
Gordon said Wednesday.
	   Gordon's successor and longtime critic, Felicito Payumo, said he
was pleased that Gordon had agreed to cooperate peacefully in
turning over his office.
	   The two men smiled at each other, shook hands before a large
number of cheering supporters and then sat side by side during a
press conference.
	   Gordon had argued that he still had a six-year term remaining
after being re-appointed in February by former President Fidel
Ramos. He has held the post since 1992.
	   During the dispute, which badly tarnished Subic's image,
Gordon's supporters barricaded the freeport's headquarters to
prevent his ouster after Estrada took office as president June 30.
	   They held out until police ousted them out in a clash that
injured more than 100 people in July. They then occupied another
building where they stayed until Gordon acknowledged defeat
Wednesday.
	   Meanwhile, Payumo held office at the local airport.
	   Subic, a former U.S. naval base 80 kilometers (50 miles) west of
Manila, was converted into an industrial and tourism center after
the Americans left in 1992. It then became a showcase of Philippine
economic growth.
	   Gordon has been praised for wooing a large number of foreign
investors, who established more than 200 factories at Subic making
a wide range of products including business suits, shoes, computer
circuit boards, cranes, yachts and armored personnel carriers.
	   Subic's exports over the past four years have totaled almost
dlrs 1.4 billion. The industrial zone now employs close to 70,000
workers, more than double the number during the time it was a U.S.
base.

Care centers in poor shape as rebuilding lags
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PORT MORESBY, Papua New Guinea (AP) _ Care centers for survivors
of Papua New Guinea's killer tsunami are in poor shape, while the
process of resettlement and rebuilding is moving too slow, the
government heard Wednesday.
	   A report on the July 17 tsunami, a 10-meter (33-foot)-high wave
which killed more than 2,000 people and left thousands homeless,
was tabled in national parliament.
	   It said a shortage of manpower and equipment was hindering the
acquisition of land on which to resettle the survivors and the
building of much needed road networks in the disaster area.
	   Unless the resettlement program was ``fast-tracked'', there was
a danger that the state of care centers holding 9,077 survivors in
the West Sepik province in PNG's northwest could ``deteriorate
rapidly''.
	   The parliamentary committee said the present state of the care
centers was inadequate, they were a little overcrowded and lacked
basic facilities like mosquito netting, adequate water supply
systems, tents, towels and building and cooking implements.
	   The plastic tarpaulins that survivors were living under only had
a lifespan of 12 weeks and were already seven weeks old.
	   ``People in the care centers want to get on with living their
lives and are a proud people that do not wish to continue living in
care centers and being spoon-fed with disaster relief,'' the report
said.
	   Children also needed to resume their schooling.
	   ``Nothing has been done to alleviate this problem and the
children are missing out on daily schooling,'' it said.
	   ``Donors are willing to fund educational materials but are
awaiting the building of proper classrooms.''
	   The parliamentary committee also urged the government, under
Prime Minister Bill Skate, to pay the increased operational costs
of hospitals in Wewak and Aitape which cared for injured tsunami
survivors.
	   The Raihu Health Center at Aitape could be forced to close for
the third time in two years because outstanding operational costs
dating back to 1997 had not been paid, the report said.

	   The former mayor, Jean-Paul Akayesu, was convicted on nine of 15
counts of genocide, crimes against humanity, torture and rape.
	   The International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda said the judgment
against Akayesu was the first for the crime of genocide by an
international court, and also the first for sexual violence.
	   All those accused in the post-World War II Nuremberg trials
pleaded innocent to charges including murder and extermination.
Those trials pre-dated the creation of the crime of genocide 50
years ago.
	   Akayesu, a Hutu former teacher born in 1953, was convicted of
ordering the killings of 2,000 people who sought his protection in
the central village of Taba.
	   They were among more than 500,000 Rwandans, mostly minority
Tutsis but also moderate Hutus, who were butchered with machetes
and nail-studded clubs in a genocide carefully orchestrated by
extremists in the former Hutu government.
	   The killing went on for 90 days, beginning April 7, 1994, the
day after President Juvenal Habyarimana plane's was shot down, and
ending when Tutsi rebels took power.

	   The tribunal, a three-judge panel based in Arusha, Tanzania, was
set up in November 1994 but until now had not yet reached a verdict
in any case, a time lag that has been criticized by Rwandans. The
maximum penalty the tribunal can impose is life imprisonment.
	   On Friday, the tribunal is scheduled to sentence former Prime
Minister Jean Kambanda, who led Rwanda's government during the 1994
genocide. Kambanda pleaded guilty in May and promised to testify
against other alleged ringleaders of the slaughter.
	   The tribunal is holding 31 people in Arusha, four of whom are on
trial. Another person is in custody in Texas. Eight others have
been indicted, but not apprehended.
	   Rwandan courts _ in proceedings condemned by many foreign
lawyers as unjust _ have tried at least 330 people for involvement
in the genocide, and 116 have been sentenced to death. More than
125,000 people are imprisoned and awaiting trial.
	   On April 24, a Rwandan firing squad executed 22 people convicted
of genocide, the first executions for the slaughter.
	   Akayesu will not be sentenced immediately, the tribunal said.
Several European countries have volunteered to incarcerate
convicts, but the tribunal would prefer those found guilty serve
their sentences in African countries.

Confusion reigns over new Malaysian exchange rules

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Panicky customers flooded banks
with calls while financial analysts scratched their heads over
Malaysia's new foreign exchange curbs, which experts say could
further hurt the country's already struggling economy.
	   Seeking clarification, hundreds of expatriates called banks
Wednesday to find out if accounts had been frozen by the new
directive on converting the Malaysian ringgit to other currencies
and repatriating them out of the country.
	   The answers, however, didn't help.
	   While one large multinational bank told a customer that no
transactions were allowed without a central bank permit, it told
another client that he could make a one-time withdrawal of 10,000
ringgit (dlrs 2,600).
	   ``It's going to close down our bank's Treasury department,''
said a banker at another foreign bank, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
	   Confusion spread across the border with Singapore where many
Malaysians have stashed away their savings because interest rates
are higher. Tuesday's fiat said such money would be useless paper
unless brought back within a month.
	   ``I have received so many calls from offshore banks who don't
know what has happened,'' said Simon Mahadevan Flint, a
Singapore-based financial analyst who advises banks in the region.
	   On Tuesday, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad announced widespread
barriers to check the relentless slide of the ringgit. Measures
included a fixed exchange rate, curbs on trading of the ringgit and
repatriating money overseas.
	   The rate was fixed at 3.80 ringgit to one U.S. dollar Wednesday,
far stronger than where the currency had been trading.
	   The government hopes to bring in 20 to 30 billion ringgit (dlrs
5 to 7 billion) locked in overseas accounts, but economists fear
the measures could choke foreign investments.
	   ``Exchange controls mean a lot of inconvenience for
multinationals and it may make them rethink and reposition
themselves,'' said Mohamad Ariff, director at the Malaysian
Institute of Economic Research, a government-funded think tank.
	   The new controls to insulate the economy from external shocks
could affect Malaysia's trade links with the world. Exports and
imports total about 130 percent of Malaysia's gross domestic
product.
	   A staggering 44 percent of all capital investment in the
manufacturing sector is from foreign companies, according to the
Malaysian Industrial Development Authority.
	   Despite a global slowdown, Malaysia last year approved foreign
direct investment worth 11.4 billion ringgit, then equivalent to
about dlrs 4 billion.
	   Companies such as U.S.-based Dell Corp. and IBM manufacture
computers here for global markets and Japanese car makers own huge
assembly plants in Malaysia. Most of these companies employ tens of
thousands of expatriates, all of whom would be affected by
Tuesday's regulations.
	   With the move, Malaysia became the first country in the region
to curb buying and selling of its currency since the turmoil
erupted a year ago. The International Monetary Fund reacted with
horror and Thailand said Kuala Lumpur had gone too far.

	   ARUSHA, Tanzania (AP) _ A U.N. tribunal, in the first
international conviction for genocide, on Wednesday found a Rwandan
ex-mayor guilty in the bloodletting that killed more than 500,000
Rwandans in 1994.
	   The former mayor, Jean-Paul Akayesu, was convicted on nine of 15
counts of genocide, crimes against humanity, torture and rape.
	   The chief judge, Laity Kama of Senegal, ordered Akayesu to stand
as the verdicts were read. He weaved slightly from left to right as
the judgments were read aloud.
	   ``The accused, Jean-Paul Akeyesu, you are declared guilty of
genocide,'' Kama intoned. Each time a guilty verdict was read,
Akayesu furrowed his brow slightly and winced.
	   The International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda said the judgment
against Akayesu was the first for the crime of genocide by an
international court, and also the first for sexual violence.
	   All those accused in the post-World War II Nuremberg trials
pleaded innocent to charges including murder and extermination.
Those trials pre-dated the creation of the crime of genocide 50
years ago.
	   Akayesu, a Hutu former teacher born in 1953, was convicted of
ordering the killings of 2,000 people who sought his protection in
the central village of Taba.
	   They were among more than 500,000 Rwandans, mostly minority
Tutsis but also moderate Hutus, who were butchered with machetes
and nail-studded clubs in a genocide carefully orchestrated by
extremists in the former Hutu government.
	   The killing went on for 90 days, beginning April 7, 1994, the
day after President Juvenal Habyarimana plane's was shot down, and
ending when Tutsi rebels took power.
	   The tribunal, a three-judge panel based in Arusha, Tanzania, was
set up in November 1994 but until now had not yet reached a verdict
in any case, a time lag that has been criticized by Rwandans. The
maximum penalty the tribunal can impose is life imprisonment.
	   The chief judge said in some counts against Akeyesu, the
prosecution failed to prove its case. He was found innocent of
complicity to commit genocide, for instance, because the crimes of
genocide and complicity in genocide are mutually exclusive and
therefore they convicted him on the graver count, the judge said.
	   Akayesu will not be sentenced immediately, the tribunal said.
Several European countries have volunteered to incarcerate
convicts, but the tribunal would prefer those found guilty serve
their sentences in African countries.
	   On Friday, the tribunal is scheduled to sentence former Prime
Minister Jean Kambanda, who led Rwanda's government during the 1994
genocide. Kambanda pleaded guilty in May and promised to testify
against other alleged ringleaders of the slaughter.
	   The tribunal is holding 31 people in Arusha, four of whom are on
trial. Another person is in custody in Texas. Eight others have
been indicted, but not apprehended.
	   Rwandan courts _ in proceedings condemned by many foreign
lawyers as unjust _ have tried at least 330 people for involvement
in the genocide, and 116 have been sentenced to death. More than
125,000 people are imprisoned and awaiting trial.
	   On April 24, a Rwandan firing squad executed 22 people convicted
of genocide, the first executions for the slaughter.

Note on plane warns of bomb attack on U.S. mission in Manila
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ A handwritten note warning of a bomb attack on the
American Embassy in the Philippines was found on board a plane that
arrived from the United Arab Emirates, the Interior Ministry said
Wednesday.
	   ``The American Embassy in the Philippines will be bombed on
Sept. 4, 1998,'' the unsigned note in Arabic said, according to
Col. Bader Saleh, the ministry spokesman.
	   Security people searched the Emirates flight, which arrived from
Dubai Tuesday, but found nothing suspicious, the official said.
	   Kuwait was the scheduled destination of the flight, and it was
not clear if the aircraft was supposed to fly to Manila later. No
details were available on where in the aircraft the note was found
and by whom.
	   Claud Young, a U.S. Embassy spokesman, told The Associated Press
that ``we take all threats seriously.''
	   Washington has closed some of its diplomatic missions around the
world and maximized security in others following last month's twin
bombings of its embassies in Nairobi, Kenya and Dar es Salaam,
Tanzania. More than 250 people were killed and some 5,000 injured.
	   The bombings led to U.S. missile strikes at suspected training
camps for fundamentalist Muslims in Afghanistan and a
pharmaceutical plant in the Sudanese capital that the U.S.
government accused of making precursors for chemical weapons.

Dollar lower against yen, Japanese stocks rise
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Wraps up with late dollar, bond

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Lingering concern over the strength of the U.S.
stock market kept the dollar weaker against the Japanese yen on
Wednesday. Tokyo stocks made a marginal gain.
	   The dollar bought 137.62 yen at late afternoon, down 0.60 yen
from late Tuesday in Tokyo and also below its late New York level
of 139.25 yen overnight. The currency ranged from 136.50 yen to
138.04 yen.
	   The U.S. dollar fell as low as 135 yen in New York on Tuesday on
nervousness about the plunge in U.S. stock prices Monday, but then
strengthened as the Dow Jones industrial average recovered, traders
said.
	   On Tuesday, the Dow rose 288.36 points, or 3.8 percent, to
7,827.43 _ the second-biggest point gain in history.
	   But investors in Tokyo were reluctant to bid the dollar too high
on anxiety over the stability of U.S. asset prices, traders said. A
further fall in U.S. stocks could signal the beginning of a
slowdown in the U.S. economy, they said.
	   The Japanese government welcomed the stronger yen.
	   ``I think a trend of correction has begun,'' said Haruhiko
Kuroda, head of the international bureau at Japan's Ministry of
Finance.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 6.99 points,
or 0.05 percent, to 14,376.62, falling back after more impressive
gains in the morning session. It had gained 261.74 points, or 1.86
percent, the previous day.
	   Behind the rise was the rebound of New York stocks and reports
that the ruling Liberal Democratic Party and the opposition are
getting closer to a compromise on the bank reform debate.
	   Naoto Kan, leader of the Democratic Party of Japan, said in an
interview published Wednesday by the Mainichi newspaper that his
party won't block a plan to inject public funds into sickly banks
if they fully disclose the extent of their financial woes.
	   But investors remained cautious.
	   ``It is difficult to say what is going to happen in parliament
about the bank reform bills,'' said Hideaki Nakagawa, general
manager at the stock division of Meiko Securities. ``Investors are
still maintaining a wait-and-see stance.''
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section of the exchange was up 8.61 points, or 0.78 percent,
to 1,118.76. On Tuesday, it rose 3.66 points, or 0.33 percent.
	   Volume on the first section of the exchange was estimated at 485
million shares, up from 444.71 million shares Tuesday. Advancing
issues outnumbered retreaters 672 to 495, with 7 issues unchanged.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese government
bond fell to 1.065 percent from Tuesday's finish of 1.075 percent,
driving its price up to 112.66 yen from 112.60 yen.

	   DURBAN, South Africa (AP) _ Congo President Laurent Kabila
materialized at the Nonaligned Movement's summit Wednesday, raising
the prospects of progress in diplomatic efforts to halt the
fighting in his country.
	   Kabila had not been expected, taking many diplomats here by
surprise with his presence. In a sign of his hostility toward
mediation efforts by South Africa, he bypassed the official
greeting offered by President Nelson Mandela to arriving heads of
state.
	   The summit here is seen as a major opportunity to negotiate
peace in the war between Kabila and the rebels, which has drawn in
Angola, Zimbabwe and Namibia to Kabila's side.
	   ``It is good that he is here,'' Zimbabwe's Deputy High
Commissioner Danson Mudekunye said. ``The prospects for the peace
talks are much better now,'' he said.
	   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan flew into Durban on Tuesday,
where he planned to hold talks with regional leaders on a peace
plan.
	   ``We need to find a way of getting everybody to talk,'' Annan
told The Associated Press Tuesday night after he met with Mandela.

Singapore navy has test fired all missile types this year

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Demonstrating its ability to defend Singapore,
the navy conducted test firings during the past year of all the
missiles in its arsenal, the Defense Ministry said Wednesday.
	   The tested weapons, all assigned to Singapore's 1970s-era
refurbished gunboats, include: the Barak, which shoots down
incoming missiles; Harpoon anti-ship missiles; Mistral
anti-aircraft missiles and the Israeli-built Gabriel, according to
an article in The Straits Times that the Defense Ministry confirmed
as accurate.
	   The test firing of the Gabriel in the South China Sea last month
completed the testing, the paper said.

DURBAN: with Mandela.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   Mandela's peace initiatives have stalled and Annan's
participation could provide a much-needed boost. Annan's agenda for
Wednesday, the opening day of the heads of state summit, was
unclear, but he could meet on the sidelines with the leaders of
Angola, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Uganda and Rwanda, who were all
expected.
	   Uganda and Rwanda deny Kabila's allegations that they are
helping the rebels.
	   After a series of rapid rebel gains, Kabila's forces, backed by
the military might of his allies, have turned the tide of war and
are now pushing the insurgents back towards Congo's eastern
borders.
	   Though not invited to the summit, an anti-Kabila group called
the Council for a Federal Democratic Congo held a news conference
Tuesday and demanded Kabila's ouster, calling his regime brutal and
undemocratic.
	   Despite the group having only 15 members, a spokesman suggested
it be allowed to form the interim government which would then work
to hold elections.
	   After a shouting match in the hallway between the dissidents and
members of the Congolese delegation, Congo Justice Minister Mwenze
Kongolo then took the stage at the summit's press center and
disparaged the group.
	   ``We do not even know what color they are,'' he scoffed. ``Maybe
they're green.''
	   South African President Nelson Mandela and his new wife Graca
Machel _ widow of Mozambican leader and black liberation leader
Samora Machel _ greeted the heads of state Wednesday morning.
	   Cuban President Fidel Castro and Mandela exchanged an especially
warm embrace.
	   ``Fidel, Fidel, Fidel,'' Mandela said as he threw his arms
around Castro, dressed nattily in a grey business suit. The two old
revolutionaries hugged, then Castro embraced Mrs. Machel.
	   At talks held by foreign ministers and other delegates behind
closed doors, India was calling on the movement to declare it a
nuclear power, said a source attending the summit.
	   ``Such a stance would be against NAM principles'' which call for
nuclear disarmament, said the source on condition of anonymity.

Russian lawmakers call for compromise candidate, plan vote Friday
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Communists calling for compromise candidate, Duma
working on statement explaining why it rejected Chernomyrdin. &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Communists on Wednesday urged President Boris
Yeltsin to come up with a new candidate for prime minister, and
lawmakers agreed hold a second vote on the position Friday.
	   The State Duma, the lower house of parliament, overwhelmingly
rejected acting Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin on Monday,
saying he was incapable of leading the country out of its worst
economic crisis since the Soviet era.
	   ``Funerals, killings and catastrophes have become the main
content of Russian life,'' lawmakers said in a draft statement
explaining why they rejected Chernomyrdin. ``By turning
Chernomyrdin down, we voted no confidence in the president and
urged him to resign.''
	   Yeltsin insists he won't give up Chernomyrdin as his nominee
despite the risk of continued political and economic uncertainty if
that strategy fails.
	   Under the Russian Constitution, the president can present his
candidate for prime minister three times. If lawmakers reject
Yeltsin's choice all three times, the president must dissolve the
Duma and call new parliamentary elections within three months.
	   That would leave the country to be steered through crisis by
Yeltsin decrees and a stand-in government.
	   But Communist lawmakers and other government opponents say that
Chernomyrdin's prospects for winning approval are dim, and they
have criticized Yeltsin's handling of the crisis.
	   Former national security adviser Alexander Lebed said dissolving
parliament would be political suicide for Yeltsin.
	   ``Hatred for the present power has taken root in the Russian
provinces,'' said Lebed, who now is governor of the Krasnoyarsk
region of Siberia.
	   ``Therefore if the president decided to dissolve the Duma, he
will commit political hari-kari,'' he told the Interfax news
agency.
	   Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov called on both houses of
parliament to come up with a new candidate for Yeltsin to propose.
Zyuganov offered no names, but has previously suggested Moscow
Mayor Yuri Luzhkov, former Soviet bureaucrat Yuri Maslyukov and
several regional governors.
	   ``President Yeltsin is pushing the nation to a civil war,'' said
Zyuganov, who is due to meet with U.S. President Bill Clinton on
Wednesday.
	   Yeltsin nominated Chernomyrdin last week, just five months after
replacing him with the young Sergei Kiriyenko. Yeltsin dismissed
Kiriyenko on Aug. 23.
	   Yeltsin assured Clinton that he wouldn't abandon democratic and
market reforms.
	   ``Russia's strategic course of reform is inevitable,'' he
declared in a speech at the state dinner honoring Clinton on
Tuesday evening.
	   Chernomyrdin meanwhile outlined several planks of his plan to
battle the country's economic crisis.
	   He called for a radical overhaul of a taxation system that he
oversaw during five turbulent years as prime minister. Very few
Russians and Russian companies pay taxes, leaving the government
unable to pay state workers and pensioners.
	   ``Without tax reform, which would stimulate production, we won't
survive,'' Chernomyrdin said.
	   Chernomyrdin also reiterated that the acting government was
considering different options to improve the terms of the
government's debt restructuring, which was announced Aug. 17.

Top Vietnamese dissident vows continued activism
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ A top Vietnamese dissident, just freed
from a Hanoi prison and headed for the United States, has vowed to
keep fighting for freedom and democracy, and called on other
Vietnamese to do likewise.
	   Doan Viet Hoat was freed from a Hanoi prison under an amnesty
for 5,219 inmates to mark Vietnam's National Day on Tuesday. He was
immediately expelled from his homeland and flown to Bangkok,
Thailand en route to resettlement in the United States.
	   In an interview one day after being pardoned from his 15-year
sentence for publishing pro-democracy newsletters, Hoat said that
he needed to study Vietnam's situation further before deciding
exactly what pro-democracy work he would do.
	   Because he was not allowed access to newspapers, books or any
other information while in prison, he had been ``totally ignorant
as to what was happening in Vietnam or the outside world,' he said
in his interview with by the U.S. government-funded Radio Free
Asia. A transcript of the interview was released Wednesday.
	   ``Everyone of us should be free to express his opinion, to speak
up his mind on questions of culture and ideology openly and
legally, and to have political rights... if we are to have a
country that is truly free,'' he said.
	   Hoat, whose case was the object of international appeals,
especially from groups concerned with freedom of expression, said
foreign pressure for human rights and democracy in Vietnam had some
success.
	   But the main impetus for change must come from inside Vietnam,
he said.
	   ``If the people and the intellectuals who understand the
situation refuse to speak up, to struggle for these same rights,
then I think it will be a long time before we see this movement
reach an apex,'' he said.
	   Hoat, an educator trained at the University of Florida, was
imprisoned on political charges from 1976-88, and rearrested in
1990 for circulating an unauthorized newsletter.
	   He said he was denied the choice of remaining in his country
after his release.
	   Another dissident, Nguyen Dan Que, and two Vietnamese-Americans
jailed for alleged plots to overthrow Vietnam's government by
violence were also among those freed by the amnesty.
	   Que was released and has been approved for resettlement in the
United States. U.S. Embassy officials in Bangkok said. He has
apparently has not left Vietnam yet.
	   Vietnamese-Americans Jimmy Tran and Ly Tong also were released,
a Vietnamese government source said Tuesday. Tran arrived in San
Jose, California, and Tong flew into San Francisco on Tuesday
afternoon.
	   Vietnam denies it holds anyone for political or religious
beliefs, only those who have broken the law. Human rights groups
counter that a number of people are jailed for violating the
all-encompassing national security law or the strict regulation of
religious activities.

Israel presses China on weapons proliferation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Israel's defense minister pressed China on
Wednesday to help prevent Israel's enemies from getting hold of
advanced weapons technologies.
	   Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai said he also asked Chinese
President Jiang Zemin to talk to Iran about missing Israeli airman
Ron Arad.
	   Jiang said China already has asked Iran, one of its diplomatic
partners in the Middle East, twice about Arad, without effect,
Mordechai told Israeli radio.
	   Arad was shot down during an October 1986 bombing mission over
south Lebanon. Israel believes he is alive and being held either by
Iranian-backed Shiite Muslim guerrillas in Lebanon or in Iran.
	   Mordechai, who is on a four-day visit, said he spent a ``very
friendly'' 90 minutes with Jiang, three times longer than planned.
	   He said they discussed cooperation on all fronts and threats to
Israel, mostly from Iran.
	   ``I asked him to make all efforts to prevent enemy nations from
achieving advanced technology that could be aimed against Israel,''
Mordechai said on the radio.
	   Mordechai did not say how Jiang responded. But on a visit to
China in May, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he
received an ``absolute commitment'' from Chinese leaders that they
are not providing Iran with technology for nuclear, chemical and
biological weapons or surface-to-surface missiles and will not do

Chinese dissidents demand colleagues' release
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ With a visit by the U.N.'s top human rights
inspector days away, Chinese dissidents have urged the government
to release two detained colleagues and stop using flimsy laws to
suppress dissent.
	   In a pair of open letters signed Tuesday and released Wednesday,
more than 150 dissidents criticized the often arbitrary exercise of
power in China. They said charges of endangering state security
leveled at detained activists Zhang Shanguang and Chen Zengxiang
are trumped-up.
	   ``The law has become a whip in the hands of the authorities.
They use it however they please,'' said one letter signed by 136
dissidents and released by New York-based Human Rights in China.
	   Their criticisms come amid confusing signals by China's
Communist Party leaders about their tolerance for open dissent.
	   A Hong Kong-based dissident monitoring group reported Wednesday
that police detained at least three campaigners Tuesday. Xu Wenli,
a veteran activist in Beijing, and his wife were detained during a
visit to Xi'an city. Wang Yingzheng, from eastern Jiangsu province,
was taken away in the central city of Wuhan.
	   Their whereabouts could not be determined Wednesday, the
Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China
reported. It added that Xu and Wang had met well-known democracy
campaigners during their trips.
	   Despite the detentions, police freed Wang Youcai on Sunday, more
than seven weeks after arresting him for trying to form an
opposition party.
	   Dissidents took Wang's release as a gesture by Chinese leaders
to improve the atmosphere for next week's visit by Mary Robinson.
She is the first U.N. high commissioner for human rights to make an
official trip to China and both sides hope it will open the door to
better cooperation.
	   During her weeklong visit, China is likely to sign the
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, something it
pledged to do six months ago.
	   The pact guarantees basic civil liberties, and signing it will
show the government is serious about moving toward a more lawful
society, said 17 dissidents from eastern Shandong province.
	   They urged the government to release Chen Zengxiang, detained in
May, apparently for joining an overseas-based opposition political
party.
	   The 136 dissidents demanded Chinese leaders free labor rights
campaigner Zhang Shanguang, the last of more than 20 activists
detained in mid-July in one of the most concerted police sweeps
against the beleaguered dissident community in years.

Ex-mayor guilty of genocide in first such international verdict

held over for sentencing &QL;

<TEXT>
	   ARUSHA, Tanzania (AP) _ A U.N. tribunal, in the first
international conviction for genocide, on Wednesday found a Rwandan
ex-mayor guilty in the savage bloodletting that killed more than
500,000 Rwandans in 1994.
	   The former mayor, Jean-Paul Akayesu, was convicted on nine of 15
counts, including genocide, crimes against humanity, torture and
rape.
	   The chief judge, Laity Kama of Senegal, ordered Akayesu to stand
as the verdicts were read. He did so, weaving slightly from left to
right as the judgment was read aloud.
	   ``The accused, Jean-Paul Akeyesu, you are declared guilty of
genocide,'' Kama intoned. Each time a guilty verdict was read,
Akayesu furrowed his brow slightly and winced.
	   The International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda said the judgment
against Akayesu was the first for the crime of genocide by an
international court, and also the first for sexual violence.
	   All those accused in the post-World War II Nuremberg trials
pleaded innocent to charges including murder and extermination.
Those trials pre-dated the creation of the crime of genocide 50
years ago.
	   Akayesu, a Hutu former teacher born in 1953, was convicted of
ordering the killings of 2,000 people who sought his protection in
the central village of Taba.
	   They were among more than 500,000 Rwandans, mostly minority
Tutsis but also moderate Hutus, who were butchered with machetes
and nail-studded clubs in a genocide carefully orchestrated by
extremists in the former Hutu government.
	   During Wednesday's 1 1/2-hour tribunal session, Kama said the
three-judge panel rejected defense arguments that Akayesu was
helpless to prevent the killings because the soldiers and militia
were more powerful than he was as a politician.
	   In Rwanda, a mayor ``was treated with a lot of deference by the
people and had a lot of power,'' the judge said. He called the
killing rampage ``meticulously organized.''
	   Akayesu was ordered held over in Arusha pending a pre-sentencing
hearing on Sept. 28. The maximum penalty the tribunal can impose is
life imprisonment.
	   Several European countries have volunteered to incarcerate
convicts, but the tribunal would prefer those found guilty serve
their sentences in African countries.
	   The tribunal, based in Arusha, Tanzania, was set up in November
1994 but until now had not yet reached a verdict in any case, a
time lag that has been criticized by Rwandans.
	   Akayesu's trial began in January 1997. The tribunal heard from
42 witnesses, and transcripts ran 4,000 pages.
	   The chief judge said in some counts against Akeyesu, the
prosecution failed to prove its case. He was found innocent of
complicity to commit genocide, for instance, because the crimes of
genocide and complicity in genocide are mutually exclusive and
therefore they convicted him on the graver count, the judge said.
	   The tribunal is holding 31 people in Arusha, four of whom are on
trial. Another person is in custody in Texas. Eight others have
been indicted, but not apprehended.
	   Rwandan courts _ in proceedings condemned by many foreign
lawyers as unjust _ have tried at least 330 people for involvement
in the genocide, and 116 have been sentenced to death. More than
125,000 people are imprisoned and awaiting trial.
	   On April 24, a Rwandan firing squad executed 22 people convicted
of genocide, the first executions for the slaughter.
	   The Rwanda genocide went on for 90 days, beginning April 7,
1994, the day after President Juvenal Habyarimana plane's was shot
down, and ending when Tutsi rebels took power.

Newspaper: Austria sees sharp rise in asylum seekers from Kosovo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- The number of Kosovo Albanians seeking
aylum in Austria is rising sharply, increasing fears that the
long-expected refugee wave to Western Europe from the troubled Serb
province is underway, a Vienna newspaper reported Wednesday.
	   Der Standard said an average of 200 Kosovo Albanians were
seeking refuge here each week, up sharply from the 77 who asked for
aylum in January -- one month before Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic launched a crackdown against secessionist rebels.
	   As of Aug. 1, the newspaper said, a total of 5,645 people from
many countries had sought asylum in Austria, surpassing the 5,500
figure for the whole of last year.
	   Of the overall figure, the majority -- about 2,800 -- were
Kosovo Albanians.
	   Only about 10 percent of the Kosovo Albanians will receive
asylum status, however, because few of them can produce evidence
that they were personally targeted for reprisals by Serbian
authorities.
	   For months, German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and other Western
European leaders have warned that unless the Kosovo conflict can be
resolved, their countries will face a wave of refugees from the
area, one of the poorest sections of the continent.
	   The United Nations estimates that more than 230,000 people have
fled their homes in Kosovo to escape the fighting. Many of them
traveled to nearby Montenegro, Albania and Macedonia.
	   But those countries are poor and lack the resources to care for
displaced people. The economies offer little or no opportunity for
work for people who have lost everything back home.
	   As a result, many are expected to try to move on to prosperous
countries of Western Europe -- notably Austria, Italy, Germany and
Switzerland.
	   As the easternmost member of the European Union, Austria is
often the first EU state reached by asylum-seekers from the Balkans
and the Middle East.

Ukraine to sell military and transport planes to Pakistan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine wants to sell military and
transport planes to Pakistan, a newspaper reported Wednesday.
	   The Antonov aircraft company will offer three military planes _
the An-74, An-72 and An-38 _ to a visiting Pakistani military
delegation this week, the company's marketing director, Oleksandr
Kiva, was quoted as saying.

military equipment after Russia.
	   In 1996, Ukraine signed a three-year dlrs 600 million deal to
supply 320 T-80UD tanks to Pakistan, the former Soviet republic's
largest military contract to date.
	   Ukraine also plans to participate in the production of a new
MBT-2000 tank, jointly designed by China and Pakistan, Fakty
newspaper said.
	   Ukraine was 14th in world arms sales in 1996 and hopes to earn
dlrs 500 million this year from arms exports.

Yemen Hunt Oil Company workers suspend strike
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By AHMAD AL-HAJ &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ Workers at a U.S. oil company suspended
their strike Wednesday after reaching an agreement with the labor
and petroleum ministries on more benefits, a union official said.
	   He said negotiations continued all night Tuesday and the 1,300
workers who had been on strike since Monday were back at work at
the Hunt Oil Company.
	   They will, however, initially work for 45 days to see if the
authorities fulfill their promise, said the official speaking on
condition of anonymity.
	   He said the labor and petroleum ministries agreed to provide the
workers with full medical insurance, annual raises, and higher pay
for high-risk work.
	   The union's president, Mahmoud Maqtari, and three members of the
union's executive committee who were arrested Monday for going on
strike have been released, the official said.
	   The decision to strike came after the union failed to reach a
compromise with the oil company and the Oil Ministry.
	   The workers, including technical and management staff, had
demanded full medical insurance, increased pay for overtime, late
shifts and high-risk work, and equal treatment with American
co-workers.
	   Hunt Oil, which is based in Texas, has a concession in an oil
field at Marib in northern Yemen with a production capacity of
165,000 barrels per day.
	   In addition to its Yemeni staff, the company has 30 foreign
workers in the country.

New Minister urges flag change
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ New Cultural Affairs Minister
Marie Hasler said Wednesday she wants to replace New Zealand's
flag, which features Britain's Union Jack, with a new ensign based
on the silver fern symbol.
	   ``For some years I have believed our existing flag no longer
catches the essence of contemporary New Zealand,'' said Hasler, who
was appointed in Sunday's reshuffle.
	   ``It is not just that it is barely distinguishable from the
Australian ensign or even that it too much reflects our former
colonial status,'' she said. ``Rather it has become over time
almost meaningless.''
	   She said a national debate should be started to decide on a new
design.
	   ``Changing the flag need not diminish our English and European
heritage, but it would give explicit recognition that we are now a
really distinctive and independent culture,'' Hasler said.
	   She said that it would be hard to improve on the elegant
simplicity and power of the silver fern on a black background, but
she wanted the nation to discuss it and give the Government ``a
signal as to their thoughts.''
	   The silver fern is a common logo for New Zealand's sporting
teams, including the famous All Blacks rugby outfit. New Zealand's
flag features a combination of the Union Jack and stars and is
similar to the design of near neighbor Australia's flag.

Two soldiers convicted of murdering Belfast Catholic paroled
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: NEW throughout
 &UR; By SHAWN POGATCHNIK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Two British soldiers convicted
of murdering an unarmed Catholic teen-ager have become the first
life-sentence prisoners paroled from a Northern Ireland prison in
response to the Belfast peace accord.
	   Britain's governor for Northern Ireland, Mo Mowlam, on Wednesday
ordered immediate freedom for Scots Guardsmen Jim Fisher, 30, and
Mark Wright, 25, from Maghaberry prison west of Belfast.
	   In reaching her decision, Mowlam emphasized that many convicted
members of the Irish Republican Army and pro-British paramilitary
groups ``engaged in terrorism'' were expected to be freed starting
next Monday, the most controversial aspect of April's peace
agreement.
	   ``The Guardsmen were in Northern Ireland as a consequence of
that terrorism and committed the offense while on duty to counter
it,'' Mowlam said in drawing a distinction between their case and
the others.
	   When the British government in 1995 last announced an
exceptional parole for a soldier convicted of murder in Northern
Ireland, it sparked three nights of rioting in many working-class
Catholic areas.
	   But the political landscape has changed dramatically since then,
partly because of the agreement's promise to free up to 420
convicted members of truce-observing paramilitary groups. The Irish
government has already freed more than a dozen IRA prisoners early.
	   The timing of Mowlam's announcement also appeared linked to the
imminent arrival Thursday in Northern Ireland of President Clinton,
an event that some politicians have seized on to shift their
positions _ and put all sides on their best behavior.
	   Relatives of the two soldiers and the many British lawmakers and
retired army personnel who had campaigned for their early parole
were ecstatic. Mowlam phoned the two prisoners' mothers in Scotland
before announcing her decision.
	   ``We're absolutely delighted. I'm stunned. I haven't come to
terms with it,'' said Fisher's sister Angela.
	   But relatives of Peter McBride, the 18-year-old civilian shot
fatally in the back by the soldiers six years ago in a Catholic
section of north Belfast, responded with fury.
	   ``Mo Mowlam told my mammy that they would not be the first two
through the (prison) gate and they were,'' said McBride's sister
Roisin, noting that the sixth anniversary of her brother's murder
will be Friday.
	   Wright and Fisher were arrested almost immediately after
shooting McBride in the back when he ran away from their foot
patrol. The soldiers claimed he was about to throw a homemade
grenade at them, but he was unarmed.
	   Earlier this year, the two soldiers were moved into their own
building within Maghaberry prison after receiving death threats
from prisoners from hard-line Catholic areas of Belfast.
	   The army had allowed the two paid leave during their
incarceration and they will be eligible to resume duties in the
Scots Guards.
	   ``They're still in the army, two murderers,'' said Roisin
McBride. ``I'm totally disgusted.''
	   Since the September 1992 shooting of McBride, the British army _
responsible for killing about 300 people in Northern Ireland since
being deployed as would-be peacekeepers in 1969 _ has committed no
other fatal shootings of civilians in Northern Ireland.

 &UR; Indonesian military sends troops back to troubled province

<TEXT>
	   LHOKSEUMAWE, Indonesia (AP) _ Citing security concerns,
Indonesia's military chief on Wednesday angrily reversed a decision
to withdraw troops from a northern province as fresh riots broke
out.
	   The decision could fuel tension in Aceh province, where soldiers
have been accused of atrocities while suppressing Islamic
separatist rebels in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Investigators
have found mass graves with alleged victims of the military.
	   Last month, armed forces chief Gen. Wiranto apologized and
pulled out 1,000 soldiers in a conciliatory gesture, but sent
hundreds back to the province Tuesday to secure the riot-torn town
of Lhokseumawe.
	   The town was quiet Wednesday, with thousands of anti-riot
officers patrolling the streets. But rioting spread to the nearby
town of Idi, where mobs looted stores and burned goods.
	   Teen-agers in school uniforms started the riot and bystanders
then joined in, police Lt. Col. Suminar said by telephone. There
were no reports of casualties.
	   Two days of unrest in Lhokseumawe, on the northern tip of
Sumatra island, left a wide path of destruction: mobs burned
buildings and hurled stones at shops owned by ethnic Chinese, a
common scapegoat. Even children joined in the looting.
	   Hundreds of Chinese fled, leaving their stores abandoned.
	   After a Cabinet meeting in Jakarta, Wiranto condemned the riots
as ``an act of anarchy'' and said Acehnese religious and social
leaders would no longer be in charge of keeping order.
	   ``From now on, the armed forces is taking over the security in
Aceh,'' he said. He brushed off questions about how long the
military would stay, saying: ``You ask the Acehnese people.''
	   Abdurrahman Yacoub, a human rights lawyer in Aceh, said there
were 6,000 troops in the province and more were not needed. He said
soldiers in Lhokseumawe were slow to react to the riots and could
have prevented them with better intelligence.
	   The unrest erupted Monday after a contingent of 660 Indonesian
soldiers left Aceh in line with the military's efforts to restore
an image sullied by accusations of human rights violations.
	   Crowds pelted the military trucks with stones as they departed
and then rampaged through the streets, some shouting ``Free Aceh!''
and other separatist slogans.
	   Many chose to vent their anger on the ethnic Chinese minority,
which is viewed with suspicion partly because it dominates business
in economically struggling Indonesia.
	   Police said one man was killed, after earlier reporting two
deaths. They did not confirm accounts by residents that the victim
was shot by security forces.
	   Hundreds of soldiers were guarding a natural gas refinery and
other state-run industrial sites in Lhokseumawe. Mobil Corp., the
U.S. oil company, has operations in the area.
	   Ninety prisoners, meanwhile, were at large after crowds stormed
the town prison Monday night and freed most of the inmates. Dozens
have since surrendered and the prison chief said more were expected
to turn themselves in.
	   ``Some have contacted us to say they will come back to the
prison after the situation calms down,'' said warden Kustopo
Widodo.
	   The riots were the worst since unrest helped oust former
autocratic President Suharto in mid-May. About 1,200 people died in
street violence in Jakarta, the capital.
	   Suharto's successor, B.J. Habibie, is implementing democratic
reforms but fears abound that Indonesia's economic crisis and the
strain on millions of poor people could lead to bigger riots.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia's central bank confirmed
Wednesday that the country's currency has been fixed at 3.80 to the
U.S. dollar, far stronger than what it was trading in the markets.
	   The move seems to contradict earlier statements by government
officials that the ringgit rate would not be fixed and that the
currency would be determined by supply and demand in the local
market.
	   In a last-ditch effort to save his country's embattled economy,
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad announced Tuesday that the
government would ban trading of the ringgit outside the country.
The measure was one on a sweeping list of capital controls that
included halting the trade of Malaysian shares overseas.
	   Confused by what the measures mean, Singapore's stockbroking
houses indefinitely halted trading on the Kuala Lumpur Stock
Exchange, traders said Wednesday.
	   Traders said the move will hurt the houses, particularly
international ones, as Malaysian markets account for ``a good
chunk'' of their business.
	   Malaysian shares account for about a quarter of trading on the
Singapore Stock Exchange.
	   Mahathir said reverting to a fixed exchange rate would fend off
currency speculators and help insulate its fragile economy from
further global shocks.
	    &UR; _____
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's central bank governor and
finance minister reaffirmed Wednesday that no new capital controls
will be imposed in imitation of Malaysia's virtual shutdown of
currency trading to fix its exchange rate.
	   The officials spoke as Thailand's currency, battered for more
than a year in the Asian economic crisis, gained new strength as a
regional shelter because of the moves in neighboring Malaysia.
	   Chatu Mongol Sonakul, governor of the Bank of Thailand, told a
news conference that Malaysia's controls should have little ill
effect on the Thai baht or on the economy. The baht was
strengthening to around 40.50 to dlrs 1 from 40.725 late Tuesday.
	   ``We have nothing to worry about,'' Finance Minister Tarrin
Nimmanahaeminda told reporters. ``Our domestic interest rates are
declining and the baht has remained stable.''
	   Both men said no further capital controls would be imposed on
Thailand if the baht remains stable. Thailand restricts baht loans
to non-residents to 50 million baht unless an underlying
transaction or domestic investment can be documented.
	   Chatu Mongol said that Malaysian importers may face transaction
costs higher when purchasing Thai exports since they will not be
able to pay for them in ringgit.
	    &UR; _____
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thai prosecutors have found billions of
baht (tens of millions of dollars) worth of overseas assets
belonging to suspects in a Thai bank scandal and ordered them
frozen, a newspaper reported Wednesday.
	   The Nation reported that the assets were located in Switzerland,
Canada and Russia. No precise figure was given.
	   The Nation reported that several politicians were among the
suspects in the scandal, which involved borrowing money from the
Bangkok Bank of Commerce with insufficient collateral and never
repaying it. No names were given.
	   The Bangkok Bank of Commerce was the center of Thailand's
biggest-ever banking scandal. In 1996, directors revealed that it
had bad debts approaching 75 billion baht (dlrs 3 billion at the
time).
	   The bank's troubles triggered a loss of confidence in the Thai
banking system that led to floating the baht a year later, the move
that triggered the Asian economic crisis.
	   So far, no one has been convicted of any wrongdoing in the bank,
though violations of Thai banking regulations were legion. After
being kept alive by the government for the past two years, the bank
was closed as part of recent financial reforms.

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Flag carrier Garuda Indonesia will lay
off at least 3,000 of its nearly 13,000 workers beginning in early
October, a newspaper reported Wednesday.
	   The employees are being dismissed as part of a massive
restructuring program, The Jakarta Post quoted Robby Djohan,
president of the airline, as saying.
	   The debt-laden airline has fallen victim to Indonesia's worst
economic turmoil in decades. With 80 percent of its operating costs
in dollars, Garuda has been hit hard by the rupiah's sharp fall
over the last year.
	   Djohan said Tuesday that the layoff process would be gradual and
some workers might be moved to Garuda subsidiaries or its
maintenance facility at Jakarta's international airport. However,
Garuda plans to sell the dlrs 300 million facility as a
cost-cutting measure.
	   Djohan said he was confident that creditors would agree with
Garuda's proposal to roll over up to dlrs 300 million of the
airline's dlrs 400 million in overseas debt.
	   ``They must accept it. After all, they gave us short-term loans
when they knew that the loans would be used for long-term
programs,'' the Post quoted him as saying.
	   Garuda currently operates 50 aircraft.

Wall Street recovery primes the pump in Asia and Europe
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: New thruout to UPDATE with Hong Kong closing sharply higher,
London and Frankfurt also opening with gains. &QL; 
 &UR; By THOMAS WAGNER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Wall Street's dramatic U-turn from big losses to a
big gain sent Asia's three main stock indexes higher Wednesday,
despite the region's ongoing economic woes.
	   In Tokyo, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average opened 0.72 percent
higher, but the end of the day its gain had slipped to 6.99 points,
or 0.05 percent, for a close of 14,376.62.
	   Although it was the Nikkei's third straight day of improvement,
many people still believe the Tokyo Stock Market has a long way to
go since it sank to a 12-year low on Friday.
	   In Singapore, where the stock market has undergone one bad day
after another lately, the Straits Times Index climbed 1.1 percent,
or 8.91 points, to 832.24, soon after trading began. By midday its
advance had slipped to 0.4 percent.
	   Dealers credited the gain to the dramatic overnight rebound of
288.36 points, or 3.8 percent, on the Dow Jones industrial average.
In fact, one trader on the scene in Singapore called Wednesday's
activity ``bargain hunting at its best.''
	   In Hong Kong, shares closed sharply higher, also lifted by the
strong rebound on Wall Street, brokers said. The blue-chip Hang
Seng Index traded in positive territory throughout the session and
ended up 293.20 points, or 4.2 percent, at 7,355.67.
	   The news form Wall Street and Russia, where U.S. President Bill
Clinton was meeting with the beleaguered Boris Yeltsin, was one of
several factors affecting the Hong Kong market, Hui said.
	   Shares also moved sharply higher from the outset of trading on
the top two European exchanges Wednesday.
	   London's Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index jumped
108.9 points, or 2.1 percent, to 5,278.0 after just a few minutes
of trading on Europe's biggest stock market. In Frankfurt, the
Xetra DAX index shot up by 2.7 percent in early dealings but then
gave up some ground to show a gain of 2.5 percent at 4,976.63.
	   Given how long Asia's financial crisis has battered its stock
and currency markets, Wall Street's one-day recovery may only
amount to a brief respite for the region.
	   The Dow's volatility, and the big losses it has suffered since
July, have left some economists wondering whether the U.S. economy
could slow down and even slip into a recession.
	   When the Dow plunged 512 points on Monday, it raised concerns in
Asia about whether the region's 14-month-old financial crisis had
spread to the West, especially Russia.
	   The Russian instability, widely regarded as the country's worst
since the fall of Communism, already has begun to batter European
companies, economies and stock markets.
	   In fact, just before Tuesday's dramatic rebound on Wall Street,
an editorial in Japan's Yomiuri newspaper had warned readers: ``It
is even possible that the plunging markets could trigger a global
depression, which would in turn throw the entire international
economic system into chaos.''
	   Questions also remain about the future of Japan, the world's
second-largest economy and a crucial factor in Asia.
	   For weeks, a stalemate in parliament has been preventing the
administration of Japan's new prime minister, Keizo Obuchi, from
using taxpayer money to prop up the nation's troubled banks.
	   But Naoto Kan, the leader of Japan's largest opposition party,
reportedly has just dropped his opposition to the Obuchi
administration bailout plan.
	   Uncertainty over the fate of the legislation _ and the entire
banking system _ has unnerved investors both in Japan and abroad.
	   The United States often has criticized Japan for failing to
revive its own economy, and a breakthrough in the banking reform
debate could benefit Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa.
	   On Friday, he is scheduled to meet in San Francisco with U.S.
Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and with U.S. Federal Reserve
Chairman Alan Greenspan.

<TEXT>
	   ARUSHA, Tanzania (AP) _ A U.N. tribunal, in the first
international conviction for genocide, on Wednesday found a Rwandan
ex-mayor guilty in the savage bloodletting that killed more than
500,000 Rwandans in 1994.
	   The former mayor, Jean-Paul Akayesu, was convicted on nine of 15
counts, including genocide, crimes against humanity, torture and
rape.
	   In Rwanda, the scene of the slaughter _ where the slow pace of
the tribunal's work has been harshly criticized _ the verdict was
greeted with some cynicism.
	   ``I don't see the people in Rwanda going to the streets to
congratulate the international court on this one,'' said Patrick
Mazimhaka, a state minister. ``It has gone on for so long and I
think people have given up.''
	   At the tribunal session, the chief judge, Laity Kama of Senegal,
ordered Akayesu to stand as the verdicts were read. He did so,
weaving slightly from side to side as the judgment was read aloud.
	   ``The accused, Jean-Paul Akayesu _ you are declared guilty of
genocide,'' Kama intoned. Each time a guilty verdict was read,
Akayesu furrowed his brow slightly and winced.
	   The International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda said the judgment
against Akayesu was the first for the crime of genocide by an
international court, and also the first for sexual violence.
	   All those accused in the post-World War II Nuremberg trials
pleaded innocent to charges including murder and extermination.
Those trials pre-dated the creation of the crime of genocide 50
years ago.
	   Akayesu, a Hutu former teacher born in 1953, was convicted of
ordering the killings of 2,000 people who sought his protection in
the central village of Taba.
	   They were among more than 500,000 Rwandans, mostly minority
Tutsis but also moderate Hutus, who were butchered with machetes
and nail-studded clubs in a genocide carefully orchestrated by
extremists in the former Hutu government.
	   During Wednesday's 1 1/2-hour tribunal session, Kama said the
three-judge panel rejected defense arguments that Akayesu was
helpless to prevent the killings because the soldiers and militia
were more powerful than he was as a politician.
	   In Rwanda, a mayor ``was treated with a lot of deference by the
people and had a lot of power,'' the judge said. He called the
killing rampage ``meticulously organized.''
	   Akayesu was ordered held over in Arusha pending a pre-sentencing
hearing on Sept. 28. The maximum penalty the tribunal can impose is
life imprisonment.
	   Several European countries have volunteered to incarcerate
convicts, but the tribunal would prefer those found guilty serve
their sentences in African countries.
	   The tribunal was set up in November 1994 but until now had not
yet reached a verdict in any case, a time lag that has been sharply
criticized by Rwandans.
	   Akayesu's trial began in January 1997. During it, the tribunal
heard from 42 witnesses, and transcripts ran 4,000 pages.
	   The chief judge said in six of the counts against Akeyesu, the
prosecution failed to prove its case.
	   He was found innocent of complicity to commit genocide, for
instance, because the judge said the crimes of genocide and
complicity in genocide were mutually exclusive. He was convicted on
the graver count.
	   The tribunal is holding 31 people in Arusha, four of whom are on
trial. Another person is in custody in Texas. Eight others have
been indicted, but not apprehended.
	   Rwandan courts _ in proceedings condemned by many foreign
lawyers as unjust _ have tried at least 330 people for involvement
in the genocide, and 116 have been sentenced to death. More than
125,000 people are imprisoned and awaiting trial.
	   On April 24, a Rwandan firing squad executed 22 people convicted
of genocide, the first executions for the slaughter.
	   The Rwanda genocide went on for 90 days, beginning April 7,
1994, the day after President Juvenal Habyarimana plane's was shot
down, and ending when Tutsi rebels took power.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Communists on Wednesday urged President Boris
Yeltsin to come up with a new, compromise candidate for prime
minister, and lawmakers agreed to hold a second vote on the
position Friday.
	   The State Duma, the lower house of parliament, overwhelmingly
rejected acting Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin on Monday,
saying he was incapable of leading the country out of its worst
economic crisis since the Soviet era.
	   ``Funerals, killings and catastrophes have become the main
content of Russian life,'' lawmakers said in a draft statement
explaining why they rejected Chernomyrdin. ``By turning
Chernomyrdin down, we voted no confidence in the president and
urged him to resign.''
	   Yeltsin insists he won't give up Chernomyrdin as his nominee
despite the risk of continued political and economic uncertainty if
that strategy fails.
	   Under the Russian Constitution, the president can present his
candidate for prime minister three times. If lawmakers reject
Yeltsin's choice all three times, the president must dissolve the
Duma and call new parliamentary elections within three months.
	   That would leave the country to be steered through crisis by
Yeltsin decrees and a stand-in government.
	   Communists and their hard-line allies say that Chernomyrdin's
prospects for winning approval are dim, and they have criticized
Yeltsin's handling of the crisis.
	   But ultranationalist leader Vladimir Zhirinovsky indicated
Wednesday that his party, which abstained in Monday's vote, would
support Chernomyrdin as the candidate best able to pull the economy
out of its tailspin.
	   ``It would be easier for him to continue the surgery since he
has just come out of the operation room,'' Zhirinovsky told
reporters, referring to Chernomyrdin's five-year stint as prime
minister before his surprise firing in March.
	   Zhirinovsky's Liberal Democratic Party is the third largest in
parliament's lower house with 50 members.

Yemen Hunt Oil Company workers suspend strike

<TEXT>
	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ Workers at a U.S. oil company suspended
their strike Wednesday after reaching an agreement with the labor
and petroleum ministries on more benefits, a union official said.
	   The official said negotiations continued all night Tuesday and
the 1,300 workers who had been on strike since Monday were back at
work at the Hunt Oil Company.
	   They will initially work for 45 days to see if the authorities
fulfill their promise, said the official speaking on condition of
anonymity.
	   The labor and petroleum ministries agreed to workers demand for
full medical insurance, annual raises, and higher pay for high-risk
work, the official said.
	   The union's president, Mahmoud Maqtari, and three members of the
union's executive committee who were arrested Monday for going on
strike have been released, the official said.
	   Hunt Oil, which is based in Texas, has a concession in an oil
field at Marib in northern Yemen with a production capacity of
165,000 barrels per day.

Ex-NATO chief Claes, others go on trial for corruption
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BRU101-103 &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT WIELAARD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Several prominent socialists _
including ex-NATO chief Willy Claes _ went on trial Wednesday
accused of taking millions of dollars in bribes stemming from two
defense contracts Belgium awarded in the late 1980s.
	   Claes, 59, a former economics minister, ex-defense minister Guy
Coeme, 52, and ex-deputy premier Guy Spitaels, 67, deny the
charges.
	   They arrived at Brussels' main courthouse where, shielded by
police, they pushed their way through hundreds of reporters, camera
crews and photographers. They made no statements.
	   Prosecutors allege Italy's Agusta SpA paid 51 million francs
(dlrs 1.37 million) to win a December, 1988, contract to build 46
army helicopters. They also say France's Dassault Aviation SA paid
a bribe of 60 million francs (dlrs 1.62 million) to win a June,
1989, deal to equip Belgian F-16 jets with new electronics.
	   The two contracts were worth hundreds of millions of dollars
each.
	   Serge Dassault, 73, of Dassault Aviation is also a defendant. He
got to the court house long before the first journalist did.
Charges have been dropped against ex-Agusta executive Raffaelo Teti
who died Aug. 22, aged 72, of a heart attack.
	   The Agusta and Dassault ``gifts'' were allegedly funneled to
Belgium's Dutch and French-speaking socialist parties from Swiss
bank accounts.
	   The trial is expected to last months. It is held in the supreme
court after the parliamentary immunity of Claes and other onetime
cabinet members had been been lifted.
	   The trial is the final curtain for party bosses who ran their
political families unhampered by laws regulating corporate
donations. In the 1980s, such donations were legal.
	   Thus, prosecutors need not prove money was paid but must show
the Agusta and Dassault ``gifts'' were timed so closely to the
awarding of contracts they had to be bribes and that the defendants
knew that and are therefore guilty of corruption.
	   In 1989, Belgium outlawed corporate donations to politicians.
	   Claes became NATO secretary general Sept. 29, 1994. He quit that
prestigious job Oct. 19, 1995, amid charges of financial wrongdoing
from his days as Belgian economics minister
	   He was long a powerbroker in the Dutch-speaking Socialist Party.
Spitaels, the former deputy premier, has long been the mainstay of
French-speaking socialists.
	   For Coeme, the former defense minister and a francophone
socialist, the trial is his second in two years. In 1996, the
supreme court gave him a two-year suspended jail term for
corruption involving phony, opinion surveys at government expense.
	   On trial with the former ministers are aides who, prosecutors
say, played a key role in getting the Agusta and Dassault money
through a tangled web of bank transfers.
	   At the time, the government said Agusta and Dassault offered
better economic compensation than their rivals _ respectively
France's Aerospatiale SA and Litton Industries Inc. of the United
States. Such compensation usually means promises to create jobs in
return for winning defense contracts.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Poisoning attempts mounted in Japan on Wednesday
when insecticide was found in a bottled drink from a vending
machine and police looked into cyanide-laced tea discovered on a
supermarket shelf.
	   In both cases drinkers immediately spat out sips of the toxic
fluids and were unharmed, police said.
	   The tainted drinks were the latest in a rash of poisoning cases
in Japan. In July, four people died and dozens fell ill after
eating curry containing arsenic served at a community festival in
Wakayama, western Japan.
	   Last month, poisoned tea served at an office in northern Japan
made 10 people ill. Then a fake diet drink mailed to some Tokyo
homes sent a teen-ager to the hospital.
	   There have been no arrests in those cases.
	   In the latest case, a toxic insecticide had been mixed in a
bottled drink in Nara, 380 kilometers (240 miles) west of Tokyo,
police said.
	   A cab driver bought a drink Wednesday at a roadside vending
machine, found two bottles in the machine and drank from one. He
immediately spat out the liquid because it had a strange taste,
said a police official who gave only his surname Minoda.
	   In the other case, a can of tea containing cyanide was found
Tuesday on a supermarket shelf in Nagano, 180 kilometers (110
miles) northwest of Tokyo, police spokesman Yuji Kinoshita said
Wednesday.
	   The manager took the can off the shelf because it was dented,
drank from it but spat it out, he said. The can had a tiny hole in
the bottom that had been later covered up, through which the poison
appeared to have been inserted, Kinoshita said.
	   Hiromu Nonaka, chief government spokesman, was quoted by Kyodo
News agency as urging police Wednesday to do more to solve the
poisonings, calling them ``dirty conduct that heightens social
unrest.''
	   Meanwhile, a police inspector, who had been working late hours
overseeing the investigation of the curry poisoning, died of an
undisclosed illness Wednesday, police said. They do not suspect
suicide or foul play.

French expel Spanish Basque suspect after rounding up 15
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BAYONNE, France (AP) _ French authorities investigating
supporters of the violent Spanish Basque separatist group ETA on
Wednesday deported one of 15 suspects it rounded up in the French
Basque region.
	   Police on Tuesday arrested 14 Spaniards and a Frenchman believed
to have ties with ETA, which has waged a campaign of bombings and
other attacks in the Spanish Basque region.
	   One of the Spanish suspects, Jose Mari Pagoaga-Gallastegui, was
freed but deported to Spain, police said on customary anonymity.
	   Two others were freed in France: Begona Jauregui-Errasti of
Spain and the French suspect, Marcel Iturburua, who had been
accused of housing foreigners illegally residing in France.
	   On Tuesday, Spanish Interior Minister Jaime Mayor had hailed the
roundups and said that ``Franco-Spanish cooperation in the struggle
against terrorism will not cease to increase.''
	   ETA, which stands for Basque Homeland and Liberty, has
traditionally used French Basque territory as a place of refuge.
But French authorities _ under pressure from Spain _ have begun to
crack down.
	   Nearly 800 people have been killed since Basque separatists
began fighting in 1968 for an independent state in Spain's northern
Basque provinces.

Wall Street recovery primes the pump in Asia and Europe
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Lead with 4 grafs to UPDATE with Singapore market closing
higher. Pickup 5th pvs, ``Dealers credited...'' &QL; 
 &UR; By THOMAS WAGNER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Wall Street's dramatic U-turn from big losses to a
big gain sent Asian and European stock indexes moving higher
Wednesday, despite the regions' ongoing economic woes.
	   In Tokyo, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average opened 0.72 percent
higher, but the end of the day its gain had slipped to 6.99 points,
or 0.05 percent, for a close of 14,376.62.
	   Although it was the Nikkei's third straight day of improvement,
many people still believe the Tokyo Stock Market has a long way to
go since it sank to a 12-year low on Friday.
	   In Singapore, where the stock market has recently undergone one
bad day after another, the Straits Times Index soon rose 1.1
percent. By the end of the day it ended up closing 4.5 points, or
0.55 percent, higher at 827.85.
	   Dealers credited the gain to the dramatic overnight rebound of
288.36 points, or 3.8 percent, on the Dow Jones industrial average.
In fact, one trader on the scene in Singapore called Wednesday's
activity ``bargain hunting at its best.''
	   In Hong Kong, shares closed sharply higher, also lifted by the
strong rebound on Wall Street, brokers said. The blue-chip Hang
Seng Index traded in positive territory throughout the session and
ended up 293.20 points, or 4.2 percent, at 7,355.67.
	   The news form Wall Street and Russia, where U.S. President Bill
Clinton was meeting with the beleaguered Boris Yeltsin, was one of
several factors affecting the Hong Kong market, Hui said.
	   Shares also moved sharply higher from the outset of trading on
the top two European exchanges Wednesday.
	   London's Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index jumped
108.9 points, or 2.1 percent, to 5,278.0 after just a few minutes
of trading on Europe's biggest stock market. In Frankfurt, the
Xetra DAX index shot up by 2.7 percent in early dealings but then
gave up some ground to show a gain of 2.5 percent at 4,976.63.
	   Given how long Asia's financial crisis has battered its stock
and currency markets, Wall Street's one-day recovery may only
amount to a brief respite for the region.
	   The Dow's volatility, and the big losses it has suffered since
July, have left some economists wondering whether the U.S. economy
could slow down and even slip into a recession.
	   When the Dow plunged 512 points on Monday, it raised concerns in
Asia about whether the region's 14-month-old financial crisis had
spread to the West, especially Russia.
	   The Russian instability, widely regarded as the country's worst
since the fall of Communism, already has begun to batter European
companies, economies and stock markets.
	   In fact, just before Tuesday's dramatic rebound on Wall Street,
an editorial in Japan's Yomiuri newspaper had warned readers: ``It
is even possible that the plunging markets could trigger a global
depression, which would in turn throw the entire international
economic system into chaos.''
	   Questions also remain about the future of Japan, the world's
second-largest economy and a crucial factor in Asia.
	   For weeks, a stalemate in parliament has been preventing the
administration of Japan's new prime minister, Keizo Obuchi, from
using taxpayer money to prop up the nation's troubled banks.
	   But Naoto Kan, the leader of Japan's largest opposition party,
reportedly has just dropped his opposition to the Obuchi
administration bailout plan.
	   Uncertainty over the fate of the legislation _ and the entire
banking system _ has unnerved investors both in Japan and abroad.
	   The United States often has criticized Japan for failing to
revive its own economy, and a breakthrough in the banking reform
debate could benefit Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa.
	   On Friday, he is scheduled to meet in San Francisco with U.S.
Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and with U.S. Federal Reserve
Chairman Alan Greenspan.

Ex-NATO chief Claes, others go on trial for corruption
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROBERT WIELAARD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Several prominent socialists including
ex-NATO chief Willy Claes went on trial Wednesday on charges they
took millions of dollars in bribes in exchange for awarding two
companies Belgian defense contracts in the late 1980s.
	   Claes, 59, Belgium's former economics minister, ex-defense
minister Guy Coeme, 52, and ex-deputy premier Guy Spitaels, 67,
denied the charges.
	   They arrived at Brussels' main courthouse shielded by police and
pushed their way through hundreds of journalists and photographers.
They made no statements.
	   Prosecutors allege Italy's Agusta SpA paid 51 million francs
(dlrs 1.37 million) to win a December, 1988, contract to build 46
army helicopters. They also say France's Dassault Aviation SA paid
a bribe of 60 million francs (dlrs 1.62 million) to win a June,
1989, deal to equip Belgian F-16 jets with new electronics.
	   The two contracts were worth hundreds of millions of dollars
each.
	   Serge Dassault, 73, of Dassault Aviation is also a defendant. He
got to the courthouse long before the first journalist did.
Ex-Agusta executive Raffaelo Teti died Aug. 22 of a heart attack.
He was 72.
	   The Agusta and Dassault ``gifts'' were allegedly funneled to
Belgium's Dutch and French-speaking socialist parties from Swiss
bank accounts.
	   The trial, held after Claes and other former cabinet ministers
were stripped of their parliamentary immunity, is expected to last
months.
	   The trial is the final curtain for party bosses who ran their
political families unhampered by laws regulating corporate
donations. Such donations were not outlawed until 1989.
	   Thus, prosecutors must prove not only that money was paid, but
that the companies' ``gifts'' were given so close to the awarding
of the contracts that they had to be bribes and that the defendants
knew that and are therefore guilty of corruption.
	   Claes became NATO secretary general in 1994. He quit a year
later amid charges of financial wrongdoing from his days as Belgian
economics minister
	   He was long a powerbroker in the Dutch-speaking Socialist Party.
Spitaels, the former deputy premier, has long been the mainstay of
French-speaking socialists.
	   The trial is Coeme's second in two years. In 1996, the supreme
court gave him a two-year suspended jail term for corruption
involving phony opinion surveys at government expense.

Mayor in Russian Siberian city injured in bomb attack
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The mayor of a western Siberian city was seriously
injured when a bomb exploded near his car as he was driving to work
Wednesday morning, a news agency reported.
	   Mayor Yuri Timoshenkov of the city of Nizhnevartovsk, in the
Tyumen region, was hospitalized in intensive care, the ITAR-Tass
news agency reported. Two of his bodyguards were also injured.
	   The bomb was concealed in a car parked on the side of the road
and exploded when Timoshenkov was driving by, said Maj. Nikolai
Sidorov, a spokesman for the local branch of the Federal Security
Service.
	   No motive for the attack was given.
	   The car that held the bomb was completely destroyed in the
explosion and investigators could not identify its license plate
number or the exact model of the Russian Zhiguli make, Sidorov
said.

Spectators cleared as riot police deploy near campus protest
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with empty trucks moved toward campus, spectators
cleared out, 6th graf &QL; 
 &UR; With BC-Myanmar-Suu Kyi Interview

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ Riot police took up positions outside a
university Wednesday during a protest by nearly 500 students, the
biggest show of discontent so far in stepped-up agitation against
Myanmar's military regime.
	   The riot police, equipped with clubs and shields, stood by as
senior teachers negotiated with the students to end the protest at
the Yangon Institute of Technology. Gates to the campus were locked
and the students did not try to reach the streets.
	   A spokesman for the government, in a fax to The Associated Press
in Bangkok, Thailand, said there had been no arrests and that
school authorities were handling the problem.
	   Traffic police closed roads near the institute, a hotbed of
anti-government sentiment that had been closed since the last wave
of student protests two years ago. It was recently reopened so
students could finally study and take their long-postponed final
exams.
	   Student sources said many grievances were related to crash
courses for the exams, but the government has in the past seen
student unrest as a cover for the pro-democracy opposition.
	   Authorities eventually brought in buses to clear away
bystanders, some of whom had cheered the students, outside the
campus. Empty trucks were seen heading toward the campus.
	   Meanwhile, pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi met diplomats
at the resident of U.S. Charge d'Affaires Kent Weidemann, a move
that could antagonize the government, which feels hostile foreign
nations are using her movement to destabilize the country.
	   There were no immediate details on the talks.
	   In a rare interview Tuesday with foreign journalists, Suu Kyi
expressed no disappointment that hit-and-run protests attempted by
students in the past 10 days had not drawn crowds into the streets.
	   ``Considering the amount of repression and the amount of
surveillance to which the students are subjected, the fact that
they managed to get these demonstrations going one after the other
showed a certain amount of organization and resolve,'' she said.
	   Suu Kyi said the government may use force to resolve its latest
confrontation with the opposition, possibly banning her party.
	   ``This government always believes in violence and the use of
force to resolve problems,'' Suu Kyi said. ``They never think of
resolving problems through negotiations, through reasonable give
and take.''
	   A week ago, Suu Kyi was described as dehydrated and severely
weakened after a 13-day roadside standoff against authorities on a
bridge outside the capital. Her doctors wanted to keep her under
observation, but Suu Kyi said Tuesday her health was fine.
	   ``They can observe me while I work,'' joked Suu Kyi, looking
fit.
	   At the home of Tin Oo, vice chairman of her National League for
Democracy, Suu Kyi defended her renewed campaign against the ruling
junta on the 10th anniversary of an uprising against military rule
that was crushed in bloodshed.
	   ``They accuse us of confrontation, but I can't think of anything
more confrontational than putting people in prison simply because
they have expressed a different point of view,'' Suu Kyi said.
	   Suu Kyi, 53, who has spent most of the past decade under house
arrest or close restriction, said that the opposition in Myanmar,
also known as Burma, is more united than at any time since abortive
elections in 1990.
	   Her party overwhelmingly won the elections, but the military,
which has ruled since 1962, refused to honor the result. In the
past few weeks, the NLD has threatened to finally convene the
legislature on its own.
	   The government has responded by threatening long prison terms
and banning the party. Suu Kyi said both were ``quite possible.''
	   The government said in a statement that it had struggled to
bring peace, stability and national unity to the country to lay a
foundation for multi-party democracy some day.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian President Boris Yeltsin said his nation
faces ``a lot of tears and sweat'' in its struggle for free markets
and democracy. U.S. President Bill Clinton said the world stand
ready to provide financial help so long as Russia stays on a
democratic track.
	   Speaking at the conclusion of a two-day summit meeting, Yeltsin
said he and Clinton discussed ways to intensify U.S.-Russian
economic relations to pull Russia out of its economic tailspin.
	   ``There still is a lot of tears and sweat to spend before we
identify the forms of business cooperation which are worthy of the
two great nations,'' Yeltsin said without mentioning the political
paralysis he faces with the State Duma over forming a new
government.

	   Before taking questions from reporters, Yeltsin and Clinton
signed two security agreements. One commits each country to ridding
itself of 50 tons of weapons-grade plutonium from old nuclear
warheads; the other calls for sharing information on missile launch
warnings.
	   They also signed joint statements on biological weapons control
and on the situation in the Kosovo, the Balkan region torn with
civil strife.
	   After the news conference Clinton was meeting with members of
the State Duma, the lower chamber of Russia's parliament. The Duma
on Monday rejected Yeltsin's appointment of Viktor Chernomyrdin as
prime minister, prolonging Russia's political paralysis.
	   Earlier Wednesday, Clinton and Yeltsin held their second round
of talks in private at the Kremlin, while Communist Party leader
Gennady Zyuganov bluntly summed up the high stakes in this
country's internal power struggle: ``President Yeltsin is pushing
the nation to a civil war.''
	   With the Kremlin and the nation enveloped in the fallout of a
wrenching transformation from communism to capitalism, Clinton's
advice is to stay the course, but pay your taxes and your debts.
	   Clinton's advice to Yeltsin carries the weight of the American
president's own political and personal woes. Beyond attempting to
stiffen the Russian leader's resolve it came with no offer of
specific help.

Spanish police arrest suspect in killing of former sect leader
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   IBIZA, Spain (AP) _ Police on Tuesday arrested a man suspected
of killing a Spaniard sentenced to 168 years in jail for sexually
abusing boys as leader of a doomsday sect, news reports said.
	   Eduardo Gonzalez Arenas, who was released on parole in 1997
after serving six years of his sentence, bled to death Monday after
an attacker with a knife slashed his throat in broad daylight.
	   Witnesses told Spanish newspapers the assailant had had a
lengthy argument with Gonzalez, who was 46, as they sat outside an
ice cream parlor in the town of Santa Eulalia on this Mediterranean
island.
	   They said the man was a regular at a bar Gonzalez co-owned.
	   The Civil Guard in Ibiza said the suspect was between 18 and 20
years old and had a criminal record, the state news agency Efe
reported.
	   Gonzalez was convicted in 1991 of sexually abusing Madrid boys
aged 11 to 14 that he recruited in the late 1980s for a sect he
called Edelweiss.
	   It was named after that mountain flower because the boys were
taken on mountain hikes during which they said they were forced to
have sex with sect leaders, including Gonzalez, and with each
other.
	   Some said they'd been brainwashed into keeping quiet about it.
	   When Gonzalez and 10 other defendants went on trial in 1991,
some of the boys testified that Gonzalez portrayed himself as an
alien who would lead sect members to salvation on another planet
when the world came to an end. He had said this would happen in
1992 with a nuclear cataclysm.
	   Two other sect leaders were sentenced to 65 years in jail.
	   Gonzalez was released on parole in 1997 for good behavior.

Hong Kong shares higher after Wall Street's rebound
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Hong Kong shares rallied Wednesday as Wall
Street's strong recovery overnight boosted investors' battered
confidence.
	   The Hang Seng Index _ the market's key indicator of blue chips _
ended up 293.20 points, or 4.2 percent, to close at 7355.67.
	   Trading volume was worth 5.80 billion Hong Kong dollars (dlrs
743 million), compared to 6.20 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dls
795 million) on Tuesday.
	   The recovery followed the index's 2.9 percent loss Tuesday and
7.1 percent drop Monday, when the government halted its costly
two-week stock buying spree.
	   The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 288.36 points, or 3.6
percent, to close at 7,827.43 on Tuesday. The gain erased more than
half of Monday's 512-point loss.
	   Tightened regulations on short selling also sent traders
scrambling to buy back their borrowed stocks, analysts said.
	   The Hong Kong Stock Exchange and the Hong Kong Securities
Clearing Co. introduced this week regulations to curtail
short-selling, the latest in a series of measures to deter
speculators and to stabilize the market.
	   Short selling is essentially a bet that a share price will fall.
Investors borrow stocks, hoping their value will decline, buy them
back at the lower price, and pocket the difference.
	   The Stock Exchange surprised investors Wednesday by announcing a
temporary ban on short-selling in the shares of Hong Kong's largest
stocks, HSBC Holdings, Hong Kong Telecom and China Telecom. The
announcement sent the three companies' shares prices soaring by
between 3 percent and 11 percent.
	   Wall Street's sharp rebound calmed investors' ``fear of a global
recession'' and renewed hopes that the Asian economy will recover
soon, said Dickson Au, sales manager at Sassoon Securities Ltd.
	   Nelson Wong, sales director of Celestial Asia Securities Ltd.,
played down rebound in Hong Kong shares, calling it a ``bear market
rally.''
	   On Tuesday, Hong Kong stocks plunged after Standard and Poor's
slashed the territory's credit rating, citing recent government
intervention in the stock and stock futures markets to fend off
speculators.
	   The government, which in the past two weeks spent an estimated
15 percent of its dlrs 96 billion in foreign reserves, has stayed
on the sidelines this week, traders said.
	   The ban on short selling of the three largest stocks boosted the
companies' share prices. China Telecom surged 1.05 Hong Kong
dollars to close at 10.90, HSBC closed at 163.00, up 4.50, and Hong
Kong Telecom gained 0.85 to 14.15. Property conglomerate Cheung
Kong Holdings gained 1.40 to close at 30.30.
	   But property company Sino Land fell 0.04 to 1.98, and Guangdong
Investment fell 0.03 to 1.39.

Australians left in limbo by currency confusion
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Australians heading for the
Commonwealth Games in Kuala Lumpur were unable to buy any of the
Malaysian currency before departure Wednesday.
	   The Malaysian government virtually halted international trade in
its currency in what could be a major disruption to the Games.
	   With the event due to begin Sept. 11, no Australian banks were
quoting or trading the Malaysian ringgit today amid confusion over
new foreign exchange rules introduced by Bank Negara, Malaysia's
central bank.
	   ``It's a major problem,'' Commonwealth Bank currency economist
Michael Workman said.
	   Bank Negara has fixed the ringgit's exchange rate at 3.80 to the
U.S. dollar and announced the currency could only be traded
domestically and would no longer be legal tender overseas from Oct.
1.
	   Despite the later deadline, the reaction from the markets was
immediate as Malaysian and international banks abruptly halted
trade in the ringgit.
	   That left Australians, among them athletes and officials heading
to Kuala Lumpur for the games, puzzled as to what currency to use
when in Malaysia.
	   While the ringgit continues to be traded within Malaysia, it is
uncertain when international trade will resume following Bank
Negara's statement that off-shore banks are no longer allowed to
trade in ringgit instruments.
	   A Reserve Bank of Australia spokesman said information was being
sought from Malaysia but denied reports that the central bank had
advised Australian banks not to trade the ringgit.
	   ``Our traders are in the dark as much as anyone else,'' the
spokesman said.	   Another trader said attempts to contact Kuala Lumpur banks to
shed light on the regulations had so far proved futile.
	   ``There seem to be no clear cut rules,'' said the Australian
trader, who declined to be named. ``Coming right before the games,
this is not good news.''
	   Commonwealth Games organizers were unsure how Malaysia's reforms
would impact on the event.
	   ``I'm not sure what the reforms mean for the games,'' an
official from Sukom, the organizing committee for the KL Games,
told Australian Associated Press in Malaysia. ``I'm not an
economist, I only deal with sports.''
	   The Malaysian currency move has also left Australian banks
nervously contemplating settlement and counterparty risks.
	   Under the new rules, those who hold ringgit overseas will not be
able to convert the ringgit to any foreign currency overseas unless
they use the ringgit to buy Malaysian assets.

Ranariddh says to end in sight to crisis; protests resume
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Ranariddh saying no end to crisis, protests at
European Union office. &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBIN McDOWELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Thousands of people renewed protests
Wednesday against strongman Hun Sen, refusing to accept the
decision by government panels he controls that he won July 26
parliamentary elections.
	   The round-the-clock protests entered their 10th day as eyes
turned toward King Norodom Sihanouk, the constitutional head of
state, to resolve the deepening political crisis Thursday when he
receives Hun Sen in the northern city of Siem Reap.
	   But opposition leader Prince Norodom Ranariddh, the king's son,
said Wednesday that there would be no end to the crisis unless the
king prevailed upon Hun Sen to compromise and allow a fair review
of the election results.
	   Hun Sen and other senior members of his party are expected to
seek the king's necessary permission to form a new government.
	   The ruling Cambodian People's Party was officially named the
election winner Tuesday. The final tally mirrored preliminary
results announced three weeks ago, giving Hun Sen a slight majority
of 64 of the 122 National Assembly seats with just 41 percent of
the popular vote.
	   However, he still lacks the two-thirds majority needed to form a
new government and the opposition has refused to join a coalition
or support a new government until its complaints are addressed.
	   At a news conference, Ranariddh, head of the FUNCINPEC party,
appealed to Sihanouk ``to try to convince the leadership of the CPP
to be reasonable ... and to help resolve the current crisis before
it is really too late.''
	   ``If there is no solution it will be a very difficult future for
Cambodia,'' Ranariddh said. ``And Hun Sen alone has to bear
responsibility for it.''
	   Ranariddh, who was deposed by Hun Sen as co-prime minister in a
bloody coup a year ago, said the king should not pressure FUNCINPEC
and its opposition ally, the Sam Rainsy Party, to join a coalition
with Hun Sen.
	   Thousands of student-led demonstrators earlier gathered in front
of the Royal Palace, where the king is not in residence, in a
symbolic appeal for him to convince Hun Sen to properly address
hundreds of alleged election irregularities.
	   The National Election Committee and the country's highest
appeals body, the Constitutional Council, have rejected all of the
opposition's complaints from the polls. Both bodies are controlled
by Hun Sen's supporters.
	   Joined by motorbike and pedicab drivers and laborers, they then
marched through the capital, clogging traffic and holding banners
reading: ``Cambodian people do not need Hun Sen anymore'' and ``Hun
Sen is a killer.''
	   They also protested before the headquarters of the European
Union, the main foreign financial donor to the elections, and urged
the international community to withdraw an assessment by observers
that the election was free and fair enough to be credible.
	   Many then returned to a park outside the National Assembly where
thousands of people have camped in a tent city to protest Hun Sen.

Indonesian activists press for inquiry against military
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Human rights activists on Wednesday
urged the government to investigate accusations that soldiers
killed dozens of civilians in southern Sumatra island in the late
1980s.
	   The allegations join a list of complaints about the
scandal-tainted military, which is trying to revamp its image in
the wake of the resignation of former autocratic President Suharto.
	   Soldiers used brutal tactics in suppressing an Islamic
separatist group in the province of Lampung, said Munir, head of
the Committee for Disappeared Persons and Victims of Violence.
	   ``The families of the victims demand that the government probe
violations made by security forces,'' Munir said.
	   He released a report that alleged 246 people were killed during
the military campaign, although the government has said 31 people
died.
	   The military has also been accused of arbitrary killings as well
as rape and torture in northern Aceh province while troops were
suppressing a separatist group in the late 1980s and early 1990s.
Bitterness toward the military triggered riots this week in the
Aceh town of Lhokseumawe.
	   A number of police face trial in the shootings of four student
protesters during demonstrations in May that helped oust Suharto
after 32 years in power.
	   Further sullying the military's reputation, 10 members of
Indonesia's special forces will be tried in the kidnappings of
political activists while Suharto was in control. A son-in-law of
Suharto, Lt. Gen. Prabowo Subianto, was fired after being
implicated.
	   Suharto's successor, President B.J. Habibie, has pledged
democratic reforms and greater accountability.

Spanish police arrest suspect in killing of former sect leader
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   IBIZA, Spain (AP) _ Police on Tuesday arrested a man suspected
of killing the leader of a doomsday sect who had been sentenced to
168 years in jail for sexually abusing boys, news reports said.
	   Eduardo Gonzalez Arenas, who was released for good behavior in
1997 after serving six years of his sentence, was stabbed to death
in broad daylight Monday.
	   Witnesses told Spanish newspapers the assailant had had a
lengthy argument with Gonzalez, who was 46, as they sat outside an
ice cream parlor in the town of Santa Eulalia on the Mediterranean
island of Ibiza.
	   They said the man was a regular at a bar Gonzalez co-owned.
	   The Civil Guard in Ibiza said the suspect was between 18 and 20
years old and had a criminal record, the state news agency Efe
reported.
	   Gonzalez was convicted in 1991 of sexually abusing Madrid boys
aged 11 to 14 whom he had recruited in the late 1980s for a sect he
called Edelweiss.
	   It was named after that mountain flower because the boys were
taken on mountain hikes during which they said they were forced to
have sex with sect leaders, including Gonzalez, and with each
other.
	   When Gonzalez and 10 other defendants went on trial in 1991,
some of the boys testified that Gonzalez portrayed himself as an
alien who would lead sect members to salvation on another planet
when the world came to an end. He had said this would happen in
1992 with a nuclear cataclysm.
	   Two other sect leaders were sentenced to 65 years in jail.

	   Clinton said he would repeat to the Duma leaders the same
message he gave Yeltsin: ``If the reform process can be completed,
I for one would be for greater assistance to Russia.'' He said the
United States has a ``very strong vested interested'' in seeing
Russia succeed.
	   In his opening remarks at the news conference in the Kremlin's
Marble Hall, Yeltsin said he and Clinton had discussed at length
critical defense and international security issues.
	   ``At large, our approaches are common, but not always so,''
Yeltsin said. ``Today's conflicts in the world have no military
solution, be it Kosovo or Iraq'' or elsewhere.
	   He also reiterated his opposition to what he called ``NATO
centerism,'' or the central military role the U.S.-led NATO
alliance plays in Europe and beyond. He added, however, that the
two days of discussion had produced a ``broader understanding on
these issues.''

Clinton says volatility is to be expected in world markets

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Trying to calm global turmoil, U.S. President Bill
Clinton said Wednesday that volatility is to be expected in U.S.
and world markets and ``the right thing to do is try to restore
growth in the economies of the world where there isn't enough
growth now.''
	   ``It means, in short, that America must maintain a leadership
role and active involvement,'' the president said.
	   Speaking from the Kremlin's Marble Hall at a joint news
conference with Russian President Boris Yeltsin, Clinton aimed his
comments at calming wild gyrations in the U.S. stock market as
investors react to currency and economic crises in Russia, Japan
and other major industrial nations.

	   Yeltsin said the key to Russia's economic recovery was not
further U.S. assistance but more foreign investment. ``This is what
we need.''
	   The beleaguered Russian leader said he wanted the world to know
that Russia does not view U.S. support as a crutch. ``Not at all,''
he said several times to stress his point. He said Russia had no
choice but to stick to its plan _ now in danger of failing _ to
build a free market economy.
	   ``We are still obliged to take these reforms to the end, through
the end, and correspondingly get a reward for that,'' he said.
	   With the Kremlin and the nation enveloped in the fallout of a
wrenching transformation from communism to capitalism, Clinton's
advice is to stay the course, but be sure to pay your taxes and
your debts.
	   ``There aren't any painless solutions,'' he told students at
Moscow State University of International Relations on Tuesday.
	   Clinton's advice to Yeltsin carries the weight of the American
president's own political and personal woes. Beyond attempting to
stiffen the Russian leader's resolve it came with no offer of
specific help.
	   In urging Yeltsin not to abandon reform, Clinton is preaching to
the choir. The Russian leader insisted Tuesday he would not give up
on democratic reforms or on his appointment of Viktor Chernomyrdin,
the Communist-era fuel and energy boss, to return as prime
minister.
	   But the Communist-led Duma refuses to approve Chernomyrdin, and
the standoff threatens to push Russia into early elections or
dissolve the parliament if it rejects the prime minister a second
and third time.
	   Clinton faces long odds in his meetings with Duma and regional
leaders, including Communist Party leader Zyuganov.
	   ``The past two years in Russia's life have been full of stormy
political events, great laborious work on reforming the economy,''
Yeltsin said in dinner remarks. ``Soon there were disappointments,
too, and unfulfilled hopes. But we've never lost the conviction in
the necessity of the transformations we're carrying out.''
	   U.S. officials said Russia's power struggle was too uncertain to
predict what kind of economic remedies would be embraced.

	   He spoke about 3 1/2 hours before Wall Street opened for another
uncertain day of trading.
	   ``The most important thing is sticking with sound economic
policy,'' Clinton said, referring to his administration's platform
of ``fiscal discipline'' couple with increased spending on
education, science and technology.
	   ``We have to make the investments and decisions we know will

	   The rebound sent Asia's three main stock indexes higher

Swiss honorary consul in Nicaragua to give up post
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ Switzerland's honorary consul in
Nicaragua, who faces legal action in the Central American country,
will leave his post, the Swiss Foreign Ministry said Wednesday.
	   An arrest warrant has been issued against Morizzo in Nicaragua,
where he is accused of embezzlement. The ministry said his
appointment was being terminated by mutual agreement.
	   Morizzo, who was involved in the coffee trade, will formally
give up his post at the end of September.
	   Ministry spokeswoman Yasmine Chatila said the solution was
chosen because Morizzo was, for personal reasons, no longer in a
position to fully carry out his tasks.
	   The diplomat has been outside Nicaragua for several months.
	   The Foreign Ministry declined to comment on the charges against
Morizzo but stressed his work had always been to its satisfaction.

Spanish police arrest suspect in killing of former sect leader
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITTING to correct slug

<TEXT>
	   IBIZA, Spain (AP) _ Police on Tuesday arrested a man suspected
of killing the leader of a doomsday sect who had been sentenced to
168 years in jail for sexually abusing boys, news reports said.
	   Eduardo Gonzalez Arenas, who was released on parole for good
behavior in 1997 after serving six years of his sentence, was
stabbed to death in broad daylight Monday.
	   Witnesses told Spanish newspapers the assailant had had a
lengthy argument with Gonzalez, who was 46, as they sat outside an
ice cream parlor in the town of Santa Eulalia on the Mediterranean
island of Ibiza.
	   They said the man was a regular at a bar Gonzalez co-owned.
	   The Civil Guard in Ibiza said the suspect was between 18 and 20
years old and had a criminal record, the state news agency Efe
reported.
	   Gonzalez was convicted in 1991 of sexually abusing Madrid boys
aged 11 to 14 whom he had recruited in the late 1980s for a sect he
called Edelweiss.
	   It was named after that mountain flower because the boys were
taken on mountain hikes during which they said they were forced to
have sex with sect leaders, including Gonzalez, and with each
other.
	   Some said they'd been brainwashed into keeping quiet about it.
	   When Gonzalez and 10 other defendants went on trial in 1991,
some of the boys testified that Gonzalez portrayed himself as an
alien who would lead sect members to salvation on another planet
when the world came to an end. He had said this would happen in
1992 with a nuclear cataclysm.
	   Two other sect leaders were sentenced to 65 years in jail.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Concluding his two-day summit with U.S. President
Bill Clinton, Russia's Boris Yeltsin said Wednesday his nation
faces ``a lot of tears and sweat'' in its struggle for a free
market and a vibrant economy.
	   Clinton, appearing with Yeltsin at a joint news conference,
offered encouragement but emphasized ``there is no short cut.''
	   ``America and the international community are, I'm convinced,
ready to offer further aassistance if Russia stays with the path to
reform,'' Clinton said.
	   Both presidents described their meetings as successful, and
Yeltsin told reporters he and Clinton discussed ways to intensify
U.S.-Russian economic relations to pull Russia out of its economic
tailspin.
	   ``There still is a lot of tears and sweat to spend before we
identify the forms of business cooperation which are worthy of the
two great nations,'' Yeltsin said without mentioning the political
paralysis he faces with the State Duma over forming a new
government.
	   Said Clinton: ``I know this is a difficult time, but there is no
short cut'' to employing economic reforms.
	   Yeltsin said the key to Russia's economic recovery was not
further U.S. assistance but more foreign investment. ``This is what
we need.''
	   Asked what he would do if the Duma again refused to confirm
Chernomyrdin as prime minister and whether he would dissolve
parliament in that event, Yeltsin took several seconds before
saying, ``There will be a reasonable number of events taking place
in order for us to be able to attain these goals.'' As Clinton and
others waited for more, he added, ``That's it.''
	   Clinton, who had been asked by the same questioner about his
admitted sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky, grinned and
quipped, ``That would be my answer, too.''
	   Clinton reiterated his regret over the affair but said it has
not affected his work and that he had spent important time with his
family and was heartened by the reaction of the American people to
his plea for forgiveness.
	   The beleaguered Russian leader said he wanted the world to know
that Russia does not view U.S. support as a crutch. ``Not at all,''
he said several times to stress his point. He said Russia had no
choice but to stick to its plan _ now in danger of failing _ to
build a free market economy.
	   ``We are still obliged to take these reforms to the end, through
the end, and correspondingly get a reward for that,'' Yeltsin said.
	   Clinton was meeting later with leaders of the Duma, Russia's
parliament, and said he would repeat the message he gave Yeltsin:
``If the reform process can be completed, I for one would be for
greater assistance to Russia.'' He said the United States has a
``very strong vested interested'' in seeing Russia succeed.
	   Before taking questions from reporters, Yeltsin and Clinton
signed two security agreements. One commits each country to ridding
itself of 50 tons of weapons-grade plutonium from old nuclear
warheads; the other calls for sharing information on missile launch
warnings.
	   They also signed joint statements on biological weapons control
and on the situation in the Kosovo, the Balkan region torn with
civil strife.
	   ``We remain friends,'' Yeltsin said in response to the first
question at a joint news conference. He said the summit took place
``in a very friendly atmosphere.''
	   After his meetings with Yeltsin, Clinton was to press his
no-pain, no-gain message with leaders of Russia's parliament.
	   Clinton and Yeltsin held their second round of talks at the
Kremlin, while Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov bluntly
summed up the high stakes in this country's internal power
struggle: ``President Yeltsin is pushing the nation to a civil
war.''
	   In his opening remarks in the Kremlin's Marble Hall, Yeltsin
said he and Clinton had discussed at length many defense and
international security issues.
	   ``At large, our approaches are common, but not always so,''
Yeltsin said. ``Today's conflicts in the world have no military
solution, be it Kosovo or Iraq'' or elsewhere.
	   He also reiterated his opposition to what he called ``NATO
centrism,'' or the central military role the U.S.-led NATO alliance
plays in Europe and beyond. He added, however, that the two days of
discussion had produced a ``broader understanding on these
issues.''
	   With the Kremlin and the nation enveloped in the fallout of a
wrenching transformation from communism to capitalism, Clinton's
advice is to stay the course, but pay your taxes and your debts.
His advice carries the weight of the American president's own
political and personal woes. Beyond attempting to stiffen the
Russian leader's resolve it came with no offer of specific help.
	   In urging Yeltsin not to abandon reform, Clinton is preaching to
the choir. The Russian leader has insisted he would not give up on
democratic reforms or on his appointment of Victor Chernomyrdin to
return as prime minister.
	   ``The past two years in Russia's life have been full of stormy
political events, great laborious work on reforming the economy,''
Yeltsin said in dinner remarks Tuesday. ``Soon there were
disappointments, too, and unfulfilled hopes. But we've never lost
the conviction in the necessity of the transformations we're
carrying out.''
	   But the Communist-led Duma refuses to approve Chernomyrdin, and
the standoff threatens to push Russia into early elections or
dissolve the parliament if it rejects the prime minister a second
and third time.
	   Clinton faces long odds in his meetings with DMA and regional
leaders, including Zyuganov, at Moscow's elegant Spas House, the
U.S. ambassador's residence.

Government forces push east into Congo's interior
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By IAN STEWART &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Government-allied troops on Wednesday
were pushing east toward the rebel-held town of Kalemie, taking
Congo's month-long civil war away from the capital and into the
heart of rebel territory.
	   Information Minister Didier Mumengi said the loyalist forces had
closed in on Kalemie, about 400 kilometers (250 miles) south of the
key rebel stronghold of Bukavu on the eastern fringe of this large
central African state.
	   Rebel leaders in the eastern city of Goma, however, said they
were reinforcing their positions in Kalemie and two other
rebel-held towns _ Moba and Manono, Kabila's birthplace _ in the
copper-rich Katanga province of southern Congo.
	   Chief rebel commander Jean-Pierre Ondekane said his forces
continued to advance into Katanga, but gave no details.
	   The coalition rebel force of ethnic Tutsi fighters and former
troops in Kabila's military was pushed out of western Congo over
the weekend, halting a month-long advance on the capital, Kinshasa,
and shifting the focus of the war on the east.
	   The rebels, many of whom supported Kabila's own rise to power
just 15 months ago in a rebellion over longtime Zairian dictator
Mobutu Sese Seko, accuse Kabila of corruption and nepotism.
	   ``Our objectives now are clear,'' Mumengi said. ``We want to
drive the aggressors out of our country.''
	   Kabila's government says Rwanda and Uganda used the Tutsi-led
rebellion to disguise what amounts to an invasion of Congo by their
forces.
	   Both countries deny involvement in the uprising, although war
prisoners displayed before the international press said they were
from Rwanda and Uganda.
	   With his capital in peril, Kabila in recent weeks enlisted the
military support of Angola, Zimbabwe and Namibia. Angolan and
Zimbabwean forces turned the tide on the western front and are now
pushing east.
	   Only sporadic gunfire was reported in parts of the west, where
government-allied troops have been blocking rebel fighters from
seeking safe passage out of the area.
	   An unspecified number of rebels trying to flee from near
Songololo, a town about 250 kilometers (150 miles) southwest of
Kinshasa, were ``effectively considered prisoners of war,'' Deputy
Interior Minister Faustin Munene said.
	   The government is demanding the withdrawal of all Rwandan and
Uganda troops from Congolese soil before the rebels will be
permitted a safe retreat.
	   In South Africa, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan called for
the withdrawal of all foreign troops _ Angolan, Zimbabwean,
Nambian, Rwandan and Ugandan _ from Congo.
	   Annan is in South Africa to attend meetings of Nonaligned
Movement member states. Several state leaders at the meetings will
take part in a mini-summit to discuss the crisis in Congo.
	   Kabila arrived unexpectedly at the summit Wednesday, raising
hopes for a negotiated end to the fighting.
	   ``It is good that he is here,'' Zimbabwe's Deputy High
Commissioner Danson Mudekunye said. ``The prospects for the peace
talks are much better now,'' he said.
	   But in a sign of hostility toward mediation efforts by South
Africa, Kabila bypassed the official greeting offered by President
Nelson Mandela to arriving heads of state. Congolese officials have
accused mediators of taking sides against Kabila's government.

 &UR; North Korea denounces Japan for making ``fuss'' over missile firing

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Sidestepping a direct response to
international denunciation of its missile test earlier this week,
North Korea on Wednesday criticized Japan for making a ``fuss''
over the issue.
	   ``We bitterly denounce Japan for making a fuss over the matter
that belongs to our sovereignty while being unaware of its
background,'' the Korean Asia-Pacific Peace Committee, a high-level
organ of North Korea's ruling Workers' Party, said in a statement.
	   ``It is imprudent for Japan to say this or that, unaware of what
the DPRK (North Korea) did, a missile test or anything else,'' the
statement said.
	   The committee's statement was carried by the North's official
Korean Central News Agency.
	   Without directly mentioning whether North Korea carried out the
missile launch over Japan on Monday, the statement accused Japanese
officials of making ``provocative remarks'' against North Korea.
	   ``Japan's behavior is ridiculous, indeed, in view of the fact
that Japan is zealously developing long-distance vehicles and other
up-to-date weapons and paving the way for overseas aggression'' by
its military links with the United States, it said.
	   It also is unfair that Japan has singled out North Korea to
censure over the missile issue because ``many countries around
Japan possess or have developed missiles,'' the statement said.
	   The statement also demanded that Japan compensate North Korea
for sufferings inflicted during its harsh colonial rule of Korea
from 1910 to 1945.
	   Japan normalized relations with capitalist South Korea in 1965
but has no formal relations with the North's communist government.
The Korean peninsula has been divided into the communist North and
the capitalist South since Japan's defeat in World War II in 1945.

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Human rights activists on Wednesday
urged the government to investigate accusations that soldiers
killed dozens of civilians in southern Sumatra island in the late
1980s.
	   The allegations join a list of complaints about the
scandal-tainted military, which is trying to revamp its image in
the wake of the resignation of former President Suharto.
	   The military's chief for socio-political affairs, meanwhile,
said the use of force in the past was sometimes wrong, the official
Antara news agency reported.
	   ``I should admit that there have been a number of wrongdoings
which (the armed forces) committed that might include human rights
violations,'' Antara quoted Lt. Gen. Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono as
saying.
	   However, Bambang said the military should not be held
responsible for all the country's ills and its actions were often
justified because its task was to keep order.
	   In the latest accusations, soldiers are said to have used brutal
tactics in suppressing an Islamic separatist group in Lampung
province, said Munir, head of the Committee for Disappeared Persons
and Victims of Violence.
	   ``The families of the victims demand that the government probe
violations made by security forces,'' Munir said.
	   He released a report that alleged 246 people were killed during
the military campaign, although the government has said 31 people
died.
	   The military has also been accused of arbitrary killings as well
as rape and torture in northern Aceh province while troops were
suppressing a separatist group in the late 1980s and early 1990s.
Bitterness toward the military triggered riots this week in the
Aceh town of Lhokseumawe.
	   A number of police face trial in the shootings of four student
protesters during demonstrations in May that helped oust Suharto
after 32 years of autocratic power.
	   Further sullying the military's reputation, 10 members of
Indonesia's special forces will be tried in the kidnappings of
political activists while Suharto was in control. A son-in-law of
Suharto, Lt. Gen. Prabowo Subianto, was fired after being
implicated.
	   Suharto's successor, President B.J. Habibie, has pledged
democratic reforms and greater accountability.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ U.S. President Bill Clinton pledged Wednesday to
continue ``the personal process'' of making amends for his
inappropriate relationship with Monica Lewinsky. He said he
believed his televised speech to the nation had conveyed his
``profound regret to all who were hurt.''
	   Clinton, who was criticized by some prominent Democrats and
Republicans for failing to make a more contrite public statement
two weeks ago, said he had re-read the speech recently and signaled
no desire to amend it.
	   ``All I wanted to say is I believe it's time for us to now go
back to the work of the country and give the people their
government back,'' he said during a Kremlin news conference with
Russian President Boris Yeltsin.
	   It was the first time Clinton answered questions about the
Lewinsky affair since his TV address two weeks ago.
	   Clinton said he has been heartened by the reaction of the
American people and leaders around the world.
	   ``I have acknowledged that I made a mistake, said that I
regretted it, asked to be forgiven, spent a lot of very valuable
time with my family in the last couple of weeks and said I was
going to back to work,'' he said. ``I believe that is what the
American people want me to do and, based on my conversations with
leaders around the world, I think that's what they want me to do
and that is what I intend to do.''

Iran bans book about women's freedoms
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran has banned a book about freedoms
granted to women by Islam's Prophet Mohammed, the Tehran Times
daily reported Wednesday.
	   The English-language newspaper said that the Ministry of Culture
and Islamic Guidance banned the book by Seyed Mohsen Saeedzadeh
because it contained ``materials disrespecting the holy Prophet of
Islam.''
	   The author had ``attributed obscene affairs to the holy
Prophet,'' the newspaper. It gave no details about the book or
describe the specific passages that ran afoul of the authorities.
	   Offended for similar reasons, Iran issued a religious edict in
1981 ordering Muslims to seek out and kill the author of ``The
Satanic Verses,'' Salman Rushdie, an Indian-born British writer.
	   ``The Satanic Verses'' had mocked Mohammed's nine wives.
	   According to Islamic texts, Mohammed performed multiple
marriages to strengthen links with other tribes and draw them into
the fold of Islam. He believed that women are equal to men in most
respects.
	   Saeedzadeh, author of the book banned in Iran, could face calls
for harsher punishment by Islamic hard-liners who may not be
satisfied only with the banning of the book.
	   Saeedzadeh was not immediately available for comment.

<TEXT>
	   BAYONNE, France (AP) _ French authorities who arrested 16
suspects believed linked to the violent Spanish Basque separatist
group ETA deported one released five others Wednesday.
	   Police on Tuesday arrested 15 Spaniards and a Frenchman believed
to have ties with ETA, which has waged a campaign of bombings and
other attacks in the Spanish Basque region.
	   One of the Spanish suspects, Jose Mari Pagoaga-Gallastegui, was
freed but deported to Spain, police said on customary anonymity. He
had been declared persona non grata in France due to a previous
conviction for criminal association.
	   Five others were freed in France, including French suspect
Marcel Iturburua, who had been accused of housing foreigners
illegally residing in France.
	   Under French law, authorities can hold a suspect in a terrorist
probe up to four days without formal court proceedings.
	   On Tuesday, Spanish Interior Minister Jaime Mayor had hailed the
roundups and said that ``Franco-Spanish cooperation in the struggle
against terrorism will not cease to increase.''
	   ETA, which stands for Basque Homeland and Liberty, has
traditionally used French Basque territory as a place of refuge.
But French authorities _ under pressure from Spain _ have begun to
crack down.
	   Nearly 800 people have been killed since Basque separatists
began fighting in 1968 for an independent state in Spain's northern
Basque provinces.

Clinton says volatility is to be expected in world markets
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Combines previous, adds byline &QL; 
 &UR; By BARRY SCHWEID &QC; 
 &UR; AP Diplomatic Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Trying to calm global turmoil, U.S. President Bill
Clinton said Wednesday that volatility in U.S. and world markets is
to be expected and ``the right thing to do'' is to restore growth
in crippled economies from Asia to Russia.
	   ``It means, in short, that America must maintain a leadership
role of active involvement,'' Clinton said.
	   Speaking from the Kremlin's Marble Hall at a joint news
conference with Russian President Boris Yeltsin, Clinton aimed his
comments at calming wild gyrations in the U.S. stock market as
investors react to currency and economic crises in Russia, Japan
and other major industrial nations.
	   ``The volatility in the world markets, including in our stock
market, I think is to be expected under these circumstances,''
Clinton said.
	   ``The right thing to do is to try to restore growth in the
economies of the world where there isn't enough growth.''
	   He spoke about 3 1/2 hours before Wall Street opened for another
uncertain day of trading.
	   ``The most important thing is sticking with sound economic
policy,'' Clinton said, referring to his administration's platform
of ``fiscal discipline'' coupled with increased spending on
education, science and technology.
	   ``We have to make the investments and decisions that we know
will produce growth over the long run for the American economy,''
he said
	   On Tuesday, Wall Street logged its second-busiest day of trading
and saw the Dow Jones industrial average bounce back 288 points
from Monday's stunning 512-point plunge. That 6.4 percent fall was
the second-biggest point drop ever for Wall Street's best-known
indicator.
	   The rebound sent Asia's three main stock indexes higher
Wednesday, despite the region's unresolved economic woes.
	   Markets in Tokyo, Singapore and Hong Kong all closed higher
Wednesday.
	   The Dow's roller coaster ride has raised fears that the U.S.
economy could slow down and slip into a recession. Monday's plunge
on Wall Street specifically raised concerns that Asia's
14-month-old had spread to the West and Russia, where an economic
crisis is widely regarded as the country's worst since the fall of
communism.
	   Clinton, who often talks of global turmoil as a direct American
interest, said the United States must take the lead in bolstering
world economies.
	   ``Because of our relative economic strength, (Americans) have an
extra obligation to try to build a system for the 21st century,''
he said.

Report: Bank's problems will cause cash problems for Russians
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SERGEI SHARGORODSKY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Customers could face lengthy delays in withdrawing
their money from a troubled commercial bank that is being taken
over by Russia's Central Bank, an official said in an interview
published Wednesday.
	   One of the country's largest private banks, SBS-Agro, has been
hit hard by Russia's financial turmoil and many customers have not
been able to withdraw their money. The Central Bank moved to take
control of SBS-Agro last week, and has asked the State Duma,
parliament's lower house, to approve a bill allowing the takeover.
	   The Duma, however, is in the midst of a political fight with
President Boris Yeltsin over his candidate for prime minister,
Viktor Chernomyrdin.
	   The Central Bank's deputy chairman Sergei Aleksashchenko warned
that swift parliamentary approval of the bill was needed to help
SBS-Agro to resume operations soon.
	   ``If the bill is rejected or delayed, the Central Bank would
have to liquidate this bank,'' Aleksashchenko told the weekly
Argumenty i Fakty.
	   Private deposits would then be transferred to the state-run
Sberbank, a process that would take up to 2 months, he said.
	   Numerous holders of dollar deposits face major losses, as
Sberbank will likely take SBS-Agro's deposits at last week's rate
of 7.8 rubles per dollar against the present 12 to 13 rubles, said
Aleksashchenko.
	   SBS-Agro was one of the country's leading banks and its problems
could potentially effect millions of people, officials said.
	   Customers of Sberbank enjoy a 100 percent government guarantee
for their deposits. The Central Bank has offered commercial banks
to transfer private deposits to Sberbank, but Aleksashchenko said
bank owners ``are not showing a burning desire'' to do so.
	   However, one major bank, Menatep, said Wednesday it has reached
a deal to transfer individual depositor accounts to Sberbank to
provide customers with ``additional guarantees for their savings,''
the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   The dollar, meanwhile, remained virtually unchanged in
electronic trading in Moscow Wednesday, selling at about 12-13
rubles.
	   Meanwhile, International Monetary Fund officials were quoted as
saying the fund might delay its next disbursement of a major
stabilization loan.
	   A dlrs 4.3 billion disbursement is expected in coming weeks, but
IMF officials said Russia must do more to improve the economic
situation, the Russian media reported.
	   Russia reached a deal in July with the IMF and other
international financial institutions for more than dlrs 22 billion
in loans this year and next, but the money did not ward off the
latest economic crisis.

Currencies stronger on good news from abroad
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TOM COHEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Buoyed by good news from New York and
Tokyo, currencies and share prices in central Europe opened
stronger Wednesday to make up some of the recent drops caused by
the Russian crisis.
	   The Polish zloty, Hungarian forint and Czech koruna all surged
in morning trading, responding to rising prices on Wall Street and
a lull in new developments in Russia.
	   Share prices on the Warsaw, Budapest and Prague stock exchanges
also rose to mimic the recovery in New York that also has been
followed in Tokyo and Western Europe.
	   Investors who pulled their stakes out of the region to cover
losses in Russia now were reconsidering central Europe markets as a
hedge, according to dealers. But they warned the markets remain
volatile and could react negatively to a further deterioration in
Russia.
	   ``It's too early to say'' if Poland's currency would continue to
rise, said Piotr Konarski, a dealer at Westdeutsche Landesbank.
	   The zloty was 3.7 percent over the midpoint of its trading range
against five international currencies, up sharply from the Tuesday
close of 1.75 percent above the midpoint. Share prices in Poland
also rose in morning trade, with 136 stocks increasing in value
compared to 20 that dropped.
	   In Budapest, the forint was stronger against both the U.S.
dollar and the German mark a week after the government launched the
first of two interventions to prop it up.
	   Stocks also opened stronger, with the BUX index of 20 major
shares up 3.6 percent from Tuesday's close.
	   Similar results came from Prague, with the koruna stronger
against both the dollar and the mark and the PX-50 stock index
rising by 2.4 percent.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan ended all charter flights to and from North
Korea Wednesday in retaliation for the missile it sent sailing over
Japan and into the Pacific Ocean.
	   The decision affects nine cargo flights from North Korea to
Japan and 14 other flights that were still up for approval, said
Transport Ministry official Eiichiro Oishi.
	   Tokyo has already decided to drop further talks to establish
diplomatic ties with North Korea to protest Monday's test launch.
It has ruled out additional food aid and suspended work on an
international project to build nuclear reactors there, toward which
Japan had previously promised dlrs 1 billion.
	   ``We must make North Korea understand that this kind of action
will be costly,'' Foreign Minister Masahiko Komura said.
	   Japan also plans to file a protest in the United Nations, both
in the Security Council and the General Assembly, officials said.
	   Also Wednesday, North Korea commented on the missile for the
first time.
	   ``We bitterly denounce Japan for making a fuss over the matter
that belongs to our sovereignty while being unaware of its
background,'' the North's official Korean Central News Agency said.
``Japan's behavior is ridiculous.''
	   The missile launch, which has shaken Japan and heightened fears
about Asian security, has also brought the Japanese government
under scrutiny for what some see as an overly slow, fumbling
response to crisis.
	   The Defense Agency acknowledged Wednesday that it waited more
than eight hours before disclosing to the public that the missile
had landed not in the Sea of Japan, as initially reported, but in
the Pacific Ocean, just some 500 kilometers (300 miles) off the
eastern coast of Japan.
	   The first news of the missile came from the U.S. military at
about noon (0300 GMT) Monday. Japan, which has no independent
missile-monitoring system, did not know about the firing until it
received word from U.S. forces.
	   The original report said the missile _ believed to be a test of
the new Taepo Dong 1 missile _ had landed in the Sea of Japan,
about midway between Russia and the western coast of Japan.
	   Three hours later, the Defense Agency learned from the U.S.
military and its own forces that the missile had landed in the
Pacific, said agency spokesman Tatsuhiko Fukui. But it waited until
after 11 p.m. to hold a news conference to announce that.
	   The fact that the missile had landed in the Pacific was critical
because it proved North Korea has the capability to strike any part
of Japan, including U.S. bases that house some 50,000 troops.
	   When North Korea fired its last missile five years ago, it
reached only as far as the Sea of Japan.
	   Fukui, the agency official, said Monday's missile appeared to be
two-stage, with the booster, or first stage, falling into the Sea
of Japan. The second stage landed in the Pacific, with the warhead
falling nearby, he said.
	   ``We did not want to unnecessarily fan the fears of the public.
We wanted to wait on the announcement until we were more certain of
the facts,'' Fukui said. ``We do not think we were too slow. We
don't want to cry wolf.''
	   But others were more critical.
	   ``Crisis management gets nowhere,'' said the headline of
Wednesday's national Mainichi newspaper. TBS TV commentator Tetsuya
Chikushi accused the government of taking a condescending view
toward ordinary people and withholding information.
	   ``Nothing is working to respond to the crisis. I don't feel
safe,'' said Kazunobu Imura, a 46-year-old owner of a health food
store.
	   ``The system doesn't seem to be functioning,'' said Takashi
Suzuki, a 32-year-old temporary worker. ``We want to know more.''
	   Charges of shoddy crisis management are not new to Tokyo. Prone
to bureaucratic foot-dragging, Japan came under fire for the same
reason after the 1995 Kobe earthquake that killed more than 6,000
people.
	   More recently, it has been labeled a procrastinator in
implementing economic reforms to wrest the nation out of a
recession.

don't pay their taxes their children won't be able to attend
state-run schools, a newspaper reported Wednesday.
	   Schoolchildren who went to school Tuesday for the first day of
classes received a letter saying they could be booted out if their
parents didn't pay what they owe the tax authorities, the
English-language Moscow Times said.
	   Tax collectors only managed to pull in about 50 percent of what
they targeted for 1997 and are growing increasingly bold in their
efforts to wrench money from Russians, the newspaper said.
	   Russian teachers often suffer delays in their pay because the
government is short of funds due to its failure to sufficiently
fill the state coffers.
	   The failure to collect taxes is considered one of the main
reasons for Russia's current economic crisis.

U.S. Embassies in Kuwait, Manila faces attack threats
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: New throughout to UPDATES with embassy in Kuwait facing
threat; CORRECTS aircraft note was in Enlgish &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ The U.S. Embassy in Kuwait said Wednesday an
attack was possibly being planned against it, and a handwritten
note found on a plane warned of a bomb attack on the U.S. mission
in the Philippines.
	   A taped message on an embassy's telephone line for U.S. citizens
said: the ``U.S. government has received information indicating
that a similar attack (to those on embassies in Kenya and Tanzania)
may be being planned in Kuwait.''
	   The message said the embassy was taking ``appropriate security
precautions.''
	   Embassy spokesman Claud Young told The Associated Press that the
mission does not plan to close down because of the threat except
for the Labor Day holiday on Monday.
	   He would not say how or where the threat was received.
	   The embassy in this oil-rich state has received several bomb
threats since the end of the 1991 Gulf War.
	   Another threat, this time against the U.S. Embassy in Manila,
Philippines, was delivered Tuesday on board an Emirates flight in
the form of a handwritten note, the Interior Ministry said.
	   The unsigned note in English was found in the toilet of the
aircraft that arrived from Dubai, Col. Bader Saleh, the ministry
spokesman, said. He had earlier reported the note was in Arabic.
	   He quoted the note as saying: ``The American Embassy in the
Philippines will be bombed on Sept. 4, 1998.''
	   Security people searched the aircraft thoroughly but found
nothing suspicious, Saleh said.
	   Kuwait was the scheduled destination of the flight, and it was
not clear if the aircraft was supposed to fly to Manila later. It
was not known who found the note.
	   In Manila, embassy spokesman Michael Korff said the mission is
aware of the threat. He would not comment further.
	   Washington has closed some of its diplomatic missions around the
world and maximized security in others following last month's twin
bombings of its embassies in Nairobi, Kenya and Dar es Salaam,
Tanzania. More than 250 people were killed and some 5,000 injured.
	   The bombings led to U.S. missile strikes at suspected training
camps for fundamentalist Muslims in Afghanistan and a
pharmaceutical plant in the Sudanese capital that the U.S.
government accused of making precursors for chemical weapons.

	   Clinton, trying to quickly dispense with questions about his
personal life in an international setting, said there were more
important issues to be dealt with.
	   ``As you can see from what we're discussing here, there are very
large issues that will affect the future of the American people in
the short run and over the long run,'' he said. ``There are large
issues that have to be dealt with now in the world and at home.''
	   ``I'm going to do my best to continue to go through the personal
process in an appropriate way but to do my job, to do the job that
I was hired to do and I think that very much needs to be done right
now,'' he said.
	   Clinton's aides had suggested that the president was looking for
an opportunity to expand on his initial remarks about the Lewinsky
investigation.
	   Twice questioned about the tone of his comments on the Lewinsky
matter, including his pointed criticism of prosecutor Kenneth
Starr, Clinton said: ``I thought it was clear that I was expressing
my profound regret to all who were hurt and to all who were
involved and my desire not to see any more people hurt by this
process and caught up in it.''
	   ``I was commenting that it seemed to be something that most
reasonable people would think had consumed a disproportionate
amount of American time, money and resources and attention and
would now continue to involve more and more people.''
	   Alluding to the ongoing Starr investigation, he added, ``All I
wanted to say is I believe it's time for us to now go back to the
work of the country and give the people their government back and
talk about and think about and work on things that will affect the
American people today and in the future.''

Austrian skiing star denies he used drugs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Alpine skiing superstar Hermann Maier on
Wednesday refuted suggestions of an Italian doctor that he had used
performance-enhancing drugs in his debut season on the World Cup
circuit.
	   ``I have definitely not taken drugs. Something like that is
unnecessary,'' Maier told the Austria Press Agency after he
returned from a month-long team training session in New Zealand.
	   The Italian Gazzetta dello Sport newspaper reported in its
Saturday edition that a doctor with the Italian winter sports
federation suspected Austrian skiers of doping.
	   Herbert Schonhuber said he had no proof of doping, but he
questioned the increased muscle mass of Maier and other Austrian
skiiers, Gazzetta dello Sport reported.
	   Schonhuber, head of the Italian federation's medical commission,
said the muscle growth is ``impossible with normal weight work or
with electro-stimulation. You can't get them with clean methods,''
the Italian paper said.
	   The doctor said both Maier and downhill star Andreas Schifferer
worked with Bernd Pansold, a doctor on trial in Berlin _ along with
other communist-era sports figures _ for harming East German
swimmers with performance-enhancing drugs.
	   However, Schonhuber told Austria's Salzburger Nachrichten
newspaper: ``I have never _ not even in this interview with
Gazzetta _ claimed that the Austrians and Maier used drugs.
	   ``I had merely reported to the newspaper that all last season
the ski circuit speculated over whether Mader had,'' the Salzburger
Nachrichten reported in its Wednesday edition.
	   Skiers are regularly tested for drug use. Maier told APA he was
tested three times during the World Cup season, and once during the
Olympic games. All the tests proved negative.
	   Maier said similar allegations have been made before about
skiers who come out of nowhere to make a name for themselves on the
World Cup circuit.
	   At the Olympic Games in Nagano, Maier recovered from a
spectacular fall in the men's downhill to win two gold medals. He
also won three World Cup titles.

<TEXT>
	   ARUSHA, Tanzania (AP) _ In the first-ever international
conviction for genocide, a U.N. tribunal on Wednesday found a
Rwandan ex-mayor guilty in the savage bloodletting that killed more
than 500,000 Rwandans in 1994.
	   Jean-Paul Akayesu was found guilty of nine of 15 counts,
including what was described as ``meticulously organized''
genocide, crimes against humanity, murder, torture and rape.
	   His lawyer said Akayesu, who maintained his innocence throughout
his 18-month trial, would appeal.
	   Prosecutor Pierre Prosper said he was deeply satisfied with the
guilty verdicts, and added that the case provides ``a road map for
how we are to proceed'' in future genocide prosecutions.
	   He said he was looking forward to going to Akayesu's hometown,
the central Rwandan village of Taba, and telling survivors of the
slaughter: ``We did it. We achieved justice.''
	   But in Rwanda, where the slow pace of the tribunal's work has
been harshly criticized, the verdict was greeted dispiritedly. The
tribunal has been in operation for nearly four years, and this is
the first conviction.
	   ``I don't see the people in Rwanda going to the streets to
congratulate the international court on this one,'' said Patrick
Mazimhaka, a state minister. ``It has gone on for so long and I
think people have given up.''
	   At Wednesday's session, the chief judge, Laity Kama of Senegal,
ordered Akayesu to stand as the verdicts were read. He did so,
weaving slightly from side to side.
	   ``The accused, Jean-Paul Akayesu _ you are declared guilty of
genocide,'' Kama intoned. Each time a guilty verdict was read out,
Akayesu furrowed his brow slightly and winced.
	   The International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda said the judgment
against Akayesu was the first for the crime of genocide by an
international court, and also the first for sexual violence.
	   All those accused in the post-World War II Nuremberg trials
pleaded innocent to charges including murder and extermination.
Those trials pre-dated the creation of the crime of genocide 50
years ago.
	   Akayesu, a Hutu former teacher born in 1953, was convicted of
ordering the killings of 2,000 people who sought his protection in
the central Rwandan village of Taba.
	   They were among more than 500,000 Rwandans, mostly minority
Tutsis but also moderate Hutus, who were butchered with machetes
and nail-studded clubs in a genocide carefully orchestrated by
extremists in the former Hutu government.
	   During Wednesday's 1 1/2-hour tribunal session, Kama said the
three-judge panel rejected defense arguments that Akayesu was
helpless to prevent the killings because the soldiers and militia
were more powerful than he was as a politician.
	   In Rwanda, a mayor ``was treated with a lot of deference by the
people and had a lot of power,'' the judge said. He called the
killing rampage ``meticulously organized.''
	   Akayesu was ordered held over in Arusha pending a pre-sentencing
hearing on Sept. 28. The maximum penalty the tribunal can impose is
life imprisonment.
	   ``The penalty doesn't match the crime,'' said Chantal Kayitesi,
who heads a group of widows of the Rwandan slaughter. ``But we have
to recognize the difference ebtween international laws and ours in
Rwanda.''
	   Defense attorney Nicolas Tingaye said an appeal would be filed,
but he did not say on which counts.
	   Several European countries have volunteered to incarcerate
tribunal convicts, but the tribunal would prefer those found guilty
serve their sentences in African countries.
	   The tribunal was set up in November 1994 but until now had not
yet rendered a verdict in any case, a time lag that has been
sharply criticized by Rwandans.
	   Akayesu's trial began in January 1997. During it, the tribunal
heard from 42 witnesses, and transcripts ran 4,000 pages.
	   The tribunal is holding 31 people in Arusha, four of whom are on
trial. Another person, an elderly Rwandan minister, is in custody
in Texas. Eight others have been indicted, but not apprehended.
	   Rwandan courts _ in proceedings condemned by many foreign
lawyers as unjust _ have tried at least 330 people for involvement
in the genocide, and 116 have been sentenced to death. More than
125,000 people are imprisoned and awaiting trial.
	   On April 24, a Rwandan firing squad executed 22 people convicted
of genocide, the first executions for the slaughter.
	   The Rwanda genocide went on for 90 days, beginning April 7,
1994, the day after President Juvenal Habyarimana plane's was shot
down, and ending when Tutsi rebels took power.

Pakistan protests India test of ground to air missile

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Pakistan on Wednesday protested a
missile test by neighboring India, warning such weapons programs
could provoke a new arms race in South Asia, a foreign ministry
statement said.
	   On Tuesday, India test fired a short-range ground-to-air Akash
missile, designed to carry conventional weapons, as part of an
ongoing missile development program, Indian news reports said.
	   In response to the reports, the Pakistani foreign ministry said
``Pakistan has repeatedly drawn international attention to the
security implications of the Indian missile program.''
	   The statement said the deployment and testing of such missiles
directly effects regional security, and it urged international
pressure on India to show restraint in weapons programs.
	   Pakistan has lost three wars since 1948 to the larger India, and
in May exploded its first atomic weapons in respond to a series of
nuclear weapons tests by India this year.

Defense chiefs fighting Congo rebels meet in Angola for talks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ The defense chiefs of Congo, Angola,
Namibia and Zimbabwe gathered here Wednesday to discuss military
strategy in their war against insurgents seeking to topple Congo's
President Laurent Kabila, the Defense Ministry said.
	   Angolan chief of staff Joao de Matos hosted the meeting which
included Kabila's son Joseph, Namibian Lt. Gen. Dimo Hamaambo, and
General Vitalis Zvinavashe of Zimbabwe.
	   None of the participants spoke to reporters. The Angolan Defense
Ministry said it would issue a statement after the talks ended,
scheduled for later Wednesday.
	   Angola has sent troops, fighter jets and tanks to support
Kabila's army. Zimbabwe and Namibia have also provided troops.
	   With their help, Kabila's army has driven the rebels away from
Kinshasa in the southwest and is threatening to pursue them to
their strongholds in eastern Congo.
	   Uganda and Rwanda deny Kabila's allegations that they are aiding
the rebels.
	   Kabila unexpectedly arrived at the Nonaligned Movement's summit
in Durban, South Africa, Wednesday, raising the possibility of
progress in diplomatic efforts to halt the fighting.

Russian lawmakers call for compromise candidate, plan vote Friday
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with lawmakers tentatively approving letter to
Chernomyrdin asking him not to stand again. &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos Available &QL; 
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Communists urged President Boris Yeltsin on
Wednesday to come up with a new, compromise choice for prime
minister, and other lawmakers called on the current candidate to
step aside.
	   Yeltsin, however, has given no sign that he will heed the
request, and another showdown is expected on Friday when parliament
plans to vote for a second time on the position.
	   The State Duma, the lower house of parliament, overwhelmingly
rejected acting Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin on Monday,
saying he was incapable of leading the country out of its worst
economic crisis since the Soviet era.
	   ``Funerals, killings and catastrophes have become the main
content of Russian life,'' lawmakers said in a draft statement
explaining why they rejected Chernomyrdin. ``By turning
Chernomyrdin down, we voted no confidence in the president and
urged him to resign.''
	   The Duma also gave tentative approval to a letter appealing to
Chernomyrdin to ask Yeltsin not to nominate him again.
	   Yeltsin insists he won't give up Chernomyrdin as his nominee
despite the risk of continued political and economic uncertainty if
his strategy fails.
	   Under the Russian Constitution, the president can present his
candidate for prime minister three times. If lawmakers reject
Yeltsin's choice all three times, the president must dissolve the
Duma and call new parliamentary elections within three months.
	   Yeltsin would then rule by decree, and with an interim
government, until the new parliament is seated.
	   Communists and their hard-line allies say that Chernomyrdin's
prospects for winning approval are dim, and they have criticized
Yeltsin's handling of the crisis.
	   But ultranationalist leader Vladimir Zhirinovsky indicated
Wednesday that his party, which abstained in Monday's vote, would
support Chernomyrdin as the candidate best able to pull the economy
out of its tailspin.
	   ``It would be easier for him to continue the surgery since he
has just come out of the operation room,'' Zhirinovsky told
reporters, referring to Chernomyrdin's five-year stint as prime
minister before his surprise firing in March.
	   Zhirinovsky's Liberal Democratic Party is the third largest in
parliament's lower house with 50 members.
	   Former national security adviser Alexander Lebed said dissolving
parliament would be political suicide for Yeltsin.
	   ``Hatred for the present power has taken root in the Russian
provinces,'' said Lebed, who now is governor of the Krasnoyarsk
region of Siberia.
	   ``Therefore if the president decided to dissolve the Duma, he
will commit political hari-kari,'' he told the Interfax news
agency.
	   Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov called on both houses of
parliament to come up with a new candidate for Yeltsin to propose.
Zyuganov offered no names, but has previously suggested Moscow
Mayor Yuri Luzhkov, former Soviet bureaucrat Yuri Maslyukov and
several regional governors.
	   Yeltsin nominated Chernomyrdin last week, just five months after
replacing him with the young Sergei Kiriyenko. Yeltsin dismissed
Kiriyenko on Aug. 23.
	   Yeltsin assured Clinton that he wouldn't abandon democratic and
market reforms.
	   Chernomyrdin meanwhile outlined several planks of his plan to
battle the country's economic crisis.
	   He called for a radical overhaul of a taxation system that he
oversaw during five turbulent years as prime minister. Very few
Russians and Russian companies pay taxes, leaving the government
unable to pay state workers and pensioners.
	   ``Without tax reform, which would stimulate production, we won't
survive,'' Chernomyrdin said.

Drive for early elections gains new momentum
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LAURIE COPANS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) - In a fresh push for early elections, President
Ezer Weizman, a key proponent of holding a new vote, met Wednesday
with several influential legislators to hear their views.
	   Weizman has expressed deep concern over the 18-month deadlock in
the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks and rising unemployment, and
has said a vote ahead of schedule was vital for Israel.
	   The next elections are set for the fall of 2000.
	   The first step for moving up the vote was taken by parliament in
late July, just before the summer recess, when an opposition bill
to disperse the Knesset passed 60-6 in a preliminary reading.
	   Parliament's Law Committee discussed the bill Wednesday, with
opposition legislators angrily accusing chairman Hanan Porath from
the National Religious Party of trying to bury the legislation.
	   Porath has proposed to couple the early elections bill with
legislation calling for sweeping changes in Israel's electoral
system. Opposition legislators said such a pairing would mean it
would take many months of discussion in the committee before the
legislation could be presented to parliament for a first reading.
	   Porath denied accusations that he was acting in bad faith and
that his real plan was to kill the early elections bill.
	   Porath, one of the patrons of the Jewish settlement movement and
an opponent of a land-for-peace deal with the Palestinians, said he
believed it might be a good idea to hold elections before May, when
the interim period of Palestinian autonomy ends.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat has said he would unilaterally
declare a Palestinian state at that time.
	   Porath told Israel radio that the public should have a direct
say in the negotiations with the Palestinians, by way of elections.
	   ``I think there are serious considerations for holding early
elections before May, 1999,'' Porath said.
	   Opposition Labor Party legislator Hagai Merom said he believed
Porath was using the threat of early elections to prevent Netanyahu
from agreeing to an Israeli troop withdrawal from 13 percent of the
West Bank, as proposed by the United States.
	   Netanyahu has agreed in principle to such a pullback, though
with several conditions the Palestinians consider unacceptable.
Netanyahu's hardline coalition partners, including Porath's NRP,
have threatened to topple him over a pullback.
	   Weizman, meanwhile, has been meeting with several key
legislators to sound them out about the possibility of early
elections.
	   On Tuesday, he held talks with opposition leader Ehud Barak and
on Wednesday he met with coalition chairman Meir Shetreet.
	   Later in the day, he was to host David Levy, a former foreign
minister in Netanyahu's government and one of the prime minister's
most outpoken critics.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ U.S. President Bill Clinton pledged Wednesday to
continue ``the personal process'' of making amends for his
inappropriate relationship with Monica Lewinsky. He said he
believed his televised speech to the nation had conveyed his
``profound regret to all who were hurt.''
	   Clinton, who was criticized by some prominent Democrats and
Republicans for failing to make a more contrite public statement
two weeks ago, said he had re-read the speech recently and signaled
no desire to amend it.
	   ``All I wanted to say is I believe it's time for us to now go
back to the work of the country and give the people their
government back,'' he said during a Kremlin news conference with
Russian President Boris Yeltsin.
	   It was Clinton's first response to questions on the Lewinsky
affair since the TV appearance.
	   He said he has been heartened by the reaction of the American
people and leaders around the world.
	   ``I have acknowledged that I made a mistake, said that I
regretted it, asked to be forgiven, spent a lot of very valuable
time with my family in the last couple of weeks and said I was
going to back to work,'' he said. ``I believe that is what the
American people want me to do and, based on my conversations with
leaders around the world, I think that's what they want me to do
and that is what I intend to do.''
	   Clinton, trying to quickly dispense with questions about his
personal life in an international setting, said there were more
important issues to be dealt with.
	   ``As you can see from what we're discussing here, there are very
large issues that will affect the future of the American people in
the short run and over the long run,'' he said. ``There are large
issues that have to be dealt with now in the world and at home.''
	   ``I'm going to do my best to continue to go through the personal
process in an appropriate way but to do my job, to do the job that
I was hired to do and I think that very much needs to be done right
now,'' he said.
	   Clinton's aides had suggested that the president was looking for
an opportunity to expand on his initial remarks about the Lewinsky
investigation.
	   Twice questioned about the tone of his comments on the Lewinsky
matter, including his pointed criticism of prosecutor Kenneth
Starr, Clinton said: ``I thought it was clear that I was expressing
my profound regret to all who were hurt and to all who were
involved and my desire not to see any more people hurt by this
process and caught up in it.''
	   ``I was commenting that it seemed to be something that most
reasonable people would think had consumed a disproportionate
amount of American time, money and resources and attention and
would now continue to involve more and more people.''
	   Meanwhile, a federal judge in Little Rock, Arkansas, suggested
she may consider sanctions against Clinton for being
less-than-forthcoming about his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky.
	   U.S. District Judge Susan Webber Wright said Tuesday that she
will release Clinton's deposition in the Paula Jones' sexual
harassment lawsuit, in which Clinton denied having ``sexual
relations'' with Ms. Lewinsky.
	   In a one-sentence footnote, Wright said she ``has concerns about
the nature of the president's January 17, 1998, deposition'' but
``makes no findings at this time regarding whether the president
may be in contempt.''
	   Clinton acknowledged Aug. 17 before a federal grand jury that he
had an inappropriate relationship with the former White House
intern.
	   In the Jan. 17 deposition in Mrs. Jones' now-dismissed lawsuit,
Clinton said: ``I have never had sexual relations with Monica
Lewinsky.''

In rebel-held Congo, war anxiety takes hold
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HRVOJE HRANJSKI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GOMA, Congo (AP) _ Jean-Pierre, a freelance electrician, is
worried the Angolans will come and drop bombs. Nicholas, a student,
is thinking of going to neighboring Rwanda to escape the war at
home.
	   After a month of swift rebel advances on the capital Kinshasa,
the Congolese war is returning like a boomerang to where it started
_ here in the east of the vast African nation, 1,600 kilometers
(1,000 miles) away from Kinshasa.
	   Aided by Angolan fighter jets and tanks and troops from Zimbabwe
and Namibia, President Laurent Kabila's army has pushed the rebels
from Kinshasa and now threatens to pursue them to their eastern
strongholds, where war anxiety has taken hold.
	   ``We are waiting. It could be that we'll be bombed,'' said
Jean-Pierre, who would only give his first name. ``We can always go
to Rwanda if Angolans come here.''
	   In Goma, a lakeside town on the border with Rwanda, commanders
and political leaders of the rebel coalition of ethnic Tutsis,
opposition politicians and disenchanted members of Kabila's army,
prepared the defense of their four eastern fronts and braced for
air strikes.
	   On Wednesday, the rebels were reported to be advancing in the
southwestern copper-rich Katanga province, where they have already
captured the Lake Tanganyika port of Kalemie and Kabila's
birthplace of Manono, and were closing in on the Kindu airbase,
which the government could use to bomb their positions.
	   In the northeast, troops and ammunition have been flown in to
defend Kisangani, Congo's third largest city and the last navigable
Congo River port. Commanders said supplies can be ferried from
there to units hoping to break through Angolan lines southwest of
Kinshasa.
	   Kisangani is also the launching point for attacks in
north-central Equatoria province and the Congo River port of
Mbandaka further southwest, they said.
	   In the eastern towns of Bukavu and Goma, which flank Lake Kivu,
anti-aircraft guns protected the airports and soldiers guarded key
installations.
	   But the rebels must also contend with the fact that they may not
have the popular support necessary to sustain a long war. Kabila
has said he can win the war in two weeks, but rebel leader Ernest
Wamba dia Wamba disagreed.
	   ``We are trying to tell our people that this may not be a few
weeks' affair. It could be months, it could be years,'' Wamba said.
``The more people get that sense that this is a worthwhile
struggle, the (more) people will continue struggling.''
	   Unlike the popular 1996 revolt that toppled longtime dictator
Mobutu Sese Seko, the anti-Kabila rebellion is spearheaded by the
military, a close circle of opposition politicians and exiled
academics and has so far mobilized little popular support.
	   ``Our movement has been active for only three weeks now,'' said
Wamba, a former Harvard lecturer who spent 25 years in exile.
	   ``The struggle is different from the first one, because then
almost everybody was fed up with Mobutu so it was much easier,'' he
added. ``This one, people still need a lot of explanation, because
many of them have not even understood the sort of danger that some
of us saw in Kabila.''
	   The rebels accuse Kabila of incompetence, nepotism and
perpetuating corruption he had promised to eradicate after ousting
Mobutu.
	   Wamba said soldiers and military officers had not been paid for
months and were equally frustrated with Kabila's mismanagement of
the army.
	   Deteriorating relations with Rwanda and Uganda over his failure
to secure eastern borders from attacks by rebels provided a timely
opportunity for the revolt.
	   Kabila accuses Rwanda and Uganda _ who helped Kabila take power
in May 1997 _ of being behind the rebellion and invading the
country. But while both countries deny the charges, the issue has
raised strong anti-Tutsi sentiment in Congo, where many were
angered by Rwandan Tutsi domination of Kabila's forces last year.
	   Rwanda has threatened to intervene openly to protect its borders
and stop persecution of its Tutsi brethren in government-controlled
Congo. Uganda said on Tuesday it will maintain units it has in
eastern Congo to fight Ugandan rebels operating there.
	   In Goma, Jean-Pierre said he was hoping Rwanda would help Congo
in case the war comes east.
	   ``If they caused this problem, they must help us,'' he said.

Indonesian military sends troops back to troubled province
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LHOKSEUMAWE, Indonesia (AP) _ Citing security concerns,
Indonesia's military chief on Wednesday angrily reversed a decision
to withdraw troops from a northern province as fresh riots flared.
	   The turnaround could fuel tension in Aceh province, where
soldiers have been accused of atrocities while suppressing Islamic
separatist rebels in the late 1980s and 1990s. Investigators have
found mass graves containing bodies of alleged victims of the
military.
	   Last month, armed forces chief Gen. Wiranto apologized and
pulled out 1,000 soldiers in a conciliatory gesture, but he sent
hundreds back to the province Tuesday to secure the riot-torn town
of Lhokseumawe.
	   The town was quiet Wednesday, with thousands of anti-riot
officers patrolling the streets. But rioting spread to the nearby
town of Idi, where mobs looted stores and burned goods.
	   Students in uniform started the riot and bystanders then joined
in, police Lt. Col. Suminar said by telephone. Some rioters also
arrived in trucks from out of town. There were no reports of
casualties.
	   Two days of unrest in Lhokseumawe, on the northern tip of
Sumatra island, left a wide path of destruction. Mobs burned
buildings and hurled stones at shops owned by ethnic Chinese, a
common scapegoat. Even children joined in the looting.
	   Hundreds of Chinese fled, leaving their stores abandoned. At
least eight ethnic Chinese families fled Idi on Wednesday.
	   After a Cabinet meeting in Jakarta, Wiranto condemned the riots
as ``an act of anarchy'' and said Acehnese religious and social
leaders would no longer be in charge of keeping order.
	   ``From now on, the armed forces is taking over the security in
Aceh,'' he said. He brushed off questions about how long the
military would stay, saying: ``You ask the Acehnese people.''
	   Without elaborating, he accused ``certain parties'' of provoking
the unrest and said some alleged inciters had been arrested.
	   Abdurrahman Yacoub, a human rights lawyer in Aceh, said there
were 6,000 troops in the province. He said soldiers in Lhokseumawe
were slow to react to the riots and could have prevented them with
better intelligence.
	   The unrest erupted Monday after a contingent of 660 Indonesian
soldiers left Aceh in line with the military's efforts to restore
an image sullied by accusations of human rights violations.
	   Crowds pelted the military trucks with stones as they departed
and then rampaged through the streets, some shouting ``Free Aceh!''
and other separatist slogans.
	   Many chose to vent their anger on the ethnic Chinese minority,
which is viewed with suspicion partly because it dominates business
in economically struggling Indonesia.
	   Police said one man was killed after earlier reporting two
deaths. They did not confirm accounts by residents that the victim
was shot by security forces.
	   Hundreds of soldiers were guarding a natural gas refinery and
other state-run industrial sites in Lhokseumawe. Mobil Corp., the
U.S. oil company, has operations in the area.
	   Ninety inmates, meanwhile, were released after crowds stormed
the town prison Monday night. Dozens have since surrendered and
more were expected to turn themselves in once calm returns.
	   The riots were the worst since unrest helped oust former
autocratic President Suharto in mid-May. About 1,200 people died in
street violence in Jakarta, the capital.
	   Suharto's successor, B.J. Habibie, is implementing democratic
reforms, but fears abound that Indonesia's economic crisis and the
strain on millions of poor people could lead to bigger riots.

Hoddle and Adams put up united front
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ England soccer coach Glenn Hoddle and defender
Tony Adams ignored their published differences of opinion to
present a united front Wednesday as England prepares for its
opening Euro 2000 qualifier against Sweden.
	   Adams' book ``Addicted'', published this week in retaliation to
Hoddle's controversial World Cup diary, criticized Hoddle's
handling of the team during the World Cup and sparked concerns of a
rift in the England camp.
	   But Hoddle sat beside Adams during a press conference Wednesday
at Burnham Beeches, where the English squad is training for
Saturday's match against Sweden in Stockholm, and said there were
no problems between himself and Adams.
	   Hoddle said he had a meeting with Adams and, regarding his
opinion, ``I have no problems at all.''
	   ``Football is all about opinions. There is no problem between
Tony Adams and myself and I can't see there being any problems in
the future,'' he said.
	   Hoddle was widely condemned for betraying the confidences of
players by publishing accounts of the World Cup and criticizing
certain players and coaches.
	   Premier League coaches and players led calls for Hoddle to step
down as coach after he revealed last month how Paul Gascoigne went
bezerk when he was told he was dropped for England's squad for the
World Cup.
	   Adams, the Arsenal captain, said he was putting his
international career on the line by publishing his version of
events.
	   In the book, he criticized Hoddle for treating the team like
children, selecting Alan Shearer over him as captain, and
humiliating David Beckham in front of the team.

Spanish military offers novel ways to beat the draft
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Spaniards with chronic acne, facial scars
or anxiety disorders will be exempt from military service under
reforms being considered by the Defense Ministry, a newspaper
reported Wednesday.
	   The long list of opt-outs also includes severe obesity, low IQ,
missing toes and osteoporosis, El Mundo said.
	   They reflect a drive to trim the armed forces as Spain moves to
an all-professional military in 2003.
	   Under the current system, all Spanish males 18 or over must sign
up for nine months of obligatory military service. Conscientious
objectors can get out of it by doing community service.
	   And people with medical conditions or emotional disorders are
exempt from doing certain kinds of military duty.
	   But under the proposed reforms, any one of those conditions,
such as bad skin, or depression diagnosed by a military doctor,
will suffice for complete exemption from the draft, El Mundo said.
	   Asked about the report, Defense Ministry spokeswoman Clara
Estrada insisted that the list had yet to be finalized and that
things like acne might not make the cut.

Chinese firm buys retired Russian aircraft carrier from Seoul

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ A mysterious Chinese company has bought a
retired Russian aircraft carrier from South Korea, sparking fears
that China might use it to boost its military might.
	   Hong Kong-based Apple Daily reported Wednesday that the
20-year-old, 43,000-ton Kiev class carrier, the Minsk, is docked
near the southern Chinese industrial city of Dongguan. It also
published four pictures of a rusty carrier bearing a red star.
	   Dongguan is known to be the center of businesses connected to
the offspring of senior military commanders.
	   Young Distribution of Seoul, South Korea, confirmed Wednesday it
had sold the vessel to a Chinese firm in mid-August on condition it
would be dismantled for scrap metal, not for military purposes.
	   A company spokesman, who refused to give his name, said he could
not reveal the identity of the Chinese company under a bilateral
agreement and refused to reveal more information.
	   The spokesman said the Chinese firm would have to pay Young a
steep penalty if the carrier was used for other purposes. Young
also has an agreement with Russia that the vessel would only be
sold for scrap metal.
	   Attempts on Wednesday to contact a Dongguan ship-breaking
company, the reported custodian of the ship, were unsuccessful.
Apple Daily said a company official, surnamed Wong, told its
reporter the matter was too sensitive and hung up without
disclosing more information.
	   Defense analysts have said China has long sought to build or
acquire an aircraft carrier to project military power far beyond
its coast, a plan that makes some Asian neighbors nervous.
	   Several months ago, a mysterious company registered in the
nearby Portuguese enclave of Macau bought an unfinished aircraft
carrier from Ukraine, saying it wants to turn it into a floating
entertainment center.
	   The company reportedly has ties with mainland China, and defense
experts suspect China eventually wants to use the carrier for
training, or to learn about carrier-building by dismantling the
vessel.
	   Macau will revert to Chinese rule in 1999.
	   The spokesman for Young Distribution said Russia had stripped
the ship of weapons, communications system, engines and other
equipment and said it is unlikely that China could remodel it for
military use.
	   But Yang Chih-heng, a respected Taiwanese defense analysts, said
China could be used mainly for training purposes rather than being
rebuilt into a new carrier. Training is now conducted on simulated
carrier decks at docks, he said.
	   Yang added China is buying Su-20 warplanes and two destroyers
from Russia, and jointly developing F10 warplanes with Israel, all
likely to be used for the planned aircraft carrier fleet.
	   Russia has sold the Minsk and other ships from its Pacific Fleet
because the country was unable to afford exorbitant maintenance
costs.
	   The spokesman for the South Korean company said it had sold the
Minsk to an Indian company earlier this year, but the deal was
scrapped because of what he described as a complicated dispute over
the delivery schedule.

Namibia suffers casualties in Congo war intervention
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WINDHOEK, Namibia (AP) _ Namibia has suffered the first
casualties from its intervention in Congo, national dailies
reported Wednesday, news likely to increase opposition at home to
the mission.
	   The sparsely populated, southwestern African country has come to
the aid of Congo President Laurent Kabila. Troops from Angola and
Zimbabwe have also helped him turn the tide of the war against
rebels.
	   The body of the first Namibian soldier killed in the fighting
has arrived back home, with more casualties expected to be
announced soon, The Namibian and the Afrikaans daily Die
Republikein reported.
	   They identified him as Lazarus Hiskia, attached to the 3rd
Battalion stationed at Oluno, had been killed on the outskirts of
Kinshasa.
	   ``Our son survived the liberation struggle and now went to die
in a land which is very far away from our country. Why so?'' The
Namibian quoted one family member as saying.
	   Several other families have also been notified of deaths in the
Congo, but this could not be independently confirmed, the
newspapers said.
	   The government confirmed Hiskia's death, saying he was the only
casualty.
	   Defense Ministry spokesman Vincent Mwange could not give any
details on the number of Namibian soldiers deployed in Congo.
	   Call-in radio programs have been inundated by listeners critical
of President Sam Nujoma's decision to send troops to Congo.

<TEXT>
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ The U.S. Embassy in Kuwait said Wednesday an
attack was possibly being planned against it, and a handwritten
note found on a plane in Kuwait warned of a bomb attack on the U.S.
mission in the Philippines.
	   Washington has closed some of its diplomatic missions around the
world and maximized security in others following last month's
bombings of its embassies in Nairobi, Kenya and Dar es Salaam,
Tanzania. More than 250 people were killed and some 5,000 injured.
	   A taped message on a telephone line in the embassy in Kuwait
said: the ``U.S. government has received information indicating
that a similar attack may be being planned in Kuwait.''
	   The message said the embassy was taking ``appropriate security
precautions.''
	   Embassy spokesman Claud Young told The Associated Press that the
mission does not plan to close down because of the threat.
	   He would not say how or where the threat was received.
	   A threat against the U.S. Embassy in Manila, Philippines, was
delivered Tuesday on board a flight from the United Arab Emirates
in the form of a handwritten note, the Interior Ministry said.
	   The unsigned note in English was found in the toilet of the
aircraft that arrived from Dubai, Col. Bader Saleh, the ministry
spokesman, said. He had earlier reported the note was in Arabic.
	   He quoted the note as saying: ``The American Embassy in the
Philippines will be bombed on Sept. 4, 1998.''
	   Security people searched the aircraft thoroughly but found
nothing suspicious, Saleh said.
	   In Manila, embassy spokesman Michael Korff said the mission is
aware of the threat. He would not comment further.

	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Government-allied troops on Wednesday
were pushing east toward the rebel-held town of Kalemie, taking
Congo's monthlong civil war away from the capital of Kinshasa and
into the heart of rebel territory.
	   Information Minister Didier Mumengi said the loyalist forces had
closed in on Kalemie, about 400 kilometers (250 miles) south of the
key rebel stronghold of Bukavu on the eastern fringe of this large
central African state.
	   Rebel leaders in the eastern city of Goma, however, said they
were reinforcing their positions in Kalemie and two other
rebel-held towns _ Moba and Manono, President Laurent Kabila's
birthplace _ in the copper-rich Katanga province of southern Congo.

Yeltsin cites obligation to reform, Clinton says 'no short cut'
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: New material throughout. Adds Clinton quotes, moves up
Zyuganov comment. &QL; 
 &UR; By BARRY SCHWEID &QC; 
 &UR; AP Diplomatic Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian President Boris Yeltsin said Wednesday his
country faces a lot of ``tears and sweat'' in dealing with its
crisis. U.S. President Bill Clinton held out hope for expanded aid
but said ``there is no short cut'' to Russian reform.
	   ``America and the international community are, I'm convinced,
ready to offer further assistance if Russia stays with the path to
reform,'' Clinton said at a joint news conference ending the
two-day Moscow summit.
	   Yeltsin, in the throes of a full-throttled political crisis, was
asked what he would do if the Russian parliament refused to confirm
his choice of Viktor Chernomyrdin to return as prime minister.
	   Yeltsin took several seconds and then said, ``There will be a
reasonable number of events taking place in order for us to be able
to attain these goals.'' As Clinton and others waited for more, he
added, ``That's it.''
	   Clinton had been asked a question about whether he had struck
the right tone in his TV appearance regarding Monica Lewinsky.
After Yeltsin's reply he grinned and quipped, ``That would be my
answer, too.''
	   Regarding the brief TV remarks on the Lewinsky matter,
criticized by many as too grudging and not nearly apologetic
enough, he said, ``I read it the other day and I thought I was
expressing my profound regret to all who were hurt.''
	   Both presidents described their meetings as successful, and
Yeltsin told reporters he and Clinton discussed ways to intensify
U.S.-Russian economic relations to pull Russia out of its economic
tailspin.
	   ``There still is a lot of tears and sweat to spend before we
identify the forms of business cooperation which are worthy of the
two great nations,'' Yeltsin said without mentioning the political
paralysis he faces with the State Duma over forming a new
government.
	   Said Clinton: ``I know this is a difficult time, but there is no
short cut.''
	   Yeltsin said the key to Russia's economic recovery was not
further U.S. assistance but more foreign investment. ``This is what
we need.''
	   The Russian leader said he wanted the world to know that Russia
does not view U.S. support as a crutch. ``Not at all,'' he said
several times to stress his point. He said Russia had no choice but
to stick to its plan _ now in danger of failing _ to build a free
market economy.
	   ``We are still obliged to take these reforms to the end, through
the end, and correspondingly get a reward for that,'' he said.
	   Clinton was meeting later with leaders of the Duma and said he
would repeat the message he gave Yeltsin: ``If the reform process
can be completed, I for one would be for greater assistance to
Russia.'' He said the United States has a ``very strong vested
interest'' in seeing Russia succeed.
	   As Clinton and Yeltsin held their second round of talks,
Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov bluntly summed up the high
stakes in this country's internal power struggle: ``President
Yeltsin is pushing the nation to a civil war.''
	   At the news conference, Clinton referred obliquely to Yeltsin's
standoff with communist and nationalist lawmakers.
	   ``I think if other political forces try to force the president
to abandon reform in midstream or even reverse it, what I think
will happen is even less money will come into Russia and even more
economic hardship will result,'' Clinton said.
	   Before taking questions from reporters, Yeltsin and Clinton
signed two security agreements. One commits each country to ridding
itself of 50 tons of weapons-grade plutonium from old nuclear
warheads; the other calls for sharing information on missile launch
warnings.
	   They also signed joint statements on biological weapons control
and on peace hopes for Kosovo, the Balkan region torn with civil
strife.
	   Yeltsin said the summit took place ``in a very friendly
atmosphere'' notwithstanding disagreements on some security issues.
After his meetings with Yeltsin, Clinton was to press his no-pain,
no-gain message with Duma leaders.
	   In his opening remarks in the Kremlin's Marble Hall, Yeltsin
said he and Clinton had discussed at length many defense and
international security issues.
	   ``At large, our approaches are common, but not always so,''
Yeltsin said. ``Today's conflicts in the world have no military
solution, be it Kosovo or Iraq'' or elsewhere.
	   He also reiterated his opposition to what he called ``NATO
centrism,'' or the central military role the U.S.-led NATO alliance
plays in Europe and beyond. He added, however, that the two days of
discussion had produced a ``broader understanding on these
issues.''
	   In urging Yeltsin not to abandon reform, Clinton is preaching to
the choir. The Russian leader has insisted he would not give up on
democratic reforms or on his appointment of Chernomyrdin as prime
minister.
	   ``The past two years in Russia's life have been full of stormy
political events, great laborious work on reforming the economy,''
Yeltsin said in dinner remarks Tuesday. ``Soon there were
disappointments, too, and unfulfilled hopes. But we've never lost
the conviction in the necessity of the transformations we're
carrying out.''

Defense chiefs fighting Congo rebels meet in Angola for talks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ The defense chiefs of Congo, Angola,
Namibia and Zimbabwe gathered here Wednesday to discuss military
strategy in their war against insurgents seeking to topple Congo's
President Laurent Kabila, the Defense Ministry said.
	   Angolan chief of staff Joao de Matos hosted the meeting, which
included Kabila's son Joseph, Namibian Lt. Gen. Dimo Hamaambo, and
Gen. Vitalis Zvinavashe of Zimbabwe.
	   None of the participants spoke to reporters. The Angolan Defense
Ministry said it would issue a statement after the talks ended,
scheduled for later Wednesday.
	   Angola has sent troops, fighter jets and tanks to support
Kabila's army. Zimbabwe and Namibia have also provided troops.
	   With their help, Kabila's army has driven the rebels away from
the capital of Kinshasa in the southwest and is threatening to
pursue them to their strongholds in eastern Congo.
	   Uganda and Rwanda deny Kabila's allegations that they are aiding
the rebels.
	   Kabila unexpectedly arrived at the Nonaligned Movement's summit
in Durban, South Africa, Wednesday, raising the possibility of
progress in diplomatic efforts to halt the fighting.

India names teams for Sahara Cup, Commonwealth Games
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRAS, India (AP) _ Indian selectors split their star batsmen
Wednesday, dispatching Sachin Tendulkar to Malaysia for the
Commonwealth Games and Mohammed Azharuddin to Canada to battle
arch-rival Pakistan in the Sahara Cup.
	   Former national captain Tendulkar, one of the world's best
batsmen with an average in the 50s, opens for India in one-day
internationals and Azharuddin is the current captain credited with
guiding India back to winning form. But with two important events
clashing on the calendar, the five selectors Wednesday struck a
compromise and picked up two teams mixed with experienced and young
players.
	   The selectors were under pressure from the Indian Olympic
Association to send top players to the Commonwealth Games. But they
also had to contend with Pakistan picking its strongest squad for
Canada.
	   Cricket fans both in India and Pakistan are expected to keenly
follow the clash between the traditional rivals in five Sahara Cup
matches in Canada.
	   The Commonwealth team that departs for Kuala Lumpur Sept. 7:
Ajay Jadeja (captain), Anil Kumble (vice captain), Tendulkar, Gagan
Khoda, V.V.S. Laxman, M.S.K. Prasad, Robin Singh, Rohan Gavaskar,
Rahul Sangvi, Paras Mambhrey, Nikhil Chopra, Amay Khurasia,
Harbhajan Singh and Debashish Mohanty.
	   The Sahara Cup team that departs for Canada Sept. 9: Mohammed
Azharuddin (captain), Saurav Ganguly (vice captain), Navjot Singh
Sidhu, Rahul Dravid, Hrishikesh Kanitkar, Nayan Mongia, Ajit
Agarkar, Sunil Joshi, Sairaj Bahutule, Javgal Srinath, Venkatesh
Prasad, Sanjay Ral, Jatin Paranjpe and Jyoti Yadav.

Spanish military offers novel ways to beat the draft
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Spaniards with chronic acne, facial scars
or anxiety disorders will be exempt from military service under
reforms being considered by the Defense Ministry, a newspaper
reported Wednesday.
	   The long list includes severe obesity, low IQ, missing toes and
osteoporosis, El Mundo said.
	   They reflect a drive to trim the armed forces as Spain moves to
an all-professional military in 2003.
	   Under the current system, all Spanish males 18 or older must
sign up for nine months of obligatory military service.
Conscientious objectors can get out of it by doing community
service.
	   And people with medical conditions or emotional disorders are
exempt from doing certain kinds of military duty.
	   But under the proposed reforms, any one of those conditions,
such as bad skin, or depression diagnosed by a military doctor,
will suffice for complete exemption from the draft, El Mundo said.
	   Asked about the report, Defense Ministry spokeswoman Clara
Estrada insisted the list had yet to be finalized and that things
like acne might not make the cut.

Explosion shatters army warehouse

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ An explosion shattered a
warehouse of the federal army in northwestern Bosnia, and up to
three soldiers were reported killed, NATO and army officials said
Wednesday.
	   The blast occurred Tuesday afternoon in the federation's
military warehouse in the village of Vrela, 210 kilometers (131
miles) northwest of Sarajevo.
	   The army of the Muslim-Croat federation and the NATO-led peace
force are investigating what is believed to be an accident caused
by mishandling of explosive ordinance.
	   NATO sources said at least three local soldiers died and eight
were wounded.
	   Federal officials confirmed the explosion killed one recruit.
They said two recruits were missing and two others were critically
injured.
	   The warehouse is one of the NATO-monitored storage sites for
weapons and ammunition of the federal army.

Drive for early elections gains new momentum
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LAURIE COPANS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ In a fresh push for early elections, Israeli
President Ezer Weizman, a key proponent of holding a new vote, met
Wednesday with several influential legislators to hear their views.
	   Weizman has expressed deep concern over the 18-month deadlock in
the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks and over rising unemployment,
and has said a vote ahead of schedule was vital for Israel.
	   The next elections are set for the fall of 2000.
	   The first step for moving up the vote was taken by parliament in
late July, just before the summer recess, when an opposition bill
to disband parliament passed 60-6 in a preliminary reading.
	   Parliament's Law Committee discussed the bill Wednesday, with
opposition legislators angrily accusing chairman Hanan Porath from
the National Religious Party of trying to bury the legislation.
	   Porath has proposed coupling the early elections bill with
legislation calling for sweeping changes in Israel's electoral
system. Opposition legislators said such a pairing would mean it
would take many months of discussion in the committee before the
legislation could be presented to parliament for a first reading.
	   Porath denied accusations that he was acting in bad faith and
that his real plan was to kill the early elections bill.
	   Porath, a patron of the Jewish settlement movement and an
opponent of a land-for-peace deal with the Palestinians, said he
believed it might be a good idea to hold elections before May, when
the interim period of Palestinian autonomy ends.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat has said he would unilaterally
declare a Palestinian state at that time.
	   Opposition Labor Party legislator Hagai Merom said he believed
Porath was using the threat of early elections to prevent Netanyahu
from agreeing to an Israeli troop withdrawal from 13 percent of the
West Bank, as proposed by the United States.
	   Netanyahu has agreed in principle to such a pullback, though
with several conditions the Palestinians consider unacceptable.
Netanyahu's hard-line coalition partners have threatened to topple
the government over a pullback.
	   Weizman, meanwhile, has been meeting with several key
legislators to sound them out about the possibility of early
elections.
	   On Tuesday, he talked with opposition leader Ehud Barak and on
Wednesday he met with coalition chairman Meir Shetreet.
	   Later in the day, he was to host David Levy, a former foreign
minister in Netanyahu's government and one of the prime minister's
most outpoken critics.

Edwards withdraws from World Cup and Commonwealth Games
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Jonathan Edwards, triple jump world-record holder,
Wednesday ruled himself out of British teams for the IAAF World Cup
track meet in Johannesburg and the Commonwealth Games in Kuala
Lumpur later this month.
	   Edwards said he would not compete for the rest of the season and
had elected to have surgery in Switzerland on his injured left
ankle.
	   He becomes the third high-profile athlete to withdraw from the
British team for the World Cup. European 200-meter champion Dougie
Walker withdrew through injury and 400-meter runner Mark Richardson
withdrew Tuesday to concentrate on the Commonwealth Games.
	   Edwards withdrew from a Golden League meet in Brussels last
Friday when a pain-killing injection failed to assist his injury.
	   ``I tried to train. I just couldn't put any weight on my foot,''
he said Wednesday.
	   ``I hoped I might get one more competition before the end of the
season. But this convinced me it is just not possible. It is just
not going to happen that I compete again this year.''

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 1100 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Wall Street's dramatic U-turn from big losses to a
big gain sent Asian and European stock indexes moving higher
Wednesday, despite the regions' ongoing economic woes. In Tokyo,
the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average opened 0.72 percent higher, but
the end of the day its gain had slipped to 6.99 points, or 0.05
percent, for a close of 14,376.62. Although it was the Nikkei's
third straight day of improvement, many people still believe the
Tokyo Stock Market has a long way to go to recover from Friday's
12-year low. In Singapore, the Straits Times Index closed up 4.5
points, or 0.55 percent, higher at 827.85. Hong Kong's market was
also lifted by the strong rebound on Wall Street, brokers said. The
blue-chip Hang Seng Index ended up 293.20 points, or 4.2 percent,
at 7,355.67. Shares also moved sharply higher from the outset of
trading Wednesday in London and Frankfurt. (WORLD MARKETS)
	   MOSCOW _ Russian President Boris Yeltsin pledges to continue
free market reforms and U.S. President Bill Clinton promises to
help as summit meetings conclude Wednesday. Yeltsin said Wednesday
his nation faces ``a lot of tears and sweat'' in its struggle for a
vibrant economy. Clinton offered encouragement but emphasized
``there is no short cut.'' ``America and the international
community are, I'm convinced, ready to offer further assistance if
Russia stays with the path to reform,'' Clinton said. Yeltsin said
the key to Russia's economic recovery was not further U.S.
assistance but more foreign investment. ``This is what we need.''
Before taking questions from reporters, Yeltsin and Clinton signed
two security agreements. One commits each country to ridding itself
of 50 tons of weapons-grade plutonium from old nuclear warheads;
the other calls for sharing information on missile launch warnings.
(RUSSIA-SUMMIT)
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia's central bank confirmed
Wednesday that the country's currency has been fixed at 3.80 to the
U.S. dollar, far stronger than what it was trading in the markets.
The move seems to contradict earlier statements by government
officials that the ringgit rate would not be fixed and that the
currency would be determined by supply and demand in the local
market. In a last-ditch effort to save his country's embattled
economy, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad announced Tuesday that the
government would ban trading of the ringgit outside the country. A
sweeping list of capital controls also halted the trade of
Malaysian shares overseas. Confused by the measures, Singapore's
brokerages halted trading on the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange.
Mahathir said reverting to a fixed exchange rate would fend off
currency speculators and help insulate its fragile economy from
further global shocks. (MALAYSIA-CURRENCY)
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Flag carrier Garuda Indonesia will lay
off at least 3,000 of its nearly 13,000 workers beginning in early
October, a newspaper reported Wednesday. The employees are being
dismissed as part of a massive restructuring program, The Jakarta
Post quoted Robby Djohan, president of the airline, as saying. The
debt-laden airline has fallen victim to Indonesia's worst economic
turmoil in decades. With 80 percent of its operating costs in
dollars, Garuda has been hit hard by the rupiah's sharp fall over
the last year. Djohan said Tuesday that the layoff process would be
gradual and some workers might be moved to Garuda subsidiaries or
its maintenance facility at Jakarta's international airport.
However, Garuda plans to sell the dlrs 300 million facility as a
cost-cutting measure. Djohan said he was confident that creditors
would agree with Garuda's proposal to roll over up to dlrs 300
million of the airline's dlrs 400 million in overseas debt.

	   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) _ Dispatchers and meteorologists were the first
to go as Northwest Airlines, entering the fifth day of a pilots'
strike, began laying off other employees. The U.S. company laid off
177 workers Tuesday and was to decide Wednesday whether more would
have to leave. Company officials said many of Northwest's 50,000
employees could be affected. The two sides are separated on issues
of compensation and job security. Northwest is the nation's
sixth-largest airline in terms of passengers carried annually and
the fourth-largest in revenue. It carries nearly 150,000 passengers
a day and 2.9 million pounds of cargo on 1,700 flights in North
America, Europe, Asia and India. Also Tuesday night, talks broke
down between Air Canada and its 2,100 pilots over issues of pay and
working conditions, forcing the airline to cancel all of its
flights worldwide. The strike is the first in the Air Canada Pilots
Association's 61-year history. Air Canada carries approximately
60,000 passengers daily. (US-NORTHWEST STRIKE)

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Communists on Wednesday urged President Boris
Yeltsin to come up with a new, compromise candidate for prime
minister, and lawmakers agreed to hold a second vote on the
position Friday. The State Duma, the lower house of parliament,
overwhelmingly rejected acting Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin
on Monday, saying he was incapable of leading the country out of
its worst economic crisis since the Soviet era. Yeltsin, who ended
a summit with President Bill Clinton, insists he won't give up
Chernomyrdin as his nominee despite the risk of continued political
and economic uncertainty if that strategy fails. Under the Russian
Constitution, the president can present his candidate for prime
minister three times. If lawmakers reject Yeltsin's choice all
three times, the president must dissolve the Duma and call new
parliamentary elections within three months. That would leave the
country to be steered through crisis by Yeltsin decrees and a
stand-in government. (RUSSIA-POLITICS)
	   ARUSHA, Tanzania (AP) _ In the first international conviction
for genocide, a U.N. tribunal on Wednesday found a Rwandan ex-mayor
guilty in the massacres that killed more than 500,000 Rwandans in
1994. Jean-Paul Akayesu was convicted on nine of 15 counts,
including genocide, crimes against humanity, torture and rape.
Prosecutor Pierre Prosper said he was deeply satisfied with the
verdict. But in Rwanda, the scene of the slaughter _ where the slow
pace of the tribunal's work has been harshly criticized _ the
verdict was greeted with some cynicism because it took so long to
gain a conviction. Akayesu, a Hutu former teacher born in 1953, was
convicted of ordering the killings of 2,000 people who sought his
protection in the central village of Taba, where he was mayor. They
were among more than 500,000 Rwandans who were butchered in a
genocide carefully orchestrated by members of the former Hutu
government. (RWANDA-GENOCIDE TRIBUNAL)
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Two British soldiers convicted
of murdering an unarmed Catholic teen-ager six years ago have
become the first life-sentence prisoners paroled from a Northern
Ireland prison in response to the Belfast peace accord. Britain's
governor for Northern Ireland, Mo Mowlam, on Wednesday ordered
immediate freedom for the two guardsmen. Mowlam emphasized that
many convicted members of the Irish Republican Army and pro-British
paramilitary groups who ``engaged in terrorism'' were expected to
be freed under April's peace agreement. The relatives of Peter
McBride, the 18-year-old civilian shot fatally in the back by the
soldiers six years ago in a Catholic section of north Belfast,
responded with fury. (NORTHERN IRELAND)
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan ended all charter flights to and from North
Korea Wednesday in retaliation for the missile it sent sailing over
Japan and into the Pacific Ocean. The decision affects nine cargo
flights from North Korea to Japan and 14 other flights that were
still up for approval, said Transport Ministry official Eiichiro
Oishi. Tokyo has already decided to drop further talks to establish
diplomatic ties with North Korea to protest Monday's test launch.
It has ruled out additional food aid and suspended work on an
international project to build nuclear reactors there, toward which
Japan had previously promised dlrs 1 billion. ``We must make North
Korea understand that this kind of action will be costly,'' Foreign
Minister Masahiko Komura said. Japan also plans to file a protest
in the United Nations, both in the Security Council and the General
Assembly, officials said. (JAPAN-NKOREA MISSILE)
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Several prominent Belgian socialists
including ex-NATO chief Willy Claes went on trial Wednesday on
charges they took millions of dollars in bribes in exchange for
awarding two companies Belgian defense contracts in the late 1980s.
Claes, 59, Belgium's former economics minister, ex-defense minister
Guy Coeme, 52, and ex-deputy premier Guy Spitaels, 67, denied the
charges. Prosecutors allege Italy's Agusta SpA and France's
Dassault Aviation SA paid million-dollar bribes to win military
contracts. The trial, held after Claes and other former cabinet
ministers were stripped of their parliamentary immunity, is
expected to last months. It is the final curtain for party bosses
who ran their political families unhampered by laws regulating
corporate donations _ which were not outlawed until 1989. Thus,
prosecutors must prove not only that money was paid, but that the
suspects knew the companies' ``gifts'' were bribes.

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ Switzerland's honorary consul in
Nicaragua, who faces legal action in the Central American country,
will leave his post, the Swiss Foreign Ministry said Wednesday.
	   An arrest warrant has been issued against Karl Morizzo in
Nicaragua, where he is accused of embezzlement. The ministry said
his appointment was being terminated by mutual agreement.
	   Morizzo, who was involved in the coffee trade, will formally
give up his post at the end of September.
	   Ministry spokeswoman Yasmine Chatila said the solution was
chosen because Morizzo was, for personal reasons, no longer in a
position to fully carry out his tasks.
	   The diplomat has been outside Nicaragua for several months.
	   The Foreign Ministry declined to comment on the charges against
Morizzo but stressed his work had always been to its satisfaction.

Police target dozens of suspected pedophiles in 12-country raids
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Police in 12 countries raided the homes of more
than 100 suspected pedophiles Wednesday in what authorities called
one of the largest efforts ever to break an Internet child
pornography ring.
	   The British National Crime Squad coordinated the early morning
raids as part of a five-month investigation into the so-called
Wonderland club, which authorities said exchanged pornographic
pictures of children as young as 2 on the Internet.
	   During the investigation, code-named ``Cathedral,'' police said
they found a database containing more than 100,000 pornographic
photographs of naked boys and girls and confiscated computers and
computer programs from dozens of suspects.
	   Police said they targeted 180 suspects and arrested more than
100 in the raids, which took place at 0400 GMT on three continents
_ in Australia, Austria, Belgium, Britain, Finland, France,
Germany, Italy, Norway, Portugal, Sweden and the United States.
	   ``I am unaware of another police operation that has ever pulled
together so many law enforcement agencies worldwide to effect
simultaneous raids and arrests,'' said Bob Packham, deputy director
general of the National Crime Squad.
	   In Britain, police arrested 11 men in a raid on 14 addresses.
The federal crime office in Wiesbaden, Germany, said investigators
raided the apartments of 18 suspects. In Sweden, police said one
man was arrested. In the United States, police raided 32 addresses.
	   Other details were not immediately available.
	   Detective Superintendent John Stewardson, who led the operation,
said children had been abused on a massive scale to produce
material to feed the international ring.
	   ``The content would turn the stomach of any right-minded person.
It's really disgusting,'' he said.
	   Police said they would now attempt to trace some of the children
in the pictures.
	   The pornographic ring originated in the United States, but the
investigation began earlier this year when Sussex police in
southeast England discovered pedophiles downloading child
pornography from the Internet, authorities said.

As flood threat recedes, China worries about killer diseases
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Red Cross appeal in graf 11; TRIMS throughout. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ With the Yangtze River's latest flood crest
weakening Wednesday, Chinese officials warned that diseases
threatened crowded refugee camps. Deadly typhoid fever already has
broken out in the flooded northeast.
	   Dikes protecting major cities were holding, but the surge this
week from rain-swollen upper Yangtze River tributaries would likely
keep floodwaters high for weeks, state media reported.
	   The heavy flooding in the northeast and in the Yangtze basin
this summer has killed more than 3,000 people nationwide and left
millions homeless, according to government statistics.
	   Along the Yangtze, China's longest river, the floods are the
worst since 1954, when 30,000 people died _ about 90 percent of
them from contagious diseases after floodwaters receded.
	   Health officials are closely monitoring diseases and have not
reported any epidemics, the China Daily on Wednesday quoted Wang
Zhao, the Ministry of Health official in charge of disease control,
as saying.
	   Conditions along the Yangtze are ripe for diseases to spread.
The weather is still hot, flood victims and livestock are crowded
together in refugee camps, and drinking water is limited.
	   Intestinal diseases are spreading in flooded areas along the
Yangtze, and to a lesser extent in the northeast, Wang said.
	   The ministry reported a 52 percent jump in cases of infectious
diseases in northeast Heilongjiang province over the same period
last year. Typhoid and dysentery _ which thrive in unsanitary
conditions _ accounted for much of the increase, the state-run
Xinhua News Agency said.
	   There was ``mounting danger from a possible major outbreak of
epidemics'' in the northeast, Xinhua said.
	   But the biggest worry for the million homeless flood victims in
the northeast was frosts expected this month and winter that brings
daily temperatures well below zero.
	   In part because of deteriorating conditions in the north, the
Red Cross appealed Wednesday for an additional dlrs 5.2 million to
provide water purification tablets, medicine, food, and quilts to
two million people, up from more than one million now.
	   Meanwhile, a group of 80 scientists called for the protection of
wetlands as a means of flood control, Xinhua said.
	   Many homes and factories have been built in wetlands along the
Yangtze River that once soaked up floodwaters. The storage capacity
of huge freshwater lakes along the river has dropped by as much as
50 percent because of reclamation and silting, Xinhua reported.
	   Wetlands also have been destroyed along the Nen and Songhua
rivers in the northeast, where flooding as severe as this summer's
is rare, the scientists said.
	   Premier Zhu Rongji, who visited the northeast Tuesday, said
environmental laws were not being enforced. Like other officials in
recent weeks, Zhu said the floods were partly due to rampant
deforestation and the soil erosion and silting of riverbeds it
brings, state media reported.

Georgia takes over full control of Black Sea port of Poti
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TBILISI, Georgia (AP) - Georgian troops have taken over full
control of the port of Poti as part of a plan to replace Russian
troops who now guard the Black Sea nation's borders, a news agency
reported Wednesday.
	   Georgian troop have been exercising complete authority over
ships entering Poti since Monday, the Interfax news agency said.
	   For the past several years, Russian forces have patrolled
Georgia's Black Sea coast, including the stretch claimed by the
breakaway province of Abkhazia. However, Russia has been
withdrawing under a recent agreement.
	   But Russia still maintains peacekeeping troops that separate the
Georgian and Abkhazian forces inland.
	   Abkhazia, a Black Sea province in northwestern Georgia, declared
independence in 1992. Separatists drove out Georgian troops and
ethnic Georgian civilians in a 13-month war.
	   Leaders in Abkhazia oppose the withdrawal of the Russian border
troops, saying the move will strengthen Georgian control over the
region and could intensify the conflict with Georgia.

Iran kicks off unprecedented military drill near Afghan border
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By AFSHIN VALINEJAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Fighter planes bombed imaginary targets and
paratroopers dropped into ``hostile'' territory Wednesday as 70,000
Iranian soldiers began unprecedented military exercises near the
border with Afghanistan.
	   Iran's biggest show of strength in peacetime is apparently
directed against Afghanistan where, according to Tehran, the
Taliban militia is illegally holding 47 Iranians.
	   More than 150 tanks rumbled through the area as Cobra helicopter
gunships hovered overhead at the start of the three-day maneuvers
in Torbat-e Jam in northeastern Khorasan province, Iranian radio
reported.
	   The exercises, by the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps and the
volunteer Basij Resistance Forces, are a ``demonstration of
strength, organization, dynamism and a high coordination,'' the
radio said.
	   The Revolutionary Guard is an elite fighting force of about
120,000 ground, air and navy personnel.
	   Meanwhile, Iran's ambassador to Kazakhstan, Hassan Qashqavi,
said the exercises were spurred by the ``recent political
developments in the region'' and called on the Afghan Taliban to
release the captive Iranians.
	   The official Islamic Republic News Agency said the first phase
of the exercises concluded successfully. Troops were airlifted,
paratroopers landed ``deep inside the hypothetical enemey's
terrain'' and jet fighters attacked enemy troop concentrations in a
600 square kilometer (240 sq. mile) area, IRNA said.
	   On Tuesday, the Guard Corps commander, Maj. Gen. Yahya Rahim
Safavi, said troops and equipment will remain in the area even
after Friday, but it was not clear if all 70,000 soldiers will stay
back.
	   The exercises, named ``Ashura-3'' are the largest this year and
the first near the Afghan border since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
	   Ashura is the holiday marking the martyrdom of Shiite Islam's
most revered figure, Hussein, the grandson of Prophet Mohammed.
	   Iran accuses the Taliban militia, which controls most of
Afghanistan, of detaining 47 Iranians since their capture in the
northern city of Mazar-e-Sharif on Aug. 8. The detainees include 11
diplomats, a journalist and 35 truck drivers.
	   Taliban says it knows nothing about the Iranian diplomats but
acknowledges holding some 30 Iranians it accuses of arming its
opponents.
	   However, on Monday IRNA quoted a close aide to Taliban leader
Mullah Mohammed Omar as saying the diplomats and the journalist
were being held in Kandahar in southern Afghanistan.
	   But adding to the confusion, the British Broadcasting
Corporation quoted Omar as saying Monday the diplomats may have
been killed in a raid on the Iranian Embassy when the Taliban
captured Mazar-e-Sharif.
	   ``Such contradictory and ambiguous remarks are not acceptable to
Iran, and Tehran holds the Taliban responsible for the safety of
the Iranian nationals and diplomats,'' Foreign Ministry spokesman
Mahmoud Mohammadi said Tuesday.
	   On Wednesday, Iran called on the United Nations to send a
mission to Afghanistan to find out the Iranians' fate.
	   Pakistan is widely believed to provide arms and other support to
the Taliban while Iran is suspected of backing the northern-based
opposition to the Taliban.

Strong earthquake hits southern Philippines
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ A strong earthquake with a
preliminary magnitude of 7 shook the southern Philippines on
Wednesday but there were no immediate reports of casualties or
serious damage.
	   Seismologist Robert Tiglao said tsunami warnings were issued
because of the earthquake's shallow depth just 10 kilometers (6
miles) below the ocean. However, no quake-related waves were
reported, he said.
	   The Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology said the
quake struck at 4:38 p.m. (0838 GMT) with its epicenter at sea
about 140 kilometers (88 miles) from Mati in Davao.
	   Mati is 1010 kilometers (650 miles) southeast of Manila.

Some students leave campus protest; riot police deployed
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with bus seen taking students away, 4th graf &QL; 
 &UR; With BC-Myanmar-Suu Kyi Interview

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ Riot police took up positions outside a
university Wednesday during a protest by nearly 500 students, the
biggest show of discontent so far in stepped-up agitation against
Myanmar's military regime.
	   The riot police, equipped with clubs and shields, stood by as
senior teachers negotiated with the students to end the protest at
the Yangon Institute of Technology. Gates to the campus were locked
and the students did not try to reach the streets.
	   A spokesman for the government, in a fax to The Associated Press
in Bangkok, Thailand, said there had been no arrests and that
school authorities were handling the problem.
	   Residents later reported seeing at least one bus take away
students. It was believed they were being taken to their homes
under an agreement. Buses were earlier brought in to clear away
bystanders, some of whom had cheered the students.
	   Traffic police closed roads near the institute, a hotbed of
anti-government sentiment that had been closed since the last wave
of student protests two years ago. It was recently reopened so
students could finally study and take their long-postponed final
exams.
	   Student sources said many grievances were related to crash
courses for the exams, but the government has in the past seen
student unrest as a cover for the pro-democracy opposition.
	   Pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi meanwhile met diplomats at
the residence of U.S. Charge d'Affaires Kent Weidemann, a move that
could antagonize the government, which feels hostile nations are
using her movement to destabilize the country.
	   There were no immediate details on the talks.
	   In a rare interview Tuesday with foreign journalists, Suu Kyi
expressed no disappointment that hit-and-run protests attempted by
students in the past 10 days had not drawn crowds into the streets.
	   ``Considering the amount of repression and the amount of
surveillance to which the students are subjected, the fact that
they managed to get these demonstrations going one after the other
showed a certain amount of organization and resolve,'' she said.
	   Suu Kyi said the government may use force to resolve its latest
confrontation with the opposition, possibly banning her party.
	   ``This government always believes in violence and the use of
force to resolve problems,'' Suu Kyi said. ``They never think of
resolving problems through negotiations, through reasonable give
and take.''
	   A week ago, Suu Kyi was described as dehydrated and severely
weakened after a 13-day roadside standoff against authorities on a
bridge outside the capital. Her doctors wanted to keep her under
observation, but Suu Kyi said Tuesday her health was fine.
	   ``They can observe me while I work,'' joked Suu Kyi, looking
fit.
	   At the home of Tin Oo, vice chairman of her National League for
Democracy, Suu Kyi defended her renewed campaign against the ruling
junta on the 10th anniversary of an uprising against military rule
that was crushed in bloodshed.
	   ``They accuse us of confrontation, but I can't think of anything
more confrontational than putting people in prison simply because
they have expressed a different point of view,'' Suu Kyi said.
	   Suu Kyi, 53, who has spent most of the past decade under house
arrest or close restriction, said that the opposition in Myanmar,
also known as Burma, is more united than at any time since abortive
elections in 1990.
	   Her party overwhelmingly won the elections, but the military,
which has ruled since 1962, refused to honor the result. In the
past few weeks, the NLD has threatened to finally convene the
legislature on its own.
	   The government has responded by threatening long prison terms
and banning the party. Suu Kyi said both were ``quite possible.''
	   The government said in a statement that it had struggled to
bring peace, stability and national unity to the country to lay a
foundation for multi-party democracy some day.

Spanish police arrest suspect in killing of former sect leader

<TEXT>
	   IBIZA, Spain (AP) _ Police on Wednesday arrested a teenager
suspected of killing the leader of a doomsday sect who had been
sentenced to 168 years in jail for sexually abusing boys.
	   Eduardo Gonzalez Arenas, who was released on parole in 1997 for
good behavior after serving six years of his sentence, was stabbed
to death in broad daylight Tuesday.
	   Witnesses told Spanish newspapers the assailant had had a
lengthy argument with Gonzalez, who was 46, as they sat outside an
ice cream parlor in the town of Santa Eulalia on the Mediterranean
island of Ibiza.
	   They said he was a regular at a bar Gonzalez co-owned.
	   A Civil Guard official said police arrested an 18-year-old
suspect before dawn Wednesday on a street in Santa Eulalia.
	   The suspect has a criminal record for repeated instances of
robbery and burglary, and there is no indication he had any link to
the sect, said the official, who asked not be named.
	   Civil Guard frogmen are searching a Mediterranean inlet for the
knife used in the killing.
	   Gonzalez was convicted in 1991 of sexually abusing Madrid boys
aged 11 to 14 whom he had recruited in the late 1980s for a sect he
called Edelweiss.
	   It was named after that mountain flower because the boys were
taken on mountain hikes during which they said they were forced to
have sex with sect leaders, including Gonzalez, and with each
other.
	   Some said they'd been brainwashed into keeping quiet about it.
	   When Gonzalez and 10 other defendants went on trial in 1991,
some of the boys testified that Gonzalez portrayed himself as an
alien who would lead sect members to salvation on another planet
when the world came to an end. He had said this would happen in
1992 with a nuclear cataclysm.
	   Two other sect leaders were sentenced to 65 years in jail.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Hillary Clinton traded anecdotes and compliments
with Russian women on Wednesday and pledged American support for
programs she said were designed to ease their plight.
	   ``The United States wants to do all it can to make sure that
Russia and Russia's children have the future you deserve,'' Mrs.
Clinton said.
	   In one of her few solo appearances during the two-day summit,
Mrs. Clinton took part in a panel discussion sponsored by the
Russian edition of Good Housekeeping magazine and listened to women
tell their stories of overcoming hardships.
	   ``In effect, women are holding down two full-time jobs _ one
they get paid for and one they do for love,'' Mrs. Clinton said.
	   She told them that many women in America and elsewhere face the
same dual burden and earned a hearty round of applause by calling
for a one-day ``global work stoppage inside the home'' to
demonstrate the importance of women's domestic work.
	   She also pledged several million dollars in U.S. financial
support for three projects addressing womens' issues: training for
lawyers and judges about issues of domestic violence;
non-governmental exchanges; and economic education through a
partnership with Junior Achievement Russia.
	   She and Mrs. Yeltsin also fielded queries about their personal
lives, including a question about how well they work with their
husbands, especially at home.
	   If the question was an oblique reference to the Clintons'
troubles over the Monica Lewinsky case, Mrs. Clinton ignored it in
her answer.
	   ``We talk constantly together about many issues we both care
about,'' she said. ``Of course, considering the position he is in,
the final decision is his.''
	   For her part, Mrs. Yeltsin scoffed at news reports suggesting
that her daughter Tatyana is a powerful, behind-the-scenes
influence on her father.
	   ``Never in life has he listened either to his wife or to his
daughter,'' Mrs. Yeltsin said. ``When I hear this I just laugh.''
	   At a tea reception following the panel, many members of the
audience praised Mrs. Clinton's elegance and intelligence and said
they would never have asked about any personal troubles with her
husband. Some denounced the American media for hounding her over
the Lewinsky affair.
	   ``It's disgusting,'' said Yelena Yershova, a political
scientist, who said she had watched the Lewinsky coverage on CNN.
``It's utterly shameful for a civilized country that claims to
value privacy.''

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ A strong earthquake with a
preliminary magnitude of 7.3 shook the southern Philippines
Wednesday, sending panicked residents fleeing from buildings. There
were no immediate reports of serious injuries or damage.
	   Tsunami warnings were issued because of the earthquake's shallow
depth, just 10 kilometers (6 miles) below the ocean. However, no
quake-related waves were reported, seismologist Robert Tiglao said.
	   The quake was centered at sea about 140 kilometers (88 miles)
from Mati in Davao province and hit at 4:38 p.m. (0838 GMT), the
Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology said.
	   Mati is about 1,010 kilometers (630 miles) southeast of Manila.
	   The earthquake was felt in at least 10 provinces, seismologists
said.
	   In General Santos city, government and private employees ran out
of their offices but soon returned.
	   ``Everybody was scampering for safety and there was panic
everywhere,'' said Eva Baliao, a city hall employee.
	   In Davao City, some students suffered slight injuries as they
rushed out of the six-story University of the Immaculate Conception
building. Classes resumed half an hour later.
	   The Office of Civil Defense said it put provincial units on
alert because of the strength of the earthquake, but had received
no immediate reports of deaths or serious damage.
	   Seismologists said the quake was caused by a movement of the
Philippine fault zone.
	   A magnitude 7 earthquake is considered a major earthquake and
can cause massive destruction if it hits a highly populated area.
In 1990, an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.7 struck the northern
Philippines, killing at least 2,000 people.
	   The Philippines is located in one of the most earthquake-prone
regions in the world.

Iraq says suspension of reviews is meaningless
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MARIAM SAMI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq on Wednesday dismissed as
``meaningless'' U.S.-British attempts to suspend regular reviews of
U.N. economic sanctions on the country.
	   Any attempts to do so would only force Iraq to ``protect its
interests and security and take other strict measures,'' said a
statement by Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz.
	   It was Iraq's first official reaction to efforts by Britain and
the United States to have suspended the 60-day reviews of the
sanctions. In the absence of the reevaluations, Iraq's chances of
getting the sanctions lifted will become even less.
	   The review suspension is aimed at forcing Iraq to resume
cooperation with the United Nations Special Commissions'
disarmament inspectors. Iraq suspended cooperation Aug. 5, accusing
the inspectors of being biased and spies for the United States.
	   ``Halting the reviews ... is meaningless to Iraq, except that it
establishes the fact that there is no need to continue cooperating
with UNSCOM,'' Aziz said.
	   ``If anyone thinks Iraq will back down from its Aug. 5 decision
under these pressures or threats, or whatever else, they are
disillusioned,'' he said.
	   UNSCOM is responsible for identifying and eliminating the mass
destruction weapons Iraq is suspected of stashing. Until the
inspectors give Iraq a clean bill of health the Security Council
will not lift the sanctions imposed after its 1990 invasion of
Kuwait.
	   U.S. officials say they hope the Security Council will soon
adopt the draft on suspending the review.
	   If that happens, it will mean the Council ``continues its
negative stand of Iraq's legitimate right to lift the sanctions and
this is something that cannot be ignored,'' Aziz said.
	   The sanctions prevent Iraq from selling oil _ the mainstay of
its economy _ in the open market. In the past, Iraq has threatened
unspecified measures if the sanctions were not lifted immediately.

Press baron Lord Rothermere dies at 73
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With AP Photo LON102 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Lord Rothermere, the last of the great English
press barons who built his family firm into a multimillion-pound
(dollar) media empire, has died, his office said Wednesday. He was
73.
	   The third Viscount Rothermere, scion of a newspaper dynasty
founded by his father and his uncle, died Tuesday night of a heart
attack at St. Thomas's Hospital in London, his Daily Mail and
General Holdings company said in a statement.
	   Rothermere, who owned the Daily Mail, the Mail on Sunday and
London's Evening Standard, dominated the press world for more than
30 years.
	   In 1971, he made Fleet Street history by relaunching the ailing
broadsheet Daily Mail as a tabloid and turning it into a
mass-selling read for the middle market, particularly the growing
number of young career women. Eleven years later, he launched the
Mail on Sunday.
	   Today, the Rothermere empire also encompasses the second-largest
portfolio of regional newspapers in Britain, magazines and
investments ranging from specialist financial publications to the
annual Daily Mail Ideal Home Exhibition.
	   But he once said he would like to be remembered ``as a man who
helped to bring back an appreciation that good journalism could
succeed.''
	   Vere Harold Esmond Harmsworth was born on Aug. 27, 1925, the son
of the second Viscount Rothermere.
	   Schooled at Eton, he went straight into newspapers, starting
with three years at a Canadian paper mill, where he learned how
newsprint was produced.
	   In 1951, he joined his family firm, Associated Newspapers, where
he worked in every department.
	   The company had been formed in 1896, when his father, Harold
Harmworth, and his uncle, Alfred Harmsworth, later Lord
Northcliffe, launched the Daily Mail for Britain's growing
middle-class readership.
	   When Lord Northcliffe died without producing children, Harold
Harmsworth assumed control of the empire.
	   Vere Harmsworth took control of Associated Newspapers from his
father in 1971, when one of its titles, the Daily Sketch, was in
decline.
	   In a daring but ultimately successful move, he closed the Daily
Sketch and made its editor, David English, editor of the Daily
Mail. Together, they turned the newspaper into a vivid,
strong-minded tabloid. English died earlier this year.
	   Under Rothermere, Associated Newspapers saw its annual sales
rise from 58 million pounds (then dlrs 87 million) to more than 1
billion pounds (dlrs 1.6 billion).
	   The Daily Mail won its circulation war with the traditionally
popular Daily Express and ran off Robert Maxwell's London Daily
News.
	   Lord Hollick, publisher of the Express, said Wednesday that
Rothermere ``was the quintessential proprietor, passionate for his
papers, robust in his views and commercially courageous,'' who
``inspired the revolution in mid-market papers in the last 20
years.''
	   A tall, ebullient man, Rothermere was the only product of
Britain's great publishing clans _ including the Beaverbrooks,
Astors and Hartwells _ to retain control of the family business.
	   Always an independent thinker, he surprised many in May 1997
when he quit the Conservative Party benches in the House of Lords
for Labor, which had just taken power in a landslide election
victory. He said then that the new government of Tony Blair ``seems
to me set to do great things.''
	   A devotee of Zen Buddism, Rothermere lived in France to escape
British taxes.
	   Rothermere's first wife, the actress Patricia ``Bubbles''
Brooks, died in 1992. He is survived by his second wife, Maiko, and
his son, Johnathan, 30, who takes over at Associated Newspapers,
two daughters and a step-daughter, all from his first marriage.
	   Funeral details were not immediately available.

Russian lawmakers call for compromise candidate for prime minister

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Communists urged President Boris Yeltsin on
Wednesday to come up with a new, compromise choice for prime
minister, and other lawmakers called on the current candidate to
step aside.
	   Yeltsin, however, has given no sign that he will heed the
request, and another showdown is expected Friday when parliament
plans to vote for a second time on the position.
	   The State Duma, the lower house of parliament, overwhelmingly
rejected acting Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin on Monday,
saying he was incapable of leading the country out of its worst
economic crisis since the Soviet era.
	   ``Funerals, killings and catastrophes have become the main
content of Russian life,'' lawmakers said in a draft statement
explaining why they rejected Chernomyrdin. ``By turning
Chernomyrdin down, we voted no confidence in the president and
urged him to resign.''
	   The Duma also gave tentative approval to a letter appealing to
Chernomyrdin to voluntarily step aside.
	   ``Your voluntary refusal to take the post of prime minister may
seriously help to ease tension and help the search for a
compromise,'' the letter said.
	   But Chernomyrdin gave no indication that he would step aside.
Russian news agencies said he nominated some ministers for his
proposed new government in a letter to Yeltsin on Tuesday. The
names were not immediately available.
	   Yeltsin insists he won't give up Chernomyrdin as his nominee
despite the risk of continued political and economic uncertainty if
his strategy fails.
	   Under the Russian Constitution, the president can present his
candidate for prime minister three times. If lawmakers reject
Yeltsin's choice all three times, the president must dissolve the
Duma and call new parliamentary elections within three months.
	   Yeltsin would then rule by decree, and with an interim
government, until the new parliament is seated.
	   Communists and their hard-line allies say that Chernomyrdin's
prospects for winning approval are dim, and they have criticized
Yeltsin's handling of the crisis.
	   But ultranationalist leader Vladimir Zhirinovsky indicated
Wednesday that his party, which abstained in Monday's vote, would
support Chernomyrdin as the candidate best able to pull the economy
out of its tailspin.
	   ``It would be easier for him to continue the surgery since he
has just come out of the operation room,'' Zhirinovsky told
reporters, referring to Chernomyrdin's five-year stint as prime
minister before his surprise firing in March.
	   Zhirinovsky's Liberal Democratic Party is the third largest in
parliament's lower house with 50 members.
	   Former national security adviser Alexander Lebed said dissolving
parliament would be political suicide for Yeltsin.
	   ``Hatred for the present power has taken root in the Russian
provinces,'' said Lebed, who now is governor of the Krasnoyarsk
region of Siberia.
	   ``Therefore if the president decided to dissolve the Duma, he
will commit political hari-kari,'' he told the Interfax news
agency.
	   Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov called on both houses of
parliament to come up with a new candidate for Yeltsin to propose.
Zyuganov offered no names, but has previously suggested Moscow
Mayor Yuri Luzhkov, former Soviet bureaucrat Yuri Maslyukov and
several regional governors.
	   Before he and other top politicians met privately with Clinton,
Zyuganov issued another apocalyptic warning about the consequences
of not moving swiftly to form a new government.
	   ``The Kremlin is half-dead, the government is paralyzed, and we
are on the verge of a paralysis of legislative power as well,'' he
told reporters. ``A lack of government would inevitably lead to
bandits and criminals taking over power in the country.''
	   Yeltsin nominated Chernomyrdin last week, just five months after
replacing him with the young Sergei Kiriyenko. Yeltsin dismissed
Kiriyenko on Aug. 23.
	   The Russian media has speculated that magnate Boris Berezovsky,
a powerful banker who is well-connected in the Kremlin, helped
persuade Yeltsin to dump Kiriyenko when he started to get tough on
banks.
	   Berezovsky told Echo Moscow radio Wednesday that Yeltsin might
resign to clear the way for new leadership, but the president has
adamantly denied that he will quit before his term expires in the
year 2000.

	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Several prominent socialists _
including ex-NATO chief Willy Claes _ went on trial Wednesday
accused of taking millions of dollars in bribes stemming from two
defense contracts Belgium awarded in the late 1980s.
	   Claes, 59, a former economics minister, ex-defense minister Guy
Coeme, 52, ex-deputy premier Guy Spitaels, 67, and nine others deny
the charges.
	   They arrived at Brussels' main courthouse where, shielded by
police, they pushed their way through hundreds of reporters, camera
crews and photographers.
	   Prosecutors allege Italy's Agusta SpA paid 51 million francs
(dlrs 1.37 million) to win a December, 1988, contract to build 46
army helicopters. They also say France's Dassault Aviation SA paid
a bribe of 60 million francs (dlrs 1.62 million) to win a June,
1989, deal to equip Belgian F-16 jets with new electronics.
	   The two contracts were worth hundreds of millions of dollars
each.
	   Serge Dassault, 73, of Dassault Aviation is also a defendant. He
got to the court house hours before the start of the trial. Charges
have been dropped against ex-Agusta executive Raffaelo Teti who
died Aug. 22, aged 72, of a heart attack.
	   At the opening session, prosecutor Eliane Liekendael listed the
allegations against the defendants in detail. The trial then bogged
down in preocedural haggling. One defendant _ ex-Claes aide Johan
Delanghe, 53, _ demanded his lawyer be allowed to speak in Dutch
though French has been selected as the trial language. The court
reserved a decision.

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan ended all charter flights to and from North
Korea Wednesday in retaliation for the missile it sent sailing over
Japan and into the Pacific Ocean.
	   The decision affects nine cargo flights from North Korea to
Japan and 14 other flights that were still up for approval, said
Transport Ministry official Eiichiro Oishi.
	   Tokyo has already decided to drop further talks to establish
diplomatic ties with North Korea to protest Monday's test launch.
It has ruled out additional food aid and suspended work on an
international project to build nuclear reactors there.
	   ``We must make North Korea understand that this kind of action
will be costly,'' Foreign Minister Masahiko Komura said.
	   Japan also plans to file a protest in the United Nations, both
in the Security Council and the General Assembly, officials said.
	   Also Wednesday, North Korea commented on the missile for the
first time.
	   ``We bitterly denounce Japan for making a fuss over the matter
that belongs to our sovereignty while being unaware of its
background,'' the North's official Korean Central News Agency said.
``Japan's behavior is ridiculous.''
	   The missile launch, which has shaken Japan and heightened fears
about Asian security, has also brought the Japanese government
under scrutiny for what some see as an overly slow, fumbling
response to crisis.
	   The Defense Agency acknowledged Wednesday that it waited more
than eight hours before disclosing to the public that the missile
had landed not in the Sea of Japan, as initially reported, but in
the Pacific Ocean, just some 500 kilometers (300 miles) off the
eastern coast of Japan.
	   The first news of the missile came from the U.S. military at
about noon (0300 GMT) Monday. Japan, which has no independent
missile-monitoring system, did not know about the firing until it
received word from U.S. forces.
	   The original report said the missile _ believed to be a test of
the new Taepo Dong 1 missile _ had landed in the Sea of Japan,
about midway between Russia and the western coast of Japan.
	   Three hours later, the Defense Agency learned from the U.S.
military and its own forces that the missile had landed in the
Pacific, said agency spokesman Tatsuhiko Fukui. But it waited until
after 11 p.m. (1400 GMT) to hold a news conference to announce
that.
	   The fact that the missile had landed in the Pacific was critical
because it proved North Korea has the capability to strike any part
of Japan, including U.S. bases that house some 50,000 troops.
	   When North Korea fired its last missile five years ago, it
reached only as far as the Sea of Japan.
	   Fukui, the agency official, said Monday's missile appeared to be
two-stage, with the booster, or first stage, falling into the Sea
of Japan. The second stage landed in the Pacific, with the warhead
falling nearby, he said.
	   ``We did not want to unnecessarily fan the fears of the public.
We wanted to wait on the announcement until we were more certain of
the facts,'' Fukui said. ``We do not think we were too slow. We
don't want to cry wolf.''
	   But others were more critical.
	   ``Crisis management gets nowhere,'' said the headline of
Wednesday's national Mainichi newspaper. TBS TV commentator Tetsuya
Chikushi accused the government of taking a condescending view
toward ordinary people and withholding information.
	   ``Nothing is working to respond to the crisis. I don't feel
safe,'' said Kazunobu Imura, a 46-year-old owner of a health food
store.
	   ``The system doesn't seem to be functioning,'' said Takashi
Suzuki, a 32-year-old temporary worker. ``We want to know more.''
	   Charges of shoddy crisis management are not new to Tokyo. Japan
came under fire for moving too slowly after the 1995 Kobe
earthquake that killed more than 6,000 people.
	   More recently, it has been labeled a procrastinator in
implementing economic reforms to wrest the nation out of a
recession.
	   The Defense Agency gave up its search for fallen missile parts
late Wednesday. Three military ships and two planes were sent early
Tuesday to the Pacific and one ship to the Sea of Japan to try to
find pieces of the missile.
	   In Moscow, Russian officials said they had asked Pyongyang for
an explanation of the missile-firing.
	   ``It is our principled stance that we want a normal, neighborly
relationship with North Korea,'' Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman
Vladimir Rakhmanin told the Interfax news agency on Wednesday.

Mir cosmonauts start preparations for trip into damaged module
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian cosmonauts on the Mir space station
started preparations Wednesday for a walk into the airless Spektr
module, damaged in a collision a year ago, space officials said.
	   Flight commander Sergei Avdeyev and engineer Gennady Padalka are
planning to venture into the Spektr on Sept. 15 to repair the
engines that keep its solar batteries oriented toward the sun,
Mission Control Center said.
	   The Spektr's solar batteries were damaged in a cargo ship
collision in June 1997, which punctured the module and left it
without air. The Mir's cosmonauts have since fixed two of the
module's four solar panels.
	   But cable connections between the panels and the system that
points them to the sun have recently come loose and need to be
readjusted, according to Mission Control spokesman Valery Lyndin
said.
	   Another solar battery on the Spektr is damaged beyond repair,
and the fourth is functional but not wired to the rest of the
station. The Mir has six other operational solar panels that supply
sufficient power.
	   On Wednesday, Avdeyev and Padalka were expected to install
equipment in the airlock leading to the Spektr. They would also be
examining the oxygen and heating units of their spacesuits, Mission
Control said.

English players face international ban for playing Super League
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ English soccer players and Premier League clubs
face international and domestic bans if they join an unsanctioned
European Super League, England's Football Association said
Wednesday.
	   FA chairman Keith Wiseman issued the warning on the eve of a
meeting in London Thursday of all Premier League clubs to discuss
the proposals by Milan-based Media Partners for a new European
competition.
	   Wiseman said English players involved in the breakaway league
could be banned from international competition, while Premier
League clubs which joined the Super League would be banned from all
domestic competitions.
	   ``I have every reason to believe the clubs will reach
accommodation with UEFA and the FA over the next couple of weeks,''
Wiseman said on BBC radio Wednesday.
	   ``But I think the point that those seeking the breakaway have
not taken account of is they are talking about playing unsanctioned
football entirely outside the jurisdiction of the whole football
body.
	   ``I think it logically follows from that, that they are not able
to play inside it as well.''
	   Wiseman said he was confident Premier League clubs would reject
the Super League in favor of UEFA's plan to expand its European
tournaments.
	   He predicted a Europe League would be created within a few years
under the proper structure of the game and after consultation with
the major domestic leagues.
	   The Media Partners proposal is for a two-tier 32 team
competition, with the 16 leading European clubs playing mid-week
home and away matches in a European Super League competition.
	   The Super League proposal promises clubs a massive pay deal
funded through television rights.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with surgery completed

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Interior Minister Jean-Pierre Chevenement underwent
surgery Wednesday for an undisclosed condition, officials said.
	   The 59-year-old leftist minister, in charge of the nation's
police and security forces, ``underwent a benign operation, planned
long in advance,'' said Daniel Vaillant, vice-minister for
parliamentary relations.
	   Vaillant, speaking to reporters after the weekly Council of
Ministers meeting, declined to elaborate on Chevenement's condition
but said that the minister planned to attend the ministers' meeting
next Wednesday.
	   Chevenement underwent the surgery at Val-de-Grace military
hospital, where he was admitted Tuesday night, officials said.
	   Chevenement did not appear ill before he was hospitalized, and
he held meetings on schedule Tuesday before entering Val-de-Grace.
He was scheduled to leave the hospital early next week.
	   Chevenement held a number of other ministry portfolios during
his political career, including defense, industry, education.
	   After three years as defense minister, he resigned in 1991 to
protest France's involvement in the U.S.-led Gulf War coalition
against Iraq.

 &UR; Mrs. Clinton trades stories with Russian women, offers sympathy and

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Hillary Clinton traded anecdotes and compliments
with Russian women on Wednesday and pledged American support for
programs she said were designed to ease their plight.
	   ``The United States wants to do all it can to make sure that
Russia and Russia's children have the future you deserve,'' Mrs.
Clinton said.
	   In one of her few solo appearances during the two-day summit,
Mrs. Clinton took part in a panel discussion sponsored by the
Russian edition of Good Housekeeping magazine and listened to women
tell their stories of overcoming hardships.
	   ``In effect, women are holding down two full-time jobs _ one
they get paid for and one they do for love,'' Mrs. Clinton said.
	   She told them that many women in America and elsewhere face the
same dual burden and earned a hearty round of applause by calling
for a one-day ``global work stoppage inside the home'' to
demonstrate the importance of women's domestic work.
	   She also pledged several million dollars in U.S. financial
support for three projects addressing womens' issues: training for
lawyers and judges about issues of domestic violence;
non-governmental exchanges; and economic education through a
partnership with Junior Achievement Russia.
	   She and Mrs. Yeltsin also fielded queries about their personal
lives, including a question about how well they work with their
husbands, especially at home.
	   If the question was an oblique reference to the Clintons'
troubles over the Monica Lewinsky case, Mrs. Clinton ignored it in
her answer.
	   ``We talk constantly together about many issues we both care
about,'' she said. ``Of course, considering the position he is in,
the final decision is his.''
	   For her part, Mrs. Yeltsin scoffed at news reports suggesting
that her daughter Tatyana is a powerful, behind-the-scenes
influence on her father.
	   ``Never in life has he listened either to his wife or to his
daughter,'' Mrs. Yeltsin said. ``When I hear this I just laugh.''
	   At a tea reception following the panel, many members of the
audience praised Mrs. Clinton's elegance and intelligence and said
they would never have asked about any personal troubles with her
husband. Some denounced the American media for hounding her over
the Lewinsky affair.
	   ``It's disgusting,'' said Yelena Yershova, a political
scientist, who said she had watched the Lewinsky coverage on CNN.
``It's utterly shameful for a civilized country that claims to
value privacy.''

Progress on many fronts as Northern Ireland prepares for Clinton

 &UR; Eds: RECASTS pvs throughout to ADD detail on British and Irish
parliamentary debates on anti-terror bills, Trimble's plans to meet
Adams &QL; 
 &UR; By SHAWN POGATCHNIK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Irish and British lawmakers
gathered in emergency sessions Wednesday to debate whether to enact
anti-terrorist measures against IRA dissidents responsible for last
month's car bomb in the Northern Ireland town of Omagh that killed
28 people.
	   The so-called Real Irish Republican Army planted the bomb as
part of its campaign against April's Northern Ireland peace
agreement.
	   ``The attack on Omagh was not just an indiscriminate attack on
democracy and the Good Friday agreement. It was a reckless attack
on a community, a whole people,'' Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern
told lawmakers convened in Dublin.
	   ``Our first objective must be to do all within our power to
prevent and deter such an atrocity from happening again,'' he said.
	   Ahern and British Prime Minister Tony Blair expect both their
parliaments to approve by Thursday night anti-terror bills
restricting the right to silence for suspected IRA dissidents and
granting more weight to police opinions in securing convictions.
	   Also Wednesday, Britain's governor for Northern Ireland paroled
two British soldiers convicted of murdering a Catholic teen-ager,
the first inmates freed from a Northern Ireland prison in response
to the peace accord.
	   Mo Mowlam ordered immediate freedom for Scots Guardsmen Jim
Fisher, 30, and Mark Wright, 25, after phoning the soldiers'
mothers _ and the mother of the 18-year-old Belfast man they shot
in the back in 1992.
	   In reaching her decision, Mowlam emphasized that the first of
420 convicted members of the IRA and pro-British paramilitary
groups ``engaged in terrorism'' were expected to be freed starting
next Monday, the most controversial aspect of the agreement.
	   ``The Guardsmen were in Northern Ireland as a consequence of
that terrorism and committed the offense while on duty to counter
it,'' Mowlam said in drawing a distinction between their case and
the others.
	   When the British government in 1995 last announced an
exceptional parole for a soldier convicted of murder in Northern
Ireland, it sparked three nights of rioting in many working-class
Catholic areas.
	   But the political landscape has profoundly changed since then.
Even as it contemplates a crackdown on IRA dissidents, the Irish
government has already freed more than a dozen IRA prisoners early
in reward for the outlawed group's July 1997 truce.
	   Nonetheless, relatives of Peter McBride _ shot while running
away from soldiers, who falsely claimed he was about to throw a
homemade grenade _ responded with fury.
	   ``Mo Mowlam told my mammy that they would not be the first two
through the (prison) gate and they were,'' said McBride's sister,
Roisin.
	   The timing of Mowlam's announcement appeared linked to the
imminent arrival of U.S. President Bill Clinton, an event that has
put all sides on their best behavior _ and encouraged key Northern
Ireland politicians to shift their positions.
	   Gerry Adams, leader of the IRA-allied Sinn Fein party, on
Tuesday announced that he wanted politically motivated violence to
be ``a thing of the past, over, done with and gone.''
	   Blair, Ahern and Clinton welcomed the statement as another step
toward a formal renunciation of violence by the IRA.
	   In response, David Trimble, designated to be the Protestant head
of a compromise government envisioned in the peace agreement,
confirmed he would meet Adams along with other Northern Irish party
leaders Monday to discuss the first steps of forming a new
government of Protestants and Catholics.
	   However, Trimble's aides emphasized that a handshake with Adams
_ or Sinn Fein representation in the new administration _ would
remain impossible until the IRA actually committed itself to
disarming under international supervision, a goal contained in the
agreement.

Wall Street recovery primes the pump in Asia and Europe

 &UR; AP Business Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Wall Street's dramatic rebound sent Asian and
European stocks higher Wednesday, but some analysts wondered
whether the rallies were sustainable against a gloomy outlook in
many economies.
	   New York traders were slow to recognize the serious potential
fallout from the financial troubles in Asia and Russia, and
uncertainty might hang on for some time in markets that now lack
any firm sense of direction, said Jeremy Batstone, an analyst at
NatWest Stockbrokers in London.
	   ``Sentiment is finally beginning to crack,'' Batstone said.
``The market is beginning to wake up.''
	   Blue chips were up by about 2 percent or more in early dealings
on the biggest European stock markets _ London, Frankfurt and Paris
_ following rallies in Tokyo, Hong Kong and Singapore.
	   London's Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index had
climbed 109.6 points, or 2.2 percent, to 5,278.7 by midday.
	   But traders remained cautious about the strength of the rallies
that some called a knee-jerk response to Tuesday's gain of 288
points, or 3.8 percent, by the Dow Jones industrial average. That
only partially erased the Dow's loss of 512 points in Monday's
session.
	   Some investors perceived the recent price drops as good
opportunities to buy quality stocks, analysts said, but many
figured the markets are a pretty risky proposition at present.
	   ``The limited volume shows that there isn't a big rally,'' said
Jean-Charles Gand, a trader at Societe Generale Asset Management in
Paris.
	   President Bill Clinton sought to reassure investors as he
mentioned the market turmoil at a joint Moscow news conference with
Russian President Boris Yeltsin.
	   ``The volatility in the world markets, including in our stock
market, I think is to be expected under these circumstances,''
Clinton said. ``The right thing to do is to try to restore growth
in the economies of the world where there isn't enough growth.''

	   Anwar's firing came after weeks of rumors about his sacking or
quitting _ always followed by emphatic denials.
	   The 52-year-old deputy, who was also finance minister and for
years seen as Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's successor, has been
sidelined and left out of economic decisions for months after
differing with his boss on the course for economic recovery.
	   Malaysia's currency, the ringgit, and the markets have plummeted
since the Asian economic crisis broke out in July 1997. The
Southeast Asian country's economy, which boasted 8 percent growth
for last decade, formally went into recession last week after its
economy shrank another 6.8 percent.

Italian government denies violating church-state accords in probe
</HEADLINE>
of cardinal &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ The Italian government on Wednesday responded to
Vatican complaints about a loan-sharking investigation involving a
cardinal, reportedly denying any violation of church-state accords.
	   In a meeting with Italy's ambassador to the Holy See last week,
the Vatican's foreign minister criticized investigators for their
handling of the probe involving Naples Cardinal Michele Giordano.
	   The Vatican was said to feel that investigators had violated
long-standing church-state accords by tapping the cardinal's
telephone, searching his office, failing to inform his superiors of
the investigation and by making a spectacle of the probe.
	   Italy's ambassador to the Vatican, Alberto Leoncini Bartoli,
delivered the government's response Wednesday following a meeting
between Premier Romano Prodi and his justice and foreign ministers
late Tuesday.
	   No details of the response were released, but Italian news
reports said it contained a denial by the government that it had
violated church-state accords. The Vatican said in a statement that
it was evaluating the response.
	   Prosecutors are investigating whether Giordano gave his brother,
who was arrested Aug. 20 in a massive loan-sharking scheme, money
for the illegal loans.
	   Giordano, known for his denunciations of usury, has denied
wrongdoing. He says he gave blank checks on his personal account to
his brother, who was having financial problems.

	   Anwar and the central bank had preferred high interest rates and
austerity measures to control Malaysia's sliding currency, the
ringgit. Mahathir and his chief economic aide, Daim Zainuddin, have
pushed through a policy of greater government spending and lower
rates to boost the economy.
	   Although Mahathir has never openly blamed his finance minister
for the economic mess, he openly said tight monetary policies were
not going to deliver recovery.
	   On Tuesday, when Mahathir and central bank officials announced
sweeping currency exchange controls, Anwar was nowhere to be seen.
	   Although Mahathir said Anwar was present at the meetings to
discuss the measures, the finance minister was not around to
comment, fueling speculation that he was not party to the
controversial currency controls.

Police target dozens of suspected pedophiles in 12-country raids
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES to add details about French and German arrests, and
further raids planned in additional countries &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Police in 12 countries raided the homes of more
than 100 suspected pedophiles Wednesday in what authorities called
one of the largest efforts ever to break an Internet child
pornography ring.
	   The British National Crime Squad coordinated the early morning
raids as part of a five-month investigation into the so-called
Wonderland club, which authorities said exchanged pornographic
pictures of children as young as 2 on the Internet.
	   During the investigation, code-named ``Cathedral,'' police said
they found a database containing more than 100,000 pornographic
photographs of naked boys and girls and confiscated computers and
computer programs from dozens of suspects.
	   Police said they targeted 180 suspects and arrested more than
100 in the raids, which took place at 0400 GMT on three continents
_ in Australia, Austria, Belgium, Britain, Finland, France,
Germany, Italy, Norway, Portugal, Sweden and the United States.
	   ``I am unaware of another police operation that has ever pulled
together so many law enforcement agencies worldwide to effect
simultaneous raids and arrests,'' said Bob Packham, deputy director
general of the National Crime Squad.
	   In Britain, police arrested 11 men in a raid on 14 addresses,
and 23 addresses were raided in the United States. One man was
arrested in Sweden, and French police arrested four people after
raids in Roubaix, Strasbourg, Toulouse and Lille.
	   The federal crime office in Wiesbaden, Germany, said
investigators arrested three suspects _ in Stuttgart in southern
Germany, near Kassel in central Germany and in the eastern town of
Freiberg.
	   Police said as many as 10 other countries were planning
additional raids in connection with the ring.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Hillary Clinton traded anecdotes and compliments
with Russian women on Wednesday and pledged American support for
programs she said were designed to ease their plight.
	   ``The United States wants to do all it can to make sure that
Russia and Russia's children have the future you deserve,'' Mrs.
Clinton said.
	   In one of her few solo appearances during the two-day summit,
Mrs. Clinton took part in a panel discussion sponsored by the
Russian edition of Good Housekeeping magazine and listened to women
tell their stories of overcoming hardships.
	   ``In effect, women are holding down two full-time jobs _ one
they get paid for and one they do for love,'' Mrs. Clinton said.
	   She told them that many women in America and elsewhere face the
same dual burden and earned a hearty round of applause by calling
for a one-day ``global work stoppage inside the home'' to
demonstrate the importance of women's domestic work.
	   She also pledged several million dollars in U.S. financial
support for three projects addressing womens' issues: training for
lawyers and judges about issues of domestic violence;
non-governmental exchanges; and economic education through a
partnership with Junior Achievement Russia.
	   She and Mrs. Yeltsin also fielded queries about their personal
lives, including a question about how well they work with their
husbands, especially at home.
	   If the question was an oblique reference to the Clintons'
troubles over the Monica Lewinsky case, Mrs. Clinton ignored it in
her answer.
	   ``We talk constantly together about many issues we both care
about,'' she said. ``Of course, considering the position he is in,
the final decision is his.''
	   For her part, Mrs. Yeltsin scoffed at news reports suggesting
that her daughter Tatyana is a powerful, behind-the-scenes
influence on her father.
	   ``Never in life has he listened either to his wife or to his
daughter,'' Mrs. Yeltsin said. ``When I hear this I just laugh.''
	   At a tea reception following the panel, many members of the
audience praised Mrs. Clinton's elegance and intelligence and said
they would never have asked about any personal troubles with her
husband. Some denounced the American media for hounding her over
the Lewinsky affair.
	   ``It's disgusting,'' said Yelena Yershova, a political
scientist, who said she had watched the Lewinsky coverage on CNN.
``It's utterly shameful for a civilized country that claims to
value privacy.''

	   In July, Anwar was seen as being in the forefront of a campaign
for political reform when the governing United Malays National
Organization held its annual convention in July. Mahathir
immediately crushed the campaign against nepotism and cronyism at
high government levels.
	   In recent weeks, Anwar has been embarrassed by accusations of
sexual misconduct contained in a book, ``50 Reasons Why Anwar
Shouldn't Be Prime Minister.'' The authors are being tried in a
court for defamation. But the trial could also rake up more
controversy about Anwar's personal life.
	   Some political observers saw the book as a part of a campaign to
humiliate Anwar and push him to resign.
	   Last month, Mahathir made a shakeup in the top editorial
positions of two leading newspapers and a television station.
Analysts said the changes were to remove people perceived as close
to the deputy prime minister.
	   The first real indication of Anwar's sacking may have been
contained in Mahathir's comments on Tuesday.
	   ``If he gives a good reason why he wants to resign, I have to
accept,'' Mahathir said.
	   ``There is no truth until it becomes a truth,'' he told
reporters who asked him whether the office of the finance minister
had fallen vacant.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Communists urged President Boris Yeltsin on
Wednesday to come up with a new, compromise choice for prime
minister, and other lawmakers called on the current candidate to
step aside.
	   Yeltsin, however, has given no sign that he will heed the
request, and another showdown is expected on Friday when parliament
plans to vote for a second time on the position.
	   The State Duma, the lower house of parliament, overwhelmingly
rejected acting Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin on Monday,
saying he was incapable of leading the country out of its worst
economic crisis since the Soviet era.
	   ``Funerals, killings and catastrophes have become the main
content of Russian life,'' lawmakers said in a draft statement
explaining why they rejected Chernomyrdin. ``By turning
Chernomyrdin down, we voted no confidence in the president and
urged him to resign.''
	   The Duma also gave tentative approval to a letter appealing to
Chernomyrdin to ask Yeltsin not to nominate him again.
	   ``Your voluntary refusal to take the post of prime minister may
seriously help to ease tension and help the search for a
compromise,'' they said.
	   But Chernomyrdin showed no sign of withdrawing. As promised
earlier this week, he proposed some ministers for his acting
government and Yeltsin immediately approved them by decree
Wednesday, the Kremlin said.
	   The newly approved ministers, all holdovers from the last
government, are Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov, Defense Minister
Igor Sergeyev, Interior Minister Sergei Stepashin, tax chief Boris
Fyodorov, Justice Minister Pavel Krashennikov and Emergency
Situations Minister Sergei Shoigu.

Turkey urges Greek Cypriots to reconsider confederation proposal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Turkey urged the Greek Cypriots on
Wednesday to reconsider its offer of a two-state confederation on
the divided island as a way to restart deadlocked unification
talks.
	   Greek Cypriot and Greek leaders rejected the idea as a ploy to
legitimize the island's partition and gain recognition for the
breakaway Turkish Cypriot state.
	   ``Those who don't give the proposal the proper consideration it
deserves, will be sorry for losing such an opportunity,'' said
Turkish Foreign Ministry spokesman Necati Utkan.
	   Cyprus has been divided into Greek and Turkish sectors since
Turkey invaded in 1974 following a short-lived coup by supporters
of union with Greece. United Nations efforts to reunite the island
have stalled.
	   The breakaway state in the north is recognized only by Turkey,
which maintains 35,000 troops there.
	   On Monday, Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash proposed a
confederation of the two states, with international recognition for
the Turkish side.

	   MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) _ Relations between Bahrain and Iran have
become normal and the two countries will soon exchange ambassadors,
government-controlled newspaper quoted the foreign minister as
saying Wednesday.
	   The Gulf Daily News and others quoted the minister, Sheik
Mohammed bin Mubarak Al Khalifa as saying that ties improved
following the unscheduled visit by Iran's former president, Ali
Rafsanjani, to Bahrain in March.
	   The newspapers did not say when the envoys will be named.
	   Sheik Mohammed made the comments in Durban, South Africa, where
he is heading Bahrain's delegation to a Nonaligned Movement summit,
the newspapers said.
	   Ties between the two countries were strained in July 1996 when
Bahrain accused Iran of orchestrating a coup plot by Shiite Muslims
to topple the island's ruling family, a member of the mainstream
Sunni sect of Islam.
	   Bahrain recalled its ambassador in protest, and Iran did the
same while denying a hand in the alleged plot.
	   Both had agreed during a visit last November by Iranian Foreign
Minister Kamal Kharrazi to exchange ambassadors but Sheik Mohammed
had cautioned at the time that obstacles remain in the way of
restoring full normalcy.
	   Iran, the world's only Shiite-governed nation, styles itself as
the protector of the sect the world over.
	   In Bahrain, Shiites form a slight majority among the island's
400,000 people. Shiites have been waging a campaign of violence
since December 1994 for political and social reforms. More than 40
people have been reportedly killed in the unrest.

Thai central bank reorganizes for more efficiency, responsibility
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's central bank on Wednesday
announced a major reorganization of its departments responsible for
examination and regulation of financial institutions.
	   Instead of dividing tasks by sector, examination and regulation
will be undertaken by 14 separate units with responsibility for
groups of specific companies.
	   Each unit will look at specific Thai commercial banks along with
finance companies, home-loan credit foncier companies _ finance
firms which supply mortgages _ and foreign institutions.
	   Bank of Thailand Governor Chatu Mongol Sonakul said at a news
conference that finance and credit foncier companies which are
subsidiaries of Thai commercial banks have been put in the same
group as their parent banks to allow thorough examination and
regulation of related companies.
	   Previously, examination of banks was separated from that of
financial and credit foncier companies.
	   The central bank had been criticized by a special government
commission earlier this year for contributing to the country's
severe financial crisis through mismanagement and lax regulation.
	   More than half the country's finance companies and several bank
went into virtual bankrupt after an economic downturn last year
exposed a mountain of bad debt on their books.
	   Chatu Mongol said the reorganization allows financial
institutions and the public to know specifically which authorities
examine which financial institutions.
	   ``When problems occur, we will know specifically who is
responsible,'' he said.
	   Chatu Mongol was named governor in May with a mandate to
reorganize the central bank after its former executives were
accused of failing to uncover weaknesses in Thai financial
institutions.

Iran bans book about women's freedoms
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS year in 4th graf to 1989 sted 1981 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran has banned a book about freedoms
granted to women by Islam's Prophet Mohammed, the Tehran Times
daily reported Wednesday.
	   The English-language newspaper said that the Ministry of Culture
and Islamic Guidance banned the book by Seyed Mohsen Saeedzadeh
because it contained ``materials disrespecting the holy Prophet of
Islam.''
	   The author had ``attributed obscene affairs to the holy
Prophet,'' the newspaper. It gave no details about the book or
describe the specific passages that ran afoul of the authorities.
	   Offended for similar reasons, Iran issued a religious edict in
1989 ordering Muslims to seek out and kill the author of ``The
Satanic Verses,'' Salman Rushdie, an Indian-born British writer.
	   ``The Satanic Verses'' had mocked Mohammed's nine wives.
	   According to Islamic texts, Mohammed performed multiple
marriages to strengthen links with other tribes and draw them into
the fold of Islam. He believed that women are equal to men in most
respects.
	   Saeedzadeh, author of the book banned in Iran, could face calls
for harsher punishment by Islamic hard-liners who may not be
satisfied only with the banning of the book.
	   Saeedzadeh was not immediately available for comment.

Once Mahathir's golden boy, Anwar falls from grace
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos available
 &UR; By RANJAN ROY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Once the second-most powerful man
in Malaysia, Anwar Ibrahim saw his political fortunes reduced to
rubble when he appeared to challenge Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad's 17-year leadership.
	   The recent row over monetary policy and sweeping currency
controls between the central bank and Mahathir were only the latest
rifts between Malaysia's two most prominent men.
	   On Wednesday, Mahathir once again showed he would not tolerate
dissent by ignominiously sacking Anwar.
	   As Finance Minister, Anwar strenuously backed Bank Negara's
stand on maintaining tight monetary policy to protect the country's
faltering currency, the ringgit.
	   But after Mahathir blamed that International Monetary Fund-style
policy for Malaysia's dramatic recession, the deputy prime minister
found himself sidelined.
	   In June, Mahathir drafted trusted aide and former finance
minister Daim Zainuddin into the Cabinet as special economics
minister. Daim, who shares Mahathir's distaste for austere
policies, soon made his mark.
	   Government spending was pumped up by 20 percent, and a
succession of interest-rate cuts left Anwar's tight monetary policy
in tatters. When the Bank Negara governor and his deputy quit last
week in opposition to Mahathir's plans to fix the ringgit, the
writing was on the wall.
	   With a fixed currency, Mahathir had no need for his Finance
Minister, whose chief role was increasingly just to reassure
international financial markets.
	   Anwar's fall was as startling as his rise.
	   From a charismatic student leader who spent 22 months in jail
for leading a demonstration by impoverished farmers, Anwar rose to
become heir to Mahathir's office.
	   In university, he co-founded the pro-Islamic Malaysian Muslim
Youth Movement and battled for a wider role for Islam in the
running of the predominantly Muslim country.
	   But as his politics moderated, Anwar quickly rose to power on
the coattails of his longtime mentor, Mahathir.
	   Both Mahathir's United Malays National Organization, the
country's dominant political group since independence from Britain
in 1957, and the main Islamic fundamentalist party wooed the young
populist.
	   Anwar joined Mahathir's party in 1982 and rose quickly to
important Cabinet positions, holding the youth and sports portfolio
until 1984, agriculture for the next two years, education until
1991 and finance from then on.
	   In 1995, he engineered a groundswell of support within the
United Malays National Organization party to win the deputy
leader's office and become the deputy prime minister.
	   But as Malaysia's economy slid into recession in recent months,
Anwar's stock fell as he differed with Mahathir on the course the
Southeast Asian nation should chart toward recovery.
	   The rift between Mahathir and Anwar surfaced openly in June
during the annual convention of the governing party. Many party
leaders saw Anwar's involvement in a campaign for political reform
that was spearheaded by a youth leader.
	   But Mahathir moved quickly, crushing the youth leader and
forcing him to recapitulate and denying that there was any cronyism
and nepotism among the UMNO leadership.

ETA says Spain, France trying to eliminate Basque language
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BILBAO, Spain (AP) _ The armed Basque separatist movement ETA
accused the Spanish government Wednesday of trying to snuff out the
Basque language.
	   The charge came in a statement published in a radical newspaper,
Euskadi Informacion. In the Basque language, known as Euskera,
Euskadi is the word for the Basque country, a region straddling the
border between Spain and France.
	   ETA took issue with ``enemies of Euskera who do not have the
right to live in Euskadi.''
	   It said the governments and Spain and France were trying to
``close off the language and force it into a ghetto to be
eliminated little by little.''
	   ``France and Spain are maintaining their imperialism,'' the
statement said.
	   Euskadi Informacion is a makeshift publication that surfaced
after the daily Egin was shut down in July over its alleged links
to ETA.
	   An estimated 600,000 people speak Euskera in the seven Basque
provinces in Spain and France, according to the University of the
Basque Country, in San Sebastian.
	   It was among regional languages that were officially banned
under the dictatorship of Gen. Francisco Franco from 1939 to 1975.
	   ETA, an acronym that stands for Basque Homeland and Freedom, has
killed almost 800 people in a 30-year fight for independence in the
Basque country of northern Spain.

Fighting spreads south in Kosovo, more dead, wounded, displaced
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ISMET HAJDARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serbian police and ethnic Albanian
militants clashed fiercely near a southern border town on
Wednesday, with dead and wounded reported by both sides.
	   A source close to pro-independence Kosovo Albanian politicians
said ``there are many dead and wounded'' in the fighting in Tusis,
a suburb of the town of Prizren in southern Kosovo, and that
violence engulfed several nearby villages.
	   The pro-Albanian Kosovo Information Center said heavy explosions
could be heard and flames seen soaring on burning houses in the
area. Civilians were fleeing the fighting, the center said.
	   The Serbian Media Center in the province's capital Pristina said
the fighting began Tuesday when Albanian militants ambushed a Serb
police patrol. In the ensuing action, the center said 15 fighters
of the Kosovo Liberation Army has been killed and two policemen
were wounded.
	   The latest escalation has brought violence further south in the
increasingly ravaged province where ethnic Albanians outnumber
local Serbs 9-1.
	   Hundreds have died and estimated 265,000 people became refugees
in six months of fighting between government troops and the KLA,
the independence-fighting guerrilla.
	   The fighting near Prizren, 60 kilometers (40 miles) southwest of
Pristina, continued overnight and Wednesday, both sides said. The
Serbs claimed police gained upper hand and captured fifteen KLA
fighters.
	   The latest escalation showed that despite recent battlefield
losses to government forces, the KLA remains active wherever ethnic
Albanians predominate -- which is most of Kosovo.
	   International efforts to bring peace to the province have been
without a visible success. But the top U.S. envoy to the region,
Christopher Hill, continued his shuttle diplomacy and on Wednesday
met with the chief Kosovo Albanian leader, Ibrahim Rugova.
	   After a meeting Tuesday between Hill and Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic, the state-run Tanjug news agency said a
dialogue between Serbs and Albanians should begin ``so that an
agreement can be reached providing for an appropriate degree on
self-rule which would include equality for all living in Kosovo.''
	   It also said that after an interim period of three to five
years, the two sides could meet again to ``analyze the functioning
of the agreement'' and ``improve it on issues they mutually agree
upon.''
	   That would fall short of the Albanian demand for complete
independence. Washington and the Europeans oppose full
independence, fearing it would lead to a redrawing of borders in
neighboring countries with large Albanian populations. As a
minimum, they want Milosevic to restore the autonomy to Kosovo
which he revoked in 1989.
	   No face-to-face talks have been held - Serbs accuse the
Albanians of foot-dragging and the Albanians insist that the
crackdown on the KLA must stop before any talks.
	   Hill's spokesman, Philip Reeker, told The Associated Press that
the Americans considered the government statement as positive
albeit ``nebulous'' and with different meaning to Serbs and
Albanians.
	   ``It's just another indication that there are (indirect)
negotiations, and that they are saying they want to see some
progress,'' he said.

<TEXT>
	   BAYONNE, France (AP) _ French authorities who arrested 16
suspects believed linked to the violent Spanish Basque separatist
group ETA deported one and released five others Wednesday.
	   Police on Tuesday arrested 15 Spaniards and a Frenchman believed
to have ties with ETA, which has waged a campaign of bombings and
other attacks in the Spanish Basque region.
	   Officials said that while no arms were found, they seized
documents in the raids in Biarritz, Bayonne, Hendaye and three
other cities, the French daily Le Monde reported Wednesday.
	   The suspects, in their 40s and 50s, were believed to give
logistical support to ETA, Le Monde said.
	   One of the Spanish suspects, Jose Mari Pagoaga-Gallastegui, was
freed Wednesday but deported to Spain, police said on customary
anonymity. He had been declared persona non grata in France due to
a previous conviction for criminal association.
	   Five others were freed in France, including French suspect
Marcel Iturburua, who had been accused of housing foreigners
illegally residing in France.
	   Under French law, authorities can hold a suspect in a terrorist
probe up to four days without formal court proceedings.
	   On Tuesday, Spanish Interior Minister Jaime Mayor had hailed the
roundups and said that ``Franco-Spanish cooperation in the struggle
against terrorism will not cease to increase.''
	   ETA, which stands for Basque Homeland and Liberty, has
traditionally used French Basque territory as a place of refuge.
But French authorities _ under pressure from Spain _ have begun to
crack down.
	   The Spanish daily El Mundo has reported that three top ETA
leaders were setting up in Belgium to escape the tougher French
policy. But Major has insisted that ETA was maintaining its command
in France.
	   Nearly 800 people have been killed since Basque separatists
began fighting in 1968 for an independent state in Spain's northern
Basque provinces.

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister
Anwar Ibrahim was fired on Wednesday after months of economic
policy differences with the prime minister.
	   The 52-year-old deputy, for years seen as Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad's successor, had been sidelined and left out of
decisions for months after differing with his boss on the course
for recovery.
	   Anwar's firing came after weeks of rumors about his departure _
always followed by emphatic denials. A three-paragraph statement by
the prime minister's department said Anwar had been relieved of his
positions, including that of finance minister.
	   Malaysia's currency, the ringgit, and the markets have plummeted
since the Asian economic crisis broke out in July 1997. The
Southeast Asian country's economy, which boasted 8 percent growth
for last decade, formally went into recession last week after its
economy shrank another 6.8 percent.
	   Anwar and the central bank had preferred high interest rates and
austerity measures to control Malaysia's sliding currency, the
ringgit. Mahathir and his chief economic aide, Daim Zainuddin, have
pushed through a policy of greater government spending and lower
rates to boost the economy.
	   Although Mahathir has never openly blamed his finance minister
for the economic mess, he openly said tight monetary policies were
not going to deliver recovery.
	   On Tuesday, when Mahathir and central bank officials announced
sweeping currency exchange controls, Anwar was nowhere to be seen.
	   Although Mahathir said Anwar was present at the meetings to
discuss the measures, the finance minister was not around to
comment, fueling speculation that he was not party to the
controversial currency controls.
	   In July, Anwar was seen as being in the forefront of a campaign
for political reform when the governing United Malays National
Organization held its annual convention in July. Mahathir
immediately crushed the campaign against nepotism and cronyism at
high government levels.
	   In recent weeks, Anwar has been embarrassed by accusations of
sexual misconduct contained in a book, ``50 Reasons Why Anwar
Shouldn't Be Prime Minister.'' The authors are being tried in a
court for defamation and the trial could rake up more controversy
about Anwar's personal life.
	   Some political observers saw the book as a part of a campaign to
humiliate Anwar and push him to resign, which he reportedly
resisted for weeks.
	   Last month, Mahathir shook up the top editorial positions of two
leading newspapers and a television station. Analysts said the
changes were to remove those perceived as close to the deputy prime
minister.
	   The first real indication of Anwar's sacking may have been
contained in Mahathir's comments on Tuesday.
	   ``If he gives a good reason why he wants to resign, I have to
accept,'' Mahathir said.
	   ``There is no truth until it becomes a truth,'' he told
reporters who asked him whether the office of the finance minister
had fallen vacant.

<TEXT>
	   DURBAN, South Africa (AP) _ President Nelson Mandela on
Wednesday accused Israel of blocking Mideast peace, saying Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's administration had ``narrow,
chauvinistic interests.''
	   ``We remain gravely concerned about ... the positions taken by
the Netanyahu administration in Israel, which has blocked progress
toward a just and peaceful solution,'' Mandela told 53 heads of
government attending the Nonaligned Movement summit.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, also attending the summit,
denied Netanyahu's assertion that Israeli and Palestinian
negotiators had been close to restarting talks on Israeli troop
withdrawal from the West Bank.
	   ``There is nothing close,'' Arafat told The Associated Press.
``There is still a far distance.''
	   Arafat rejected Netanyahu's claim that the Palestinians were
holding up progress, saying the Netanyahu administration has
refused to accept Washington's peace initiative for the region.
	   Mandela, who greeted Arafat at the summit with a hug and a kiss,
urged renewed efforts to create a Palestinian state.
	   ``The international community, and the United States in
particular, should ensure that this matter is addressed
expeditiously,'' Mandela told the heads of state.
	   ``We should not allow that the narrow, chauvinistic interests of
the current administration in Israel should succeed to block the
prospect of a permanent and just peace throughout the Middle East.

Police search for missing French businessman

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Police were searching Wednesday for a missing
French man who might have fallen while on a hiking trip.
	   The 35-year-old man was reported missing since Sunday morning
after leaving his Hong Kong apartment for a hike in the rural New
Territories, the police statement said.
	   The South China Morning Post identified the man as Pascal
Vernhes, a finance director of PR Asia, a regional office of liquor
giant Pernod Ricard.
	   Police on Monday found his car near a temple, and Stephen
Verralls, the commander of the Castle Peak police division, told
government radio he may still be in the area.
	   ``One of the major possibilities is that he's fallen down into a
valley to a place where we can't see him,'' Verralls said, adding
that he may be injured.
	   The man's employer notified police after he failed to report to
work Monday, the police statement said.
	   His wife and children returned to Hong Kong from vacation in
France on Tuesday to help with the search, Verralls said.
	   Police have not yet decided if the search will continue
Thursday, the statement said.

	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Irish and British lawmakers
gathered in emergency sessions Wednesday to debate whether to enact
anti-terrorist measures against IRA dissidents responsible for last
month's car bomb in the Northern Ireland town of Omagh that killed
28 people.
	   The so-called Real Irish Republican Army planted the bomb as
part of its campaign against April's Northern Ireland peace
agreement.
	   ``The attack on Omagh was not just an indiscriminate attack on
democracy and the Good Friday agreement. It was a reckless attack
on a community, a whole people,'' Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern
told lawmakers convened in Dublin.
	   Ahern and British Prime Minister Tony Blair expect both their
parliaments to approve by Thursday night anti-terror bills
restricting the right to silence for suspected IRA dissidents and
granting more weight to police opinions in securing convictions.
	   Also Wednesday, Britain's governor for Northern Ireland paroled
two British soldiers convicted of murdering a Catholic teen-ager,
the first inmates freed from a Northern Ireland prison in response
to the peace accord.
	   Mo Mowlam ordered immediate freedom for Scots Guardsmen Jim
Fisher, 30, and Mark Wright, 25, after phoning the soldiers'
mothers _ and the mother of the 18-year-old Belfast man they shot
in the back in 1992.
	   In reaching her decision, Mowlam emphasized that the first of
420 convicted members of the IRA and pro-British paramilitary
groups ``engaged in terrorism'' were expected to be freed starting
next Monday, the most controversial aspect of the agreement.
	   ``The Guardsmen were in Northern Ireland as a consequence of
that terrorism and committed the offense while on duty to counter
it,'' Mowlam said in drawing a distinction between their case and
the others.
	   When the British government in 1995 last announced an
exceptional parole for a soldier convicted of murder in Northern
Ireland, it sparked three nights of rioting in many working-class
Catholic areas.
	   But the political landscape has profoundly changed since then.
Even as it contemplates a crackdown on IRA dissidents, the Irish
government has already freed more than a dozen IRA prisoners early
in reward for the outlawed group's July 1997 truce.
	   Nonetheless, relatives of Peter McBride _ shot while running
away from soldiers, who falsely claimed he was about to throw a
homemade grenade _ responded with fury.
	   ``Mo Mowlam told my mammy that they would not be the first two
through the (prison) gate and they were,'' said McBride's sister,
Roisin.
	   The timing of Mowlam's announcement appeared linked to the
imminent arrival of U.S. President Bill Clinton, an event that has
put all sides on their best behavior _ and encouraged key Northern
Ireland politicians to shift their positions.
	   Gerry Adams, leader of the IRA-allied Sinn Fein party, on
Tuesday announced that he wanted politically motivated violence to
be ``a thing of the past, over, done with and gone.''
	   Blair, Ahern and Clinton welcomed the statement as another step
toward a formal renunciation of violence by the IRA.
	   In response, David Trimble, designated to be the Protestant head
of a compromise government envisioned in the peace agreement,
confirmed he would meet Adams along with other Northern Irish party
leaders Monday to discuss the first steps of forming a new
government of Protestants and Catholics.
	   However, Trimble's aides emphasized that a handshake with Adams
_ or Sinn Fein representation in the new administration _ would
remain impossible until the IRA actually committed itself to
disarming under international supervision, a goal contained in the
agreement.
	   On Wednesday, Adams appointed Sinn Fein's chief negotiator,
Martin McGuinness, as the go-between between the IRA and the
commission set up to oversee the decommissioning of paramilitary
weapons.
	   ``The issue of arms must be finally and satisfactorily
settled,'' Adams said. ``This and the removal of the causes of
conflict is an absolute requirement of the successful construction
of a lasting peace settlement.''

Iraqi rival Kurdish factions exchange hundreds of detainees
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Iraq's two main rival Kurdish groups have
released more than 200 prisoners of war, the British Broadcasting
Corp. reported Wednesday.
	   The prisoners were freed on Tuesday, BBC's monitoring service
said quoting the Kurdistan Democratic Party's radio. It said the
KDP freed about 160 fighters while the PUK released 44.
	   The release came amid efforts aimed at ending the conflict
between the KDP and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, which are
wrestling for control of the autonomous Kurdish zone in northern
Iraq since 1991.
	   The zone was created by the United States and Britain after the
Iraqi government suppressed a Kurdish revolt in 1991. Recently
executives of the two factions have been negotiating moves to
consolidate a U.S.-brokered cease-fire signed in May 1997.
	   KDP leader Massoud Barzani and head of the PUK, Jalal Talabani,
are scheduled to visit the United States next week for talks with
senior administration officials on reconciliation efforts.

Protesting students leave campus amid heavy security
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES throughout with protest apparently over,
students leaving; TRIMS &QL; 
 &UR; With BC-Myanmar-Suu Kyi Interview

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ Nearly 500 university students protested
at a campus in the capital Wednesday in the largest show of public
discontent in a recent string of demonstrations against the
military government.
	   The protest broke up after riot police deployed around the
university.
	   Students indicated, however, that the demonstration at the
Yangon Institute of Technology had more to do with grievances about
exams than the renewed campaign for greater democracy led by Aung
San Suu Kyi.
	   The campus, a traditional hotbed of unrest, had been closed
since the last wave of student protests two years ago. It reopened
recently to permit students to study and take their long-postponed
final exams.
	   Early Wednesday, hundreds of students began marching behind the
locked gates of the campus. Spectators outside could see professors
negotiating to end the protest. Student demands largely focused on
getting more time to study for the exams next Monday.
	   Students have historically been at the vanguard of political
unrest and traffic police quickly closed major roads. Riot police
with clubs and shields were deployed nearby, but did not enter the
campus. The students did not attempt to march in the streets.
	   By late afternoon, under an apparent agreement between students,
school authorities and officials, the students were allowed to
leave in their cars or by bus. Parents were let through police
lines to wait for their children.
	   The roads stayed closed to normal traffic.
	   ``The faculties of the institute have sent the kids back to
their homes,'' a government spokesman, on condition of anonymity,
told The Associated Press in a fax to Bangkok, Thailand. ``They are
not being taken from the institute for questioning.''
	   It was unclear if the study courses would continue. The
spokesman said that no one would be denied the chance to take
exams.
	   Pro-democracy leader Suu Kyi met diplomats at the residence of
U.S. Charge d'Affaires Kent Weidemann. No details were released on
the results of the talks.
	   The meeting could antagonize the government, which feels hostile
nations are using Suu Kyi's party, the National League for
Democracy, to destabilize the country.
	   In an interview Tuesday with foreign journalists, Suu Kyi
expressed no disappointment that hit-and-run protests against
military rule attempted by students in the past 10 days had not
drawn crowds into the streets.
	   ``Considering the amount of repression and the amount of
surveillance to which the students are subjected, the fact that
they managed to get these demonstrations going one after the other
showed a certain amount of organization and resolve,'' she said.
	   Suu Kyi said the government may use force to resolve its latest
confrontation with the opposition, possibly banning her party.
	   ``They never think of resolving problems through negotiations,
through reasonable give and take,'' she said.
	   A week ago, Suu Kyi was described as dehydrated and severely
weakened after a 13-day roadside standoff against authorities on a
bridge outside the capital. Her doctors wanted to keep her under
observation, but Suu Kyi said her health was fine.
	   ``They can observe me while I work,'' joked Suu Kyi, looking
fit.
	   Suu Kyi, 53, who has spent most of the past decade under house
arrest or close restriction, said that the opposition in Myanmar,
also known as Burma, is more united than at any time since abortive
elections in 1990.
	   Her party overwhelmingly won the elections, but the military,
which has ruled since 1962, refused to honor the result. In the
past few weeks, the NLD has threatened to finally convene the
legislature on its own.
	   The campaign coincides with the 10th anniversary of an uprising
against military rule that was crushed in bloodshed.
	   The government has responded to the call to convene the
parliament by threatening long prison terms and banning the party.
	   The government said in a statement that it had struggled to
bring peace, stability and national unity to Myanmar and lay a
foundation for multi-party democracy some day.

	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Several prominent Belgian socialists _
including ex-NATO chief Willy Claes _ went on trial Wednesday,
accused of taking millions of dollars in bribes in exchange for
awarding two defense contracts in the late 1980s.
	   Claes, 59, a former economics minister, ex-defense minister Guy
Coeme, 52, ex-deputy premier Guy Spitaels, 67, and nine others deny
the charges.
	   Sheilded by police, they pushed their way through hundreds of
reporters, camera crews and photographers to enter Brussels' main
courthouse.
	   Prosecutors allege Italy's Agusta SpA paid 51 million francs
(dlrs 1.4 million) to win a December 1988, contract to build 46
army helicopters. They also say France's Dassault Aviation SA paid
a bribe of 60 million francs (dlrs 1.6 million) to win a June,
1989, deal to equip Belgian F-16 jets with new electronics.
	   The two contracts were each worth hundreds of millions of
dollars.
	   Serge Dassault, 73, of Dassault Aviation is also a defendant. He
got to the courthouse hours before the start of the trial. Charges
have been dropped against ex-Agusta executive Raffaelo Teti who
died in August of a heart attack at age 72.
	   At the opening session, prosecutor Eliane Liekendael listed the
allegations against the defendants in detail. The trial then bogged
down in preocedural haggling. One defendant _ a former aide to
Claes _ demanded his lawyer be allowed to speak in Dutch though
French has been selected as the trial language. The court reserved
a decision.

Former Taiwan opposition presidential candidate quits party
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ The runner up in 1996 presidential
elections quit the main opposition party Wednesday after
criticizing its strategy of downplaying calls for Taiwan
independence.
	   Peng Ming-min announced at a meeting of independent lawmakers
that he was ``already not a member of the Democratic Progressive
Party,'' but declined to elaborate on the reasons.
	   DPP Chairman Lin Yi-hsiung said he would try to persuade Peng to
remain in the party.
	   Taiwanese media speculated Peng's departure could raise
credibility problems for former associates running in December
elections. Peng's former running mate Frank Hsieh is the DPP's
candidate for mayor of Taiwan's second largest city, Kaohsiung.
	   A veteran activist and political exile, Peng came a
disappointing second behind Nationalist Party incumbent Lee
Teng-hui in Taiwan's first ever direct presidential election.
	   He has since criticized DPP leaders for softpeddaling the
party's pro-independence stance to win over jittery voters, and
stumped for independent politicians against DPP candidates in
1997's local elections.
	   China considers Taiwan a renegade province, and threatens to
invade if the island declares independence.
	   The DPP controls more than a third of legislative seats, and
governs over half of Taiwan's counties and large cities.

UN human rights chief deplores global failure to curb conflicts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   STRASBOURG, France (AP) - U.N. Human Rights Commissioner Mary
Robinson lashed out Wednesday at the international community's
indifference towards the spread of human rights violations and
conflict around the world.
	   Addressing the Council of Europe on the 50th anniversary of the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Robinson said organizations
like the United Nations and the Council were much to blame by their
``lack of appropriate action.''
	   ``We have to acknowledge, sadly, that the commemoration of the
50th Anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights is
not a cause for celebration,'' Robinson told representatives of the
40-nation Council.
	   ``We must see in the prevalence of conflicts and widespread
human rights violations in the world today ... a measure of our
past failures,'' she said.
	   Citing a 1996 report drawn up for the United Nations by Graca
Machel, wife of South African President Nelson Mandela, on the
impact of armed conflict on children, she said more than 2 million
children had been killed in conflicts in the previous decade.
	   ``The abuses prevalent in modern conflicts are apalling,''
Robinson said. ``Insofar as such abuses are occurring in Europe
they interrogate Europe's integrity and commitment to the values of
the Council of Europe.''
	   She said efforts to prevent conflict should focus not only on
ethnic or political disputes but also on the social issues of
``chronic underdevelopment, grinding poverty, mass unemployment,
widespread illiteracy and systematic inequalities of income or
opportunities.''

Police say Planet Hollywood bomb linked to other Cape Town blasts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ The bomb that ripped through a
Planet Hollywood restaurant last month resembled previous bombs
aimed at police targets, authorities said Wednesday.
	   Experts had finished reconstructing the Planet Hollywood bomb,
which killed a man and injured 27 people Aug. 25. A caller saying
he represented an anti-American, anti-Israeli group claimed
responsibility, but the group later repudiated the claim.
	   Cape Town and its surrounding slums have been subject to a wave
of recent bombings, which authorities have linked to a Muslim
vigilante group, People Against Gangsterism and Drugs.
	   One bomb went off Aug. 6 outside police offices, killing a
street vendor, and another outside a local police station struck
about a month before that. No one was injured in that attack.
	   Police spokesman Senior Supt. John Sterrenberg said all three
bombs had ``common elements,'' but said he could not describe them
to protect the investigation.
	   Police had no leads on the earlier blasts, he said. Media
reports at the time had linked them to PAGAD.

Once Mahathir's golden boy, Anwar falls from grace
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS ages of Mahathir, Anwar &QL;

 &UR; By RANJAN ROY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Once the second-most powerful man
in Malaysia, Anwar Ibrahim saw his political fortunes reducee central bank and Mahathir were only the latest
rifts between Malaysia's two most prominent men.
	   On Wednesday, Mahathir once again showed he would not tolerate
dissent by ignominiously sacking Anwar.
	   As Finance Minister, Anwar, 51, strenuously backed Bank Negara's
stand on maintaining tight monetary policy to protect the country's
faltering currency, the ringgit.
	   But after Mahathir, 72, blamed that International Monetary
Fund-style policy for Malaysia's dramatic recession, the deputy
prime minister found himself sidelined.
	   In June, Mahathir drafted trusted aide and former finance
minister Daim Zainuddin into the Cabinet as special economics
minister. Daim, who shares Mahathir's distaste for austere
policies, soon made his mark.
	   Government spending was pumped up by 20 percent, and a
succession of interest-rate cuts left Anwar's tight monetary policy
in tatters. When the Bank Negara governor and his deputy quit last
week in opposition to Mahathir's plans to fix the ringgit, the
writing was on the wall.
	   With a fixed currency, Mahathir had no need for his Finance
Minister, whose chief role was increasingly just to reassure
international financial markets.
	   Anwar's fall was as startling as his rise.
	   From a charismatic student leader who spent 22 months in jail
for leading a demonstration by impoverished farmers, Anwar rose to
become heir to Mahathir's office.
	   In university, he co-founded the pro-Islamic Malaysian Muslim
Youth Movement and battled for a wider role for Islam in the
running of the predominantly Muslim country.
	   But as his politics moderated, Anwar quickly rose to power on
the coattails of his longtime mentor, Mahathir.
	   Both Mahathir's United Malays National Organization, the
country's dominant political group since independence from Britain
in 1957, and the main Islamic fundamentalist party wooed the young
populist.
	   Anwar joined Mahathir's party in 1982 and rose quickly to
important Cabinet positions, holding the youth and sports portfolio
until 1984, agriculture for the next two years, education until
1991 and finance from then on.
	   In 1995, he engineered a groundswell of support within the
United Malays National Organization party to win the deputy
leader's office and become the deputy prime minister.
	   But as Malaysia's economy slid into recession in recent months,
Anwar's stock fell as he differed with Mahathir on the course the
Southeast Asian nation should chart toward recovery.
	   The rift between Mahathir and Anwar surfaced openly in June
during the annual convention of the governing party. Many party
leaders saw Anwar's involvement in a campaign for political reform
that was spearheaded by a youth leader.
	   But Mahathir moved quickly, crushing the youth leader and
forcing him to recapitulate and denying that there was any cronyism
and nepotism among the UMNO leadership.

Kyrgyz president seeks referendum on constitutional changes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Kyrgyz President Askar Akayev proposed a national
referendum on constitutional amendments to approve private land
ownership, and ban parliament from adopting laws to restrict
freedom of speech, a news agency said Wednesday.
	   The amendments would also deprive lawmakers of immunity from
prosecution and increase the number of legislators in parliament,
the Interfax news agency said.
	   Speaking on national television Tuesday night, Akayev said the
amendments were aimed at strengthening the legislature and creating
equal opportunities for all forms of ownership, the Interfax news
agency reported.
	   However, many in parliament, which is to discuss a decree
calling for the referendum on Sept. 8, oppose Akayev's measures.
	   The provision on abolishing parliamentary immunity may lead to
illegal arrests of lawmakers, said Omurbek Tekebayev, a socialist
lawmaker.
	   Tekebayev also was worried by Akayev's suggestion to give the
government a final say on budget expenses and revenues, saying that
would leave parliament with little say over the country's financial
and social policies, Interfax reported.
	   ``This may ... slow down further development of democracy,''
Tekebayev said.
	   Akayev did not say when the referendum was to take place, and
parliament might still reject it.
	   Meanwhile, parliament is preparing its own draft law on
constitutional amendments, which it plans to submit to Akayev by
Oct. 5, according to Tekebayev.

Malaysia's deputy prime minister sacked

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia's deputy prime minister
and finance chief Anwar Ibrahim was fired on Wednesday after months
of economic policy differences with the prime minister.
	   The move _ announced by the prime minister's department in a
three-paragraph statement _ came after weeks of rumors that Anwar
had been fired or would quit, always followed by emphatic denials.
	   The 51-year-old Anwar, for years seen as Mahathir's successor,
had been left out of economic decisions for months after differing
with his boss on the course for economic recovery.
	   Dozens of Anwar supporters flocked to his residence Wednesday
night, pushing through a horde of reporters who had been camped
outside his house all afternoon.
	   Three truckloads of riot police were deployed around the nearby
residence of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, apparently to prevent
protests by Anwar supporters.
	   ``He didn't want to resign, so he was sacked,'' said a close
aide to Mahathir. The aide, who asked not to be identified, said
Anwar's successor had not yet been chosen.
	   The aide said the Supreme Council of the ruling United Malays
National Organization would meet Thursday to discuss Anwar's
position in the party. Anwar is UMNO vice president.
	   Lim Kit Siang, the opposition leader in Parliament, said the
move would push the Southeast Asian country into further chaos
during the regional economic crisis.
	   ``The sacking of the deputy prime minister will plunge the
country into an unprecedented political crisis and turmoil,'' said
Lim. ``Unless Dr. Mahathir can convincingly establish the
legitimacy of the drastic action.''
	   The firing of the finance chief comes at a crucial time for the
economy.
	   Malaysia's currency, the ringgit, and the markets have plummeted
since the Asian economic crisis broke out in July 1997. The
Southeast Asian country's economy, which boasted 8 percent growth
for last decade, formally went into recession last week after its
economy shrank another 6.8 percent.
	   Anwar and the central bank had preferred high interest rates and
austerity measures to control Malaysia's sliding currency, the
ringgit. Mahathir and his chief economic aide, Daim Zainuddin, have
pushed through a policy of greater government spending and lower
rates to boost the economy.
	   Although Mahathir has never openly blamed his finance minister
for the economic mess, he openly said the tight monetary policies
of the central bank were not going to deliver recovery.
	   When Bank Negara governor Ahmad Mohamed Don and his deputy, Fong
Weng Phak, quit last week in opposition to Mahathir's plans to fix
the ringgit at 3.8 to the U.S. dollar, it appeared Anwar's days
were numbered.
	   On Tuesday, when Mahathir and central bank officials announced
sweeping currency exchange controls, Anwar was nowhere to be seen.
	   In July, Anwar was seen as being in the forefront of a campaign
for political reform when the governing United Malays National
Organization held its annual convention in July. Mahathir
immediately crushed the campaign against nepotism and cronyism at
high government levels.
	   In recent weeks, Anwar has been embarrassed by accusations of
sexual misconduct contained in a book, ``50 Reasons Why Anwar
Shouldn't Be Prime Minister.'' The authors are being tried in a
court for defamation and the trial could rake up more controversy
about Anwar's personal life.
	   Some political observers saw the book as a part of a campaign to
humiliate Anwar and push him to resign, which he reportedly
resisted for weeks.

Police suspect driver in armored car theft
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Taiwanese police were looking for the
driver of an armored car suspected of fleeing Wednesday with almost
50 million Taiwan dollars (U.S. dlrs 1.4 million) in cash.
	   Tseng Ming-chun overcame two security guards with a knife and
locked them in handcuffs before dumping the van and driving away in
a taxi, police said. The two guards were being held for questioning
as possible accomplices, police said.
	   Representatives of the Guardforce security company said the
cash's owner, Bank of Taiwan, would be immediately reimbursed.
	   Tseng, 34, had worked for the company barely half a year, and
was recently docked 6,000 Taiwan dollars (U.S. dlrs 171) for poor
job performance, company officials told local media.
	   Guardforce commands a 50 percent share of the armored car
business in Taiwan.

Injury forces Swedish striker Andersson to sit out England match
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Striker Kennet Andersson, suffering
from a thigh injury, will sit out Saturday's European Championship
qualifying match against England.
	   The loss of Andersson, one of Sweden's strongest players, could
be a critical deficit in what many see as one of Sweden's hottest
matches in years.
	   ``This feels really sad,'' Andersson was quoted as saying by the
Swedish news agency TT on Tuesday.
	   ``Kennet has a hemorrhage in the muscle attachment in the back
of the leg, an injury that takes about three weeks to heal,'' said
team doctor Magnus Forsblad.

Japanese chipmakers shut factories in U.S.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Two of Japan's largest makers of computer memory
chips said Wednesday they will close factories in the United States
because of the long downturn in global chip prices.
	   Hitachi Ltd. and Mitsubishi Electric Corp. said the steps are
aimed at cutting costs as a glut in worldwide chip production
drives down prices and squeezes profit margins.
	   Hitachi will cut 500 jobs by shutting its plant in Irving,
Texas, where it built several types of chips including 4-megabit
dynamic random access memory (DRAM) chips, said Masahiro Takahashi,
a spokesman for Hitachi.
	   The company said it hasn't decided yet what to do with the
facility and may reopen it in the future. Hitachi will also cut
another 100 employees in California by merging two design and
development subsidiaries.
	   A spokesman for Mitsubishi Electric said the company will close
its factory in Durham, North Carolina, which made 16 and 64-megabit
DRAM chips, and lay off all 230 workers.
	   The companies said they will focus production in Japan, where
the companies would face intense public criticism if they laid off
employees.

Deposed leader urges quick action in Russia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Sacked Russian Prime Minister Sergei
Kiriyenko criticized his country's parliament Wednesday for failing
to replace him immediately.
	   Viktor Chernomyrdin, Kiriyenko's predecessor, was President
Boris Yeltsin's choice to take over after he sacked Kiriyenko last
week.
	   Kiriyenko, in Australia for a private, unofficial visit, told
local radio that Russia's future was being placed at risk by
political game playing.
	   Russia's State Duma, the lower house of parliament,
overwhelmingly rejected Chernomyrdin on Monday, saying he was
incapable of leading the country out of its worst economic crisis
since the Soviet era.
	   Kiriyenko said he believed a coalition government would fail.
	   ``I have doubts about the coalition government because the
coalition government can't work effectively,'' he told Australian
Broadcasting Corp. radio, through an interpreter. ``They can't make
emergency decisions, hard decisions and unpopular decisions because
that could affect the party they are representing.''
	   He said that because of the country's economic turmoil, ``we
cannot afford to lose even a week during this crisis and political
debates within the Duma are wasting valuable time.''
	   ``We should be putting effective methods in place now, but we're
wasting time,'' Kiriyenko said.
	   The former banker said his sacking had not come as a surprise,
adding that when Yeltsin offered him the job in March he had felt
the crisis was near.
	   ``I also knew I would need to use unpopular strategies to soften
the crisis and turn it around,'' Kiriyenko said. ``We knew they
were going to be unpopular and sooner or later it would cost us our
jobs. We would lose government, it was very clear, but I don't
think we chose the wrong tactics. If I had my time over I would do
it again but even harder.''
	   The Russian Embassy in Canberra confirmed Kiriyenko was in
Australia on private business and had no official engagements.
	   A spokeswoman for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade
said it had no details of his plans.
	   Kiriyenko was sacked as Prime Minister last week when Yeltsin
dismissed his entire government. Chernomyrdin was sacked as prime
minister in March after holding the job for five years.

Iran kicks off unprecedented military drill near Afghan border
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By AFSHIN VALINEJAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iranian fighter planes bombed imaginary
targets Wednesday and paratroopers dropped into ``hostile''
territory during exercises by 70,000 Iranian soldiers taking part
in an unprecedented show of military force near the border with
Afghanistan.
	   Iran's biggest peacetime show of strength is apparently aimed at
Afghanistan where, according to Tehran, the ruling Taliban militia
is illegally holding 47 Iranians.
	   More than 150 tanks rumbled through the area and Cobra
helicopter gunships hovered overhead Wednesday at the start of
three-day maneuvers in the northeastern Khorasan province, Iranian
radio reported.
	   The exercises, by the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps and the
volunteer Basij Resistance Forces, are a ``demonstration of
strength, organization, dynamism and a high coordination,'' the
radio said.
	   The Revolutionary Guard is an elite fighting force of about
120,000 ground, air and navy personnel.
	   Iran's ambassador to Kazakhstan, Hassan Qashqavi, said the
exercises were spurred by the ``recent political developments in
the region'' and urged the Taliban to release the captive Iranians.
	   The official Islamic Republic News Agency said the first phase
of the exercises concluded successfully. Troops were airlifted,
paratroopers landed ``deep inside the hypothetical enemy's
terrain'' and jet fighters attacked enemy troop concentrations in a
600-square-kilometer (240-square-mile) area, IRNA said.
	   On Tuesday, the Guard Corps commander, Maj. Gen. Yahya Rahim
Safavi, said troops and equipment will remain in the area after
Friday, but it was not clear if that included all 70,000 soldiers.
	   The exercises are the largest this year and the first near the
Afghan border since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
	   Iran accuses the Taliban militia, which controls most of
Afghanistan, of detaining 47 Iranians since their capture in the
northern city of Mazar-e-Sharif on Aug. 8. The detainees include 11
diplomats, a journalist and 35 truck drivers.
	   Taliban says it knows nothing about the Iranian diplomats but
acknowledges holding some 30 Iranians it accuses of arming its
opponents.
	   On Wednesday, Iran urged the United Nations to send a mission to
Afghanistan to investigate the disappearance.
	   Pakistan is widely believed to provide arms and other support to
the Taliban while Iran is suspected of backing the northern-based
opposition to the Taliban.

U.S. embassies in Kuwait, Manila face attack threats
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with threat to Coca Cola factory in Yemen &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ The U.S. Embassy in Kuwait said Wednesday an
attack was possibly being planned against it, and a note found on a
plane in Kuwait warned of a bomb attack on the U.S. mission in the
Philippines.
	   Meanwhile, the Coca Cola factory in Yemen also received a threat
on Monday, factory officials said.
	   Washington has closed some of its diplomatic missions around the
world and maximized security in others following last month's twin
bombings of its embassies in Nairobi, Kenya and Dar es Salaam,
Tanzania. More than 250 people were killed and some 5,000 injured.
	   A taped message on a telephone line at the embassy in Kuwait
said: The ``U.S. government has received information indicating
that a similar attack (to those in Kenya and Tanzania) may be being
planned in Kuwait.''
	   The message said the embassy was taking ``appropriate security
precautions.''
	   Embassy spokesman Claud Young told The Associated Press that the
mission does not have immediate plans to close down because of the
threat, but was closed for the Labor Day holiday on Monday.
	   He would not say how or where the threat was received.
	   The embassy in this oil-rich state has received several bomb
threats since the end of the 1991 Gulf War.
	   Another threat, this time against the U.S. Embassy in Manila,
Philippines, was delivered Tuesday on board an Emirates flight in
the a handwritten note, the Interior Ministry said.
	   The unsigned note in English was found in the toilet of the
aircraft that arrived from Dubai, Col. Bader Saleh, the ministry
spokesman, said.
	   He quoted the note as saying: ``The American Embassy in the
Philippines will be bombed on Sept. 4, 1998.''
	   Security people searched the aircraft thoroughly but found
nothing suspicious, Saleh said.
	   In the Yemeni capital of San`a, the Coca Cola factory was sent
an anonymous fax that said: ``This is an American factory and
should be closed or we will blow it up without further warning.
This is a final warning,'' the al-Balagh weekly independent
newspaper reported Wednesday.
	   Company officials confirmed the report but refused to elaborate.
Al-Balagh said extra police have been posted around the factory,
which was still running.
	   The embassy bombings in Africa led to U.S. missile strikes at
suspected training camps for fundamentalist Muslims in Afghanistan
and a pharmaceutical plant in the Sudanese capital that the U.S.
government accused of making precursors for chemical weapons.

Deposed leader urges quick action in Russia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Former Russian Prime Minister Sergei
Kiriyenko criticized his country's parliament Wednesday for failing
to replace him immediately.
	   Viktor Chernomyrdin, Kiriyenko's predecessor, was President
Boris Yeltsin's choice to take over after he sacked Kiriyenko last
week.
	   Kiriyenko, in Australia for a private, unofficial visit, told
local radio that Russia's future was being placed at risk by
political game playing.
	   Russia's State Duma, the lower house of parliament,
overwhelmingly rejected Chernomyrdin on Monday, saying he was
incapable of leading the country out of its worst economic crisis
since the Soviet era.
	   Kiriyenko said he believed a coalition government would fail.
	   ``I have doubts about the coalition government because the
coalition government can't work effectively,'' he told Australian
Broadcasting Corp. radio through an interpreter. ``They can't make
emergency decisions, hard decisions and unpopular decisions because
that could affect the party they are representing.''
	   He said that because of the country's economic turmoil, ``we
cannot afford to lose even a week during this crisis and political
debates within the Duma are wasting valuable time.''
	   ``We should be putting effective methods in place now, but we're
wasting time,'' Kiriyenko said.
	   The former banker said his sacking had not come as a surprise,
adding that when Yeltsin offered him the job in March he had felt
the crisis was near.
	   ``I also knew I would need to use unpopular strategies to soften
the crisis and turn it around,'' Kiriyenko said. ``We knew they
were going to be unpopular and sooner or later it would cost us our
jobs. We would lose government, it was very clear, but I don't
think we chose the wrong tactics. If I had my time over I would do
it again but even harder.''
	   The Russian Embassy in Canberra confirmed Kiriyenko was in
Australia on private business and had no official engagements.
	   A spokeswoman for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade
said it had no details of his plans.
	   Kiriyenko was sacked as Prime Minister last week when Yeltsin
dismissed his entire government. Chernomyrdin was sacked as prime
minister in March after holding the job for five years.

Pakistan protests India test of ground to air missile
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Pakistan on Wednesday protested
India's latest missile test, warning that such weapons programs
could provoke a new arms race in South Asia.
	   Pakistan has lost three wars since 1948 to its larger neighbor,
and in May exploded its first atomic weapons in response to India's
series of nuclear weapons tests.
	   India on Tuesday test fired a short-range Akash missile,
designed to carry conventional weapons, as part of its missile
development program, Indian news reports said.
	   In response to the reports, the Pakistani foreign ministry said
``Pakistan has repeatedly drawn international attention to the
security implications of the Indian missile program.''
	   The statement said the deployment and testing of such missiles
directly affects regional security, and asked the international
community to pressure India to show restraint in weapons programs.

Yeltsin cites obligation to reform, Clinton says 'no short cut'
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Clinton meeting Duma members, trims bottom. &QL; 
 &UR; By BARRY SCHWEID &QC; 
 &UR; AP Diplomatic Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian President Boris Yeltsin said Wednesday his
country faces a lot of ``tears and sweat'' in dealing with its
crisis. U.S. President Bill Clinton held out hope for expanded aid
but said ``there is no short cut'' to Russian reform.
	   ``America and the international community are, I'm convinced,
ready to offer further assistance if Russia stays with the path to
reform,'' Clinton said at a joint news conference ending the
two-day Moscow summit.
	   Yeltsin, in the throes of a full-throttled political crisis, was
asked what he would do if the Russian parliament refused to confirm
his choice of Viktor Chernomyrdin to return as prime minister.
	   Yeltsin took several seconds and then said, ``There will be a
reasonable number of events taking place in order for us to be able
to attain these goals.'' As Clinton and others waited for more, he
added, ``That's it.''
	   Clinton had been asked a question about whether he had struck
the right tone in his TV appearance regarding Monica Lewinsky.
After Yeltsin's reply he grinned and quipped, ``That would be my
answer, too.''
	   Regarding the brief TV remarks on the Lewinsky matter,
criticized by many as too grudging and not nearly apologetic
enough, he said, ``I read it the other day and I thought I was
expressing my profound regret to all who were hurt.''
	   Both presidents described their meetings as successful, and
Yeltsin told reporters he and Clinton discussed ways to intensify
U.S.-Russian economic relations to pull Russia out of its economic
tailspin.
	   ``There still is a lot of tears and sweat to spend before we
identify the forms of business cooperation which are worthy of the
two great nations,'' Yeltsin said without mentioning the political
paralysis he faces with the State Duma over forming a new
government.
	   Said Clinton: ``I know this is a difficult time, but there is no
short cut.''
	   Later Clinton addressed some two dozen members of the Duma and
regional leaders, including Alexander Lebed, a regional governor
and former hard-line commander with a record of challenging
Yeltsin's policies, and Gennady Zyuganov, the Communist Party
leader who also is a chief Yeltsin nemesis.
	   ``Russia must have its own approaches that keep the nation
strong, that care for the people who are in need, that prepare for
the future of your children,'' Clinton said, emphasizing the
benefit of a national debate. ``No other country's approach would
be exactly right for Russia.''
	   Referring to Russia's failure so far to build an effective tax
collection system, defeat corruption and pass laws to protect and
regulate banking and other commercial enterprises, Clinton said ``I
do not believe you can find one country in the world that is
economically successful that has completely ignored the ground
rules of the global economy.
	   ``If the basic framework is not in place, as a friend I say I do
not believe that you can defy the rules of the road in today's
global economy any more than I could defy the laws of gravity by
stepping off the top floor of Spaso House,'' he said, referring to
the U.S. ambassador's residence in which he was speaking.
	   In the joint news conference, Yeltsin said the key to Russia's
economic recovery was not further U.S. assistance but more foreign
investment. ``This is what we need.''
	   The Russian leader said he wanted the world to know that Russia
does not view U.S. support as a crutch. ``Not at all,'' he said
several times to stress his point. He said Russia had no choice but
to stick to its plan _ now in danger of failing _ to build a free
market economy.
	   ``We are still obliged to take these reforms to the end, through
the end, and correspondingly get a reward for that,'' he said.
	   As Clinton and Yeltsin held their second round of talks,
Communist Party leader Zyuganov bluntly summed up the high stakes
in this country's internal power struggle: ``President Yeltsin is
pushing the nation to a civil war.''
	   At the news conference, Clinton referred obliquely to Yeltsin's
standoff with communist and nationalist lawmakers.
	   ``I think if other political forces try to force the president
to abandon reform in midstream or even reverse it, what I think
will happen is even less money will come into Russia and even more
economic hardship will result,'' Clinton said.
	   Before taking questions from reporters, Yeltsin and Clinton
signed two security agreements. One commits each country to ridding
itself of 50 tons of weapons-grade plutonium from old nuclear
warheads; the other calls for sharing information on missile launch
warnings.
	   They also signed joint statements on biological weapons control
and on peace hopes for Kosovo, the Balkan region torn with civil
strife.
	   Yeltsin said the summit took place ``in a very friendly
atmosphere'' notwithstanding disagreements on some security issues.
After his meetings with Yeltsin, Clinton was to press his no-pain,
no-gain message with Duma leaders.

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Egypt's Al-Ahram Beverages Co. announced
Wednesday its gross profits increased 20 percent during the fiscal
year that ended June 30 compared to the same period last fiscal.
	   Gross profit increased by 17.7 million pounds (dlrs 5.2 million)
to 106.1 million pounds (dlrs 31.2 million), Al-Ahram said in a
statement.
	   Net income increased by 25 percent from 53.9 million pounds
(dlrs 15.85 million) to 67.6 million pounds (dlrs 19.9 million),
the statement added. Earnings per share increased from 11.98 pounds
(dlrs 3.53) to 15.01 (dlrs 4.43), an increase of 25 percent.
	   Al-Ahram, a former state-run company, was privatized in 1997 and
currently brews the Stella brand of beer in Egypt and has licensing
agreements with Denmark's Carlsberg and the U.S. Royal Crown Cola.
The company also is expected to begin brewing the well-known Irish
beer, Guinness, and its non-alcoholic stable mate, Kaliber.
 &UR; ___
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ The Egyptian work force is estimated to be
19.757 million by the year 2001-2 out of which 18.799 million will
be employed, Labor Minister Ahmed el-Amawi said in remarks
published Wednesday.
	   The minister said the resulting unemployment will be a drop of
five percent, the Egyptian Gazette reported. Unemployment is
currently about 8.8 percent.
	   El-Amawi said his ministry had managed to create 7,000 jobs for
young people who are listed in the national employment guide,
issued earlier by the ministry.
	   He said the guide will be available in the market beginning
Saturday and will provide data on available jobs in new industrial
zone and communities. El-Amawi said salaries in these industrial
zones will range from 100 pounds (dlrs 29) to 6,000 pounds (dlrs
1,764).
 &UR; ___
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ The governor of the Central Bank of Kuwait said in
remarks published Wednesday that the bank had no plans for
devaluating the dinar in response to the continuing slump in oil
prices.
	   The governor, Sheik Salem Abdul-Aziz al-Sabah, told the Arab
Times daily that the bank sees neither the need nor the benefit
from changing its exchange rate policy which ``continues to
adequately serve the country.''
	   Neighboring Saudi Arabia has also strongly ruled out any
intention to devaluate its riyal amid speculation from
international dealers.
	   The Arab Times quoted economists as saying the benefits of
devaluation would only be short-term, and would undermine the
country's financial credibility.
	   Kuwait's state revenues, which come mostly from oil, have been
hard hit by low oil prices. The small Gulf state foresees a budget
deficit of 1.92 billion dinars (dlrs 6.27 billion) in the fiscal
year that started July 1.
	   The CBK fixed the dinar Wednesday at dlrs 0.305. Kuwait links
the dinar rate to a basket of currencies, which is widely believed
to be heavily weighted against the U.S. dollar.

Geologists find 2 million-year-old elephant skeleton
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MIHAELA ARMASELU &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ A 16-year-old high-school student in
southern Romania stumbled upon the bone of an elephant that
probably roamed here 2 million years ago, a geologist said
Wednesday.
	   Calling it a rare find, geologist Aurel Popescu, who's heading a
research team studying the discovery, said it could offer vital
information about the climate and vegetation existing in that
period.
	   In late August, student Catalin Bidireav, 16, chanced upon the
bone as he was digging stones for an addition to his grandparents'
house in a quarry near the village of Leu, 175 kilometers (109
miles) west of Bucharest.
	   Realizing the bone might be something special, the teen, who is
studying veterinary medicine, brought the bone to the Natural
Science Museum in Craiova 30 kilometers (19 miles) away.
	   The museum immediately sent a team of experts to the village,
Popescu said by telephone from the museum.
	   Popescu said the skeleton, which is complete and in good
condition, dates from the beginning of the Quaternary Period, 2
million years ago. He said it would be excavated in the fall when
scientists are able to borrow the right equipment.
	   ``How lucky it is that a student who realized that it was
precious found it,'' he said.
	   After examining the first samples, experts concluded that the
elephant belonged to the Archkodon Meridionalis species. It would
have been 4.25 meters (almost 14 feet) tall and 6 meters (20 feet)
long.
	   Geologists commonly believe the species lived in this part of
continent almost 1.6 million years ago. But the shape of the
elephant's teeth and two other mammal skeletons discovered at the
same spot indicated they were several hundred thousand years older,
Popescu said.
	   In Bucharest, the curator of the Grigore Antipa Museum,
Romania's Natural History Museum, said only two other valuable
skeletons of the same age have been found in what today is Romania.
	   The skeletons were unearthed at the beginning of this century in
southern Romania. One is the only known complete skeleton of a
fossil elephant, Deinotherium Gigantisimum. A mammoth skeleton also
was found, said museum curator Dumitru Murariu.

Tajiks, U.N. talk about bringing fighters back from Afghanistan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DUSHANBE, Tajikistan (AP) _ An opposition leader, government
official and U.N. envoy on Wednesday discussed how to bring home
fighters who fled to Afghanistan during Tajikistan's civil war.
	   The opposition is seeking the United Nation's help in bringing
home the several hundred fighters who remain in northern
Afghanistan following a peace deal signed last year.
	   Under the deal, the fighters must return unarmed.
	   Akhmadshakh Kamliov, head of Tajikistan's national
reconciliation commission, said officials have gone to Sher Khan on
the Pyandzh River on the border with Afghanistan to see whether it
is safe for the fighters to return.
	   Fighting continues in northern Afghanistan between the Taliban
Islamic army and an opposition alliance.
	   If it is safe, the fighters will cross the Pyandzh River on
rafts accompanied by U.N. military observers, Kamilov said.
	   The peace deal has already seen the return of 10,000 civilian
refugees under the auspices of the U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees.
	   About 55,000 Tajiks fled to northern Afghanistan during the
Tajik civil war in 1992 and 1993. Most eventually returned home
themselves.

Communist Party leader Zyuganov bluntly summed up the high stakes
in this country's internal power struggle: ``President Yeltsin is
pushing the nation to a civil war.''
	   At the news conference, Clinton referred obliquely to Yeltsin's
standoff with communist and nationalist lawmakers.
	   ``I think if other political forces try to force the president
to abandon reform in midstream or even reverse it, what I think
will happen is even less money will come into Russia and even more
economic hardship will result,'' Clinton said.
	   Before taking questions from reporters, Yeltsin and Clinton
signed two security agreements. One commits each country to ridding
itself of 50 tons of weapons-grade plutonium from old nuclear
warheads; the other calls for sharing information on missile launch
warnings.
	   They also signed joint statements on biological weapons control
and on peace hopes for Kosovo, the Balkan region torn with civil
strife.
	   Yeltsin said the atmosphere in his summit talks was friendly,
nptwithstanding disagreements on some security issues. After his
meetings with Yeltsin, Clinton was to press his no-pain, no-gain
message with Duma leaders.

U. N. report: Population explosion isn't over
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with quotes from U.N. Population Fund's executive
director at news conference &QL; 
 &UR; By EDITH M. LEDERER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The largest-ever generation of young people in
every continent except Europe will ensure that the human race will
continue to grow until at least the middle of the next century, the
U.N. Population Fund said Wednesday.
	   And global population is likely ``to go on growing slowly after
that for perhaps 50 more years,'' Dr. Nafis Sadik, the fund's
executive director, said at a news conference launching its annual
report.
	   While falling fertility, smaller families and improved health
care have slowed the annual rate of population growth, the legacy
of past high fertility is an unprecedented number of teenagers
approaching their childbearing years, the agency said.
	   Global population is still increasing by more than 80 million
people every year and will pass 6 billion in 1999. It will reach
somewhere between 7.7 billion and 11.1 billion by 2050 _ most
likely 9.4 billion, according to U.N. projections.
	   ``This means population may grow as much or more in the next 50
years than in the past 50 years,'' the report said, noting that
there were only 2.5 billion people in 1950.
	   The composition of the world's population is also changing.
	   Today's generation of young people is the biggest in history,
Sadik said, with more than 1 billion young people between the ages
of 15 and 24 entering their most fertile years.
	   ``These young people will decide whether family size continues
to decline,'' she said.
	   The slowdown in population growth has improved the lives of
billions of people in developing countries, where family size has
fallen by half in the last 30 years, Sadik said.
	   ``It helped to drive the Asian economic miracle,'' she said.
``It can help the staggering Asian economies to get back on their
feet, and it can help create the conditions for economic recovery
in Africa.
	   ``These are possibilities, not predictions. Families are smaller
today and people are better off because we took action. And action
is still needed, perhaps more than ever before.''
	   The report siad that young people ``need more and better
education and information about sexuality, how to avoid pregnancy
and sexually transmitted diseases, and how to respect the rights of
partners, so they can make responsible decisions (including the
option of delaying sexual activity).''
	   While the younger generation is increasing, the number and
proportion of adults over the age of 65 is increasing at an
unprecedented rate, according to the Population Fund.

 &UR; Indonesian military sends troops back to troubled province
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with damage of Chinese temple, 6th graf &QL;

 &UR; By FIRDIA LISNAWATI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   IDI, Indonesia (AP) _ Citing security concerns, Indonesia's
military chief on Wednesday angrily reversed a decision to withdraw
troops from a northern province as fresh riots flared.
	   The turnaround could fuel tension in Aceh province, where
soldiers have been accused of atrocities while suppressing Islamic
separatist rebels in the late 1980s and 1990s. Investigators have
found mass graves containing bodies of alleged victims of the
military.
	   Last month, armed forces chief Gen. Wiranto apologized and
pulled out 1,000 soldiers in a conciliatory gesture, but sent
hundreds back to the province Tuesday to secure the riot-torn town
of Lhokseumawe.
	   The town was quiet Wednesday, with thousands of anti-riot
officers patrolling the streets. But rioting spread to the nearby
town of Idi, where mobs looted stores and burned goods.
	   Students in uniform started the riot and bystanders then joined
in, police Lt. Col. Suminar said by telephone. There were no
reports of casualties.
	   The rioters, mostly from out of Idi, a district town in the East
Aceh regency, also destroyed a Chinese temple. Local residents who
were trying to prevent further violence said the rioters came in
trucks and incited town residents.
	   Two days of unrest in Lhokseumawe, on the northern tip of
Sumatra island, left a wide path of destruction: mobs burned
buildings and hurled stones at shops owned by ethnic Chinese, a
common scapegoat. Even children joined in the looting.
	   Hundreds of Chinese fled, leaving their stores abandoned. At
least eight ethnic Chinese families fled Idi on Wednesday.
	   After a Cabinet meeting in Jakarta, Wiranto condemned the riots
as ``an act of anarchy'' and said Acehnese religious and social
leaders would no longer be in charge of keeping order.
	   ``From now on, the armed forces is taking over the security in
Aceh,'' he said. He brushed off questions about how long the
military would stay, saying: ``You ask the Acehnese people.''
	   Without elaborating, he accused ``certain parties'' of provoking
the unrest and said some alleged inciters had been arrested.
	   Abdurrahman Yacoub, a human rights lawyer in Aceh, said there
were 6,000 troops in the province and more were not needed. He said
soldiers in Lhokseumawe were slow to react to the riots and could
have prevented them with better intelligence.
	   The unrest erupted Monday after a contingent of 660 Indonesian
soldiers left Aceh in line with the military's efforts to restore
an image sullied by accusations of human rights violations.
	   Crowds pelted the military trucks with stones as they departed
and then rampaged through the streets, some shouting ``Free Aceh!''
and other separatist slogans.
	   Many chose to vent their anger on the ethnic Chinese minority,
which is viewed with suspicion partly because it dominates business
in economically struggling Indonesia.
	   Police said one man was killed, after earlier reporting two
deaths. They did not confirm accounts by residents that the victim
was shot by security forces.
	   Hundreds of soldiers were guarding a natural gas refinery and
other state-run industrial sites in Lhokseumawe. Mobil Corp., the
U.S. oil company, has operations in the area.
	   Ninety prisoners, meanwhile, were at large after crowds stormed
the town prison Monday night. Dozens have since surrendered and
more were expected to turn themselves in once calm returns.
	   The riots were the worst since unrest helped oust former
autocratic President Suharto in mid-May. About 1,200 people died in
street violence in Jakarta, the capital.
	   Suharto's successor, B.J. Habibie, is implementing democratic
reforms but fears abound that Indonesia's economic crisis and the
strain on millions of poor people could lead to bigger riots.

Fifth Bosnian Serb arrested in Germany on suspicion of war crimes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KARLSRUHE, Germany (AP) _ A former Bosnian Serb police commander
has been arrested on suspicion of ordering the shooting deaths of
at least eight Muslim villagers during the Bosnian war, federal
prosecutors announced Wednesday.
	   The suspect, identified only as 43-year-old Djuradj K., is the
fifth Bosnian war crimes suspect to be arrested in Germany.
	   Djuradj K. faces charges of murder, attempted murder, kidnapping
and being an accessory to genocide, prosecutors said. Formal
charges will be filed pending completion of an investigation, which
was expected to take several more months.
	   Federal prosecutors said the suspect will be tried in Bavaria,
where he was arrested Tuesday.
	   Prosecutors said they suspect Djuradj K., the former police
commander in the village of Vrbanjci, about 120 kilometers (75
miles) northwest of Sarajevo, ordered and participated in the
shooting of 16 Muslim men near his village on June 25, 1992. Eight
of the victims were confirmed dead; the fate of the others is
unknown.
	   The suspect also is believed to have been involved in a massacre
on Aug. 14, 1992 in nearby Dabovci, in which 18 Muslim men were
shot to death, and their bodies burned, prosecutors said.
Investigators were trying to determine whether he ordered or
participated in the killings.
	   Germany has tried three Bosnian war crimes suspect at the
request of the U.N. tribunal for former Yugoslavia in The Hague,
Netherlands. A fourth suspect arrested here, Dusan Tadic, was
turned over to the Hague for trial.

Iraq pleading for end to sanctions
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Iraq-UN &QL; 
 &UR; By HEMA SHUKLA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Iraq is trying to find a way out of its
deadlock with the United Nations and the United States by looking
for friends in other countries, the country's oil minister said
during a Wednesday visit to India.
	   Oil Minister Amir Muhammad Rasheed told reporters Iraq was
talking to other countries to explain that it no longer has illegal
weapons, and therefore should no longer be subject to crippling
U.N. sanctions.
	   The sanctions, which include a ban on air travel and limits on
oil sales, were imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait. They
were eased in 1996 for humanitarian reasons, letting Iraq sell oil
to buy food and medicine for its 22 million people.
	   Rasheed said Iraq had destroyed its weapons of mass destruction
by 1991, and accused the United States of extending sanctions for
political reasons.
	   Other countries ``will understand they have no grounds to
continue with this approach,'' he said. ``Iraq should be allowed to
export its commodities for the benefit of its people.''
	   Indian Petroleum Minister Vazhapadi Ramamurthy, with whom
Rasheed met over the last two days, said India was deeply concerned
about the plight of the Iraqi people because of the sanctions.
	   ``We in India look forward to the early lifting of sanctions on
Iraq,'' Ramamurthy said.
	   India and Iraq signed agreements Wednesday calling for future
cultural cooperation and for India one day to help Iraq identify
new oil fields. But close cooperation between Iraq and any country
is stalled by the sanctions.
	   A U.N. special commission is charged with identifying and
destroying Iraq's biological, chemical and nuclear weapons. Until
the commission certifies that Iraq is free of illegal weapons, the
Security Council will not lift economic sanctions.
	   Last month, Iraq suspended cooperation with U.N. weapons
inspectors, halting new arms inspections _ and delaying any
certification of Iraqi compliance. Iraq accuses the inspectors of
taking orders from the United States.
	   Prominent inspector Scott Ritter resigned from the commission
last month, accusing the United Nations and the United States of
doing too little to stop Iraq from producing and concealing
biological and chemical weapons.

Police arrest man for biting off chunk of nose
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Dutch police Wednesday arrested a
54-year-old man for biting off a chunk of another man's nose in an
argument last month. The officers also found the chunk of nose in
the arrested man's freezer.
	   The suspect told police he had kept the 2-by-2.5-centimeter
(0.8-by-1-inch) piece of nose, which was frozen in a glass of milk,
to prove he did not use a knife in the Aug. 14 attack in an
Amsterdam cafe, according to a police statement.
	   Police thawed out the piece of nose but said there was no longer
any chance of grafting it back on to the victim's face. The
suspect, whose name was not released, was expected to be charged
with aggravated assault.

	   GJIROKASTRA, Albania (AP) -- Police searching a village for
gunmen who blocked a main highway were met Wednesday by a hail of
gunfire in which eight officers were wounded. Police flew heavily
armed reinforcements to the area.
	   The opposition Democratic Party of former President Sali Berisha
accused the government of Prime Minister Fatos Nano of trying to
provoke the villagers, believed to be Berisha supporters.
	   Trouble started here Tuesday when armed civilians from the
nearby village of Lazarat blockaded the country's main north-south
highway near this town about 145 kilometers (90 miles) south of the
capital Tirana.
	   The reason for the blockade was unclear, but witnesses said 18
truck drivers as well as some private motorists were robbed or
shot.
	   Police commandos were rushed to the area and the civilians
dispersed late Tuesday. Early Wednesday, police entered Lazarat,
located on the top of a steep hill overlooking the highway, to
search for the ringleaders of the blockade.
	   But the villagers opened fire and drove police back down the
hill. Eight policemen -- four commandos and four local officers --
were wounded.
	   Three of the wounded officers were rushed to a hospital in
Ioannia, Greece, where a doctor said by telephone that their
condition was not life-threatening.
	   Police flew reinforcements by helicopter to the area from Tirana
but had so far made no further move to enter the village.
	   The incident was the latest sign of trouble for the Nano
government, which is facing a growing challenge from Berisha's
opposition. Berisha has called for more protest marches Friday,
accusing the government of corruption and of trying to stamp out
the opposition.
	   The former Communist country, among the poorest in Europe, has
barely recovered from last year's nationwide riots which erupted
after the collapse of pyramid investment schemes, which cost many
people their life-savings.
	   In addition, thousands of ethnic Albanians from neighboring
Kosovo province have streamed across the border to escape fighting
between Serb forces and secessionist rebels.
	   On Monday, about 2,000 protesters broke through police lines and
marched on the prime minister's office to demand the release of six
opposition politicians jailed since Aug. 23.
	   They were arrested in connection with last year's investment
scheme riots.
	   The 54-nation Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe has urged all sides to avoid provocations and violence.

Former premier may face charges connected to Chernobyl disaster
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ More than a decade after the
Chernobyl disaster, former Communist Premier Lubomir Strougal may
face charges of having withheld information on dangers caused by
the nuclear catastrophe, officials said Wednesday.
	   Strougal, 74, is suspected of abusing official power by
intentionally providing false or incomplete information on
radiation levels measured on Czechoslovak territory shortly after
the 1986 Chernobyl explosion.
	   The investigation is being carried out by the Office for
Investigation and Documentation of Communist Crimes, a watchdog
body with powers to prosecute.
	   According to the office's spokesman, Tomas Hornof, investigators
hope to decide within a month whether to press charges against
Strougal.
	   If convicted, Strougal, who was Czechoslovak premier from 1970
to 1988, could face a sentence of up to 15 years in prison.
	   Strougal immediately denied the accusations.

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Takashi Ishii scattered three hits over eight
innings as the Seibu Lions blanked the Pacific League's
front-running Nippon Ham Fighters 2-0 at Tokyo Dome on Wednesday.
	   Catcher Tsutomu Itoh hit a home run, his fourth of the season,
in the fifth and slugger Ken Suzuki belted a home run, his 18th of
the season, in the ninth for the Lions. Ishii is 7-3.
	   The Fighters, who suffered their fifth straight defeat, are
still 1 1/2 games ahead of the second-place Lions, who extended
their winning streak to five.
	   At Osaka Dome, Tuffy Rhodes belted a two-run home run in the
fourth, leading the Kintetsu Buffaloes to a 4-1 victory over the
Fukuoka Daiei Hawks.
	   Rhodes, formerly with the Boston Red Sox, has 18 homers.
	   At Chiba, the Chiba Lotte Marines beat the Orix BlueWave 7-5 on
three homers, including a three-run homer by Yukihiko Satoh in the
first inning. Satoh has seven homers.
	   In the Central League, the front-running Yokohama BayStars
scored on Toshihisa Nishi's error and blanked the Yomiuri Giants
1-0 at Yokohama.
	   Hisashi Tokano (6-6) gave up four hits over seven innings and
relievers Hideki Igarashi and Kazuhiro Sasaki held the Giants
hitless in the last two innings.
	   The BayStars are two games ahead of the second-place Chunichi
Dragons, who ended their losing streak at three with a 3-1 victory
over the Hiroshima Toyo Carp on two homers, including a
round-tripper by Takeshi Yamasaki, at Hiroshima. Yamasaki has 20
homers.
	   Sun Dong-yol, formerly with the Hai Tai Tigers of South Korea's
professional baseball league, limited the Carp to three hits and
one run in the last inning for his 23rd save.
	   At Koshien Stadium, Kazuhisa Ishii hurled a four-hitter over
eight innings for a 11-6 record and also singled home a
tie-breaking run against Darrel May in the sixth as the Yakult
Swallows beat the Hanshin Tigers 4-1 and moved into the third
place. The Tigers are .001 percentage points ahead of the Giants,
who fell to fourth.
	   May, formerly with the Anaheim Angels, took the loss. He is 4-7.

	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Acclaimed playwright Wole Soyinka is among
a group of Nigerian dissidents who are planning to return from
exile if the military regime drops criminal charges against them, a
newspaper reported Wednesday.
	   The exiled activists met recently in London and collectively
decided to return to their homeland if Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar's
government formally withdraws murder, treason and other charges
lodged by late dictator Gen. Sani Abacha, the Lagos daily This Day
reported.
	   The exiles have also demanded the repeal of decrees allowing the
government to detain opponents without trial.
	   In a communique, the activists said ``positive changes have
occurred in Nigeria, although we are disturbed that the culture of
military repression has remained intact.''
	   Soyinka, who won the Nobel Prize for literature in 1986, fled
Nigeria in 1995 after learning that military authorities were going
to arrest him for criticizing the government. He is currently
teaching at Emory University in Atlanta.
	   Abacha widely trumped up allegations, jailed and sometimes
executed his critics, prompting international condemnation of
Nigeria's government.
	   Abubakar, who took over after Abacha's sudden death in early
June, has appealed to exiles to return home before national
elections scheduled for Feb. 27.
	   -----
	   LOME, Togo (AP) _ More than two months after widely discredited
elections restored President Gnassingbe Eyadema to power, the
leader has announced a cabinet. Opposition groups boycotted offers
to join.
	   Eyadema announced in a state television broadcast Tuesday
evening that his 27-member government consisted of 12 new
appointees and 15 holdovers from the president's previous
administration. Three members had changed portfolios.
	   The country's most popular opposition leader, Gilchrist Olympio,
has launched a series of scattered protests after the elections, in
which vote-counting was interrupted and Eyadema was declared winner
despite protests from international observers.
	   The government accused unnamed insurgents of trying to attack
the capital from across the border in neighboring Ghana last month.
Olympio responded saying the charge was a trumped up excuse to
crack down on critics.
	   -----
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Rabies has infected more than 200 people
in the past two months in the central Angolan province of Bie, news
reports said Wednesday.
	   There is no human antidote available in the province, about 250
kilometers (150 miles) southeast of the capital Luanda, for the
animal-carried virus, the Portuguese news agency Lusa quoted a
health official as saying.
	   Some 5,000 animals, including dogs, cats and monkeys, were
vaccinated in a one-month-old campaign to eradicate the deadly
virus in the former Portuguese colony, according to Lusa.
	   Rabies, a viral disease spread by the bite of an infected
animal, is common in Africa, India and Southeast Asia. It claims
around 15,000 human lives around the world every year.
	   -----
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ A television host was
recovering in a hospital Wednesday after being shot during a
robbery attempt at his home.
	   David Williams was attacked Monday night after driving through
the gates to his driveway, a common type of crime in the
high-walled suburbs of Johannesburg.
	   Williams co-hosts a weekly sports show on South African
Broadcasting Corp.
	   The assailants fired two shots before running away.
	   One of the bullets grazed Williams' face and the other went
through his body close to the pelvis.
	   ``I was very lucky indeed,'' Williams told South African Press
Assoction from his hospital bed. ``One feels angry about it, but
I'm not considering moving to another suburb as this kind of crime
is not restricted to any specific area.''
	   Crime, particularly car-jackings, robberies and murder, runs
rampant in South Africa's cities.
	   -----
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ The Uganda Revenue Authority has
appointed Briton David Child as its deputy director general in
order to help improve operations, a newspaper report said
Wednesday.
	   The government-owned New Vision newspaper said Child's
appointment would be followed by the recruitment of four other
foreigners, all with expertise in their fields.
	   The appointments were made through the British Department for
International Development, the New Vision said.
	   It said Child was to arrive in the country shortly and serve a
two-year contract.
	   The report said the Department for International Development
would pay all expenses for Child and the other four foreigners, who
will have contracts spanning from six months to two years depending
on their posts.

Cambodia's king invites feuding parties to `family meeting'
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES with king's planned meeting; EDITS

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ King Norodom Sihanouk on Wednesday
invited election officials and representatives of the country's
three main political parties for a meeting to discuss Cambodia's
political crisis.
	   The influential monarch's invitation was immediately accepted by
the ruling party of strongman Hun Sen as well as the opposition,
whose refusal to accept the results of July's parliamentary
elections have sparked the crisis.
	   Thousands of opposition supporters meanwhile continued street
protests Wednesday over the results of the July 26 poll, which they
claim was marred by fraud and other irregularities.
	   Opposition leader Prince Norodom Ranariddh said Wednesday that
there would be no end to the crisis unless the king prevailed upon
Hun Sen to compromise and allow a fair review of the election
results.
	   Hun Sen's ruling Cambodian People's Party was officially named
the election winner on Tuesday. The final tally, which mirrored
preliminary results announced three weeks ago, gave Hun Sen a
slight majority of 64 of the 122 National Assembly seats with just
41 percent of the popular vote.
	   However, he still lacks the two-thirds majority needed to form a
new government and the opposition has refused to join a coalition
or support a new government until its complaints are addressed.
	   Hun Sen and other senior members of his party were scheduled to
travel to the northern city of Siem Reap Thursday to meet Sihanouk
at his palace there.
	   Before the king's invitation for a tri-party meeting was
announced, they had been expected to seek the king's necessary
permission to form a new government.
	   Sihanouk, in a statement released Wednesday evening, said the
purpose of the new meeting he had called for Saturday through
Monday was ``to discuss different issues that have created a great
political crisis in our motherland.''
	   The king, who is fond referring to the Cambodian people as his
``children,'' described it as a ``family meeting.''
	   ``I cannot promise the meeting will have a positive result but I
hope it will be useful in making the nation feel better during this
current political crisis,'' wrote Sihanouk.
	   Round-the-clock anti-government protests on the streets of the
capital entered their 10th day Wednesday. Thousands of student-led
demonstrators gathered in front of the Royal Palace in a symbolic
appeal for him to convince Hun Sen to properly address hundreds of
alleged election irregularities.
	   The National Election Committee and the country's highest
appeals body, the Constitutional Council, have rejected all of the
opposition's complaints from the polls. Both bodies are controlled
by Hun Sen's supporters.
	   Joined by motorbike and pedicab drivers and laborers, the
students marched through the capital, clogging traffic and carrying
banners reading: ``Cambodian people do not need Hun Sen anymore''
and ``Hun Sen is a killer.''
	   They also protested before the headquarters of the European
Union, the main foreign financial donor to the elections, and urged
the international community to withdraw an assessment by observers
that the election was free and fair enough to be credible.
	   Many then returned to a park outside the National Assembly where
thousands of people have camped in a tent city to protest Hun Sen.
	   At a news conference, Ranariddh, head of the FUNCINPEC party,
appealed to Sihanouk ``to try to convince the leadership of the CPP
to be reasonable ... and to help resolve the current crisis before
it is really too late.''
	   ``If there is no solution it will be a very difficult future for
Cambodia,'' Ranariddh said, emphasizing possible adverse economic
consequences. ``And Hun Sen alone has to bear responsibility for
it.''
	   Ranariddh, who was deposed by Hun Sen as co-prime minister in a
bloody coup a year ago, said the king should not pressure FUNCINPEC
and its opposition ally, the Sam Rainsy Party, to join a coalition
with Hun Sen.

	   DURBAN, South Africa (AP) _ Hopes for peace in the Congo won a
boost Wednesday as all parties involved in the conflict agreed to
meet at a summit of the Nonaligned Movement for talks brokered by
the head of the United Nations.
	   Taking officials by surprise, Congo President Laurent Kabila
arrived at the conference hall here. In a sign of hostility towards
mediation efforts by South Africa, he bypassed the official
greeting offered by President Nelson Mandela to arriving heads of
state.
	   Summit sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, later said
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan would hold a two-hour breakfast
meeting with Kabila and leaders from all states caught up in the
Congo rebellion.
	   Leaders from Angola, Namibia and Zimbabwe _ who have all sent
troops to support Kabila _ will sit face-to-face at the meeting
with leaders from Rwanda and Uganda, who Kabila alleges are backing
the rebels.
	   The officials said there had already been intense efforts toward
getting the parties to agree to a ceasefire, but would not be drawn
out on prospects for an agreement emerging from the meeting at
which no rebel representitives will be present.
	   Kabila has refused a cease-fire so far, saying it is impossible
with Rwandan and Ugandan troops on Congolese soil. However, both
those countries deny being involved.
	   After a series of rapid rebel gains, Kabila's forces, backed by
the military might of his allies, have turned the tide of war and
are now pushing the insurgents back towards Congo's eastern
borders.
	   Annan, addressing the summit, earlier appealed for Africa's
leaders to solve their problems through political and not military
means.
	   ``For every day that we fail to do so, the innocent people of
this continent pay a terrible price,'' Annan said, citing trouble
spots including Congo and Angola, where he said the U.N.-brokered
peace process is ``hanging by a thread.''
	   South African President Nelson Mandela and his new wife Graca
Machel _ widow of Mozambican leader and black liberation leader
Samora Machel _ greeted the heads of state Wednesday morning.
	   Cuban President Fidel Castro and Mandela exchanged an especially
warm embrace.
	   ``Fidel, Fidel, Fidel,'' Mandela said as he threw his arms
around Castro, dressed in a grey business suit. The two old
revolutionaries hugged, then Castro embraced Mrs. Machel.

	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran has banned a book about freedoms
granted to women by Islam's Prophet Mohammed, the Tehran Times
daily reported Wednesday.
	   The English-language newspaper said that the Ministry of Culture
and Islamic Guidance banned the book by Seyed Mohsen Saeedzadeh
because it contained ``materials disrespecting the holy Prophet of
Islam.''
	   The author had ``attributed obscene affairs to the holy
Prophet,'' the newspaper. It gave no details about the book or
describe the specific passages that ran afoul of the authorities.
	   Offended for similar reasons, Iran issued a religious edict in
1989 ordering Muslims to seek out and kill the author of ``The
Satanic Verses,'' Salman Rushdie, an Indian-born British writer.

Police target dozens of suspected pedophiles in 12-country raids

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES to add details about Australian arrests and Italian
raids &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Police in 12 countries raided the homes of more
than 100 suspected pedophiles Wednesday in what authorities called
one of the largest efforts ever to break an Internet child
pornography ring.
	   The British National Crime Squad coordinated the early morning
raids as part of a five-month investigation into the so-called
Wonderland club, which authorities said exchanged pornographic
pictures of children as young as 2 on the Internet.
	   During the investigation, code-named ``Cathedral,'' police said
they found a database containing more than 100,000 pornographic
photographs of naked boys and girls and confiscated computers and
computer programs from dozens of suspects.
	   Police said they targeted 180 suspects and arrested more than
100 in the raids, which took place at 0400 GMT on three continents
_ in Australia, Austria, Belgium, Britain, Finland, France,
Germany, Italy, Norway, Portugal, Sweden and the United States.
	   ``I am unaware of another police operation that has ever pulled
together so many law enforcement agencies worldwide to effect
simultaneous raids and arrests,'' said Bob Packham, deputy director
general of the National Crime Squad.
	   In Britain, police arrested 11 men in a raid on 14 addresses.
Raids were carried out on 23 addresses in the United States, and
four in Australia. One man was arrested in Sweden, and French
police arrested four people after raids in Roubaix, Strasbourg,

McLaren defends Coultard amid Ferrari allegations
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WOKING, England (AP) _ McLaren Formula One racing team Wednesday
hit back at Ferrari's continued attack on David Coulthard in the
wake of the collision which put Michael Schumacher out of the
Belgian Grand Prix on Sunday.
	   Ferrari released a statement late Tuesday blaming McLaren driver
Coulthard for the collision with Schumacher, which cost the Ferrari
driver a possible lead in the drivers' championship.
	   Ferrari accused Coulthard of breaking the rules and causing the
collision as Schumacher, who had built a half-minute lead in the
wet conditions, attempted to overtake him.
	   In the pits after the accident, Schumacher had to be restrained
by team officials from attacking Coulthard, who later said his
German rival had ``behaved like an animal.''
	   Damon Hill evenutally won the race, while Coulthard finished
seventh and his team mate, Mika Hakkinen, maintained a seven point
lead over Schumacher in the drivers' standings.
	   McLaren released a statement Wednesday saying it was
understandable that immediately after the incident, ``emotions were
running high and incorrect conclusions reached.''
	   ``It is our regret that this incident occurred and that its
subsequent interpretation by Ferrari has challenged the intergrity
of our team and its driver,'' the statement said.
	   ``It is clear that the incident was accidental and a consequence
of the actions of both drivers involved who were competing in
appalling conditions.''
	   After interviewing Coulthard and reviewing car performance data
provided by Formula One world governing body, FIA, Belgian Grand
Prix stewards concluded Coulthard had no case to answer.
	   ``McLaren wishes to continue to compete in a sporting manner and
does not wish to become involved in a protracted public discussion
with Ferrari, but extends an invitation to discuss the matter
further in private if there is a wish to do so,'' the McLaren
statement said.
	   Ferrari's statement said team officials had re-examined all the
film and photographic evidence of the crash, which showed beyond
doubt that Coulthard had breached the rules.
	   Ferrari said Coulthard ignored the blue flags for almost an
entire lap and never gave way to Schumacher as required by the
rules.
	   ``Coulthard's sudden deceleration, while on the racing line, was
sudden and premature. Given the poor visibility, he made the
accident unavoidable despite Schumacher's extreme efforts to avoid
one,'' the statement said.
	   ``Ferrari will make no further statement about what happened and
considers the incident closed. We now look forward to a return to a
healthy climate of competition.''
	   Schumacher and Coulthard were to share the track at Monza,
Italy, during testing Wednesday.

Virenque asked Tour bosses not to start drugs probe, official says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ French cyclist Richard Virenque urged authorities
not to take disciplinary action against him for illegal drug use, a
senior cycling official said Wednesday.
	   Virenque, one of France's top cyclists, is a member of the
Festina team that was expelled from the Tour de France after the
team admitted to the systematic use of the banned substance EPO.
	   Virenque has consistently denied using the drug.
	   Daniel Baal, President of the French Cycling Federation and
vice-president of the world governing body, the International
Cycling Union (UCI), said that the cyclist pressed him not to
proceed with disciplinary action once the revelations about the use
of EPO became public.
	   ``He would have preferred for there not have been a disciplinary
procedure,'' he told Europe 1 radio. ``I explained to him that it
was my responsibility to open a case the moment that we knew of a
number of incidents.''

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Striker Kennet Andersson is suffering
from a thigh injury and will sit out Saturday's European
Championship qualifying match against England.
	   The loss of Andersson could be critical in what many see as one
of Sweden's most crucial matches in years.
	   ``This feels really sad,'' Andersson was quoted as saying by the
Swedish news agency TT on Tuesday.
	   ``Kennet has a hemorrhage in the muscle attachment in the back
of the leg, an injury that takes about three weeks to heal,'' team
physician Dr. Magnus Forsblad said.

In parliament, election-time clash over Germany's economic future
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ With elections less than a month away,
Germany's finance minister asserted Wednesday that a victory by the
opposition Social Democrats would hurt Europe's biggest economy.
	   The attack was part of a parliamentary debate marked by sharp
rhetoric as both major parties seized the final chance to campaign
on that stage before voters elect a new chamber on Sept. 27.
	   A showdown was due Thursday when Chancellor Helmut Kohl and
front runner Gerhard Schroeder, the Social Democrats' candidate,
promote competing visions of the nation's economic future in their
speeches _ the closest they will come to a head-on debate.
	   A poll published Wednesday showed the Social Democrats slipping
and slight gains for Kohl's center-right Christian Democrats.
	   The Allensbach Institute survey gave Schroeder's party 41.1
percent of the vote, down from 42.7 percent a week earlier. The
Christian Democrats polled 35.5 percent, up from 35.2 percent. The
margin of error was 2.5 percent.
	   The Social Democrats sought to focus Wednesday's budget debate
on Germany's 4.1 million jobless, but Finance Minister Theo Waigel
pointed to an upswing in the economy and claimed a ``turnaround''
in the job market.
	   Had the Social Democrats been in power, he asserted, there would
be ``high inflation, high interest rates, economic stagnation, a
weak German mark and now a weak euro.''
	   He accused the opposition of duping voters with a campaign of
``empty words'' about modernizing the welfare-state economy without
saying who would pay the tab.
	   ``Whoever votes for the Social Democrats is ultimately voting
for higher taxes,'' he charged.
	   In reply, the Social Democrats called the government's talk of
unemployment bottoming out ``cynical'' and pronounced its economic
policy a failure.
	   With an eye on left-leaning governments in power in many
European nations, including France and Britain, party chairman
Oskar Lafontaine said the Social Democrats would seek a common
approach to combating joblessness if elected.
	   ``We will ensure that the fight against unemployment is moved to
the center of European politics,'' he said.
	   He did not say whether the Social Democrats would pump money
into new EU jobs programs, something Kohl has staunchly refused.
	   ``We need a new way of thinking in German economic and financial
policy,'' including putting more money in workers' pockets so they
can boost the economy by spending it, he said.
	   Waigel introduced the government's proposed 465 billion mark
(dlrs 266 billion) budget for next year, though parliament's
schedule rules out passage before the elections.

Germany pledges aid for Kosovo refugees
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Yugoslavia-Kosovo &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Germany pledged 7.5 million marks (dlrs 4.3
million) in aid Wednesday for refugees from the fighting in
Serbia's Kosovo province.
	   The aid, earmarked mostly for refugees who have fled to the
neighboring Yugoslav republic of Montenegro, is part of German
efforts to keep them from heading to western Europe, development
ministry spokesman Leo Kreuz said.
	   ``Germany cannot absorb another large inflow of refugees'' as it
did during the Bosnian war, he said.
	   Most of the money will be channeled through international aid
agencies to provide food. One third will go for providing water and
shelter for the refugees, Kreuz said.

Senior Muslim, Christian clergymen condone use of Viagra
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Two senior Christian and Muslim clergymen
said in remarks published Wednesday that they would accept the use
of Viagra with the aim of strengthening relations between married
couples.
	   Grand Ayatollah Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah, a senior Shiite
Muslim cleric, said Sharia, or Islamic law, does not prohibit the
use of the U.S. impotence drug.
	   ``Sharia has no problem in the use of Viagra when there is a
need for it provided that there are no big negative results,''
Fadlallah said in an interview with the leading An-Nahar newspaper.
	   Fadlallah pointed out that sexual impotence can upset a married
couple's life and ``may reflect negatively on a man's behavior and
psychological life.''
	   The Greek Orthodox bishop of Mount Lebanon, George Khodor, said
there is no need to take the Viagra pill if relations between a
married couple are ``psychologically sound.''
	   ``But if there is a definite need for the use of Viagra or other
(anti-impotence) pills, let it be at a doctor's prescription. In
this case, Viagra becomes like a medicine,'' Khodor said in the
same interview with An-Nahar.
	   Viagra is still banned in most Arab states because of reports of
its negative side-effects.
	   The Lebanese Health Ministry has not yet approved the sale of
Viagra, which is reportedly selling for dlrs 50 a tablet on the
black market. It sells for about dlrs 10 per pill in the United
States.
	   On Wednesday, An-Nahar quoted Michel Abela, chairman of the
Lebanese Pharmacists' Association, as warning drug stores against
the sale of Viagra before obtaining the necessary permission from
authorities.
	   Abela said an inspection of 60 pharmacies found no trace of
Viagra. But he acknowledged that there was demand for the pill and
``some pharmacies may be selling it secretly.''
	   Lebanese authorities also have banned the harvesting of a local
plant known as Shirsh Zallouh, which has been touted by Beirut
media as the ``Lebanese Viagra.''
	   The recent ban by the Agriculture Ministry came after a sudden
surge in demand for Shirsh Zallouh raised scientists' fears about
the plant's extinction.
	   Shirsh Zallouh, Arabic for ``hairy root,'' has grown in
Lebanon's mountains for millennia. Herbalists had in the past
prescribed it as a stimulant.
	   In recent weeks, people have climbed eastern Lebanon's mountains
and the biblical Mount Hermon in the south to gather the plant for
personal use or for sale.

World Cup champ denies using drugs
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: REPEATING to European lines to CORRECT category code to ``s'';
CORRECTS to Maier in 8th graf. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ World Cup overall champion Hermann Maier
on Wednesday refuted suggestions made by an Italian doctor that he
used performance-enhancing drugs last season enroute to the title.
	   ``I have definitely not taken drugs. Something like that is
unnecessary,'' Maier told the Austria Press Agency after he
returned from a month-long team training session in New Zealand.
	   Italian sports daily Gazzetta dello Sport reported in its
Saturday edition that a doctor with the Italian winter sports
federation suspected Austrian skiers of doping.
	   Herbert Schonhuber said he had no proof of doping, but he
questioned the increased muscle mass of Maier and other Austrian
skiiers, Gazzetta dello Sport reported.
	   Schonhuber, head of the Italian federation's medical commission,
said the muscle growth is ``impossible with normal weight work or
with electro-stimulation. You can't get them with clean methods,''
the Italian paper said.
	   The doctor said both Maier, who made his debut on the World Cup
circuit last season, and World Cup downhill champion Andreas
Schifferer worked with Bernd Pansold, a doctor on trial in Berlin _
along with other communist-era sports figures _ for harming East
German swimmers with performance-enhancing drugs.
	   However, Schonhuber told Austria's Salzburger Nachrichten
newspaper: ``I have never _ not even in this interview with
Gazzetta _ claimed that the Austrians and Maier used drugs.
	   ``I had merely reported to the newspaper that all last season
the ski circuit speculated over whether Maier had,'' the Salzburger
Nachrichten reported in its Wednesday edition.
	   Skiers are regularly tested for doping. Maier told APA he was
tested three times during the World Cup season, and once during the
Olympic Games. All the tests proved negative.
	   Maier said similar allegations have been made before about
skiers who come out of nowhere to make a name for themselves on the
World Cup circuit.
	   At the Olympic Games in Nagano, Maier recovered from a
spectacular crash in the men's downhill to win two gold medals. He
also won the World Cup super-giant slalom and giant slalom titles
in addition to his overall crown.

More drugs wash up on Japanese coast
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Police said Wednesday that they found eight bags of
illegal stimulants washed up on the shore of southwestern Japan,
the third such find in less than two weeks.
	   The bags, containing 68.8 kilograms (152 pounds) of
amphetamines, were found by police on the coast near the rural town
of Kubokawa in Kochi prefecture, a Kubokawa police spokesman said.
	   That brings the total amount of illegal stimulants found in the
area since Aug. 23 to 170.8 kilograms (376 pounds), police said.
	   Police in Kobokawa, about 625 kilometers (387 miles) southwest
of Tokyo, said they were still investigating the matter.
	   But news reports said the drugs, which have a total street value
of about 10 billion yen (dlrs 75 million), were probably lost by
smugglers.
	   Stimulants are the most common type of drug in Japan and gained
popularity during World War II, when they were used by the Japanese
military to enhance soldiers' combat performance.

Eight police wounded after armed civilians block national road
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HEKTOR PUSTINA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer-

<TEXT>
	   GJIROKASTRA, Albania (AP) _ Gunmen fired Wednesday on police
searching a village for civilians who had blocked a major highway,
wounding eight of the officers. Police responded by flying heavily
armed reinforcements to the area.
	   The opposition Democratic Party of former President Sali Berisha
accused the government of Prime Minister Fatos Nano of trying to
provoke residents of the village, a Berisha stronghold.
	   The incident was the latest sign of trouble for Nano's
government. The Berisha-led opposition accuses the government of
incompetence and corruption, while the government accuses Berisha
and his supporters of trying to destabilize it.
	   Unrest started here Tuesday when armed civilians from the nearby
village of Lazarat blockaded the country's main north-south highway
near this town about 145 kilometers (90 miles) south of the capital
Tirana.
	   The reason for the blockade was unclear, but witnesses said 18
truck drivers as well as some private motorists were robbed or
shot.
	   When police commandos began arriving in the area, the civilians
manning the blockade dispersed late Tuesday. Early Wednesday,
police entered Lazarat, located on a steep hill overlooking the
highway, to search for ringleaders of the blockade.
	   But the villagers opened fire and drove police back down the
hill. Eight policemen _ four commandos and four local officers _
were wounded.
	   Three of the wounded officers were taken to a hospital in
Ioannia, Greece, where a doctor said by telephone that their
conditions were not life-threatening.
	   Police flew reinforcements by helicopter to the area from Tirana
but had so far made no further move to enter the village.
	   Formerly communist Albania, among the poorest countries inhich
cost many people their life savings.
	   In addition, thousands of ethnic Albanians from Kosovo province
in neighboring Yugoslavia have streamed across the border to escape
fighting between Serb forces and secessionist rebels.
	   On Monday, about 2,000 protesters broke through police lines and
marched on Prime Minister Nano's office to demand the release of
six opposition politicians jailed since Aug. 23.
	   Berisha, who was defeated by Nano in last year's elections, has
called for protest marches on Friday.

Annan to hold talks with Greek Cypriot leader
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DURBAN, South Africa (AP) _ Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides
wants to raise the issue of divided Cyprus with U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan at the ongoing summit of the
Nonaligned Movement, a diplomatic source said Wednesday.
	   Speaking on condition of anonymity, a member of the Cypriot
delegation said Clerides would discuss the latest developments on
the divided island, including a recent Turkish Cypriot proposal for
reunification of the island through a two-state confederation.
	   They were to meet Thursday afternoon, he said.
	   Clerides has rejected the proposal as tantamount to partition of
the island, branding it ``contrary and contemptuous'' of U.N.
Security Council resolutions that reject recognition of the
breakaway Turkish Cypriot state.
	   ``This is just a good opportunity to talk'' with Annan, the
delegate said. ``I don't expect any new proposals to come out of
it. They will just discuss the latest developments.''
	   The proposal was made Monday by Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf
Denktash and Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem during Cem's visit
to the north of the island.
	   The Mediterranean island has been divided since Turkish troops
invaded after an abortive coup by Greek Cypriots, who favored union
with Greece. About 35,000 Turkish forces remain in northern Cyprus.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comment from Blair as British debate opens, Sinn

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Irish and British lawmakers
debated in emergency sessions Wednesday whether to enact
anti-terrorist measures against IRA dissidents responsible for last
month's slaying of 28 people in the Northern Ireland town of Omagh.
	   The so-called Real Irish Republican Army planted the car bomb as
part of its campaign against April's compromise agreement on how
Protestants and Catholics should govern Northern Ireland together.
	   British Prime Minister Tony Blair urged lawmakers in London to
approve his Conspiracy and Terrorism Bill as ``a proportionate and
targeted response to deal with small evil groups of violent men who
seek to wreck the hopes for peace which the great majority yearn
for and have voted for.''
	   In a parallel debate in the Irish parliament in Dublin, Prime
Minister Bertie Ahern told lawmakers: ``The attack on Omagh was not
just an indiscriminate attack on democracy and the Good Friday
agreement. It was a reckless attack on a community, a whole
people.''
	   Ahern and Blair expect both their parliaments to approve by
Thursday night legislation restricting the right to silence for
suspected IRA dissidents and granting more weight to police
opinions in securing convictions.
	   In Dublin, the only early critic of the proposals in the
166-seat chamber came from the sole Sinn Fein lawmaker. ``The
political blunders and legal injustices of the past are being
repeated,'' said Caoimhghin O Caolain, who vowed to ``oppose this
bill in its entirety.''

National carrier loses nearly half-a-million passengers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Frequent strikes, long delays, and a
failure to fly on time cost Olympic Airways nearly half-a-million
passengers in the first seven months of this year.
	   According to figures published Wednesday, the ailing national
carrier lost 455,107 passengers from January to July, an 11.02
percent drop compared to the same period last year. But income from
lost passengers only dropped 0.2 percent, mainly due to a five
percent rise in the price of tickets.
	   ``On the one hand these figures show the discomfort of Olympic's
passengers and the defamation of the country abroad,'' said Aris
Spiliotopoulos, spokesman for the main opposition conservative New
Democracy party. ``On the other hand they show the complete failure
of the government's program to reform the company,''
	   It was latest blow for the debt-burdened state airline, which
could still close if management does not fully apply a
restructuring program and slash spending by 50 billion drachmas
(dlrs 155 million) per year over the next five years.
	   Olympic posted an estimated 6 billion to 6.5 billion drachmas
(dlrs 18-20 million) loss in 1997. This fall Olympic is expected to
seek a dlrs one billion loan for the purchase of four Airbus 340's
and eight Boeing 737-800's.
	   In a law suit against Olympic last month, an employees union
claimed mismanagement caused the cancellation of 2,136 flights in
the first six months of this year at a cost of 3.2 billion drachmas
(dlrs 10.8 million).
	   The state-owned airline was beset by near daily strikes and
labor actions by pilots and flight attendants protesting plans to
reform Olympic. Air crews mostly staged work-to-rule actions and
refused to work overtimes.
	   They have blamed Olympic's management for the losses, saying the
airline scheduled more flights than its air crews could staff,
leading to numerous cancellations.
	   Staff shortages have led to frequent delays for both domestic
and international flights, said Yannis Economides, the president of
the flight attendants union.
	   A dispute between the union and management over hiring 280 new
flight attendants contributed to delays on at least four
international flights on Monday, Economides said.
	   The airline's management ``must take more positive action,
otherwise things will get worse,'' he added.

Blast in bus in Kashmir leaves 1 dead, 12 injured
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAMMU, India (AP) _ A blast in a bus in Jammu-Kashmir state on
Wednesday left one person dead and 12 army soldiers wounded as the
chief minister was touring the area to monitor increased
secessionist violence, police said.
	   No one immediately claimed responsibility for the blast in
Nabna, a village in Poonch district that borders Pakistan, India's
hostile neighbor. State police officials quickly blamed guerrillas
who want predominately Muslim Kashmir to break away from mostly
Hindu India.
	   The bus, contracted out to the army, was transporting soldiers
from Poonch to Jammu, the winter capital of the Himalayan
territory. The blast occurred just after the bus had left Poonch,
180 kilometers (110 miles) northwest of Jammu, police said. The
driver, a civilian, was killed.
	   Chief Minister Farooq Abdullah, the state's highest elected
official, was not injured. He was meeting elsewhere with police and
administration officials on how to restore peace to Poonch
district. In recent months, more than 150 people have been killed
in militant attacks in Poonch and the adjoining district of
Rajauri.
	   The attacks increased following rising tension between India and
Pakistan after both nations tested nuclear devices in May. Soldiers
across the frontier exchanged gun and mortar fire, leaving hundreds
dead or injured.
	   More than 16,000 people have been killed since the separatist
movement began in 1989. India accuses Pakistan of training and
arming the rebels, a charge Pakistan denies.
	   Pakistan and India have fought two wars over Kashmir, a
territory divided between them that both claim in its entirety.

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DURBAN, South Africa (AP) _ President Nelson Mandela on
Wednesday accused Israel of blocking Mideast peace, saying Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's administration had ``narrow,
chauvinistic interests.''
	   ``We remain gravely concerned about ... the positions taken by
the Netanyahu administration in Israel, which has blocked progress
toward a just and peaceful solution,'' Mandela told 53 heads of
government attending the Nonaligned Movement summit.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, also attending the summit,
denied Netanyahu's assertion that Israeli and Palestinian
negotiators had been close to restarting talks on Israeli troop
withdrawal from the West Bank.
	   ``There is nothing close,'' Arafat told The Associated Press.
``There is still a far distance.''
	   Arafat rejected Netanyahu's claim that the Palestinians were
holding up progress, saying the Netanyahu administration has
refused to accept Washington's peace initiative for the region.
	   Mandela, who greeted Arafat at the summit with a hug and a kiss,
urged renewed efforts to create a Palestinian state.
	   ``The international community, and the United States in
particular, should ensure that this matter is addressed
expeditiously,'' Mandela told the heads of state.
	   ``We should not allow that the narrow, chauvinistic interests of
the current administration in Israel should succeed to block the
prospect of a permanent and just peace throughout the Middle East.

EU flight ban on Yugoslav airlines could come into effect next week
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ A European Union ban on commercial
flights by Yugoslav companies could come into force next week after
Greece dropped its veto, EU officials said Wednesday.
	   The ban was agreed in principle by the leaders of the 15 EU
nations in June at a summit in Cardiff, Wales, adding to sanctions
aimed at halting the clampdown in Kosovo by Yugoslav forces.
	   Footdragging by Britain and Greece had prevented the EU from
putting the plan into practice, but on Monday Greece agreed to drop
its veto. Now, the measure should now be formally adopted Sept. 7.
	   Britain had earlier lifted its objections. The ban should come
into force after the regulation is translated into the nine
official EU languages and formally entered into the Union's rule
book. EU officials declined to say how long that would take, but
said it could be as early as next week.
	   The ban would prohibit commercial flights by Yugoslav airlines
to and from airports in the 15 EU nations. Yugoslav companies
currently operate daily flights to most major capitals in Europe.
	   EU foreign ministers are scheduled to discuss the Union's
responses to the situation in Kosovo when they meet this weekend in
Salzburg, Austria.

NFL '98: Millions and billions for everybody
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BARRY WILNER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The players are getting rich, the club owners
are getting very rich and television is willing to pay for it all.
The U.S. National Football League, with labor peace well into the
next decade, is in the best shape of any U.S. professional sport as
it approaches the new millennium.
	   Not even the impending retirement of such stars as John Elway,
Dan Marino and Reggie White can take away from the glow.
	   These are grand times for American pro gridiron football, which
has no lockout woes, no ratings problems and plenty of big names
and showcase teams to go around.
	   ``The new television deal is the most significant in TV
history,'' Pat Bowlen, owner of the Super Bowl champion Denver
Broncos, says of the dlrs 17.6 billion, eight-year contract the
league signed with commerical networks Fox, CBS and ABC and ABC's
cable outlet ESPN.
	   ``Not just measured by length or by the revenue involved, but
most importantly by ensuring the stability of the NFL,'' he says.
``We all desire stability in our franchises, and this long-term
deal benefits that in every way.''
	   As does the collective bargaining agreement, which was extended
in the offseason through 2003.
	   When the season begins Sept. 6, each of the 30 NFL teams will
have seen the salary cap rise by more than dlrs 11 million. That's
meant huge deals for the likes of Dana Stubblefield, Curtis Martin,
John Randle, Sean Gilbert, Bryce Paup, John Copeland, Yancey
Thigpen, Ray Crockett, Kevin Mawae, Doug Evans, Aaron Taylor,
Natrone Means, Todd Steussie ... shall we go on?
	   In other words, money for everyone.
	   And there's more coming. Lots more.
	   Two days after the season begins, the league will introduce the
winner of bidding for the Cleveland Browns expansion team that
begins play next year. The expected price tag: close to dlrs 500
million.
	   And because that will bring the NFL membership to 31,
necessitating a bye each week of 1999 season, further expansion
will come very soon. Some are predicting the cost for an expansion
franchise will soon reach dlrs 1 billion.
	   But this is the 1998 season, which begins with an AFC team on
top for the first time since 1984. The Broncos won a thrilling
Super Bowl over Green Bay, and they weren't raided the way most
defending champions are. John Elway decided to return for one more
season, Terrell Davis is one of American football's most dominant
players and the Broncos should have another strong run in them.
	   As should the Packers, who did take some big hits in the
offseason (Evans, Taylor, Gabe Wilkins, Edgar Bennett, Eugene
Robinson) and saw No. 1 running back Dorsey Levens hold out through
training camp.
	   Green Bay has the league's best player in quarterback Brett
Favre, who has won three straight Most Valuable Player awards. It
has White back for one more year _ and it has the memory of the
super loss to Denver.
	   ``All last year we felt like we were the best, but for one day
the Denver Broncos were better than us and they're crowned the
champs,'' Packers receiver Antonio Freeman says. ``It's not an easy
thing to accept. But time is the best healer.''
	   Time is on the side of the league's two newest quarterback
phenoms, Peyton Manning in Indianapolis and Ryan Leaf in San Diego.
The first two choices in the draft, they were handed the starting
jobs right away and their progress will be noted each week,
especially in Week 5, when they face off in Indianapolis.
	   Marv Levy retired just short of becoming the oldest coach in NFL
history, with Wade Phillips taking over in Buffalo. Jim Mora gets
to oversee Manning's development with the Colts. Jon Gruden, who
just turned 35 _ three players on his preseason roster were older _
gets his first head coaching job with the Raiders. Chan Gailey,
like Gruden an offensive coordinator promoted to a top spot, also
owns a high-profile position as coach of the Dallas Cowboys.
	   The Cardinals, who've played in Chicago, St. Louis and Arizona,
begin their 100th season with a vastly improved roster. The New
York Giants will play their 1,000th game when they face Kansas City
on Dec. 20.
	   Barry Sanders, fresh off a 2,053-yard season and a shared MVP
award, will continue his pursuit of Walter Payton's career rushing
record of 16,726 yards. Elway must pass for 1,331 yards to reach
50,000. Marino needs 15 touchdown passes to become the first player
with 400.
	   For all of the good vibes, there have been some troubling times,
too.
	   The Cowboys can't seem to avoid negative headlines, with Michael
Irvin usually involved. The 49ers had an ugly front-office battle
in which highly regarded team president Carmen Policy resigned.
Lawrence Phillips' and Dave Meggett's off-field troubles helped
cost them jobs. Alonzo Spellman's erratic behavior had the same
result. Several players were arrested on drunken driving or
domestic abuse charges.
	   Such behavior seems to be a problem in every sport. But no other
American sport has as golden an outlook these days as the NFL.

Russia's Finance Ministry fails in attempt to issue domestic bonds
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs. RECASTS, UPDATES throughout with failed bond issue, other
details. Trims. &QL; 
 &UR; By SERGEI SHARGORODSKY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's Finance Ministry on Wednesday annulled a
government bond auction that had been intended to raise money for
the cash-strapped government.
	   The ministry's failure to restart the bond market, which has
been paralyzed for about two months, signaled investors' continuing
lack of confidence that the ruble could recover from its battering.
The ruble's street value in relation to the dollar has fallen by
about half over the past two and a half weeks, and official trading
between the two currencies is frozen.
	   The ministry and the Central Bank, which organized the sales,
did not say why the auction was annulled, but it appeared that bids
were demanding very high interest. The minimum offer on the
two-week notes would have netted the investor the equivalent of 200
percent annual interest.
	   ``That there weren't any bids below 200 percent means that there
is no confidence in the ruble in the near term,'' said Dmitry
Poletayev, a trader at International Moscow Bank.
	   The last successful auction for Russian domestic government
bonds took place in early July. Trading of the outstanding issues
on the secondary market was suspended Aug. 17, when the government
announced that it would restructure the country's short-term debt.
	   The ruble remained largely unchanged in electronic trading in
Moscow on Wednesday, with the U.S. dollar selling at around 12
rubles, about double the exchange rate before the economic crisis
hit Russia.
	   As financial turmoil continued to rage, Russia's State Duma, the
lower house of parliament, proposed Wednesday that President Boris
Yeltsin fire Central Bank chief Sergei Dubinin. Many blame Dubinin
for failing to avoid the crisis and the resulting paralysis of the
banking system.
	   Dubinin immediately responded that he would not step down.
	   Trying to avoid a collapse of the national banking system, the
Central Bank on Wednesday ordered commercial banks to calculate
their losses, audit their capital and increase loss provisions,
with major banks to complete approved audits by Sept. 15.
	   Other developments on Wednesday hardly brought relief to the
battered interim government.
	   The Federal Tax Service chief, Boris Fyodorov, said tax
collections in August had amounted to 11.2 billion rubles, some 2
billion rubles less than planned. He said the financial crisis had
pushed many taxpayers to delay payments, while those actually made
often were stranded in the banks.
	   Meanwhile, International Monetary Fund officials were quoted as
saying the fund might delay its next disbursement of a major
stabilization loan.
	   A dlrs 4.3 billion disbursement is expected in coming weeks, but
IMF officials said Russia must do more to improve the economic
situation, Russian media reported.
	   Russia reached a deal in July with the IMF and other
international financial institutions for more than dlrs 22 billion
in loans this year and next, but the money did not ward off the
latest economic crisis.

Nigerian journalist awarded by UNESCO, Reporters Without Borders
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ A Nigerian journalist imprisoned for three years
was awarded the UNESCO/Guillermo Cano World Press Freedom Prize and
the 1995 Reporters Without Borders Prize on Wednesday.
	   Christina Anyanwu, publisher and editor-in-chief of The Sunday
Magazine in Lagos, Nigeria, was released in June after being jailed
for the publication of an article on an attempted coup in March
1995. She was jailed by a special military tribunal.
	   After Wednesday's presentation at UNESCO headquarters in Paris,
Anyanwu dedicated the award to all Nigerian journalists who worked
during the rule of Gen. Sani Abacha, who died in June.
	   ``I accept this prize with gratitude to God and on behalf of the
journalists of Nigeria who suffered great tribulations at the hands
of the military throughout the span of Gen. Abacha's horrific
reign,'' she said.
	   ``My ordeal symbolizes the heavy cross the media had to carry at
the time: the closures and bans of over 13 publications; the
millions of Naira lost by the independent press through seizures;
the printing and circulation of forged editions of our magazines by
government agents to confuse readers,'' she added.
	   She urged Nigeria's current government to release other jailed
journalists, and to repudiate alleged human rights abuses under
Abacha's regime.
	   Anyanwu was chosen for the UNESCO prize in February. She was
also honored by France-based Reporters Without Borders in 1995. Due
to her imprisonment at the time, both prizes were accepted by Nobel
Literature Prize winner Wole Soyinka, who also attended Wednesday's
ceremony.
	   The UNESCO/Guillermo Cano award was created in 1997 to honor a
person, organization or institution that has made a notable
contribution to the defense and, or promotion of press freedom.
	   It is named after a Colombian journalist and editor who was
murdered by drug cartel hitmen in 1986.
	   The Reporters Without Borders prize awards a journalist who
demonstrates support of press freedom through professional
activities, opinions and attitudes.

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Wall Street on Wednesday extended its comeback
attempt from August's scary selloff, with the Dow industrials
flirting with a move back into positive territory for the year.
	   The Dow Jones industrial average, down 512.61 on Monday and up
288.23 Tuesday, was up 20.85 at 7,848.28 at midmorning. At one
point, the Dow was up 87.02 at 7,914.45, slightly above where it
began the year, at 7,908.25.
	   Broader indicators also were rising, including the Nasdaq
composite index, which added to Tuesday's record point gain.
	   Tuesday's rise was the second-biggest daily point gain ever and
came on record trading of more than 1.2 billion shares on the New
York Stock Exchange. Trading was active Wednesday morning but
volume was running behind Tuesday's frantic pace.
	   Wall Street's dramatic rebound Tuesday also sent Asian and
European stocks higher Wednesday, but some analysts wondered
whether the rallies could be sustained against a gloomy outlook in
many economies.
	   New York traders were slow to recognize the serious potential
fallout from the financial troubles in Asia and Russia, and
uncertainty might hang on for some time in markets that now lack
any firm sense of direction, said Jeremy Batstone, an analyst at
NatWest Stockbrokers in London.
	   ``Sentiment is finally beginning to crack,'' Batstone said.
``The market is beginning to wake up.''
	   President Bill Clinton sought to reassure investors during a
joint Moscow news conference Wednesday with Russian President Boris
Yeltsin.
	   ``The volatility in the world markets, including in our stock
market, I think is to be expected under these circumstances,''
Clinton said. ``The right thing to do is to try to restore growth
in the economies of the world where there isn't enough growth.''
	   Clinton said ``America must maintain a leadership role of active
involvement.''
	   Blue chips were up in early dealings on the biggest European
stock markets _ London, Frankfurt, Germany, and Paris _ following
gains in Tokyo, Hong Kong and Singapore.
	   London's Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index had
climbed 2.2 percent by midday.
	   But traders remained cautious about the strength of the rallies
that some called a knee-jerk response to Tuesday's gains on Wall
Street.
	   Some investors perceived the recent price drops as good
opportunities to buy quality stocks, analysts said, but many
figured the markets are a pretty risky proposition at present.
	   In Tokyo, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 6.99 points,
or 0.05 percent, for a close of 14,376.62, which was below its high
for the day.
	   Although it was the Nikkei's third straight day of higher
prices, many people still believe Tokyo shares have a long way to
go after sinking to a 12-year low Friday.
	   In Hong Kong, shares closed sharply higher, with the blue-chip
Hang Seng Index rising 4.2 percent.
	   In Singapore, where the stock market has recently undergone one
bad day after another, the Straits Times Index initially rose 1.1
percent but finished with a gain 0.55 percent.
	   But given how long Asia's financial crisis has battered its
stock and currency markets, Wall Street's one-day recovery may only
amount to a brief respite for the region.
	   The Dow's volatility, and the big losses it has suffered over
the summer, have left some economists wondering whether the U.S.
economy could slow down and even slip into a recession.
	   Russian instability, widely regarded as that country's worst
since the fall of Communism, already has begun to batter European
companies, economies and stock markets.
	   Questions also remain about the future of Japan, the world's
second-largest economy and a crucial factor in Asia.
	   For weeks, a stalemate in parliament has been preventing the
administration of Japan's new prime minister, Keizo Obuchi, from
using taxpayer money to prop up the nation's troubled banks.
	   Fears remain that the problems will spread from Asia and Russia,
slowing economic growth or leading to recession around the globe.

Gorbachev says appointment of Chernomyrdin would be bad for Russia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev said that
Viktor Chernomyrdin's appointment as Russian prime minister would
be bad for the country, a news agency reported Wednesday.
	   Gorbachev also lashed out at President Boris Yeltsin for
``pushing his crony through the Duma'' and blamed both men for the
current political and economic crisis, the Interfax news agency
reported.
	   Reiterating his earlier views, Gorbachev also said that Yeltsin
should resign and new elections should be held.
	   He predicted that the Duma, or the lower house of the Russian
parliament, would not likely vote for a man ``who has done so much
to bring us into this predicament.''
	   The Duma voted against Chernomyrdin's candidacy Monday and is
scheduled to hold another vote Friday. If lawmakers reject him a
third time, Yeltsin must dissolve parliament, appoint a prime
minister by decree and hold elections within three months.
	   Although Gorbachev remains respected overseas, his popularity
rating is almost nonexistent in Russia, where people maintain that
he is to blame for the collapse of the Soviet Union.

Eight police wounded after armed civilians block national road
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS to UPDATE with warning that military will shoot looters:

<TEXT>
	   GJIROKASTRA, Albania (AP) _ Gunmen fired Wednesday on police
searching a village for civilians who had blocked a major highway,
wounding eight of the officers. Police responded by flying heavily
armed reinforcements to the area.
	   The opposition Democratic Party of former President Sali Berisha
accused the government of Prime Minister Fatos Nano of trying to
provoke residents of the village, a Berisha stronghold.
	   The incident was the latest sign of trouble for Nano's
government. The Berisha-led opposition accuses the government of
incompetence and corruption, while the government accuses Berisha
and his supporters of trying to destabilize it.
	   Mindful that the unrest could spread, the Ministry of Defense
warned Wednesday that troops will shoot anyone who tries to break
into armories, which were looted during nationwide unrest last
year.
	   ``We are determined to protect the property of the army,'' the
statement said.
	   Trouble started here Tuesday when armed civilians from the
nearby village of Lazarat blockaded the country's main north-south
highway near this town about 145 kilometers (90 miles) south of the
capital Tirana.
	   The reason for the blockade was unclear, but witnesses said 18
truck drivers as well as some private motorists were robbed or
shot.
	   When police commandos began arriving in the area, the civilians
manning the blockade dispersed late Tuesday. Early Wednesday,
police entered Lazarat, located on a steep hill overlooking the
highway, to search for ringleaders of the blockade.
	   But the villagers opened fire and drove police back down the
hill. Eight policemen _ four commandos and four local officers _
were wounded.
	   Three of the wounded officers were taken to a hospital in
Ioannia, Greece, where a doctor said by telephone that their
conditions were not life-threatening.
	   Police flew reinforcements by helicopter to the area from Tirana
but had so far made no further move to enter the village.
	   Formerly communist Albania, among the poorest countries in
Europe, has barely recovered from nationwide riots that erupted
last year after the collapse of pyramid investment schemes, which
cost many people their life savings.
	   In addition, thousands of ethnic Albanians from Kosovo province
in neighboring Yugoslavia have streamed across the border to escape
fighting between Serb forces and secessionist rebels.
	   On Monday, about 2,000 protesters broke through police lines and
marched on Prime Minister Nano's office to demand the release of
six opposition politicians jailed since Aug. 23.
	   Berisha, who was defeated by Nano in last year's elections, has
called for protest marches on Friday.

U.S. official warns Latvia of danger of rejecting change
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIGA, Latvia (AP) _ The U.S. ambassador to NATO on Wednesday
cautioned Latvians on Wednesday that failing to liberalize
naturalization laws could undermine the country's desire to join
Western institutions.
	   Latvians are to vote in an Oct. 3-4 referendum on whether to
make naturalization easier for the hundreds of thousands of
residents who were left stateless after Latvia became independent
in 1991.
	   Most of the stateless residents are ethnic Russians, and the
issue has been a longtime irritant between Latvia and the Kremlin.
Russia this spring threatened trade sanctions against Latvia unless
it eased citizenship requirements.
	   In the wake of those threats, Latvia's parliament amended the
naturalization laws, but many Latvians resent the Russians'
presence and nationalist politicians gathered enough signatures to
force a plebiscite on the amendments.
	   ``We hope there is a good and informed debate on the amendments
and that Latvians make the right choice,'' Alexander Vershbow said
at a news conference, accroding to the Baltic News Service. ``This
will have an effect on Latvia's integration into Western
institutions.''
	   Latvia is eager to join both NATO and the European Union, but
many officials worry that the country's current naturalization law
would be unpalatable to those organizations. The Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe also has called for Latvia to
change its laws.
	   Under current law, the older a stateless resident is, the longer
he has to wait before being able to apply for citizenship. That
provision is seen by many as clearly aimed at punishing ethnic
Russians who were moved to Latvia in the 1950s under Soviet
dictator Josef Stalin's ``russification'' program.

Fighting spreads south in Kosovo, more dead, wounded, displaced
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ISMET HAJDARI &QC;

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serbian police battled ethnic
Albanian militants near a border town in southern Yugoslavia on
Wednesday, with both sides reporting fighters killed and wounded.
	   The pro-Albanian Kosovo Information Center said heavy explosions
could be heard and houses seen burning in Tusis, a suburb of
Prizren. Civilians were fleeing the fighting, it said, as violence
spread further south in the increasingly ravaged province of
Kosovo.
	   ``There are many dead and wounded,'' said the center, which is
close to pro-independence Kosovo Albanian politicians. The flare-up
in fighting also engulfed several nearby villages, it said.
	   The Serbian Media Center in Pristina, capital of Kosovo, said
the clash began Tuesday when ethnic Albanian militants ambushed a
Serb police patrol. Fifteen fighters of the Kosovo Liberation Army
were killed and two policemen wounded, the center said.
	   Hundreds have died and estimated 265,000 people have become
refugees in six months of fighting between government troops and
pro-independence KLA guerrillas. Ethnic Albanians outnumber Serbs
in Kosovo 9-1.
	   The fighting near Prizren, 60 kilometers (40 miles) southwest of
Pristina, continued overnight and Wednesday, both sides said. The
Serbs claimed police had gained the upper hand and captured fifteen
rebel fighters in the area, which is 15 kilometers (nine miles)
northeast of the Albanian border and 30 kilometers (19 miles)
northwest of Macedonia.
	   The violence showed that despite recent battlefield losses to
government forces, the KLA remains active wherever ethnic Albanians
predominate.
	   International efforts to bring peace to the province have so far
failed. But the top U.S. envoy to the region, Christopher Hill,
continued his shuttle diplomacy and on Wednesday met with Kosovo's
chief Albanian leader, Ibrahim Rugova.
	   After a meeting Tuesday between Hill and Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic, the state-run Tanjug news agency said a
dialogue between Serbs and Albanians should begin ``so that an
agreement can be reached providing for an appropriate degree of
self-rule which would include equality for all living in Kosovo.''
	   The report also said that after an interim period of three to
five years, the two sides could meet again to ``analyze the
functioning of the agreement'' and ``improve it on issues they
mutually agree upon.''
	   That arrangement would fall short of the Albanian demand for
complete independence. The United States and several Europeans
powers oppose full independence, fearing it would lead to a
redrawing of borders in neighboring countries and areas like
Macedonia and Montenegro with large Albanian populations. As a
minimum, they want Milosevic to restore to Kosovo the autonomy he
revoked in 1989.
	   No face-to-face talks have been held _ Serbs accuse the
Albanians of dragging their feet, and the Albanians insist that the
crackdown on the KLA must stop before any talks.

Archaeologists unearth 12th tomb in Vergina
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SALONICA, Greece (AP) _ Archaeologists have uncovered another
tomb in the ancient site of Vergina, where the father of Alexander
the Great is believed to have been buried, bringing the total
number to 12, local media reported Wednesday.
	   The rectangular, three-meter (10-foot) deep tomb, dating from
the late 4th century B.C., was found a few meters (yards) east of
the first tomb uncovered in 1865 and had been looted in the past,
archaeologists said.
	   It was uncovered during construction work for a protective cover
over other nearby graves, media reported.
	   Few traces of ceramic artifacts were found inside the tomb,
where the interior walls are decorated in bands of red, white and
black.
	   The lack of ceramics common to grave finds has led
archaeologists to believe the tomb was the burial site of a woman,
where the main offerings would have been of metal, and particularly
of gold, and would have been carried off by grave robbers.
	   Excavations in the region are being conducted by the University
of Salonica as a continuation to the work which began in 1981-2,
led by Greek archaeologist Manolis Andronikos.

Islamic separatists, government reach agreement in Dagestan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Members of a small Islamic sect have ended their
drive to create a separate Islamic territory out of two villages in
the southern Russian republic of Dagestan, a news report said
Wednesday.
	   The separatists, members of the Wahhabi sect of Islam, promised
to ``renounce anti-constitutional actions and to recognize local
self-government authorities'' after negotiations with the
government, said Mahomed-Salikh Gusayev, Dagestan's Minister for
Ethnicity and External Relations.
	   In turn, the government promised not to prosecute residents in
the breakaway Karamakhi and Chabanmakhi villages, located in
central Dagestan, the Interfax news agency reported. Officials also
confirmed the villagers' constitutional right to practice Islam,
Interfax said.
	   In mid-August, the Wahhabis set up road blocks and prevented
city officials from entering three villages. At the time, they
announced plans to set up an independent religious government.
	   The Interfax report did not mention the status of the third
village, Kadar.
	   Dagestan, which borders on breakaway Chechnya, has been awash in
kidnappings and violence in recent months. It is caught in a power
struggle between various ethnic and religious groups in the region.

Annan to hold talks with Greek Cypriot leader
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DURBAN, South Africa (AP) _ Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides
wants to raise the issue of divided Cyprus with U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan at the ongoing summit of the
Nonaligned Movement, a diplomatic source said Wednesday.
	   Speaking on condition of anonymity, a member of the Cypriot
delegation said Clerides would discuss the latest developments on
the divided island, including a recent Turkish Cypriot proposal for
reunification of the island through a two-state confederation.
	   They were to meet Thursday afternoon, he said.
	   Clerides has rejected the proposal as tantamount to partition of
the island, branding it ``contrary and contemptuous'' of U.N.
Security Council resolutions that reject recognition of the
breakaway Turkish Cypriot state.
	   ``This is just a good opportunity to talk'' with Annan, the
delegate said. ``I don't expect any new proposals to come out of
it. They will just discuss the latest developments.''
	   The proposal was made Monday by Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf
Denktash and Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem during Cem's visit
to the north of the island.
	   The Mediterranean island has been divided since Turkish troops
invaded after an abortive coup by Greek Cypriots, who favored union
with Greece. About 35,000 Turkish forces remain in northern Cyprus.

<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ The defense chiefs of Angola, Namibia and
Zimbabwe agreed Wednesday to end their involvement soon in the war
against insurgents seeking to topple Congo's President Laurent
Kabila.
	   ``We intervened to prevent a military powergrab. This first step
was completed successfully. We believe it will be fully
accomplished in the next few days,'' Angolan armed forces chief
Gen. Joao de Matos told reporters after talks here with the other
defense chiefs.
	   He declined to give a more specific timetable for the withdrawal
of the foreign troops from Congo.
	   The talks were also attended by Kabila's son Joseph, Namibian
Lt. Gen. Dimo Hamaambo and Gen. Vitalis Zvinavashe of Zimbabwe.
	   Zvinavashe said the defense chiefs would report to their
governments before revealing further details of the talks in the
Angolan capital.
	   ``When we went to Congo, there was a war. Now the allied forces
have controlled the situation,'' he said.
	   Angola has sent troops, fighter jets and tanks to support
Kabila's army. Zimbabwe and Namibia have also provided troops.
	   With the help of the allies, Kabila's army has driven the rebels
away from Kinshasa in the southwest and has threatened to pursue
them to their strongholds in eastern Congo.
	   Uganda and Rwanda deny Kabila's allegations that they are aiding
the rebels.
	   Kabila unexpectedly arrived at the Nonaligned Movement's summit
in Durban, South Africa, Wednesday, raising the possibility of
progress in diplomatic efforts to halt the fighting.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia's deputy prime minister
and finance chief Anwar Ibrahim was fired on Wednesday after months
of economic policy differences with the prime minister.
	   The move _ announced by the prime minister's department in a
three-paragraph statement _ came after weeks of rumors that Anwar
had been fired or would quit, always followed by emphatic denials.
	   The 51-year-old Anwar, for years seen as Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad's successor, had been left out of decisions for months
after differing with his boss on the course for economic recovery.
	   Dozens of Anwar supporters flocked to his residence Wednesday
night, pushing through a horde of reporters who had been camped
outside his house all afternoon.
	   Three truckloads of riot police were deployed around the nearby
residence of Mahathir, apparently to prevent protests by Anwar
supporters.
	   There were unconfirmed reports that Anwar was under house arrest
or facing imminent arrest on unspecified criminal charges. An
attorney representing him in a libel case was seen going into the
house.
	   ``He didn't want to resign, so he was sacked,'' said a close
aide to Mahathir. The aide, who asked not to be identified, said
Anwar's successor had not yet been chosen.
	   Lim Kit Siang, the opposition leader in Parliament, said the
move would push the Southeast Asian country into further chaos
during the regional economic crisis.
	   ``The sacking of the deputy prime minister will plunge the
country into an unprecedented political crisis and turmoil,'' said
Lim.
	   Malaysia's currency, the ringgit, and the markets have plummeted
since the Asian economic crisis broke out in July 1997. The
country's economy, which boasted 8 percent growth for last decade,
formally went into recession last week after its economy shrank
another 6.8 percent.
	   Anwar and the central bank had preferred high interest rates and
austerity measures to control Malaysia's sliding currency. Mahathir
and his chief economic aide, Daim Zainuddin, have pushed through a
policy of greater government spending and lower rates to boost the
economy.
	   Although Mahathir has never openly blamed his finance minister
for the economic mess, he openly said the tight monetary policies
of the central bank were not going to deliver recovery.
	   When Bank Negara governor Ahmad Mohamed Don and his deputy, Fong
Weng Phak, quit last week in opposition to Mahathir's plans to fix
the ringgit at 3.8 to the U.S. dollar, it was apparent Anwar's days
were numbered.
	   On Tuesday, when Mahathir and central bank officials announced
sweeping currency exchange controls, Anwar was nowhere to be seen.
	   Mahathir has been consolidating his hold on power for month,
first naming Daim as his chief economic aide and then replacing the
chiefs of Malaysia's two largest Malay newspapers. The editors were
viewed as Anwar supporters.
	   In recent weeks, Anwar has been embarrassed by accusations of
sexual misconduct contained in a book, ``50 Reasons Why Anwar
Shouldn't Be Prime Minister.'' The authors are being tried in a
court for defamation and the trial could rake up more controversy
about Anwar's personal life.

Truck driver kills four people when brakes fail
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ A pick-up truck driver ran over and killed
four men attending a funeral service after his brakes failed, a
weekly newspaper reported Wednesday.
	   Scores of people were injured in the accident in a Baghdad
suburb.
	   Witnesses told the Al-I'lam newspaper the driver discovered his
brakes were not working when he tried to slow down before a group
of pedestrians crossing the street.
	   He swerved to the right and drove into a crowd of mourners
gathering for a funeral.
	   The report gave no further details.
	   Spare parts for vehicles are extremely expensive in Iraq, which
has been under U.N. trade sanctions since shortly after its army
invaded Kuwait in 1990.

Rape as genocidal crime: U.N. ruling sets precedent
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Rwanda-Genocide Tribunal &QL; 
 &UR; By KARIN DAVIES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ARUSHA, Tanzania (AP) _ The women told their stories in voices
that cracked with the pain of remembering: Gang rape of a pregnant
victim. Being forced to parade naked. Mutilation.
	   Months ago, the U.N. tribunal's judges listened to the harrowing
testimony, and on Wednesday they rendered their precedent-setting
verdict: In Rwanda's 1994 bloodbath, rape and sexual violence were
brutally wielded as tools of genocide.
	   Women's groups hailed the decision as historic, saying it would
pave the way for prosecuting crimes of sexual violence committed in
the course of armed conflict.
	   Such acts ``constitute genocide, the same as any other act,''
Judge Laity Kama of Senegal said as he read the nine guilty
judgments issued by the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda
against a former Rwandan village mayor, Jean-Paul Akayesu.
	   For the first time, the court also provided an international
definition for sexual violence, which included rape but added that
it ``is not limited to physical invasion of the human body and may
include acts which do not involve penetration or even physical
contact.''
	   Akayesu was found guilty of genocide, murder, rape in torture in
presiding over the slaughter of 2,000 minority Tutsis who had
sought his protection. Those killings came against the larger
backdrop of the gruesome slayings of half a million Rwandans,
mainly Tutsis.
	   While no one accused Akayesu of personally raping any women, the
court ruled he was criminally responsible because he witnessed and
encouraged the sexual violence of militiamen and police.
	   Acts of sexual violence were generally accompanied by explicit
threats of death or bodily harm, and that meant Tutsi women lived
in constant fear, the court said.
	   ``The Hutus used sexual violence to degrade and destroy the
Tutsi community ... They hurt not only the women they raped, but
their families and their friends,'' said Alice Karekezi, a Rwandan
Tutsi who monitors gender-related crimes.
	   During testimony in the trial, which began in January 1997, the
women described horrific scenes played out against a backdrop of
killing.
	   One witness, identified only as P.P., said she watched while
several Hutu militiamen gang-raped three Tutsi women, one of them
pregnant.
	   ``They removed their clothes and they were told to walk so that
they could display the thighs of Tutsi women,'' said the witness.
``After they had walked up and down ...they were raped.''
	   Afterward, the women were bludgeoned to death and heaved into
shallow graves, she said.
	   Faiza Jama Mohamed, Africa director for Equality Now, a New
York-based group organization focusing on violations of women's
rights, praised the tribunal's decision.
	   ``This is a historic moment ... It is the first time an
international tribunal has looked at sexual violence against women
and held someone responsible,'' she said.

Colombia devalues the peso, citing world financial turmoil
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ Citing recent worldwide markets turmoil,
the government of President Andres Pastrana announced it would
allow the Colombian peso to drop 9 percentage points against the
U.S. dollar.
	   The decision was influenced by ``the recent evolution of
international financial markets,'' said Finance Minister Juan
Camilo Restrepo.
	   The peso, which closed at 1,443 to the dollar Tuesday, was
trading early Wednesday at about 1,500 _ a 4 percent drop in value.
	   The peso had come under pressure in recent days because of
speculation of a devaluation in neighboring Venezuela, Colombia's
second-largest trading partner. Financial deterioration in Russia
compounded the situation as emerging-market currencies _ in Brazil,
Mexico and Argentina _ fell behind.
	   The government had spent dlrs 210 million defending the peso
since last Friday, and about dlrs 1 billion during the past year.
	   Speculation of a peso devaluation has been heavy since Pastrana
took office Aug. 7, inheriting large fiscal and current account
deficits from former president Ernesto Samper. The devaluation was
expected to boost exports and employment, thereby reducing the
current account deficit, while raising the cost of dollar debts.

Rooster helps police find missing body
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Frustrated that they weren't able to find
the body of an accident victim, police decided to test the folk
belief that roosters can find those who have drowned _ and quickly
succeeded.
	   According to a report in the Bergens Tidende newspaper
Wednesday, officers in the town of Kvam, near Bergen, had searched
for 10 days for a 17-year-old boy whose motorcycle had crashed.
They suspected he had been thrown into a waterfall next to the
crash site and combed the river and the lake it feeds.
	   Even with underwater cameras and search dogs, they found
nothing.
	   Finally, Kvam sheriff Olav Valland asked a retired colleague for
help. The colleague turned up with a rooster that was placed in a
tightly shut cardboard box, and they set out on the lake in a
rowboat.
	   After only a few hundred feet the rooster started crowing, and
when they looked around the policemen spotted the missing body
floating in the water nearby. The closer they came, the louder the
rooster crowed, even though it could see nothing.
	   ``It was incredible, but it was no coincidence. I have no
logical explanation for why it works, but it works,'' the sheriff's
colleague, Olav Arvid Skaalheim, was quoted as saying by the
newspaper.

Forest fires cover Bolivia with smoke
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PETER McFARREN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SANTA CRUZ DE LA SIERRA, Bolivia (AP) _ Smoke from forest fires
have covered more than two-thirds of Bolivia with a thick blanket
of smoke, resulting in school closings and canceled flights.
	   Smoke now covers about two-thirds of Bolivia, which is 424,165
square miles (1,098,587 square kilometers). The haze has even
crossed the Andes from the east and covered the capital city of La
Paz and the airport with a layer of smoke.
	   Smoke from fires to clear farmlands in Bolivia and neighboring
Brazil pose problems each year, but government officials report
levels are at a record high. A severe drought in Brazil and the
eastern lowlands of Bolivia is spreading the fires.
	   Thick smoke covered the Santa Cruz de la Sierra, a city of one
million in the eastern Bolivian lowlands. Several grass fires could
be seen from the air.
	   In the northern town of Riveralta, visibility was only 50 meters
(yards).
	   Devastating fires that have been raging for two weeks in central
Brazil, killing wildlife and livestock and endangering the lives of
thousands of Indians.
	   The Ministry of Sustainable Development says the fires pose a
serious threat to the environment and health of residents.
	   Many flights northeast of La Paz have been suspended or delayed
due to low visibility, and schools in the area were shut down this
week after higher than normal rates of respiratory ailments were
reported.
	   Legislators have asked the government to mobilize the armed
forces to limit the centuries-old practice of slash-and-burn
agriculture, and to begin a media campaign to make farmers aware of
the problems caused by the smoke.

U.N. human rights chief calls for investigation of Kosovo deaths
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Yugoslavia-Kosovo, Germany-Kosovo &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The United Nations' top human rights official
called for independent investigation of violent deaths in Kosovo
Wednesday, saying she was ``haunted and horrified'' by recent
reports of killings.
	   Mary Robinson, the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, said
all sides in the conflict should help clear the way for
investigations by experts including international forensic
specialists.
	   ``I suggest that, instead of concentrating on those differences
that separate the parties, efforts be focused to highlight areas of
common concern,'' Robinson said in a statement.
	   Such efforts were ``in the interest of all persons committed to
human rights in Kosovo,'' she added.
	   Allegations of abuse by both Serb forces and Albanian guerrillas
in the troubled Yugoslav province escalated last weekend after
Serbian police said they had discovered a crematory in the village
of Klecka, where ethnic Albanians had allegedly burned the bodies
of at least 22 Serbs.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed on both sides in the
conflict, and more than 260,000 have been rendered homeless by the
fighting.
	   ``For many months, the violence in Kosovo has provided us with
countless images of death, destruction and human suffering,''
Robinson said. ``I am haunted and horrified by this weekend's
images of charred remains in a makeshift crematorium.''
	   But she noted that all those involved have expressed public
concern over human rights abuses.
	   At various points this year, Robinson said, Yugoslav officials,
Kosovo Albanian representatives and human rights activists inside
and outside Yugoslavia have supported independent investigations.

Rightwing politician denounces Jewish groups for pursuing Holocaust
</HEADLINE>
claims &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT H. REID &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- A member of Austria's rightwing
opposition party Wednesday criticized the World Jewish Congress and
its American ``star lawyers'' for seeking compensation for
Holocaust victims and suggested revenge was behind the campaign.
	   Eduard Nicka, a state legislator of the rightwing Austrian
Peoples Party, told reporters in Eisenstadt that the WJC ``with its
American star lawyers has again raised new demands on the Austrian
taxpayers for compensation for the victims of the Nazi era.''
	   Nicka wondered whether ``this is really raised to repay a
historical debt or whether it is to extract money and exact revenge
on those who were born'' after World War II.
	   On Sunday, a class action lawsuit was filed in Brooklyn federal
court against Volkswagen and 11 other German and Austrian companies
for using slave labor during the war.
	   Another lawsuit, filed in federal court in Newark, N.J., on
Monday, named only Volkswagen A.G. and Volkswagen of America. It
accused the automaker of using Nazi prisoners to do heavy labor in
its factories during the war.
	   The actions follow the recent dlrs 1.25 billion agreement by
Swiss banks to settle claims by Holocaust survivors who weren't
allowed to collect their assets after World War II.
	   Historians believe more than 7 million people were forced to
work in Germany under the regime of Adolf Hitler, who was born in
Austria.
	   Nicka said that by the end of the 1980s, Austria, which was
absorbed into Hitler's Germany in 1938, had paid more than one
billion schillings, or dlrs 80 million, to victims of the
Holocaust.
	   He said postwar generations should not be required to bear the
responsibility for actions taken before they were born. If Austria
were required to make restitution to Nazi victims, the same
principle should be allied to Germans expelled from Czechoslovakia
and Austrians who were forced out of Slovenia following World War
II.
	   Nicka's party opposes the ruling Socialists, who have taken a
more acomodating view toward such compensation claims. Chancellor
Viktor Klima was reported by Austrian media to have recommended to
executives of an Austrian bank, Creditanstalt, to be cooperative in
dealing with the compensation claims.
	   Both he and Vice Chancellor Wolfgang Schuessel suggested that
Austrian companies should react ``with the greatest possible
openness'' to claims from victims of Nazi terror.

Sons of Princess Diana appeal to nation to end their mourning

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Princess Diana's sons appealed to the nation
Wednesday to let their mother and her memory finally rest in peace,
saying ``constant reminders of her death can create nothing but
pain to those she left behind.''
	   In a statement issued two days after the first anniversary of
Diana's death, Prince William, 16, and Prince Harry, 13, declared
that the public mourning period should now end.
	   ``Throughout the last year, since the death of their mother,
Prince William and Prince Harry have been comforted enormously by
the public sympathy and support they have been given,'' said a
statement issued by Sandy Henney, the press secretary to their
father, Prince Charles.
	   ``It has meant a great deal to them and they have asked me to
express their thanks once again to everyone,'' Ms. Henney said in
the statement. ``They have also asked me to say that they believe
their mother would want people now to move on _ because she would
have known that constant reminders of her death can create nothing
but pain to those she left behind.
	   ``They therefore hope, very much, that their mother and her
memory will now finally be allowed to rest in peace.''
	   Press Association, the British news agency, said the appeal
apparently was decided upon over the weekend at Balmoral, Queen's
Elizabeth II's Scottish estate, where the boys spent the
anniversary with the rest of the royal family.
	   The news agency said the boys were prompted to issue it by their
concern over the constant references to their mother and the
``Diana industry'' that has sprouted up in the past year.
	   On Wednesday, Harry began his first year at Eton, the elite
boarding school favored by the aristocracy for centuries, which his
brother already attends.
	   The school is just across the River Thames from Windsor Castle,
a weekend base for the queen.

<TEXT>
	   GJIROKASTRA, Albania (AP) _ Gunmen fired Wednesday on police
searching a village for civilians who had blocked a major highway,
wounding eight of the officers. Police responded by flying heavily
armed reinforcements to the area.
	   The opposition Democratic Party of former President Sali Berisha
accused the government of Prime Minister Fatos Nano of trying to
provoke residents of the village, a Berisha stronghold.
	   The incident was the latest sign of trouble for Nano's
government. The Berisha-led opposition accuses the government of
incompetence and corruption, while the government accuses Berisha
and his supporters of trying to destabilize it.
	   Mindful that the unrest could spread, the Ministry of Defense
warned Wednesday that troops will shoot anyone who tries to break
into armories, which were looted during nationwide unrest last
year.
	   ``We are determined to protect the property of the army,'' the
statement said.
	   Trouble started here Tuesday when armed civilians from the
nearby village of Lazarat blockaded the country's main north-south
highway near this town about 145 kilometers (90 miles) south of the
capital, Tirana.

Central banks of Ukraine, Russia to revive ruble market in Ukraine
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine's Central Bank is preparing a set
of measures jointly with its Russian counterpart to resume trading
in rubles at the Ukrainian currency exchange, a top banking
official said Wednesday.
	   ``We let the (Russian) Central Bank have the initiative in
influencing the ruble market in Ukraine so that it can be
revived,'' Ukraine's National Bank chief Viktor Yushchenko told a
news conference.
	   He did not elaborate on what measures the two countries' banks
were taking to revive the ruble market in Ukraine.
	   Trading in rubles at the Ukrainian interbank currency exchange
was suspended Aug. 17, the same day the Russian government sharply
devalued the ruble.
	   No ruble trading has been conducted since. The ruble's street
rate in Kiev currently stands at 0.12 to the hryvna, down from 0.33
before the devaluation.
	   Yushchenko said the National Bank was ready to resume trading in
rubles any day, but would not so as to avoid creating more problems
to Russia.
	   ``We do not want the Ukrainian ruble market to be another
detonator (of troubles) in Russia,'' he said.

	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Pakistan on Wednesday protested
India's latest missile test, warning that such weapons programs
could provoke a new arms race in South Asia.
	   Pakistan has lost three wars since 1948 to its larger neighbor,
and in May exploded its first atomic devices in response to India's
series of nuclear tests.

Britain renames Eurofighter after World War II bomber
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The Eurofighter combat aircraft was renamed
Typhoon on Wednesday in honor of the Royal Air Force bomber that
blasted German troops in World War II.
	   The 40 billion pound (dlrs 66 billion) aircraft is produced
jointly by the air forces of Britain, Germany, Spain and Italy. It
is being designed to fly worldwide missions and operate from short
runways, competing in the marketplace with Lockheed Martin's
American F-16.
	   ``We wanted a name that we all felt was appropriate for the
product, for the guys who were flying it and for the export
market,'' said Brian Phillipson, managing director of the
Eurofighter company. ``It is a name that conveys the right sort of
image. It was just something we were all happy with.''
	   He denied reports that Germany had ever raised objections to the
rechristening, saying, ``There has never been a problem with the
name.''
	   The plane's namesake was a ground attack fighter that took part
in many World War II missions. The aircraft also played a big part
in the D-Day landings in 1944 by blasting German tank and gun
positions.
	   The European countries producing the Typhoon have already
ordered 620 planes. The partners said they expect more than 800
Typhoons to flood the global market during the next three decades
	   The plane will continue to be called a Eurofighter in Europe.

Scalfaro, Yeltsin to meet in Moscow this month
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Italian President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro will go to
Russia later this month for a three-day state visit, acting on an
invitation issued by Boris Yeltsin before Russia's latest crisis
broke, the Italian leader's office said Wednesday.
	   The Sept. 13-16 visit will include a meeting between the two
presidents. No details of the agenda have yet been released.
	   Yeltsin invited Scalfaro to Moscow during the Russian leader's
own state visit to Italy in February.
	   Coming on the heels of U.S. President Bill Clinton's visit, the
trip is seen by some as a show of support in Russia's time of
financial crisis. Italy is the 15-nation European Union's
second-biggest exporter to Russia, trailing far after Germany.
Russia accounts for 1.6 percent of Italy's total exports.

Three SAP managers pay fines to end insider trading cases
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Prosecutors dropped insider trading
investigations against three managers at Germany's largest software
firm, SAP, Thursday after they agreed to pay fines of up to 120,000
marks (dlrs 65,000).
	   Three other employees remain under investigation, said Frankfurt
prosecutors' spokesman Job Tilmann.
	   Prosecutors allege that SAP employees aware that the company had
posted disappointing third-quarter earnings in 1996 improperly sold
stocks ahead of the announcement on Oct. 23 that year to avoid
losses. Share prices plunged moments after the results were
announced.
	   Prosecutors originally investigated 34 suspects at the software
firm, but dropped cases against 28 for lack of evidence.

French president arrives in Ukraine
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ French President Jacques Chirac arrived in
Ukraine on Wednesday on the first official visit by a French
president to the former Soviet republic.
	   In an interview with Ukrainian television on the eve of his
trip, Chirac said his visit was intended to stimulate bilateral
relations and show Ukrainians that their country ``has its own
place in Europe.''
	   Strengthening economic cooperation and channeling more French
investment to Ukraine are also expected to top the agenda. A large
group of French businessmen is accompanying Chirac.
	   France has expressed interest in completion of Ukraine's AN-70
military transport plane, and the country's construction materials
giant Lafarge is interested in investing in the Ukrainian cement
industry.
	   Other potential spheres of cooperation include energy
production, telecommunications, nuclear energy, space research,
food industry and others.
	   During his three-day visit, the French president is to meet with
President Leonid Kuchma, Prime Minister Valery Pustovoitenko and
parliament Speaker Oleksandr Tkachenko.
	   The sides are to sign four agreements, including pacts on the
peaceful uses of nuclear energy, nuclear safety and energy
cooperation, and cooperation between Ukrainian and French law
enforcement bodies.
	   Chirac is scheduled to fly to Chisinau, the capital of the
former Soviet republic of Moldova, on Friday.

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Once the second-most powerful man
in Malaysia, Anwar Ibrahim saw his political fortunes reduced to
rubble when he appeared to challenge Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad's 17-year leadership.
	   The recent row over monetary policy and sweeping currency
controls between the central bank and Mahathir were only the latest
rifts between Malaysia's two most prominent men.
	   On Wednesday, Mahathir once again showed he would not tolerate
dissent by ignominiously sacking Anwar, 51.
	   As finance minister, Anwar strenuously backed Bank Negara's
stand on maintaining tight monetary policy to protect Malaysia's
faltering currency, the ringgit.
	   But after Mahathir, 72, blamed that International Monetary
Fund-style policy for Malaysia's dramatic recession, the deputy
prime minister found himself sidelined.
	   In June, Mahathir drafted trusted aide and former finance
minister Daim Zainuddin as special economics minister. Daim, who
shares Mahathir's distaste for austere policies, soon made his
mark.
	   Government spending was pumped up by 20 percent, and a
succession of interest-rate cuts left Anwar's tight monetary policy
in tatters. When Bank Negara governor Ahmad Mohamed Don and his
deputy, Fong Weng Phak, quit last week in opposition to Mahathir's
plans to fix the ringgit at 3.80 to the dollar, the writing was on
the wall.
	   With a fixed currency, Mahathir had no need for his finance
minister, whose chief role was increasingly just to reassure
international financial markets.
	   Anwar's fall was as startling as his rise.
	   From a charismatic student leader who spent 22 months in jail
for leading a demonstration by impoverished farmers, Anwar rose to
become heir to Mahathir's office.
	   In university, he co-founded the pro-Islamic Malaysian Muslim
Youth Movement and battled for a wider role for Islam in the
running of the predominantly Muslim country.
	   As his politics moderated, Anwar rose to power on the coattails
of his longtime mentor, Mahathir.
	   Both Mahathir's United Malays National Organization, the
country's dominant political group since independence from Britain
in 1957, and the main Islamic fundamentalist party wooed the young
populist.
	   Anwar joined Mahathir's party in 1982 and rose quickly to
important Cabinet positions, holding the youth and sports portfolio
until 1984, agriculture for the next two years, education until
1991 and finance from then on.
	   In 1993, he engineered a groundswell of support within his party
to win the deputy leader's office and become the deputy prime
minister.
	   But as Malaysia's economy slid into recession in recent months,
Anwar's stock fell as he differed with Mahathir on the course the
Southeast Asian nation should chart toward recovery.
	   The rift between Mahathir and Anwar surfaced openly in June
during the annual convention of the governing party. Many party
leaders saw Anwar's involvement in a campaign for political reform
that was spearheaded by a youth leader.
	   But Mahathir moved quickly, crushing the youth leader and
forcing him to recapitulate and denying that there was any cronyism
and nepotism in the UMNO leadership. Since then, no party member
has publicly voiced concern about the tangled links between top
politicians and businessmen.
	   Anwar has tried to mend fences, promising not to challenge
Mahathir when the party's internal election is held next year.
Mahathir, he said last month, was like his father.
	   ``Mahathir is a seasoned leader,'' Anwar said. ``If I compare
myself with him, I'm just a student. I'm aware I can't go against
teachers, what's more against a father.''
	   Anwar, married and the father of six children, is the author of
a book on his philosophy, entitled ``The Asian Renaissance.''

Britain businesses go ahead with trade mission to Russia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A British trade mission to Russia will go ahead
next week despite the economic and political crisis facing the
country, a government minister said Wednesday.
	   Trade Minister Brian Wilson will accompany representatives from
130 firms to St. Petersburg on Tuesday for Britain's largest ever
trade exhibition in Russia. The trip will focus on construction,
transport, textiles, and food and drink.
	   Wilson said none of the British companies wanted to withdraw,
but that he did have to cancel a meeting with the Russian trade
minister in Moscow.
	   ``Although conditions are obviously difficult at the moment,
everyone recognizes that trade is a long-term affair and the
current difficulties will pass,'' he said.

Pakistani minorities prepare to block new Islamic laws
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By AMIR ZIA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Pakistani minorities plan to fight a
constitutional amendment to impose a new Islamic order in the
country, saying it will subject many non-Muslims to further
persecution.
	   ``We are already exposed to discrimination and victimization.
This new law will multiply our woes,'' Cecil Chaudhary, the leader
of a Christian group, told The Associated Press Wednesday.
	   On Friday, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif introduced a
constitutional amendment to replace British common law with laws
based on the Koran and Sunnat _ the traditions of Islam's prophet
Mohammed.
	   Opposition parties and human rights groups say it would
undermine the constitution, wreck state institutions and threaten
the country's unity.
	   Opposition parties already have vowed to form an alliance to
block the amendment, but Sharif is expected to muster the support
because he controls a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
	   The amendment ``obliges'' the federal government to enforce
prayers five times a day, collect an annual tithings and
``prescribe what is right and to forbid what is wrong.''
	   Cecil, leader of the National Christian Action Forum, said the
minorities already were fighting the blasphemy law, which makes it
a capital offense to insult Islam or its prophet.
	   ``The extremist groups will be able to misuse it against us as
they misused the blasphemy law,'' he said.
	   Sharif has assured minorities, which make up 5 percent of the
country's 140 million people, that the new Islamic order would not
limit their rights.
	   Alexander John Malik, Bishop of Lahore, said there were 72 sects
in Islam and each had its separate interpretations of Islamic laws.
	   ``We will be at their mercy as many extremist groups are opposed
to minorities,'' he told reporters today in the federal capital.
	   Shabaz Bhatti, president of the Christian Liberation Front, said
his party had forged an alliance with the opposition to stop the
amendment.
	   ``We will soon challenge it in the Supreme Court also and launch
countrywide protests,'' he said.

<TEXT>
	   TRIPOLI, Libya (AP) _ If the two Libyans accused of the 1988
bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 are convicted, they should serve their
time in Libya and not in Britain, their Libyan lawyer said
Wednesday.
	   Ibrahim Legwell told reporters that he wanted further guarantees
on the rights of the suspects from those outlined in the plan
endorsed by the U.N. Security Council on Aug. 27.
	   The United States and Britain, which drew up the plan, have said
it is non-negotiable.
	   The plan provides for the United Nations to suspend sanctions
against Libya once it turns over two men suspected in the bombing
of the flight which exploded over Lockerbie, Scotland, on Dec. 21,
1988, killing 270 people.
	   Under the plan, the suspects _ Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi and
Lamen Khalifa Fhimah _ would be tried in the Netherlands by a panel
of three Scottish judges according to Scottish law. If convicted,
they will serve their sentences in a British prison.
	   Speaking to reporters in his office in downtown Tripoli, Legwell
said the legal team that will represent al-Megrahi and Fhimah had
not yet assembled and had not come to a decision on the plan.
	   But he said that he wanted more safeguards for the suspects, who
are currently under house arrest in Tripoli.
	   ``We need to know how they will spend their time (during and
after the trial),'' he said.
	   He also said he wanted guarantees that the defense lawyers will
have unfettered access to the defendants, that the Central
Intelligence Agency and other foreign agencies do not have access
to the men, and that the prosecutor will be not granted long
adjournments in order to find witnesses.
	   ``We need somebody for their religious and social needs,'' he
added. Al-Megrahi and Fhimah will require a Muslim cleric, a doctor
and someone to cook traditional Libyan meals.
	   He added that he didn't think that they would be found guilty if
`they received a fair trial.''
	   Legwell's request for guarantees is similar to that of Libyan
leader Moammar Gadhafi who called on the weekend for negotiations
with the United States and Britain on bringing the men to trial.
	   Spokesmen for the U.S. and British governments rejected
Gadhafi's demand. A Foreign Office spokesman said while Britain
would provide clarification, the U.N. plan was ``totally
non-negotiable.''
	   ``There are comprehensive safeguards and assurances of a safe
trial,'' the spokesman said.
	   U.S. State Department spokesman James Foley said Gadhafi's bid
to negotiate the proposal was ``tantamount to rejection.''
	   Legwell rejected the suggestion that Gadhafi would have the
final say on whether the men were handed over to Dutch custody for
a trial. He said the suspects would decide themselves after
receiving the opinion of their lawyers.
	   However, it is generally understood that Gadhafi has the final
word on all matters in Libya.

Hecht still confident European Super League will kick off by 2000
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Rodolfo Hecht, whose Milan-based company Media
Partners is behind moves to create the European Football League,
said Wednesday he was ``more confident than ever'' the competition
will kick off by the year 2000.
	   Hecht issued a statement in London Wednesday saying his meetings
with potential European Football League clubs on Monday and Tuesday
had been productive and the league was developing rapidly.
	   His announcement coincided with a warning from England's
Football Association chairman Keith Wiseman that English players
and Premier League clubs would be subject to international and
domestic bans for participating in the unsanctioned competition.
	   UEFA, European soccer's governing body, has also opposed the
breakaway league and has set up a task force to investigate ways of
restructuring its own tournaments to prevent the formation of a
rival league.
	   However, Hecht said improvement to the proposed EFL were what
the fans wanted.
	   ``Improvements to the structure of the competition have been
made, having listened not only to the clubs but also to the
supporters, the national leagues and UEFA,'' Hecht said after his
meetings with the clubs in London.
	   ``I am more confident than ever that we will see the
modernization of European club competitions in time for the
2000-2001 season, for the benefit or the clubs and the fans.''
	   Hecht unveiled modified plans for the competition, including an
increase from 16 to 18 teams in the top-flight of the Super League
and the implementation of a promotion and relegation system based
on merits.
	   The EFL will comprise two competitions. The Super League will
comprise 36 teams in two divisions and the Pro Cup will involve 96
teams, from all the territories covered by UEFA's 51 associations,
in a knock-out competition.
	   Hecht said EFL was expected to generate more than 1.25 billion
pounds (dlrs 2.05 billion) every season for six seasons, with 50
million pounds (dlrs 82 million) going to the development of youth
soccer each season.
	   ``The EFL will be open and accountable. It will be 100 percent
owned by the clubs (like the existing national leagues in England,
Scotland and the Netherlands,'' Hecht's statement said.
	   ``The clubs support offering a regulatory and administrative
role to UEFA based on the English FA-Premier League model.
	   ``UEFA has also been offered responsibility for allocating the
money which will be generated by the EFL for the good of amateur
and youth football.''

Indonesian military intelligence predicted May riots
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ A senior military official said
Wednesday that the Indonesian armed forces had predicted that riots
would break out in May.
	   However, Maj. Gen. Zacky Anwar Makarim, chief of the military's
intelligence agency, denied any military involvement with any
groups that may have incited the riots that left 1,200 people dead
and led to the resignation of President Suharto.
	   In his testimony before a fact-finding team probing the May
12-25 riots, Zacky said his office estimated that the riots would
peak on May 20, the 90th anniversary of National Awakening Day.
	   The 19-member team has already questioned Jakarta Gov. Sutiyoso,
former Jakarta military chief Maj. Gen. Syafrie Syamsudin and
former Jakarta police chief Maj. Gen. Hamami Nata.
	   The team plans to interrogate some other officials as well as
former officials, team member Bambang W. Suharto said.
	   Critics have accused the government and military of doing little
to stop the violence, which included widespread rape.
	   Thousands of homes and buildings, mostly owned by ethnic
Chinese, were looted, ransacked and burned. Rock-throwing mobs
smashed windows and destroyed cars.

UCI extends deadline, says Casagrande suspension not enough
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ The International Cycling Union
said Wednesday it will extend its deadline for national bodies to
decide on sanctions against cyclists thrown off this year's Tour de
France.
	   The move came after the Australian and French cycling
federations said their disciplinary procedures couldn't be
completed until Sept. 30, the UCI said in a statement.
	   The UCI, which on Monday told the Australian, French and Swiss
federations to make decisions by Sept. 13, accordingly put the
deadline back to Oct. 1.
	   The cyclists concerned ``will be able to pursue their sporting
activity until this date,'' it said.
	   They were all part of the Festina team, kicked out of the French
Tour after banned substances were found in a team car by police
shortly before the start of the first stage in Dublin, Ireland.
	   Also Wednesday, the UCI said it judged the six-month suspension
imposed on Italian cyclist Francesco Casagrande by his national
league Monday to be insufficient.
	   The international body plans to appeal to the Lausanne-based
Court of Arbitration for Sport over the decision, the statement
said.
	   Casagrande, 28, was suspended for twice testing positive for
banned substances.
	   He had elevated levels of testosterone in doping tests he took
at the Tour of Trentino in April and the Tour de Romandie in May.
The Italian claimed his body's testosterone level fluctuates
naturally.
	   This week's call to get tough with cyclists kicked out of the
Tour for using banned substances came after the international body
met in Bordeaux.
	   Anti-doping regulations call for suspensions from six to 12
months.
	   But in its call to national federations, the UCI reminded them
of the seriousness of the offense and asked that the considerable
evidence against the cyclists be taken into account when handing
out sanctions.

Engineer says he warned that bridge would buckle under weight
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DANNY BEN-TAL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ A mechanical engineer testified
Wednesday that he warned contractors that a foot bridge built to
carry athletes across a polluted river, would buckle under the
pressure of large groups of people.
	   The bridge collapsed July 12th, 1997 at the opening ceremonies
of the Maccabiah Games, an international sporting event for Jewish
athletes, sending dozens of Australians into the waters below. Four
team members died and many were injured.
	   Five people including contractors and the bridge engineer, are
on trial at a Tel Aviv District court facing charges of criminal
negligence as a result of the collapse.
	   Igor Zolitsky who work's for the bridge's engineer, said he ran
the bridge design through computerized simulation tests which
revealed it would not be strong enough to hold more than 100 people
at one time.
	   Zolitsky told the court that he informed contractors of the
tests and that they assured him that someone would be placed at the
bridge entrance to prevent more than 100 people at a time from
standing on the bridge.
	   In his own defense, Zolitsky said that the two contractors, who
are on trial, lied when they denied during joint police questioning
that he had not told them about the tests.
	   ``They claimed in the police inquiry that they never spoke to me
by phone and that I didn't mention the number 100 but I know that I
spoke to them,'' Zolitsky said.
	   Zolitsky was the 51st witness brought by the prosecution to
testify at the trial and at least 10 more remained on the witness
list.
	   With five defendants each with his own attorney and independent
defense strategies, the trial was likely to be lengthy and
prosecutor's aides said it could run into next summer.

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ A top Vietnamese dissident, just freed
from a Hanoi prison and headed for the United States, has vowed to
keep fighting for freedom and democracy, and called on other
Vietnamese to do likewise.
	   Doan Viet Hoat was freed from a Hanoi prison under an amnesty
for 5,219 inmates to mark Vietnam's National Day on Tuesday. He was
immediately expelled from his homeland and flown to Bangkok,
Thailand en route to resettlement in the United States.
	   In an interview one day after being pardoned from his 15-year
sentence for publishing pro-democracy newsletters, Hoat said that
he needed to study Vietnam's situation further before deciding
exactly what pro-democracy work he would do.
	   Because he was not allowed access to newspapers, books or any
other information while in prison, he had been ``totally ignorant
as to what was happening in Vietnam or the outside world,' he said
in his interview with by the U.S. government-funded Radio Free
Asia. A transcript of the interview was released Wednesday.
	   ``Everyone of us should be free to express his opinion, to speak
up his mind on questions of culture and ideology openly and
legally, and to have political rights... if we are to have a
country that is truly free,'' he said.
	   Hoat, whose case was the object of international appeals,
especially from groups concerned with freedom of expression, said
foreign pressure for human rights and democracy in Vietnam had some
success.
	   But the main impetus for change must come from inside Vietnam,
he said.
	   ``If the people and the intellectuals who understand the
situation refuse to speak up, to struggle for these same rights,
then I think it will be a long time before we see this movement
reach an apex,'' he said.
	   Hoat, an educator trained at the University of Florida, was

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Acting Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin signed a
decree Wednesday to ensure the continued development of Russia's
satellite technology, a news report said.
	   The decree endorsed proposals by the Russian Space Agency for
the creation of a new generation of communication and broadcasting
satellites even as Russia faces severe financial crisis, the
ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   The space agency wanted the government's support for projects on
three satellites: the Yamal-200, Yamal-300, and Express-K.
	   The satellites are to replace two older types, the Horizon and
Ekran-M, which will be phased out by 1999.

<TEXT>
	   GORIC, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Rain above, mud below and biting chill
all around. It's still summer on the calendar but for tens of
thousands of refugees huddled at best under plastic sheeting,
Kosovo's bitter autumn is already here.
	   Some days, the sun still provides a few hours' warmth to the
estimated 50,000 people scattered in fields, forests, meadows and
mountains by the government offensive that has destroyed hundreds
of ethnic Albanian villages since March.
	   But nights bring cold and rain, foreshadowing the tragedy to
come unless Kosovo's new nomads are sheltered _ and fast.
	   After a recent visit to refugee sites, U.S. Assistant Secretary
of State Julia Taft warned of a ``catastrophe that is looming,''
and predicted suffering and death this winter for tens of thousands
of the most vulnerable.
	   For field workers such as Maggie Bryson of the International
Committee of the Red Cross, the catastrophe is already here. The
onset of cold weather is ``absolutely dreadful'' she says. On a
recent tour of devastated southwest Kosovo, she saw the corpse of a
10-day-old baby who died of exposure.
	   Nothing unusual, say refugees camped in abandoned buses, cars,
burned-out houses or in makeshift tents _ leaky plastic sheeting
propped up by branches or stretched over trailers covered-wagon
style.
	   Some of the trailers remain hooked up to tractors _ the better
to flee quickly in case shelling starts again.
	   ``It's already very cold at night, close to freezing,'' says
Zuka Miradic, rocking an infant in a wooden cradle as other women
tend to the fire in the iron stove inside their plastic shelter.
``Three people died in the last few days, an old woman, a
4-month-old child and a newborn baby.''
	   Their ``tent'' near Goric, just south of the former Kosovo
Liberation Army stronghold of Malisevo, is pitched in a meadow.
Nearby stand similar shelters _ two buses and cars piled with
carpets, blankets _ anything to provide nighttime warmth.
	   The muddy patch is bordered on one side by a creek of
ocher-colored water where a woman is slapping a shirt against rocks
to try to get it clean. Cows and water buffalo roll in the muck
upstream, less than 50 meters (yards) from a girl cupping her hands
for a drink.
	   Two nights of rain have made dry wood a precious commodity, only
used for cooking. The adults hug each other for warmth at night.
Most of the kids _ about 80 of them in the whole settlement _ sleep
in the buses.
	   ``I don't mind the cold in the night for myself. It's the kids
that suffer,'' says Ajshe Bytyci, one of about a dozen women
sharing space in the ``tent'' with the children who crowd in during
the day. ``The children are already getting sick, them and the
older women.''
	   Most of the kids are sockless and wear only thin wooden clogs.
But it's not the runny noses that bother the women. Diarrhea and
dysentery, both potential child-killers, are on the increase, they
say, the result of contaminated water and lack of hygiene. With the
cold, most of the children haven't bathed for a week.
	   Peppers stew on the stove _ a gift from nearby villagers.
``Other than that we have nothing,'' says Bytyci. Asked if they
have seen any international humanitarian aid in her five days of
camping out, the women shake their heads.
	   Though U.N. and other aid agencies are operating in the Serbian
province, their efforts are hampered by the particular nature of
Kosovo's war and by Serbian government red tape.
	   Many of the estimated 265,000 Kosovo refugees don't stay put
more than a few days, forced to flee again and again by an
offensive that Serbia says means to target only separatist
guerrillas. Most of the victims, however, are civilians. By the
time they arrive at a campsite, aid convoys often find the
makeshift refugee camps empty, their inhabitants on the run again.
	   International agencies complain that the government in Belgrade
refuses to issue visas to their staffers. The U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees says that it's working at half strength
because of such delays.
	   The violence of the offensive _ Albanian villages first shelled,
then often torched _ has led many refugees to believe their enemy
is bent not only on wiping out separatist guerrillas but Kosovo
Albanians themselves.
	   Small wonder that Serbian promises to set up 11 ``safe zones''
throughout Kosovo, where refugees can come to get food, medicines
and building materials, are met with anger.
	   ``They're not interested in helping us,'' says Shefki Bytygi,
who says his nearby house was destroyed in a recent attack.
	   Others nod as he demands stronger international action than
promises of aid that never arrive.
	   ``Bomb the bloody bastards as quick as you can if you want to
save these women, these children,'' he says, his hands sweeping the
refugee area around him. ``Kill the Serb killing machine!''

Death toll mounts in Indian floods: villagers fight for food

<TEXT>
	   PARSASHUKRULLAH, India (AP) _ Poor villagers left homeless by a
furious flood pushed and punched each other in a struggle over
donated food Wednesday, as the death toll in the worst flood in
decades in northern India rose to nearly 1,350 people.
	   Nearly 12 million villagers were either marooned or left
shelterless in the past three weeks following torrential monsoon
rains which fed rivers flowing through Uttar Pradesh, the most
populous Indian state with 150 million people.
	   On Wednesday, the air force helicopters carried crucial food
supplies to thousands of villages isolated by flooded roads, using
makeshift helipads constructed on rain-soaked terrain, Air
Commodore B.N.Gokhale, a spokesman for the air force, said.
	   Gokhale said pilots were making 20 or more flights each day to
drop relief packets in affected villages.
	   Near Parsashukrullah, a village that was until last week under 7
feet (2 meters) of water, nearly 1,000 men, women and children
lined up to receive rice packets. Several young men pushed each
other to grab the small food packets thrown from a parked truck by
volunteers.
	   Rescue workers said they were hampered by the shortage of boats
and doctors. ``We could do with 300 more boats,'' Pradeep
Srivastava, a local government official, told reporters in
Gorakhpur, a city 645 kilometers (400 miles) southeast of New
Delhi. The district is worst affected by the floods.
	   Rescuers have only 7,685 small country boats and 73 motorized
boats, official statistics say.
	   The government's Flood Control Center in Lucknow, the state
capital, said 23,145 villages were either submerged or surrounded
by water.
	   At least 1,203 people have drowned and another 141 killed by
waterborne diseases such as cholera, diarrhea and hepatitis, the
center said. Villagers stranded in relief camps have little or no
access to drinking water and often use dirty water for drinking,
bathing and washing clothes.
	   In deep floodwaters, poisonous cobras, vipers and kraits have
come out of their pits and cases of snakebites have shot up,
doctors said.
	   Most of those rendered homeless or marooned are poor farmers,
living in mud thatched homes with agriculture as the sole source of
income. ``Below this lies my rice crop. The yield was fantastic
this year,'' said Kasha Singh Gosain, a 45-year-old farmer,
pointing to a vast expanse of water outside his village near
Gorakhpur.
	   Gosain said he would have earned up to 6,000 rupees (dlrs 150)
after the harvest, a third the 18,000 rupees (dlrs 430) he normally
earns each year.

	   ASCHAFFENBURG, Germany (AP) _ Robbers with a police-style
flashing blue light on their car ambushed a postal van and made off
with some 600,000 marks (dlrs 343,000) in gold and other valuables,
police said Wednesday.
	   The 24-year-old postal driver said he was beaten unconscious and
locked in his cab by the two men, who forced him to stop on an
autobahn superhighway near Aschaffenburg, 45 kilometers (30 miles)
east of Frankfurt, at about midnight Tuesday, according to police.
	   The driver, who suffered a cut on his forehead, called police on
a mobile telephone.
	   Investigators were tracing the origins of the stolen shipments,
including 31 kilograms (68.3 lbs) of gold, to determine their exact
value.

Colombia devalues currency, citing world financial turmoil
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ Blaming turmoil in world financial
markets, the government announced it would devalue the national
currency by allowing it to drop 9 percentage points against the
dollar.
	   The central bank's announcement, at midnight Tuesday, was made
after the peso had come under increasing pressure because of
speculation neighboring Venezuela would pare the value of its
currency. Venezuela is Colombia's second-largest trading partner.
	   The peso, which closed at 1,443 to the dollar Tuesday, was
trading early Wednesday at about 1,500 _ a drop of about 4 percent
in value.
	   Finance Minister Juan Camilo Restrepo said Wednesday that the
currency was devalued because of ``the recent evolution of
international financial markets.''
	   Global markets have been whipsawed by the economic troubles of
Asian nations and the more recent travails of the Russian economy.
Investors fearful the contagion will spread to other developing
nations have pulled out of financial markets in Latin America,
battering stocks and currencies in the region.
	   The Colombian government had spent dlrs 210 million since last
Friday in foreign exchange markets trying to prop up the peso. It
had spent about dlrs 1 billion during the past year.
	   In announcing its move, the central bank said it would raise by
9 percentage points, effective Wednesday, the level of the band
within which the peso is allowed to fluctuate.
	   Speculation of a peso devaluation has been heavy since President
Andres Pastrana took office Aug. 7, inheriting large fiscal and
trade deficits from former President Ernesto Samper.
	   The devaluation was expected to boost exports and employment,
thereby reducing the trade deficit, while raising the cost of
dollar debts. Inflation, running at 14.7 percent this year, was
also expected to rise as the cost of imported goods increases.

	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ The defense chiefs of Angola, Namibia and
Zimbabwe agreed Wednesday to end their involvement soon in the war
against insurgents seeking to topple Congo's President Laurent
Kabila.
	   ``We intervened to prevent a military powergrab. This first step
was completed successfully. We believe it will be fully
accomplished in the next few days,'' Angolan armed forces chief
Gen. Joao de Matos told reporters after talks here with the other
defense chiefs.
	   He declined to give a more specific timetable for the withdrawal
of the foreign troops from Congo.
	   The talks were also attended by Kabila's son Joseph, Namibian
Lt. Gen. Dimo Hamaambo and Gen. Vitalis Zvinavashe of Zimbabwe.
	   Zvinavashe said the defense chiefs would report to their
governments before revealing further details of the talks in the
Angolan capital.
	   ``When we went to Congo, there was a war. Now the allied forces
have controlled the situation,'' he said.
	   Angola has sent troops, fighter jets and tanks to support
Kabila's army. Zimbabwe and Namibia have also provided troops.
	   With the help of the allies, Kabila's army has driven the rebels
away from Kinshasa in the southwest and has threatened to pursue
them to their strongholds in eastern Congo.
	   Uganda and Rwanda deny Kabila's allegations that they are aiding
the rebels.
	   Kabila unexpectedly arrived at the Nonaligned Movement's summit
in Durban, South Africa, Wednesday, raising the possibility of
progress in diplomatic efforts to halt the fighting.

Cyprus criticizes US over Turkish Cypriot proposal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ Cyprus criticized the United States on
Wednesday for its failure to promptly reject a Turkish Cypriot
proposal for the divided island to become a confederation.
	   Cyprus, Greece and four permanent members of the U.N. Security
Council _ Britain, China, France and Russia _ have objected to the
plan, which Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash put forward
Monday.
	   ``The United States is the only council member that has failed
to denounce the proposal,'' said Spyros Kyprianou, the speaker of
parliament. He is acting president during the absence of Glafcos
Clerides, who is in South Africa for the summit of the Nonaligned
Movement.
	   U.S. Ambassador Kenneth Brill has told reporters that his
government is still studying the proposal.
	   Denktash proposed the reunification of the island in a
confederation ``between two peoples and two states.''
	   U.N. Security Council resolutions rule out recognition of the
breakaway Turkish Cypriot state that Denktash heads in the north of
Cyprus.
	   Cyprus has been divided into a Greek Cypriot south and a
Turkish-occupied north since Turkey invaded in 1974 after a coup by
supporters of union with Greece.
	   Turkey, which backs the proposal, maintains 35,000 troops in
north Cyprus.

	   SPA-FRANCORCHAMPS, Belgium (AP) _ It wouldn't be such a good
idea to invite Ferrari and McLaren to the same party.
	   But they are more than threatening to make the last three races
of the Formula One season compelling. There's war on the Grand Prix
circuit, where the championship will be decided between Ferrari's
Michael Schumacher and McLaren's Mika Hakkinen.
	   ``It was clear that we would have taken the lead in the
championship,'' Schumacher fumed Sunday after a collision with
Hakkinen's teammate David Coulthard in the Belgian Grand Prix.
	   Schumacher was well on his way to victory, with Hakkinen _ the
victim of a rain-caused multicar crackup on the first lap _ out of
the picture.
	   Despite a 30-second lead, Schumacher closed in and prepared to
put a lap on Coulthard in blinding rain.
	   ``I slowed down to let him pass,'' said Coulthard, whose car
sprayed water like a garden hose.
	   The Ferrari camp figures he slowed down too fast, leaving
Schumacher nowhere to go.
	   ``I didn't have any chance, and banged into him,'' Schumacher
said.
	   That was the nicest thing he had to say.
	   ``One could think he did it deliberately,'' he grumbled. ``It is
very disappointing.''
	   Later, Schumacher stormed into the McLaren garage in search of
Coulthard.
	   ``You want to kill me?'' Schumacher screamed after spotting him,
then had to be restrained.
	   Coulthard called Schumacher ``an animal,'' but was later to
learn where the real creatures were. They waited for him, then
showered him with empty beer cans and other trash as he left the
track.
	   After talking to Coulthard and reviewing telemetry and other
data, Belgian Grand Prix stewards cleared Coulthard.
	   But the verbal sparring continued this week, with Ferrari saying
in a statement on Tuesday that it had reviewed videotape of the
accident and still blamed Coulthard.
	   ``Coulthard's sudden deceleration, while on the racing line, was
sudden and premature. Given the poor visibility, he made the
accident unavoidable despite Schumacher's extreme efforts to avoid
one,'' the statement said.
	   McLaren responded on Wednesday by nicely calling Ferrari poor
sports.
	   ``It is our regret that this incident occurred and that its
subsequent interpretation by Ferrari has challenged the intergrity
of our team and its driver,'' the statement said.
	   It could get worse weekend after next, when British-based
McLaren goes from the neutral asphalt of Belgium to the
Ferrari-friendly venue of Monza, Italy.
	   That got McLaren-Mercedes team chief Norbert Haug to thinking.
	   ``An apology from Schumacher would defuse the situation,'' he
said. ``Let's return to the issue of sport.''
	   That is extremely doubtful at best.
	   What could have been an 80-77 lead for Schumacher is a 77-70
deficit.
	   Hakkinen and the McLaren-Mercedes have been dominant on the
faster circuits, and will be looking to widen their margin Sept. 13
at speedy Monza.
	   In practice on the fast Spa-Francorchamps circuit, the McLarens
were faster by a second per lap. Only rain, in which Schumacher
drives better than anyone, foiled their plan.
	   Now, Ferrari is hoping a new version of its F300 car will make a
winning debut at Monza.
	   ``We won't recapture a full second, but it will boost
confidence,'' said Schumacher, who is seeking his third Formula One
title. ``There is no reason why we should not be competitive for
the race.''
	   On Sept. 27, Schumacher has another ``home'' race, at Germany's
Nurburgring, where the Luxembourg Grand Prix will be staged.
	   The title chase could again go to the final race _ the Japanese
Grand Prix at Suzuka.
	   There, in 1994, Schumacher won his first world title, but only
after banging, bumping and controversy with then-rival Damon Hill.

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Wall Street on Wednesday extended its comeback
attempt from August's scary selloff, with the Dow industrials
flirting with a move back into positive territory for the year.
	   The Dow Jones industrial average, down 512.61 on Monday and up
288.23 Tuesday, was up an additional 73.63 at 7,901.06 by late
morning. At one point, the Dow was up 87.02 at 7,914.45, slightly
above where it began the year, at 7,908.25.
	   Broader indicators also were rising, including the Nasdaq
composite index, which added to Tuesday's record point gain.
	   Wall Street's dramatic rebound Tuesday also sent Asian and
European stocks rising Wednesday, but some analysts wondered
whether the rallies could be sustained against a gloomy outlook in
many economies.
	   New York traders were slow to recognize the serious potential
fallout from the financial troubles in Asia and Russia, and
uncertainty might hang on for some time in markets that now lack
any firm sense of direction, said Jeremy Batstone, an analyst at
NatWest Stockbrokers in London.
	   ``Sentiment is finally beginning to crack,'' Batstone said.
``The market is beginning to wake up.''
	   President Bill Clinton sought to reassure investors during a
joint Moscow news conference today with Russian President Boris
Yeltsin.
	   ``The volatility in the world markets, including in our stock
market, I think is to be expected under these circumstances,''
Clinton said. ``The right thing to do is to try to restore growth
in the economies of the world where there isn't enough growth.''
	   Clinton said ``America must maintain a leadership role of active
involvement.''
	   Blue chips rose on the biggest European stock markets _ London;
Frankfurt, Germany; and Paris _ following gains in Tokyo, Hong Kong
and Singapore.
	   London's Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index closed
with a gain of 1.3 percent, with a rise of 1.9 percent in
Frankfurt's electronic Xetra DAX index and a gain of 2.3 percent in
the CAC 40 index in Paris.

UCI extends deadline, says Casagrande suspension not enough
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ The International Cycling Union
said Wednesday it will extend its deadline for national governing
bodies to decide on sanctions against cyclists disqualified from
this year's Tour de France.
	   The move came after the Australian and French federations said
their disciplinary procedures couldn't be completed until Sept. 30,
the UCI said in a statement.
	   The UCI, which on Monday told the Australian, French and Swiss
federations to decide by Sept. 13, accordingly put the deadline
back to Oct. 1.
	   The cyclists concerned ``will be able to pursue their sporting
activity until this date,'' it said.
	   They were all part of the Festina team, expelled from the French
tour after banned substances were found in a team car by police
shortly before the start of the first stage in Dublin, Ireland.
	   Also Wednesday, the UCI said it judged the six-month suspension
imposed on Italian cyclist Francesco Casagrande by his federation
Monday to be insufficient.
	   The international body plans to appeal to the Lausanne-based
Court of Arbitration for Sport over the decision, the statement
said.
	   Casagrande, 28, was suspended for twice testing positive for
banned substances.
	   He had elevated levels of testosterone in doping tests he took
at the Tour of Trentino in April and the Tour de Romandie in May.
The Italian claimed his body's testosterone level fluctuates
naturally.
	   This week's call to get tough with cyclists kicked out of the
Tour for using banned substances came after the international body
met in Bordeaux.
	   Anti-doping regulations call for suspensions from six to 12
months.
	   But in its call to national federations, the UCI reminded them
of the seriousness of the offense and asked that the considerable
evidence against the cyclists be taken into account when handing
out sanctions.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister
Anwar Ibrahim was sacked on Wednesday after months of economic
policy differences with the prime minister.
	   A three-paragraph statement issued by the prime minister's
department said Anwar had been removed from all positions,
including that of finance minister.
	   Anwar's firing came after weeks of rumors about his being sacked
or quitting, speculation that was always followed by emphatic
denials.
	   Dozens of Anwar supporters flocked to his residence Wednesday
night, pushing through a horde of reporters who had been camped
outside his house all afternoon.
	   Three truckloads of riot police were posted around the nearby
residence of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, apparently to prevent
protests by Anwar supporters.
	   There were unconfirmed reports that Anwar was under house arrest
or facing imminent arrest on unspecified criminal charges. A lawyer
representing him in a libel case was seen entering the house.
	   But Malaysia's police chief, Rahim Noor, denied that Anwar was
under house arrest. He was, however, being investigated on charges
of sexual misconduct, police said.

U.N. human rights chief calls for investigation of Kosovo deaths
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Yugoslavia-Kosovo &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The United Nations' top human rights official
called Wednesday for independent investigation of violent deaths in
Kosovo, saying she was ``haunted and horrified'' by recent reports
of killings.
	   Mary Robinson, the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, said
all sides in the conflict should help clear the way for
investigations by experts including international forensic
specialists.
	   ``I suggest that, instead of concentrating on those differences
that separate the parties, efforts be focused to highlight areas of
common concern,'' Robinson said in a statement.
	   Such efforts were ``in the interest of all persons committed to
human rights in Kosovo,'' she added.
	   Allegations of abuse by both Serb forces and Albanian guerrillas
in the troubled Yugoslav province escalated last weekend after
Serbian police said they had discovered a crematory in the village
of Klecka, where ethnic Albanians had allegedly burned the bodies
of at least 22 Serbs.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed on both sides in the
conflict, and more than 260,000 have been rendered homeless by the
fighting.
	   ``For many months, the violence in Kosovo has provided us with
countless images of death, destruction and human suffering,''
Robinson said. ``I am haunted and horrified by this weekend's
images of charred remains in a makeshift crematorium.''
	   But she noted that all those involved have expressed public
concern over human rights abuses.
	   At various points this year, Robinson said, Yugoslav officials,
Kosovo Albanian representatives and human rights activists inside
and outside Yugoslavia have supported independent investigations.

US, Britain consulting on suspending Iraq sanctions
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ U.S. and British officials were
considering giving Iraq some incentive to resume cooperation with
U.N. weapons inspectors as they consulted Wednesday with Security
Council members on a draft resolution.
	   The goal of the resolution would punish Iraq by suspending
regular sanctions reviews until Baghdad resumes cooperation with
U.N. weapons inspectors _ a move dismissed as meaningless Wednesday
by Iraq.
	   The resolution, the council's boldest move in the current
impasse, would effectively end Iraq's chances of having sanctions
lifted. But it is largely symbolic since in the past, the regular,
60-day reviews haven't led to any easing of the 8-year-old
measures.
	   U.S. and British officials, taking into consideration concerns
of other permanent council members Russia and China, were
considering giving Iraq some incentive to resume cooperation, which
was suspended Aug. 5.
	   A draft resolution could include a reference to a comprehensive
review of sanctions, diplomats said. Such a review would force the
council to recognize Iraq's previous progress in seven years of
intrusive inspections to dismantle its weapons of mass destruction.
	   The diplomats stressed, however, that no such comprehensive
review could take place until Iraq complies with U.N. resolutions
and allows inspectors to resume their work.
	   ``We may be able to get a reference to that idea but it would
have to be spelled out that there's no way that anything like that
could go ahead unless Iraq resumes cooperation'' said one western
diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   Arms experts must certify that Baghdad has destroyed its
long-range missiles and chemical, biological and nuclear weapons
before the council will lift sanctions imposed after Iraq invaded
Kuwait in 1990.
	   Iraq suspended cooperation with inspectors after the chief
weapons inspector, Richard Butler, refused earlier this month to
certify that Baghdad had destroyed its banned weapons.
	   A U.S.-British draft would suspend regular sanctions reviews
until after the chief inspectors report ``that Iraq has fully
resumed the cooperation necessary for them to perform the full
range of their activities mandated under the relevant resolutions
of the council.''
	   The United States and Britain hoped to have a draft presented to
the council Thursday, diplomats said.
	   On Wednesday in Baghdad, Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz
dismissed the significance of the suspension of reviews, saying it
would only lead to further tension.
	   Any attempts to do suspend sanctions reviews would only force
Iraq to ``protect its interests and security and take other strict
measures,'' said Aziz.

Explosion shatters army warehouse
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ An explosion shattered a
federal army warehouse in northwestern Bosnia, and up to three
soldiers were reported killed, NATO and army officials said
Wednesday.
	   The blast occurred Tuesday afternoon in the federation's
military warehouse in the village of Vrela, 210 kilometers (130
miles) northwest of Sarajevo.
	   The army of the Muslim-Croat federation and the NATO-led peace
force are investigating what is believed to be an accident caused
by mishandling of explosive ordinance.
	   NATO sources said at least three local soldiers died and eight
were wounded.
	   Federal officials confirmed the explosion killed one recruit.
They said two recruits were missing and two others were critically
injured.
	   The warehouse is one of the NATO-monitored storage sites for
weapons and ammunition of the federal army.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Determined to prevail over a hostile parliament,
President Boris Yeltsin approved six ministers in a proposed
government Wednesday as some hard-line lawmakers signaled they want
to back away from confrontation.
	   The State Duma, parliament's lower chamber, appealed to Viktor
Chernomyrdin to step aside as Yeltsin's candidate for prime
minister. But with that scenario unlikely, lawmakers scheduled a
second vote on the acting premier's confirmation for Friday.
	   The developments left the two sides stalemated over who should
lead Russia out of its severe financial plight, although Yeltsin
holds the upper hand with the constitutional right to disband the
Duma.
	   The government has been in crisis since Aug. 23, when Yeltsin
fired Sergei Kiriyenko as premier. The ruble has lost more than
half its value, some prices have doubled and some Russians are
still lining up daily to get their shrunken savings out of ailing
banks.
	   In a sign of further financial distress, Russia's Finance
Ministry annulled a government bond auction that had been intended
to raise money for the cash-strapped government.
	   While Yeltsin, looking alert and confident, was focused
Wednesday on his summit with U.S. President Clinton, the Duma
showed possible new willingness to compromise, approving a letter
urging Chernomyrdin to ask Yeltsin not to nominate him again.
	   ``Your voluntary refusal to take the post of prime minister may
seriously help to ease tension and help the search for a
compromise,'' said the lawmakers, who on Monday resoundingly voted
against Chernomyrdin.
	   Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov also called on both houses of
parliament to come up with a new candidate for Yeltsin to propose.
	   But Chernomyrdin showed no sign of withdrawing. As promised
earlier this week, he proposed some ministers for his acting
government and Yeltsin immediately approved them by decree
Wednesday.
	   The newly approved acting ministers, all holdovers from the last
government, are Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov, Defense Minister
Igor Sergeyev, Interior Minister Sergei Stepashin, tax chief Boris
Fyodorov, Justice Minister Pavel Krashennikov and Emergency
Situations Minister Sergei Shoigu.
	   Increasing Chernomyrdin's chances, ultranationalist leader
Vladimir Zhirinovsky indicated his 50-member faction, third largest
in the Duma, will support the acting premier after having abstained
Monday.
	   ``It would be easier for him to continue the surgery since he
has just come out of the operation room,'' the Liberal Democratic
Party leader said, referring to Chernomyrdin's five years as prime
minister before his surprise firing in March.
	   Chernomyrdin was endorsed Wednesday by influential regional
leaders who sit in the upper house, the Federation Council. The
chamber will likely pass a resolution Friday backing Chernomyrdin's
candidacy, council member Murtaza Rakhimov said _ putting more
pressure on the law-making Duma to confirm him.
	   Under the constitution, the president can present his candidate
for prime minister three times. If lawmakers reject Yeltsin's
choice three times, the president must dissolve the Duma and call
new parliamentary elections within three months.
	   Communists say they are not afraid of new elections. But some
hardliners fear Yeltsin could declare a state of emergency and
forego new elections, installing Chernomyrdin and ruling by decree.
	   ``Some hotheads in the president's inner circle intend to solve
the economic crisis by force _ disbanding the State Duma and
banning the opposition parties and movements,'' said Communist
deputy Viktor Ilyukhin, one of Yeltsin's most outspoken foes.
	   Russian media have speculated that magnate Boris Berezovsky, a
powerful banker who is well-connected in the Kremlin, helped
persuade Yeltsin to dump Kiriyenko when he started to get tough on
banks.
	   Berezovsky told Echo Moscow radio that Yeltsin might resign to
clear the way for new leadership, even though the president has
adamantly denied that he will quit before his term expires in 2000.
	   But top presidential hopeful Alexander Lebed said Yeltsin will
never resign. ``He wants to die as president,'' he said.

Scientists claim to find test for human growth hormone
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) _ A group of European scientists have
discovered a test that can detect the banned performance-enhancing
substance human growth hormone, a newspaper reported Wednesday.
	   HGH, a popular alternative to steroids, cannot be detected by
standard urine-control tests.
	   ``We have found a sure method to test growth hormones,''
Professor Jens Sandahl Christiansen of Denmark was quoted as saying
by the Politiken newspaper.
	   Sandahl Christiansen said the method needs to be more widely
tested before it could be put into full use. The newspaper quoted
him as saying the scientists have informed the International
Olympics Commission of their work.
	   Sandahl Christiansen was not reachable for comment by the
Associated Press.
	   The project to develop the test was sponsored by the European
Union, and involved teams from the St. Thomas Hospital in London,
the universities of Naples, Italy, and Goteborg, Sweden, and the
university hospital in Aarhus, Denmark, according to the newspaper.

Finance Ministry fails in attempt to issue domestic bonds
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with ruble trading rate, details in new 5th, 7th
grafs. &QL; 
 &UR; By SERGEI SHARGORODSKY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's Finance Ministry on Wednesday annulled a
government bond auction that had been intended to raise money for
the cash-strapped government.
	   The ministry's failure to restart the bond market, which has
been paralyzed for about two months, signaled investors' continuing
lack of confidence that the ruble could recover from its battering.
The ruble's street value in relation to the dollar has fallen by
about half over the past two and a half weeks, and official trading
between the two currencies is frozen.
	   The ministry and the Central Bank, which organized the sales,
did not say why the auction was annulled, but it appeared that
bidders were demanding very high interest. The minimum offer on the
two-week notes would have netted the investor the equivalent of 200
percent annual interest.
	   ``That there weren't any bids below 200 percent means that there
is no confidence in the ruble in the near term,'' said Dmitry
Poletayev, a trader at International Moscow Bank.
	   However, the Federal Securities Commission has said that the
bond offer may not have been legal because it was not registered
with the commission.
	   The last successful auction for Russian domestic government
bonds took place in early July. Trading of the outstanding issues
on the secondary market was suspended Aug. 17, when the government
announced that it would restructure the country's short-term debt.
	   Russian stocks were a touch lower in light trading on Wednesday
and the ruble weakened slightly in over-the-counter electronic
trading in Moscow. The U.S. dollar was selling for 13.4 to 13.7
rubles, up from 12 to 13 rubles on Tuesday.

Airports face environmental challenge in meeting passenger growth
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PHILIP WALLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The number of people using the world's airports is
set to double by 2010, a senior Airports Council International
official said Wednesday.
	   Passenger numbers are expected to rise to 5.8 billion from 2.9
billion last year, Geneva-based ACI's Director of Economics Paul
Behnke told The Associated Press.
	   But growing concerns about the environmental impact of expansion
in some regions, particularly Europe, could cause difficulties for
airports trying to satisfy the demand, ACI officials said.
	   ``It's not just a question of building new runways and
buildings,'' said ACI public affairs manager Lili Eigl.
	   Passenger traffic worldwide is expected to grow annually by an
average of 4.6 percent between now and 2010, according to ACI
forecasts. Cargo tonnages are expected to increase annually by 6.4
percent during the same period.
	   International air traffic is forecast to increase more rapidly
than domestic traffic in every region, particularly in North
America where international traffic is expected to grow nearly
twice as much as domestic.
	   In May this year, passenger numbers grew in Europe, Latin
America and North America, but dropped by seven percent in Asia and
the Pacific. Despite the region's economic slump, numbers are
expected to be growing again by 2000, said Behnke.
	   An ACI economics survey of 339 airports released this week says
they plan investing dlrs 13 billion in 1998 to cope with air
traffic increases. New airports have been opened in Asia and a
third runway is due to open this fall at Charles de Gaulle airport
in Paris.
	   But growing concern about the environment could pose
difficulties for airports reaching full capacity, said Eigl.
	   The International Federation of Airline Pilots' Associations in
April added Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport to a list of airports with
major safety problems after pilots complained of being forced to
land in strong crosswinds because noise restrictions prohibit safer
alternatives, Britain's Sunday Times reported earlier this year.
	   Schipol is trying to meet a 30 percent increase in aircraft
movements by 2003 while obeying bans on noisy aircraft and other
noise restrictions.
	   Britain's Manchester Airport has got government approval for a
new runway despite opposition from environmental campaigners
claiming it could cause massive damage.
	   The concerns have prompted airports, aircraft manufacturers and
others to get together to work out how to reduce noise and other
problems, said Eigl.
	   Meanwhile, ACI said passenger traffic at 539 airports worldwide
rose three percent in May. Cargo increased by one percent.
	   ``Despite the continuing economic downturn in the Asia Pacific
region, 1998 is proving to be relatively stable,'' said Maria
Hinayon, ACI's statistics and data processing manager.
	   The airports in the economics survey reported more than 173,000
people employed directly, with almost 1.6 million additional staff
working at airport sites. Non-aeronautical revenue such as retail
concessions, parking fees and hotels represented more than 46
percent of total income, the survey said.

Lawyer says Lockerbie suspects, if convicted, should serve time in

	   TRIPOLI, Libya (AP) _ If the two Libyans accused of the 1988
bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 are convicted, they should serve their
time in Libya and not in Britain, their Libyan lawyer said
Wednesday.
	   Ibrahim Legwell told reporters that he wanted further guarantees
on the rights of the suspects from those outlined in the plan the
U.N. Security Council endorsed Aug. 27.
	   He added that he didn't think that they would be found guilty if
``they received a fair trial.''
	   The United States and Britain, which drew up the plan, have said
it is not negotiable.
	   Under the plan, the United Nations would suspend sanctions
against Libya once it turns over two men. They are accused of
bombing the flight that exploded over Lockerbie, Scotland, on Dec.
21, 1988, killing 270 people.
	   The plan stipulates that the suspects _ Abdel Basset Ali
al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah _ be tried in the Netherlands
by a panel of three Scottish judges according to Scottish law. If
convicted, they will serve their sentences in a British prison.
	   Speaking to reporters in his office in downtown Tripoli, Legwell
said the legal team that will represent al-Megrahi and Fhimah had
not yet reached a decision on the plan.
	   But he said that he wanted more safeguards for the suspects, who
are currently under house arrest in Tripoli.
	   ``We need to know how they will spend their time (during and
after the trial),'' he said.
	   He also said he wanted guarantees of defense lawyers' access to
their clients, that the CIA and other foreign agencies will not
have access to the suspects, and that the prosecutor will be not
granted long adjournments to find witnesses.
	   Al-Megrahi and Fhimah will require a Muslim cleric, a doctor and
someone to cook traditional Libyan meals, he added.
	   Legwell's request for guarantees is similar a weekend call by
Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi for negotiations with the United
States and Britain on bringing the men to trial.
	   Spokesmen for the U.S. and British governments rejected
Gadhafi's demand. A Foreign Office spokesman said while Britain
would provide clarification, the U.N. plan was ``totally
non-negotiable.''
	   ``There are comprehensive safeguards and assurances of a safe
trial,'' the spokesman said.
	   U.S. State Department spokesman James Foley said Gadhafi's bid
to negotiate the proposal was ``tantamount to rejection.''
	   Legwell rejected the suggestion that Gadhafi would have the
final say on whether the men were handed over to Dutch custody for
a trial. He said the suspects would decide themselves after
receiving the opinion of their lawyers.
	   However, it is generally understood that Gadhafi has the final
word on all matters in Libya.

	   DURBAN, South Africa (AP) _ Congo President Laurent Kabila
attacked Rwanda and Uganda for alleged invasion of his country and
asked the Nonaligned Movement Summit to ``unequivocally condemn the
aggression and request their withdrawal.''
	   In a surprise appearance at the summit, Kabila also promised to
hold free and fair elections by 1999.
	   Kabila's appearance set a tense tone for peace talks that are to
take place on Thursday with U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan, who
is to try to mediate the month-old rebel insurrection.
	   ``At this very moment, my country fellows in occupied territory
are being assassinated, women are being raped and children are
being used as cannon fodder,'' Kabila said in the speech that
followed those by other leaders that included Cuba's Fidel Castro
	   Kabila is to meet with leaders from the five countries that have
been drawn into the conflict, including Uganda and Rwanda, who have
denied they are helping the rebels, and Zimbabwe, Angola and
Namibia, who are backing Kabila militarily.
	   Summit sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, have said
the meeting would take place over breakfast on Thursday.
	   The officials said there had already been intense efforts toward
getting the parties to agree to a cease-fire, but would not be
drawn out on prospects for an agreement emerging from the meeting
at which no rebel representatives will be present.
	   In a sign of hostility towards mediation efforts by South
Africa, Kabila bypassed the official greeting offered by President
Nelson Mandela to arriving heads of state.
	   Kabila has refused a cease-fire so far, saying it is impossible
with Rwandan and Ugandan troops on Congolese soil. However, both
those countries deny being involved.
	   After a series of rapid rebel gains, Kabila's forces, backed by
the military might of his allies, have turned the tide of war and
are now pushing the insurgents back towards Congo's eastern
borders.
	   Annan, addressing the summit, earlier appealed for Africa's
leaders to solve their problems through political and not military
means.
	   ``For every day that we fail to do so, the innocent people of
this continent pay a terrible price,'' Annan said, citing trouble
spots including Congo and Angola, where he said the U.N.-brokered
peace process is ``hanging by a thread.''
	   South African President Nelson Mandela and his new wife Graca
Machel _ widow of Mozambican leader and black liberation leader
Samora Machel _ greeted the heads of state Wednesday morning.
	   Cuban President Fidel Castro and Mandela exchanged an especially
warm embrace.
	   ``Fidel, Fidel, Fidel,'' Mandela said as he threw his arms
around Castro, dressed in a grey business suit. The two old
revolutionaries hugged, then Castro embraced Mrs. Machel.

Scientists claim to find test for human growth hormone
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) _ A group of European scientists have
discovered a test that can detect the banned performance-enhancing
substance human growth hormone, a newspaper reported Wednesday.
	   HGH, a popular alternative to steroids, cannot be detected by
standard urine-control tests.
	   ``We have found a sure method to test growth hormones,''
Professor Jens Sandahl Christiansen of Denmark was quoted as saying
by the Politiken newspaper.
	   Sandahl Christiansen said the method needs to be more widely
tested before it could be put into full use. The newspaper quoted
him as saying the scientists have informed the International
Olympics Committee of their work.
	   Sandahl Christiansen was not reachable for comment by The
Associated Press.
	   The project to develop the test was sponsored by the European
Union, and involved teams from the St. Thomas Hospital in London,
the universities of Naples, Italy, and Goteborg, Sweden, and the
university hospital in Aarhus, Denmark, according to the newspaper.

Indonesian cruise ship member third foreigner killed in Bahamas

<TEXT>
	   NASSAU, Bahamas (AP) _ An Indonesian man working on a
Miami-based cruise ship became the third foreigner killed in the
Bahamas in recent weeks when he was shot dead in a robbery
Wednesday, police reported.
	   The bodies of a British tourist and an American tourist who
disappeared on Paradise Island resort were found 11 days ago. A
North Carolina newspaper on Wednesday quoted a relative of one
victim as saying the murders raised the specter of a serial killer.
	   At about 1 a.m. Wednesday the latest victim, Johannes Hortanto,
44, was walking along Bay Street, Nassau's major shopping area,
with some friends off his cruise ship when a gang of armed men
approached and tried to rob them.
	   ``They apparently took off running, and he apparently fell,''
Assistant Police Superintendent Arnold Josey told The Associated
Press. He said the attackers caught up with Hortanto and shot him
in the side. He was rushed to the hospital, where he died a short
time later.
	   ``This is an unfortunate situation. Here's a guy who apparently
was doing what we tell people to do, traveling in a group,'' Josey
said.
	   Hortante worked on the Fantasy, belonging to Carnival cruise
line.
	   On Sunday afternoon, a Scotland Yard detective sent to
investigate the murder of British teacher Joanne Clarke, 24, was
held up at gunpoint and robbed at Fort Fincastle, a popular
historic spot for tourists.
	   Superintendent Brian Morris and his Bahamian taxi driver,
Michael Mackey, were robbed of their watches and dlrs 580. The
Nassau Tribune newspaper reported that police were questioning two
people in connection with that robbery.
	   No one has been arrested in the murders of Clarke, a teacher
from Oxfordshire who was strangled and sexually assaulted, and Lori
Fogleman, a 32-year-old second-grade teacher from Richmond,
Virginia.
	   Both women disappeared in a secluded area of Cabbage Beach, away
from the resort hotels usually crowded with tourists. Fogleman
disappeared on July 20 and Clarke on Aug. 21. Their bodies were
found Aug. 22 in some brush between the Paradise Island Golf Course
and Cabbage Beach.
	   Bahamian police will not say whether they think the deaths are
related. But Fogleman's estranged husband, A.J. Winstead, told a
North Carolina that he believed there were similarities that
suggested a serial killer.
	   ``The two women were of similar height, hair and skin color.
They were both teachers and were reported missing exactly a month
apart. We think it was a serial killer,'' Winstead was quoted as
saying in the Burlington Times-News on Wednesday.
	   FBI officers are in the Bahamas to help investigate Fogleman's
murder.
	   The latest killings bring the number of foreigners murdered in
the Bahamas since 1993 to seven, according to Douglas Hanna,
superintendent of the Criminal Investigation Department. The
Bahamian islands host about 3 million tourists each year.
	   According to the last available official figures, there were 48
murders in the Bahamas in 1996. This year there have been 20
murders, including three Bahamians killed in recent weeks,
according to Josey.

Press baron Lord Rothermere dies at 73

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ He was the last English press grandee: a bullish,
sometimes eccentric aristocrat who built the newspaper company
founded by his great-uncle into a publishing powerhouse _ and kept
it in family hands.
	   Lord Rothermere, owner of the Daily Mail, the Mail on Sunday and
London's Evening Standard, has died of a heart attack at age 73,
his office said Wednesday.
	   The third Viscount Rothermere died in St. Thomas's Hospital in
London on Tuesday night.
	   A tall, gregarious figure, Rothermere dominated the press world
for more than 30 years, turning the family firm, Associated
Newspapers, into a powerhouse that today encompasses magazines,
specialist financial publications and the second-largest portfolio
of regional newspapers in Britain.
	   In 1971, the year after he became company chairman, he made
Fleet Street history by relaunching the ailing broadsheet Daily
Mail as a tabloid and turning it into a mass-selling read for the
middle market, particularly the growing number of young career
women.
	   He launched the Mail on Sunday in 1982.
	   Even rivals had praise for the man who once said he would like
to be remembered as someone ``who helped to bring back an
appreciation that good journalism could succeed.''
	   Lord Hollick, publisher of the Daily Express, which lost a
protracted circulation war to the Daily Mail, said Wednesday that
Rothermere was ``the quintessential proprietor, passionate for his
papers, robust in his views and commercially courageous,'' who
``inspired the revolution in mid-market papers in the last 20
years.''
	   Born on Aug. 27, 1925, the son of the second Viscount
Rothermere, Vere Harold Esmond Harmsworth attended Eton before
launching his publishing career with a stint in a Canadian paper
mill, learning about newsprint.
	   He joined Associated Newspapers in 1951, working his way up
through the company that had been formed in 1896, when his
great-uncle Alfred Harmsworth, later Lord Northcliffe, launched the
Daily Mail for Britain's growing middle-class readership.
	   When Lord Northcliffe died, control passed to Rothermere's
father, Esmond Harmsworth.
	   After Vere Harmsworth took control, he closed the ailing Daily
Sketch and appointed its editor, David English, the editor of the
Daily Mail. Together, they transformed the newspaper.
	   Under Rothermere, Associated Newspapers saw its annual sales
rise from 58 million pounds (then dlrs 87 million) to more than 1
billion pounds (dlrs 1.6 billion).
	   The Daily Mail won its circulation war with the traditionally
popular Daily Express and the Evening Standard ran off Robert
Maxwell's London Daily News.
	   In 1980, Australian media tycoon Rupert Murdoch beat him to the
purchase of The Times of London, but the two men remained on good
terms and Murdoch said Wednesday that Rothermere's death was ``a
tremendous loss for the media industry.''
	   An amateur poet and devotee of Zen Buddhism, Rothermere was the
only product of Britain's great publishing clans _ including the
Beaverbrooks, Astors and Hartwells _ to retain control of the
family business.
	   He respected his editors' decisions, and agonized over his
papers. English recalled how the pair once spent an entire day in
the dining room of New York's Carlyle Hotel debating the future of
the Mail on Sunday _ and eating meal after meal.
	   Rothermere lived in France to escape British taxes and
maintained a mistress for many years, despite a solid marriage to
the actress Patricia ``Bubbles'' Brooks.
	   Always an independent thinker, in May 1997 he quit the
Conservative Party benches in the House of Lords for Labor, which
had just taken power in a landslide election victory, saying Tony
Blair's new government ``seems to me set to do great things.''
	   After ``Bubbles'' Rothermere's death in 1992, Rothermere married
his mistress, Maiko Lee. She survives him, with his son, Johnathan,
30, who takes over at Associated Newspapers, two daughters and a
step-daughter, all from his first marriage.
	   Funeral details were not immediately available.

	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ The businessman who handled the
transfer of Marcelo Salas to Argentina's River Plate several years
ago has been accused of tax evasion.
	   Carlos Silvani, head of Argentina's Federal Administration of
Public Revenue, a tax-collecting agency, presented his case
accusing businessman Gustavo Mascardi before a federal judge
Tuesday.
	   Local reports said an associate, Settimio Aloisio, was also
under investigation.
	   Mascardi and Aloisio have denied the charges.
	   Both men were involved in arranging the transfer of Marcelo
Salas to River Plate along with Cristian Traverso to Boca Juniors
in 1996. Before moving to Argentina, both played for Chile's
Universidad de Chile.
	   Salas was transferred to Italy's Lazio earlier this year in a
deal worth dlrs 21 million, a record for Argentine soccer.

French president arrives in Ukraine

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ French President Jacques Chirac arrived in
Ukraine Wednesday on the first official visit by a French president
to the former Soviet republic.
	   Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma greeted Chirac at the ornate
Mariinsky Palace in downtown Kiev, and the two proceeded to a
closed-door meeting.
	   Simultaneously, talks were scheduled to start between Ukraine's
Foreign Minister Borys Tarasyuk and his French counterpart Hubert
Vedrine.
	   Other meetings included those between Industry Minister Vasyl
Hureyev and French State Secretary for Industry Christian Pierret,
and the two countries' health ministers, Andriy Serdyuk of Ukraine
and Bernard Kouchner of France.
	   In an interview with Ukrainian television on the eve of his
trip, Chirac said his visit was meant to stimulate bilateral
relations and show Ukrainians that their country ``has its own
place in Europe.''
	   Strengthening economic cooperation and channeling more French
investment to the former Soviet nation of more than 50 million
people are also expected to top the agenda. A large group of French
businessmen is accompanying Chirac.
	   Although a number of large French companies and banks have
opened offices in Ukraine, French investment to the country has
been meager compared to other Western nations.
	   Of the more than dlrs 2 billion in foreign investment Ukraine
has received since independence in 1991, France has accounted for
about dlrs 50 million, according to Ukrainian government
statistics.
	   The flow of French investment to Ukraine was hampered by
bureaucratic hurdles many French firms encountered in the republic.
French construction material giant, Lafarge, has been goiung
through court battles since the spring to defend a stake in a large
Ukrainian cement plant it purchased this year.
	   France has expressed interest in joint aviation projects with
Ukraine. Other potential spheres of cooperation include energy
production, nuclear energy, telecommunications, space research and
food industry.
	   On Thursday, Chirac is scheduled to have another meeting with
Kuchma and to confer with Prime Minister Valery Pustovoitenko and
parliament speaker Oleksandr Tkachenko.
	   The sides are to sign four agreements, including pacts on the
peaceful uses of nuclear energy, nuclear safety and energy
cooperation, and cooperation between Ukrainian and French law
enforcement bodies.
	   Chirac is scheduled to leave for Chisinau, the capital of the
former Soviet republic of Moldova, on Friday.

IMF mission to assess situation in Ukraine before considering loan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VIKTOR LUHOVYK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ The chief of Ukraine's Central Bank said
Wednesday that the government will present its revised economic
program to the International Monetary Fund this week.
	   An IMF mission arrived in Kiev late Wednesday to assess the
situation in Ukraine before the fund's board discusses a large loan
to the former Soviet republic, the Cabinet press service reported.
	   The mission is to meet country leaders Wednesday and Thursday,
while the IMF board is scheduled to discuss the dlrs 2.2 billion
loan to Ukraine on Friday, the press service said.
	   Central Bank chief Viktor Yushchenko said the government would
send its revised program to the IMF on Thursday.
	   He said the revision _ the IMF's last requirement for discussing
the loan _ was made to take into account the consequences on
Ukraine of the financial crisis in Russia.
	   Ukraine badly needs the IMF loan to replenish the Central Bank's
reserves and maintain stability of the national hryvna currency,
which has remained under increasing pressure since the Russian
government's devaluation of the ruble on Aug. 17.
	   The turmoil in Russia forced the Central Bank to acknowledge
Wednesday that the government-set currency fluctuation band of 1.8
to 2.25 hryvnas to the dollar would be widened in the near future.
	   ``Under the circumstances, we have to consider changing the
corridor,'' Yushchenko told a news conference.
	   He said the change would be ``insignificant,'' but declined to
provide concrete figures.
	   The crisis in Russia has caused a sharp increase in demand for
dollars in Ukraine, and the Central Bank has been spending its
reserves extensively in the past two weeks to defend the hryvna.
	   However, it could not stop the hryvna's steady fall, and the
currency is already trading at 2.25 to the dollar _ the upper limit
of the currency fluctuation band.
	   The Central Bank's reserves, which stood at dlrs 1.75 billion in
July, have dropped to about dlrs 800 million, Yushchenko said.

Netanyahu invites Governor Bush for official visit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Texas Governor George Bush Jr. has accepted an
invitation from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to visit
the Jewish state, the premier's office said Wednesday.
	   Netanyahu's aide David Bar-Illan said no date had been fixed yet
for the visit.
	   Relations between Israel and the Clinton administration have
been slightly strained under Netanyahu's right-wing government,
which has taken a more hardline approach to the U.S.-sponsored
Mideast peace process.
	   Netanyahu maintains close ties with many members of the
Republican party.
	   Last week, New Jersey Governor Christine Todd Whitman spent four
days in Israel and held meetings with Netanyahu. Whitman has been
considered a possible running-mate for Bush should he seek and win
the Republican presidential nomination.

50 slaughterhouse employees let go due to Russian crisis
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) _ Danish Crown, Denmark's largest
slaughterhouse, fired 50 workers Wednesday, citing the unstable
economic situation in Russia which is its main export market for
processed meat.
	   ``Due to the present situation our exports (to Russia) are
almost at a standstill,'' said Jens Moeller, manager of Danish
Crown.
	   The firings affected every third employee at the factory in
Broenderslev, northern Denmark, which make sausages, smoked ham,
bacon and other pork products.
	   Moeller said the sale to Russia which is Danish Crown's first
export market for processed meat, would resume ``when the political
and economic situation clears up.''
	   Pork and bacon are Denmark's major export products.

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Police in 12 countries raided the homes of more
than 100 suspected pedophiles Wednesday in what authorities called
one of the largest efforts ever to break an Internet child
pornography ring.
	   The British National Crime Squad coordinated the early morning
raids as part of a five-month investigation into the so-called
Wonderland club, which authorities said exchanged pornographic
pictures of children as young as 2 on the Internet.
	   During the investigation, code-named ``Cathedral,'' police said
they found a database containing more than 100,000 pornographic
photographs of naked boys and girls and confiscated computers and
computer programs from dozens of suspects.
	   Police said they targeted 180 suspects and arrested more than
100 in the raids, which took place at 0400 GMT on three continents
_ in Australia, Austria, Belgium, Britain, Finland, France,
Germany, Italy, Norway, Portugal, Sweden and the United States.
	   ``I am unaware of another police operation that has ever pulled
together so many law enforcement agencies worldwide to effect
simultaneous raids and arrests,'' said Bob Packham, deputy director
general of the National Crime Squad.
	   In Britain, police arrested 11 men in a raid on 14 addresses. In
the United States, where the pornographic ring originated, the U.S.
Customs Service announced it had conducted 32 federal search and
seizure warrants in 22 states.

	   LONDON (AP) _ Prince Harry headed for the playing fields of Eton
on Wednesday, following his brother to the elite boarding school
favored by the aristocracy for centuries.
	   The 13-year-old prince, accompanied to the school by his father,
Prince Charles, posed briefly for photographers and a crowd of
well-wishers before entering the boarding house at the school where
he will spend much of the next five years.
	   Harry and Charles had tea with housemaster Andrew Gailey and the
parents of other boys starting at the school before being shown the
prince's room.
	   Eton is just across the River Thames from Windsor Castle, a
weekend base for the princes' grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II.
	   Harry traveled to Eton three years ago with his mother, Princess
Diana, and his father to see his brother, Prince William, sign the
school's historic entrance.
	   Harry traveled with his father Tuesday night from Balmoral, the
queen's estate in Scotland where the royal family marked the first
anniversary of Diana's death Monday. They stayed overnight at
Highgrove, Charles' country residence.
	   William, 16, planned to leave Scotland later Wednesday to return
to school.
	   Fees at Eton, founded by King Henry VI in 1440 and educator of
notables from William Pitt to Percy Bysshe Shelley, are about
15,000 pounds (dlrs 24,000) a year per pupil.

Fighting spreads south, two sides slowly move toward agreement

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Despite new clashes between Serbs
and ethnic Albanians in Kosovo, progress was reported Wednesday on
an agreement aimed at ending the fighting and reducing Serbia's
tight grip on the province's ethnic Albanian majority.
	   A senior Western diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the framework of an agreement between the Serb-led government
and Albanian politicians was taking shape as a result of shuttle
diplomacy by special U.S. envoy Christopher Hill.
	   Rather than tackling the issue of Kosovo's final status, U.S.
efforts are now focusing on reaching an interim agreement to end
the six months of fighting and slowly democratize Kosovo, giving
Albanians some self-rule, the diplomat said.
	   After an interim period of three years, the two sides could
review the agreement. The diplomat said both Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic and Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova have accepted
the idea in principle.
	   The diplomat, who is familiar with Hills' talks with both sides,
said he hoped an agreement on an ``interim accord'' would be
possible within months.
	   Kosovo Albanians want independence from Serbia, a Yugoslav
republic, while Milosevic refuses to discuss anything beyond some
form of limited autonomy. The Americans and the Europeans have
called for ``substantial autonomy'' for Albanians, who make up 90
percent of the province's population.
	   The rebel Kosovo Liberation Army has rejected any formula short
of full independence. But the rebels have suffered substantial
losses on the battlefield. The leader of the KLA's political wing,
Adem Demaci, admitted last month that the rebels were ``aware that
we, too, cannot win militarily, and one day we will have to
negotiate.''
	   Washington and the Europeans oppose full independence because
they fear it would lead to a redrawing of borders in neighboring
countries with large Albanian populations. As a minimum, they want
Milosevic to restore the autonomy to Kosovo which he revoked in
1989.
	   In Belgrade, the Fonet news agency quoted Russia's Balkan envoy,
deputy Foreign Minister Nikolai Afanasyevski, as saying an
``interim agreement'' on Kosovo is in sight.
	   ``If we manage to have the two sides agree about organizing
local self-rule in Kosovo, a common public security service and
about how to help the refugees, that would be a serious
breakthrough,'' he was quoted as saying.
	   The Western diplomat said details still under discussion
included creation of a mixed-Serbian-Albanian police force and new
Kosovo elections. He suggested that Serbian losses in fighting _
although smaller than among ethnic Albanian guerrillas _ were
contributing to Milosevic's desire for agreement.
	   He said that during Hill's meeting Tuesday with Milosevic, a
senior official complained ``about signing condolence letters to
the families of (Serb police) officers killed.''
	   On Wednesday, Hill met with Rugova. Afterward, Rugova's
followers issued a statement saying the two discussed a ``temporary
agreement between Belgrade and Pristina about a normalization of
situation in Kosovo.''
	   ``This agreement will last three years and its purpose will be
stabilization of the overall situation in Kosovo and functioning of
all institutions,'' the statement said. ``This will create
preconditions for a definitive solution of (the) status of
Kosovo.''
	   Despite the reported diplomatic progress, fighting continued
Wednesday southwest of here. Albanian sources said Serb police
attacked the village of Tusis, a suburb of the southern town of
Prizren, in fighting that left ``many dead and wounded.''
	   The Serbian Media Center in the province's capital Pristina said
the fighting began Tuesday when Albanian militants ambushed a Serb
police patrol. In the ensuing action, the center said 15 fighters
of the Kosovo Liberation Army has been killed and two policemen
were wounded.
	   The area south of Prizren, near the border with Macedonia, is
believed to be important to the guerrillas in their efforts to
smuggle arms in from Albania.

	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Government-allied troops on Wednesday
were pushing east toward the rebel-held town of Kalemie, taking
Congo's monthlong civil war away from the capital of Kinshasa and
into the heart of rebel territory.
	   The offensive came as President Laurent Kabila's military allies
said they may not stay in the Congolese war much longer and Kabila
lashed out what he said was a foreign invasion of his country.
	   Information Minister Didier Mumengi said the loyalist forces had
closed in on Kalemie, about 400 kilometers (250 miles) south of the
key rebel stronghold of Bukavu on the eastern fringe of this
central African state.
	   Rebel leaders in the eastern city of Goma, however, said they
were reinforcing their positions in Kalemie and two other
rebel-held towns _ Moba and Manono, Kabila's birthplace _ in the
copper-rich Katanga province of southern Congo.
	   Chief rebel commander Jean-Pierre Ondekane said his forces
continued to advance into Katanga, but gave no details.
	   The coalition rebel force of ethnic Tutsi fighters and former
troops in Kabila's military was pushed out of western Congo over
the weekend, halting a month-long advance on the capital, Kinshasa,
and shifting the focus of the war on the east.
	   In Angola, though, defense chiefs from Kabila's military allies
agreed Wednesday to end their involvement soon in the Congolese
war.
	   ``We intervened to prevent a military power-grab. This first
step was completed successfully. We believe it will be fully
accomplished in the next few days,'' Angolan armed forces chief
Gen. Joao de Matos told reporters after talks in Angola's capital,
Luanda, with defense ministers from Namibia and Zimbabwe. He
declined to give a timetable for any withdrawal.
	   With his capital in peril, Kabila in recent weeks enlisted the
military support of Angola, Zimbabwe and Namibia. Angolan and
Zimbabwean forces turned the tide on the western front and are now
pushing east.
	   The rebels, many of whom supported Kabila's own rise to power
just 16 months ago in a rebellion over longtime Zairian dictator
Mobutu Sese Seko, accuse Kabila of corruption and nepotism.
	   But Kabila's government says Rwanda and Uganda used the
Tutsi-led rebellion to disguise what amounts to an invasion of
Congo by their forces.
	   Both countries deny involvement in the uprising, although war
prisoners displayed before the international press said they were
from Rwanda and Uganda.
	   On Wednesday, only sporadic gunfire was reported in parts of
western Congo, where government-allied troops have been blocking
routed rebel fighters from seeking safe passage out of the area.
	   An unspecified number of rebels trying to flee from near
Songololo, a town about 250 kilometers (150 miles) southwest of
Kinshasa, were ``effectively considered prisoners of war,'' Deputy
Interior Minister Faustin Munene said.
	   The government is demanding the withdrawal of all Rwandan and
Uganda troops from Congolese soil before the rebels will be
permitted a safe retreat.
	   In South Africa, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan called for
the withdrawal of all foreign troops _ Angolan, Zimbabwean,
Nambian, Rwandan and Ugandan _ from Congo.
	   Annan is in South Africa to attend meetings of Nonaligned
Movement member states. Several state leaders at the meetings will
take part in a mini-summit to discuss the crisis in Congo.
	   Kabila arrived unexpectedly at the summit Wednesday, raising
hopes for a negotiated end to the fighting.
	   But he set a tense tone for Annan's peace talks, accusing Rwanda
and Uganda of invading his country and asking the Nonaligned
Movement Summit to ``unequivocally condemn the aggression and
request their withdrawal.''
	   ``At this very moment, my country fellows in occupied territory
are being assassinated, women are being raped and children are
being used as cannon fodder,'' Kabila said.
	   Kabila is to meet with leaders from Zimbabwe, Angola, Namibia,
Uganda and Rwanda.
	   Summit sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, have said
the meeting would take place Thursday over breakfast.

by his opponent in last fall's election, police said.

and was listed in satisfactory condition Wednesday.
	   Giuseppe Pietrangelo, 53, who lost to Thomson last November in a
landslide, 89 percent to 11 percent, was arrested at his home
shortly after the attack and was charged with attempted murder.
	   Thomson was thrashed with a homemade solid steel cane.
	   ``The mayor was hurt and weak, barely able to talk,'' said K.R.
Davidson, deputy chief of the Niagara Regional Police. ``He lost a
lot of blood.''
	   Police gave no motive for the attack.

Press baron Lord Rothermere dies at 73

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ He was the last English press grandee: a bullish,
sometimes eccentric aristocrat who built the newspaper company
founded by his great-uncle into a publishing powerhouse _ and kept
it in family hands.
	   Lord Rothermere, owner of the Daily Mail, the Mail on Sunday and
London's Evening Standard, has died of a heart attack at age 73,
his office said Wednesday.
	   The third Viscount Rothermere died in St. Thomas's Hospital in
London on Tuesday night.
	   A tall, gregarious figure, Rothermere dominated the press world
for more than 30 years, turning the family firm, Associated
Newspapers, into a powerhouse that today encompasses magazines,
specialist financial publications and the second-largest portfolio
of regional newspapers in Britain.
	   In 1971, the year after he became company chairman, he made
Fleet Street history by relaunching the ailing broadsheet Daily
Mail as a tabloid and turning it into a mass-selling read for the
middle market, particularly the growing number of young career
women.
	   He launched the Mail on Sunday in 1982.
	   Even rivals had praise for the man who once said he would like
to be remembered as someone ``who helped to bring back an
appreciation that good journalism could succeed.''
	   Lord Hollick, publisher of the Daily Express, which lost a
protracted circulation war to the Daily Mail, said Wednesday that
Rothermere was ``the quintessential proprietor, passionate for his
papers, robust in his views and commercially courageous,'' who
``inspired the revolution in mid-market papers in the last 20
years.''
	   Born on Aug. 27, 1925, the son of the second Viscount
Rothermere, Vere Harold Esmond Harmsworth attended Eton before
launching his publishing career with a stint in a Canadian paper
mill, learning about newsprint.
	   He joined Associated Newspapers in 1951, working his way up
through the company that had been formed in 1896, when his
great-uncle Alfred Harmsworth, later Lord Northcliffe, launched the
Daily Mail for Britain's growing middle-class readership.
	   When Lord Northcliffe died, control passed to Rothermere's
father, Esmond Harmsworth.
	   After Vere Harmsworth took control, he closed the ailing Daily
Sketch and appointed its editor, David English, the editor of the
Daily Mail. Together, they transformed the newspaper.
	   Under Rothermere, Associated Newspapers saw its annual sales
rise from 58 million pounds (then dlrs 87 million) to more than 1
billion pounds (dlrs 1.6 billion).
	   The Daily Mail won its circulation war with the traditionally
popular Daily Express and the Evening Standard ran off Robert
Maxwell's London Daily News.
	   In 1980, Australian media tycoon Rupert Murdoch beat him to the
purchase of The Times of London, but the two men remained on good
terms and Murdoch said Wednesday that Rothermere's death was ``a
tremendous loss for the media industry.''
	   Soon after that, Fleet Street lost its storied status as the
traditional home of British newspaper offices when new technology
and changing working practices made it cheaper for them to relocate
to London's Docklands area.

Espanyol releases Bielsa to coach Argentina's national team

<TEXT>
	   BARCELONA, Spain (AP) _ After a marathon round of negotiations
to try and make him stay, Spanish first-division side Espanyol has
decided to free Marcelo Bielsa to become Argentina's national team
coach.
	   Bielsa resigned Wednesday but has agreed to continue coaching
Espanyol until December 24, the club's president, Daniel Sanchez
Llibre, sitting alongside the coach, said at a press conference.
	   ``I am leaving Espanyol feeling indebted to them'', Bielsa said
although he admitted being delighted with his new task.
	   ``This is the highest point of my professional career and there
is nothing in the world of soccer that could surpass it,'' he said.
	   Bielsa, who took over Espanyol earlier this summer, was last
month announced as Argentina's replacement for Daniel Passarella,
whose contract was not renewed following the World Cup.
	   The announcement angered Espanyol representatives who said
Bielsa had to work out his contract for this season with the club.
	   A former player, Bielsa has coached Argentine club Newell's Old
Boys and Mexico's Atlas and Club America. Last season, he steered
Argentina's Velez Sarsfield to the league title.
	   Bielsa said he has been happy in Spain and intended to ``come
back in the future to pay off his debt.''

Clinton meets with Russian opposition leaders

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ U.S. President Bill Clinton met with Russia's
opposition leaders on Wednesday, and one politician came away so
impressed that he declared his envy for Monica Lewinsky.
	   Clinton's admission of an improper relationship with the White
House intern has been widely publicized in Russia, although most
Russians seem supportive of the U.S. president and incredulous that
the affair could cause political trouble.
	   On Wednesday, Clinton met with half a dozen opposition leaders
from across the political spectrum to listen to their views about
Russia's crisis and ways to resolve it.
	   ``He was certainly interested in the political situation in
Russia,'' said the governor of the central Russian region of
Saratov, Dmitry Ayatskov. ``The U.S. president, like the Russians,
certainly wants the situation to be stable.''
	   Other guests at U.S. Ambassador James Collins' residence
included Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov and Krasnoyarsk governor
Alexander Lebed _ both potential leading candidates in the 2000
presidential election _ and several parliamentary leaders.
	   Zyuganov, who arrived at the meeting eager to promote his views
on the allegedly evil nature of President Boris Yeltsin's reforms,
was apparently pleased with having gotten Clinton's ear.
	   Zyuganov stated after the meeting that now Clinton has learned
about the real situation in Russia.
	   ``At least, he listened very attentively,'' Zyuganov said.
	   As the guests lounged around the reception hall, Clinton talked
to each of the politicians individually, asking about their views
on Russia's crisis.
	   ``As far as we could, we answered what we thought _ we gave
different answers, of course,'' said Vladimir Lukin, a leader of
the liberal Yabloko faction and chief of parliament's international
affairs committee.
	   And Ayatskov, the flamboyant Saratov governor, was apparently
much impressed with Clinton's ability to listen.
	   ``I envy Monica Lewinsky _ he is a great guy,'' Ayatskov
declared.

	   DURBAN, South Africa (AP) _ Congo President Laurent Kabila

	   In a surprise appearance at the summit, Kabila also promised to

take place on Thursday with U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who
will try to mediate the monthlong rebel insurrection.
	   ``At this very moment, my country fellows in occupied territory
are being assassinated, women are being raped and children are
being used as cannon fodder,'' Kabila said in the speech that
followed those by other leaders that included Cuba's Fidel Castro.
	   Annan is to meet with leaders from the five countries that have
been drawn into the conflict, including Uganda and Rwanda, Kabila's
alleged enemies, and and Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia, who are
backing Kabila militarily.
	   It was not clear if Kabila would attend the meeting.
	   Veteran U.S. diplomat Princeton Lyman said Rwanda and Uganda _
who have denied involvement _ do have troops in Congo.
	   ``There are foreign troops on both sides, and that's got to be
recognized, and a plan for withdrawing them has to be part of the
(peace) process,'' Lyman said in an interview with The Associated
Press. Lyman is attending the summit as a ``guest'' _ the first
time Washington has had an official representative at a Nonaligned
Movement summit.
	   Lyman, who heads the State Department bureau that deals with
international organizations, said his delegation has contacted all
parties involved in the Congo war to come to an agreement that
includes a cease-fire, withdrawal of foreign troops, and a
broadening of the government in Congo.
	   Summit sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, have said
the meeting with Annan would take place Thursday over breakfast.
	   The officials said there were intense efforts to get the parties
to agree to a cease-fire, but would not speculate about prospects
for an agreement since rebel representatives won't be at the
meeting.
	   In a sign of hostility towards mediation efforts by South
Africa, Kabila bypassed the official greeting President Nelson
Mandela offered arriving heads of state.
	   Kabila has refused a cease-fire so far, saying it is impossible
with Rwandan and Ugandan troops on Congolese soil. However, both
those countries deny being involved.
	   After a series of rapid rebel gains, Kabila's forces, backed by
the military might of his allies, have turned the tide and are now
pushing the insurgents back towards Congo's eastern borders.
	   Annan, addressing the summit, earlier appealed for Africa's
leaders to solve their problems through political and not military
means.
	   ``For every day that we fail to do so, the innocent people of
this continent pay a terrible price,'' Annan said, citing trouble
spots including Congo and Angola, where he said the U.N.-brokered
peace process is ``hanging by a thread.''
	   South African President Nelson Mandela and his new wife Graca
Machel _ widow of Mozambican president and black liberation leader
Samora Machel _ greeted the heads of state Wednesday morning.
	   Cuban President Fidel Castro and Mandela exchanged an especially
warm embrace.
	   ``Fidel, Fidel, Fidel,'' Mandela said as he threw his arms
around Castro, dressed in a gray business suit. The two old
revolutionaries hugged, then Castro embraced Mrs. Machel.

Seeded players zip into third round except for Sugiyama
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: NEW with Wednesday's early matches; EDITS to conform &QL; 
 &UR; By BOB GREENE &QC;

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The road into the women's third round at the
U.S. Open was an expressway for Steffi Graf and the other top
women. Ai Sugiyama, however, ran into a snag.
	   Graf, the eighth seed, took only 41 minutes to zip past German
compatriot Marlene Weingartner 6-0, 6-1; No. 11 Patty Schnyder of
Switzerland ousted Aubrie Rippner of the United States 6-1, 6-2 in
52 minutes, and No. 14 Dominique Van Roost of Belgium stayed on
court for only 47 minutes in beating Poland's Magdalena Grzybowska
6-0, 6-0.
	   Sugiyama, the 16th seed from Japan, sprained her left ankle and
was forced to retire in the first set of her match while leading
Gala Leon Garcia of Spain 3-2.
	   Sugiyama was the first seeded woman to tumble out of the year's
final Grand Slam tournament.
	   Graf got just what she was looking for: an easy match, yet one
that let her get into the groove as Weingartner kept the ball in
play, but could do nothing to hurt the former No. 1 player.
	   Graf controlled nearly every point as she pounded out the easy
victory and ran her consecutive match winning streak at the U.S.
Open to 16. She won the title in her last two appearances here, but
missed last year's tournament when she was recuperating from knee
surgery.
	   With a little luck and several close line calls, defending men's
champion Patrick Rafter won a close match Tuesday night. As usual.
	   Morocco's Hicham Arazi was weaving his spell over the No. 3
seed, taking the first two sets and closing in on a service break
to go up 3-1 in the third.
	   Controlling an opponent as if he had him on a string, Arazi
jerked Rafter from side to side, then whipped a backhand crosscourt
that bounced right at the sideline. When umpire Norm Chryst upheld
the out call, Arazi lost his cool and his concentration, and Rafter
began the long climb to the second round at the National Tennis
Center.
	   ``Down 2-0, I figured I had a fine vacation coming, be able to
watch Pearl Jam,'' Rafter said. ``But I hung in there and came
back.''
	   Rafter's 4-6, 4-6, 6-3, 6-3, 6-1 victory was his 10th in 12
five-set matches, and the ninth consecutive five-setter in which he
has been victorious.

Russia's Central Bank leaves ruble to float
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS, UPDATES with Central Bank abandoning ruble band. &QL; 
 &UR; By SERGEI SHARGORODSKY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian ruble went far beyond the state-set
fluctuation band Wednesday and the Central Bank said it had no
choice but to leave the currency to the mercy of market forces.
	   ``We are faced with the option of either using government
reserves to attempt to keep the rate in the set corridor, or allow
it to float, leaving government reserves for urgent needs,''
Central Bank deputy chairman Denis Kiselyov said in a radio
interview.
	   ``That is the policy we are adopting - and we think it is the
right policy,'' Kiselyov added. ``Therefore, a floating rate is the
only option we now have.''
	   The Central Bank announced on Aug. 17 that the ruble would be
allowed to fluctuate in a band of 6.0-9.5 to the U.S. dollar, and
has suspended its dollar sales.
	   But the official rate broke through the lower limit for the
ruble Tuesday, and was set at 10.88 against the dollar. By
Wednesday, it had fallen to as low as 12.82.
	   The bank's announcement came just after the Finance Ministry
annulled a government bond auction that had been intended to raise
money for the cash-strapped government.
	   The failure to restart the bond market, which has been paralyzed
for about two months, signaled investors' continuing lack of
confidence that the ruble could recover from its battering.
	   The ministry and the Central Bank, which organized the sales,
did not say why the auction was annulled, but it appeared that
bidders were demanding very high interest. The minimum offer on the
two-week notes would have netted the investor the equivalent of 200
percent annual interest.
	   ``That there weren't any bids below 200 percent means that there
is no confidence in the ruble in the near term,'' said Dmitry
Poletayev, a trader at International Moscow Bank.
	   However, the Federal Securities Commission has said that the
bond offer may not have been legal because it was not registered
with the commission.
	   The last successful auction for Russian domestic government
bonds took place in early July. Trading of the outstanding issues
on the secondary market was suspended Aug. 17, when the government
announced that it would restructure the country's short-term debt.
	   As financial turmoil continued to rage, Russia's State Duma, the
lower house of parliament, proposed Wednesday that President Boris
Yeltsin fire Central Bank chief Sergei Dubinin. Many blame Dubinin
for failing to avoid the crisis and the resulting paralysis of the
banking system.
	   Dubinin immediately responded that he would not step down.
	   Trying to avoid a collapse of the national banking system, the
Central Bank on Wednesday ordered commercial banks to calculate
their losses, audit their capital and increase loss provisions,
with major banks to complete approved audits by Sept. 15. It also
told major banks to transfer private deposits to the state-run
Sberbank to guarantee their safety.
	   Other developments on Wednesday hardly brought relief to the
battered interim government.
	   The Federal Tax Service chief, Boris Fyodorov, said tax
collections in August had amounted to 11.2 billion rubles, some 2
billion rubles less than planned. He said the financial crisis had
pushed many taxpayers to delay payments, while those actually made
often were stranded in the banks.
	   Meanwhile, International Monetary Fund officials were quoted as
saying the fund might delay its next disbursement of a major
stabilization loan.
	   A dlrs 4.3 billion disbursement is expected in coming weeks, but
IMF officials said Russia must do more to improve the economic
situation, Russian media reported.
	   Russia reached a deal in July with the IMF and other
international financial institutions for more than dlrs 22 billion
in loans this year and next, but the money did not ward off the
latest economic crisis.

IOC Coordination Commission visits Athens for first time
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ An International Olympic Committee
commission Wednesday received its first progress report on the
Athens 2004 Games, and reviewed some proposed venue changes made by
Greek organizers.
	   IOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch also took the opportunity
to sign an agreement for Athens to organize a four-year Cultural
Olympiad starting in 2000.
	   ``There are indeed some changes being proposed on the location
of sports venues,'' said Jacques Rogge, president of the IOC
Coordination Committee. ``Basically a change is not a bad thing.
The changes proposed meet the requirements ... I believe the end
result will be better locations.''
	   Some of the changes include moving venues for some sports such
as baseball and equestrian events. Rowing and canoeing may also be
changed because of environmental concerns.
	   There are no major changes planned as Athens has completed more
than two-thirds of the facilities necessary to stage the Games. Key
projects _ including a new subway and a new airport _ are due for
completion by 2001.
	   Rogge and IOC General Manager Francois Carrard late Wednesday
held the first of a series of meetings with the Greek organizing
committee. They were the first meetings since Athens was awarded
the Games one year ago and announcements about the talks are
expected Friday.
	   Preparations for the Summer Games have been mired in
bureaucratic wrangling and complaints by the Greek organizing
committee of a lack of communication with government agencies and
officials.
	   On the sidelines, Samaranch signed an agreement with Greek
Culture Minister Evangelos Venizelos and a UNESCO representative to
set up a foundation to organize the Cultural Olympiad.
	   Proposed by Venizelos to UNESCO last October and accepted by all
member countries, the Cultural Olympiad foundation will undertake
to organize a series of cultural events during the four years
leading up to the 2004 Games. It is not binding on any future
Olympic Games organizers.
	   Samaranch also signed a deal setting up a special space for
Greece in the Olympic Museum in Lausanne, Switzerland. It will
initially house ancient art and statues from the archeological
museum in Ancient Olympia, birthplace of the Olympic Games nearly
3,000 years ago. They were revived here in 1896.
	   After signing the deal, Samaranch said he was looking forward to
the Athens Games because they would have a third dimension beyond
sports and culture.
	   ``They can be different. There is sport and culture, But in
Athens we have a third dimension. Real Olympic history,'' Samaranch
said.

Fighting spreads south, two sides slowly move toward agreement

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with coming visits by assistant secretary of state,
Senator Dole in grafs 7-8. &QL; 
 &UR; By GEORGE JAHN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Despite new clashes between Serbs
and ethnic Albanians, progress was reported Wednesday on an
agreement aimed at ending the fighting and reducing Serbia's tight
grip on the province's ethnic Albanian majority.
	   A senior Western diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the framework of an agreement between the Serb-led government
and Albanian politicians was taking shape as a result of shuttle
diplomacy by special U.S. envoy Christopher Hill.
	   Rather than tackling the issue of Kosovo's final status, U.S.
efforts are now focusing on reaching an interim agreement to end
the six months of fighting and slowly democratize Kosovo, giving
Albanians some self-rule, the diplomat said.
	   After an interim period of three years, the two sides could
review the agreement. The diplomat said both Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic and Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova have accepted
the idea in principle.
	   The diplomat, who is familiar with Hills' talks with both sides,
said he hoped an agreement on an ``interim accord'' would be
possible within months.
	   ``It may not be a touchdown, but at least we have a first
down,'' the diplomat told reporters.
	   Continuing the U.S. scrutiny of Kosovo, John Shattuck, assistant
secretary of state for human rights, and Senator Robert Dole were
expected in Pristina in the coming days.
	   U.S. officials, who asked not to be identified, said Shattuck
was arriving Friday evening and Dole Saturday. Both were likely to
tour refugee areas and investigate kidnappings by both sides before
leaving Sunday.

East German voters sour on Kohl, once-beloved `unification

<TEXT>
	   LEIPZIG, Germany (AP) _ Snapshots of Leipzig, 1989: Protesters
fill the streets. Riot police guard the main square. Lights glow
from evening prayer in the Nikolaikirche, the medieval church that
was the center of East Germany's anti-communist movement.
	   The peaceful revolution that started in Leipzig ended in 1990,
when Chancellor Helmut Kohl oversaw the merging of communist East
with capitalist West. It was a time of hope _ for the city and for
Kohl. Declaring himself Germany's ``unification chancellor,'' he
promised ``blooming landscapes'' for the downtrodden eastern
states. And they believed.
	   Today, the pictures look far different.
	   The eastern mood is one of disillusionment with high
unemployment and with what some people see as the selfishness of
capitalism. Struggling in his push for an unprecedented fifth term,
Kohl needs the east German vote on Sept. 27 but looks unlikely to
get it from people who say he broke his promise to bring them a
better life.
	   As Kohl addressed a crowd Tuesday night in Leipzig's main
square, boos, shrill whistles and shouts of ``Kohl must go!''
drowned out the tepid clapping of supporters far outnumbered by the
hecklers. Protests louder than these have greeted Kohl on eastern
campaign stops in recent weeks, but Leipzig _ the heartland of
German unification _ was a symbolic snub.
	   ``There's a strange tension here in the east,'' said Friedrich
Magirius, the retired Lutheran priest who lead the Nikolaikirche
when it was a nucleus of communist-era dissent. ``Most people are
doing better overall. Certainly, no one wants to go back to
communism. But it's all very uncertain, because the economy here is
so much worse than in the west.''
	   However improved life is now in the five eastern states,
easterners disgruntled with Kohl aren't comparing themselves to
where they were 10 years ago. They compare themselves to west
Germany and come up short, feeling like second-class citizens
living with bad roads, surrounded by ugly, communist-era buildings
and suffering under unemployment at 17.4 percent, nearly twice what
it is in the west.
	   After communism, many east Germans flocked to Kohl's Christian
Democratic party. And east German voters were instrumental in
re-electing the ``unification chancellor'' in 1994, giving him 38
percent of the vote in the former east.
	   Today, the Leipzig Institute polling agency finds that 51
percent of East German voters would chose the Social Democrats,
compared to 22 percent for Kohl's party. The poll of 1,000 people,
published Wednesday, had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.7
percentage points.
	   And yet eastern voters are wild cards, believed to be too new to
democracy to have loyalty to any one party. So-called ``protest
voters'' also are part of the picture. Voters in one eastern state,
for example, recently showed disgust with the status-quo by giving
13 percent of a state vote to an extreme-rightist party whose views
border on neo-Nazism. Others in the east suffer from voter apathy.
	   ``My vote isn't going to be the one that decides, anyway,'' said
18-year-old Uwe Herzog, a declared non-voter, as oompah music
blasted from speakers before the Kohl speech.
	   Kohl, who trails far behind the younger, slicker Schroeder in
the polls, only occasionally appealed directly to eastern voters
Tuesday in an extemporaneous, 90-minute speech that rambled from
World War II remembrances to the unification of Europe.
	   ``To speak in Leipzig is the fulfillment of a dream,'' he boomed
from the podium, invoking the city's role in bringing down
communism and unifying Germany. ``We must recapture the feeling of
unity we had back then.''
	   About 1,500 supporters _ most of them middle-aged or older _
stood in a cordoned area of the square, clapping politely. Heckles
came from the 5,000 younger people outside the cordon, some of them
blowing whistles continuously or holding placards with sarcastic
slogans such as ``Helmut, thanks for everything!''
	   ``I do not scold young people, who ... are now screaming around
here because they don't even know what they are actually doing,''
Kohl said, drawing even stronger more boos and whistles.

Iraq says suspension of reviews would be meaningless
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MARIAM SAMI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq on Wednesday dismissed as
``meaningless'' all joint U.S.-British attempts to end regular
reevaluations of U.N. economic sanctions against it.
	   Such attempts would only force Iraq to ``protect its interests
and security and take other strict measures,'' Deputy Prime
Minister Tariq Aziz said.
	   His statement was Iraq's first official reaction to efforts by
Britain and the United States to persuade the world body to suspend
the 60-day reviews of sanctions imposed after Iraq invaded
neighboring Kuwait in 1990. Without periodic reevaluations, Iraq's
chances of getting the sanctions lifted will diminish further.
	   Washington and London are threatening a suspension of the
reviews to try to force Iraq to resume cooperation with the United
Nations Special Commission and its disarmament inspectors. Iraq
stopped cooperating on Aug. 5, accusing the inspectors of being
biased and spying for the United States.
	   UNSCOM is responsible for identifying and eliminating weapons of
mass destruction that Iraq is suspected of hiding. Until the
inspectors can verify that Iraq has no such arms, the Security
Council will not lift the embargo.
	   The sanctions prevent Iraq from selling oil, the mainstay of its
economy, in the open market. In the past, Iraq has threatened
unspecified measures if the sanctions were not lifted immediately.
	   ``Halting the reviews ... is meaningless to Iraq, except that it
establishes the fact that there is no need to continue cooperating
with UNSCOM,'' Aziz said.
	   ``If anyone thinks Iraq will back down from its Aug. 5 decision
under these pressures or threats, or whatever else, they are
disillusioned,'' he said.
	   U.S. officials say they hope the council will soon adopt the
draft on suspending the reviews.
	   If that happens, it will mean the council ``continues its
negative stand on Iraq's legitimate right to lift the sanctions,
and this is something that cannot be ignored,'' Aziz said.

Hecht still confident European Super League will kick off by 2000
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: updates, adds quotes from Hecht in 6th graf &QL; 
 &UR; By JOHN PYE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Rodolfo Hecht, whose Milan-based company Media
Partners is behind moves to create the European Football League,
said Wednesday he was ``more confident than ever'' the competition
will kick off by the year 2000.
	   Hecht said his meetings with potential European Football League
clubs on Monday and Tuesday had been productive and the league was
developing rapidly.
	   However, he said it was too early to officially name the clubs
involved.
	   His announcement coincided with a warning from England's
Football Association chairman Keith Wiseman that English players
and Premier League clubs would be subject to international and
domestic bans for participating in the unsanctioned competition.
	   UEFA, European soccer's governing body, has also opposed the
breakaway league and has set up a task force to investigate ways of
restructuring its own tournaments to prevent the formation of a
rival league.
	   But Hecht said the FA and UEFA had voiced preliminary objections
to the league because they didn't have all the facts about the
competition.
	   ``The reaction so far has been based on a caricature of the
European Football League,'' he said.
	   ``The reason for that is that the people involved in the project
didn't feel in a position to divulge any information until our
partners, the clubs, fully understood and supported the concepted.
	   ``Now I'm completely confident we have that support and can
continue our dynamic process of creating the league,'' Hecht said.
	   ``Why should we encounter opposition before the other parties
know exactly what we're talking about?''
	   Hecht said the clubs would own the competition, based on a
similar system operating between the Football Association and the
Premier League, with UEFA as a regulator.
	   ``We aim to deliver something really good _ a project with no
losers.''
	   Hecht said when the competition was set up, Media Partners would
get out of the administration and take on a marketing role.
	   He said improvements to the proposed EFL were what the fans
wanted.
	   ``Improvements to the structure of the competition have been
made, having listened not only to the clubs but also to the
supporters, the national leagues and UEFA,'' Hecht said after his
meetings with the clubs in London.
	   ``I am more confident than ever that we will see the
modernization of European club competitions in time for the
2000-2001 season, for the benefit of the clubs and the fans.''
	   Hecht unveiled modified plans for the competition, including an
increase from 16 to 18 teams in the top-flight of the Super League
and the implementation of a promotion and relegation system based
on merits.
	   The EFL will comprise two competitions. The Super League will
comprise 36 teams in two divisions and the Pro Cup will involve 96
teams, from all the territories covered by UEFA's 51 associations,
in a knock-out competition.
	   Hecht said EFL was expected to generate more than 1.25 billion
pounds (dlrs 2.05 billion) every season for six seasons, with 50
million pounds (dlrs 82 million) going to the development of youth
soccer each season.
	   ``The EFL will be open and accountable. It will be 100 percent
owned by the clubs (like the existing national leagues in England,
Scotland and the Netherlands,'' Hecht said.
	   ``The clubs support offering a regulatory and administrative
role to UEFA.
	   ``UEFA has also been offered responsibility for allocating the
money which will be generated by the EFL for the good of amateur
and youth football.''

Sao Paulo takes young team against San Lorenzo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ Sao Paulo will try a new, younger team
against Argentina's San Lorenzo on Thursday, hoping to win a share
of first place in Group A of the Copa Mercosur.
	   Coach Nelsinho Baptista has once again tinkered with the lineup
of his team, which has been uneven all season.
	   In its latest formation, 22-year-old midfielder Edmilson is
starting on defense in place of Ze Carlos, a member of the
Brazilian team at the World Cup in France.
	   In the midfield, veteran Capitao was benched to make room for
21-year-old Sidney.
	   The team is still trying to find its feet after the loss of
all-stars Denilson and Rai. Denilson transferred to Spain's Real
Betis after the World Cup, while Rai is recovering from torn knee
ligaments and will be sidelined for six months.
	   In the Brazilian championship, Sao Paulo occupies a modest 11th
place among 24 teams, 13 points behind leader Corinthians.
	   Its campaign in the Copa Mercosur, the team is tied with
Cruzeiro for second place with three points each. Sao Paulo beat
Colo Colo of Chile 1-0 at home and got thumped 5-1 by Cruzeiro in
Belo Horizonte.
	   After two victories at home, San Lorenzo now goes on the road
for the first time. With victories over Cruzeiro 2-1 and Colo Colo
3-0, the Argentines are in first place with six points.

Swiss say dlrs 40 million frozen in Thai bank scandal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: INCORPORATES Thailand-Bank Scandal. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ Swiss authorities have frozen dlrs 40
million in accounts linked to a Thai bank scam, a spokesman for the
Swiss Office of Police Affairs said Wednesday.
	   The sum was initially frozen in July 1996 by local judicial
authorities when a Zurich bank reported suspicions of money
laundering, Folco Galli said. Most of the money was formally
blocked last month.
	   Bangkok newspaper The Nation reported that Thai prosecutors have
found billions of baht worth of overseas assets belonging to the
suspects in the scandal surrounding the Bangkok Bank of Commerce
and ordered them frozen.
	   It reported that the assets were located in Switzerland, Canada
and Russia, but gave no precise figure. The baht is currently
trading at 40 to dlrs 1.
	   Following the initial Swiss move to freeze the assets, the
Zurich district attorney's office invited Thai authorities to make
a formal request for legal assistance, Galli said.
	   After a series of such requests were received, the block was
confirmed last month and the bank told to hand over documents.
Appeals against the freeze are pending at a Zurich court.
	   The Bangkok Bank of Commerce was the center of Thailand's
biggest-ever banking scandal. In 1996, directors revealed that it
had bad debts approaching 75 billion baht (dlrs 3 billion at the
time).
	   The bank's troubles triggered a loss of confidence in the Thai
banking system that led to floating the baht a year later, the move
that triggered the Asian economic crisis.
	   So far, no one has been convicted of any wrongdoing in the bank,
though violations of Thai banking regulations were legion. After
being kept alive by the government for the past two years, the bank
was closed as part of recent financial reforms.
	   The Nation reported that several politicians were among the
suspects in the scandal, which involved borrowing money from the
bank with insufficient collateral and never repaying it. No names
were given.
	   Direk Sunthornket, a deputy attorney general, was quoted as
saying that the recent closure could make it harder to locate
witnesses and documents that can bring suspects to court.
	   Rakesh Saxena, the bank's adviser, has been blamed by Thai
authorities for most of the shady practices at the bank. He has
fled to Canada and is fighting attempts to extradite him.
	   Galli said that Thai police are investigating ``a number of
officials'' of the bank but gave no further details.

Progress at Berlin's Potsdamer Platz: a new theater and Sony HQ
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ A 19-screen movie theater opened Wednesday among
the construction cranes and half-finished buildings of Potsdamer
Platz, and Sony inaugurated its European headquarters _ two signs
of progress for the city's developing commerce center.
	   The Cinemaxx theater stands on property owned by industrial
conglomerate Daimler-Benz, whose 30-story terra-cotta-tiled Debis
building was completed this summer and opens officially in October.
	   Potsdamer Platz, the heart of prewar Berlin and once one of
Europe's busiest intersections, stood empty during the Cold War but
for a stretch of the Berlin Wall that divided the city into
communist and capitalist sectors.
	   Its revival is central to the return of the German capital to
Berlin next year.
	   The triangular Sony complex will house the Japanese electronics
giant's European headquarters, along with restaurants and a casino.
	   Sony also is building an eight-screen cinema in Potsdamer Platz,
and other planned theaters mean that by 2000 the area will have 28
screens. It is to become the new venue for the Berlin film
festival.

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DURBAN, South Africa (AP) _ In a surprise appearance at the
Nonaligned Movement summit Wednesday, Congo President Laurent
Kabila blasted Rwanda and Uganda, saying they had invaded his vast
central African country.
	   Instead of being a love fest of leaders of developing countries,
the Congo war _ which involves troops from as many as six countries
_ proved divisive. Underscoring his hostility toward mediation
efforts spearheaded by South Africa, Kabila bypassed President
Nelson Mandela as he was greeting the 53 heads of government who
arrived for the summit Wednesday.
	   Kabila then took the podium to ask the leaders of developing
nations to ``unequivocally condemn the aggression'' of Uganda and
Rwanda and request their troops' withdrawal from Congo.
	   ``At this very moment, my country fellows in occupied territory
are being assassinated, women are being raped and children are
being used as cannon fodder,'' Kabila said, wearing his trademark
safari suit and reading his speech through thick glasses.
	   Kabila also promised to hold free and fair elections by 1999.
	   Kabila's appearance set a tense tone as U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan was trying to hold peace talks here with regional
leaders. Kabila met with Annan. No details were immediately
available.
	   Uganda and Rwanda have denied their forces are helping Congolese
rebels. But senior U.S. diplomat Princeton Lyman, a guest at the
summit, said Rwanda and Uganda do have troops in Congo.
	   ``There are foreign troops on both sides, and that's got to be
recognized, and a plan for withdrawing them has to be part of the
(peace) process,'' Lyman said in an interview with The Associated
Press.
	   Kabila, meanwhile, thanked Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia for
sending troops to help battle the rebels and later lunched with
Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos, Zimbabwean President
Robert Mugabe and Namibian President Sam Nujoma, said Kabila
spokesman Kikaya Bin Karubi.
	   Lyman said his delegation has contacted all parties involved in
the Congo war to come to an agreement that includes a cease-fire,
the withdrawal of foreign troops, a broadening of the government in
Congo to be more representative and to deal with the humanitarian
situation.
	   ``We've been very concerned about the humanitarian situation.
There are reports of massacres. Hate radio going on, People in
detention whose lives may be in danger,'' Lyman said.
	   Hate broadcasts in Rwanda in 1994 prodded the Hutu majority to
massacre ethnic Tutsis.
	   Summit sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, have said
Annan hoped to hold joint talks with African leaders involved in
the Congo war on Thursday. Karubi said he didn't know if Kabila
would attend.
	   After a series of rapid rebel gains, Kabila's forces backed by
his allies are pushing the insurgents back towards Congo's eastern
borders.
	   Annan, addressing the summit, appealed for Africa's leaders to
solve their problems through political and not military means.
	   ``For every day that we fail to do so, the innocent people of
this continent pay a terrible price,'' Annan said, citing trouble
spots including Congo and Angola, where he said the U.N.-brokered
peace process is ``hanging by a thread.''
	   Another issue dominating the Nonaligned Movement, created in the
1950s to fend off supperpower domination, was nuclear weapons.
	   India was pushing for the Nonaligned Movement to recognize it as
a nuclear power _ a status shared by five other nations, according
to Lyman and another source at the summit. If India _ which along
with Pakistan tested nuclear weapons this year _ is declared a
nuclear power, it could argue it doesn't have to dispose of its
nuclear weapons as called for by the nuclear nonproliferation
treaty, Lyman said.
	   ``We encourage them to reconsider what they've done and where
they'e going ... and then slowly think about coming back into the
nonproliferation regime,'' Lyman said. ``But if (more countries)
get declared nuclear weapons states, you're already moving in the
wrong direction.''
	   Lyman also said his delegation has lobbied delegates to soften
the ``excessive'' tone of a resolution being considered here which
denounces the U.S. cruise missile attack on Sudan. Sudan had
requested the condemnation.
	   Despite the sometimes tense climate at the summit, there were
moments of warmth.
	   At the receiving line before the summit began, Mandela and his
new wife Graca Machel _ widow of Mozambican leader and black
liberation leader Samora Machel _ shared an emotional moment with
Cuban President Fidel Castro.
	   ``Fidel, Fidel, Fidel,'' Mandela said as he threw his arms
around Castro, dressed in a grey business suit. The two old
revolutionaries hugged, then Castro embraced Mrs. Machel.

Russian, German share top money in checkers championship
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GROZNY, Russia (AP) _ A Russian won top honors in a two-week
event ending Wednesday that organizers billed as the world checkers
championship.
	   Mikhail Goruynov of Russia finished atop the field and Russian
emigre Mark Makrovich of Germany was second, each winning dlrs
9,000.
	   Despite its title, the event was open only to players from the
former Soviet Union, including those who have since emigrated.
Checkers rules vary around the world.
	   Russians Vladimir Langin and Muradallo Amrelyev came in third
and fourth, each taking home dlrs 5,500. Pyotr Umshanov of Russia
was fifth, winning dlrs 4,000, and Chechen Abu Magomadov was sixth
with dlrs 3,000.
	   The tourney was held in an airport VIP lounge in the Chechen
capital Grozny _ one of the only buildings still intact following
the region's independence war against Russia.
	   About 40 competitors from 19 countries competed.

<TEXT>
	   ARUSHA, Tanzania (AP) _ He painted himself as a lowly village
mayor powerless to halt the ``force of evil'' that engulfed Rwanda.
Prosecutors held the former schoolteacher responsible for the
slayings of 2,000 minority Tutsis who had sought his protection.
	   On Wednesday, a U.N. tribunal rendered a verdict, the first of
its kind by an international court: Guilty of genocide. Guilty of
crimes against humanity. Guilty of rape, murder and torture.
	   Jean-Paul Akayesu winced and knotted his fingers behind his back
as chief Judge Laity Kama read out each count in a subdued
courtroom, where bulletproof glass shielded the defendant from the
public gallery.
	   His lawyer said Akayesu, who maintained his innocence throughout
his 20-month trial, would appeal.
	   At maximum, Akayesu, born in 1953, could be sentenced to life in
prison _ not enough to satisfy survivors of the slaughter of more
than 500,000 minority Tutsis in 1994.
	   ``The penalty doesn't match the crime,'' said one Tutsi widow,
Chantal Kayitesi, who came to this remote northern Tanzanian town
to hear the long-awaited decision.
	   In neighboring Rwanda, where the tribunal has been harshly
criticized for mismanagement, corruption and slowness, the verdict
was greeted dispiritedly by those who bothered to listen to a live
radio broadcast.
	   The International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda has been working
nearly four years, and this is the first conviction.
	   ``I don't see the people in Rwanda going to the streets to
congratulate the international court on this one,'' said Patrick
Mazimhaka, a state minister. ``It has gone on for so long _ I think
people have given up.''
	   Still, the 300-page judgment was heralded as historic because it
marks the first conviction for genocide, an offense decreed and
defined in 1948 after the Nuremberg trials. It is also the first
time an international tribunal defined rape as a genocidal crime.
	   Prosecutor Pierre Prosper said the decision provides ``a road
map for how we are to proceed'' in similar cases.
	   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan called the judgment ``a
testament to our collective determination to confront the heinous
crime of genocide in a way we never have before.''
	   A U.N. peacekeeping mission in Rwanda during the genocide was
prevented by member countries from intervening to stop the
slaughter, a failing for which Annan was condemned during a visit
to Rwanda in May.
	   ``Let us never again be accused of standing by while genocide
and crimes against humanity are being committed,'' Annan said
during an international gathering in Durban, South Africa.
	   In a trial that began Jan. 9, 1997, Akayesu was convicted on
nine of 15 counts against him. The three-judge panel rejected
charges involving violations of the Geneva Convention on treatment
of war victims, arguing Akayesu had no military command
responsibility.
	   Testifying in his own defense in March, Akayesu said he was
helpless against a much stronger military and could not resist
``the force of evil which grew everywhere.''
	   Defense lawyer Nicolas Tiangaye said Akayesu was a scapegoat for
a genocide that even the United Nations failed to prevent.
	   Prosper, the prosecutor, agreed that Akayesu initially tried to
resist, but became an enthusiastic supporter of the genocide after
a visit by former Prime Minister Jean Kambanda, who has pleaded
guilty to genocide.
	   In a speech just after that, Akayesu encouraged Hutus to kill
Tutsis, calling them collaborators with Tutsi rebels fighting the
mainly Hutu government and military. That day, the slaughter began
in Akayesu's village, Taba.
	   During Wednesday's 1 1/2-hour tribunal session, Kama said the
three-judge panel rejected the argument that Akayesu was powerless,
asserting that a mayor in Rwanda ``was treated with a lot of
deference ... and had a lot of power.''
	   The former mayor was held responsible in the ``meticulously
organized'' genocide that included the killings of 2,000 Tutsis in
the Taba area and the brutal rapes of dozens of women, even though
police and military committed most of the acts.
	   Specifically, Akayesu also was found guilty of ordering the
deaths of Tutsi intellectuals, and telling militiamen to kill five
teachers.
	   The judges rejected arguments that the genocide was a sad but
inevitable consequence of Rwanda's civil war, saying obvious
noncombatants were killed: women, children, even newborns.
	   ``It is clear that the massacres that occurred in Rwanda in 1994
had a special object, namely the extermination of Tutsi (people),''
Kama said.
	   The tribunal is holding 31 people in Arusha, four of whom are on
trial. An elderly Rwandan minister is in custody in Texas. Eight
others have been indicted but not apprehended.
	   Rwandan courts _ in proceedings condemned by many foreign
lawyers as unjust _ have tried at least 330 people for involvement
in the genocide, and 116 have been sentenced to death. More than
125,000 people are imprisoned and awaiting trial.
	   On April 24, Rwandan firing squads executed 22 people convicted
of genocide, the first executions for the slaughter.

U.S. First Lady praises Northern Ireland women as peacemakers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Arriving a day ahead of her
husband, Hillary Rodham Clinton on Wednesday called Northern
Ireland's women a quiet catalyst for the Belfast peace agreement,
but said they must play a bigger role in politics for real
reconciliation to take root.
	   ``It was women whose whispers of `Enough!' became a torrent of
voices that could no longer be ignored,'' the wife of U.S.
President Bill Clinton told 600 women's activists, community
workers and politicians at a conference called ``Vital Voices:
Women in Democracy.''
	   ``It is up to you, the women of Northern Ireland, speaking out
whenever injustice arises, to point out opportunities, to face up
to challenges, and to speak for those who are still voiceless,''
she said.
	   Mrs. Clinton's speech brought together not only grass-roots
Protestant and Catholic activists, but once-deadly opponents in
Northern Ireland's three-decade-old conflict _ virtually all of
them men.
	   Sitting in the front row of one balcony were Gerry Adams, Martin
McGuinness and Pat Doherty, leaders of the IRA-allied Sinn Fein
party.
	   Behind them sat members of the Ulster Unionists, the major
British Protestant party that also backs April's compromise accord
on how Northern Ireland should be governed _ but refuses to talk
directly with Sinn Fein.
	   After her speech, Mrs. Clinton attended a reception in her honor
in Belfast City Hall along with the outgoing U.S. ambassador to
Ireland, Jean Kennedy Smith.
	   Mrs. Clinton is staying overnight at Hillsborough Castle
southwest of Belfast as a guest of Mo Mowlam, Britain's first
female secretary of state for Northern Ireland.
	   On Thursday, Mrs. Clinton planned to open a playground for
Protestant and Catholic children in an underprivileged part of
Belfast, then appear with her husband for his keynote speech.
	   Wednesday marked Mrs. Clinton's third visit to Northern Ireland.
She accompanied the president during their precedent-setting 1995
visit to Belfast, and returned without him for more public
engagements last October.

proliferating human rights abuses and conflict.
	   Addressing the Council of Europe on the 50th anniversary of the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Robinson said organizations
like the United Nations and the Council were much to blame due to
their ``lack of appropriate action. ...
	   ``We must see in the prevalence of conflicts and widespread
human rights violations in the world today ... a measure of our
past failures,'' she told representatives of the 40-nation Council.
	   More than 2 million children had been killed in conflicts during
the previous decade, Robinson said, citing a 1996 report compiled
for the United Nations by Graca Machel, wife of South African
President Nelson Mandela.
	   Efforts to prevent such ``appalling'' abuses should focus not
only on resolving ethnic and political disputes but also on the
social issues of ``chronic underdevelopment, grinding poverty, mass
unemployment, widespread illiteracy and systematic inequalities of
income or opportunities,'' Robinson said.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin, Israeli Industry and
Trade Minister Natan Sharansky and other dignitaries attended the
opening on Wednesday of a new synagogue and Holocaust memorial in
Moscow.
	   The synagogue has been constructed near a Russian Orthodox
church and a mosque on the Russian capital's Poklonnaya Gora, a
complex built to commemorate Russia's huge losses in World War II.
	   U.S. Energy Secretary Bill Richardson, who traveled to Moscow on
Tuesday with President Bill Clinton, also attended.
	   ``Today people bow their heads before the Jews who fell in World
War II, before all victims of fascism, and before the Jews and
Russians who died in concentration camps and prisons,'' Sharansky
said, according to the Interfax news agency.
	   Sharansky, once one of the Soviet Union's best-known political
prisoners, fought for the right of Jews to emigrate to Israel, and
later spent nine years in Soviet prisons on trumped-up charges that
he was a CIA spy.
	   Sharansky called the new synagogue evidence ``that there will be
no return to a totalitarian regime and that the new, democratic
Russia is strong and great not because it erases all differences,
but because it respects and develops the culture, traditions and
spiritual life of all peoples living in Russia.''

Teenagers hold key to population growth _ and need sex education
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs; RECASTS and UPDATES throughout with new material from
news conference and report &QL; 
 &UR; By EDITH M. LEDERER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Today's teenagers hold the key to population
growth in the 21st century _ and they must have access to sex
education and contraception, the U.N. Population Fund said
Wednesday in its annual report.
	   These adolescents are part of the largest generation of young
people in history on every continent except Europe, the report
said. More than 1 billion strong, ranging in age from 15 to 24,
they now are entering their most fertile years.
	   ``These young people will decide whether family size continues
to decline,'' Dr. Nafis Sadik, the fund's executive director, said
at a news conference launching the report.
	   Even though the population growth rate is slowing down, the past
baby boom in much of the world will ensure the human race continues
to grow until at least the middle of the next century _ and it is
likely ``to go on growing slowly after that for perhaps 50 more
years,'' she said.
	   Global population is still increasing by more than 80 million
people every year and will pass 6 billion in 1999. It will reach
somewhere between 7.7 billion and 11.1 billion by 2050 _ most
likely 9.4 billion, according to U.N. projections.
	   Efforts by governments, international agencies and millions of
men and women have cut family size in half in the last 30 years,
Sadik said.
	   ``It is a trend which has improved the lives and prospects of
literally billions of people in today's developing countries. It
helped to drive the Asian economic miracle. It can help the
staggering Asian economies to get back on their feet, and it can
help create the conditions for economic recovery in Africa,'' she
said.
	   ``These are possibilities, not predictions. Families are smaller
today and people are better off because we took action. And action
is still needed, perhaps more than ever before.''
	   During the next two decades, lower birth rates in developing
countries offer the prospect of a ``bulge'' of young people coming
into the workforce while fewer children are born, the U.N. agency
said.
	   This demographic bulge can be an engine for greater productivity
and economic development if the world starts investing now in
educating and training the younger generation for jobs and future
leadership, the report said.
	   These young people also have the right to choose the size of
their family ``and the task of the next decade is to make sure that
they can exercise their rights,'' Sadik said.
	   Currently, she said, access to sex education and family planning
services for adolescents in the developing world is ``extremely
limited.''
	   With the age gap between puberty and marriage widening, sexual
activity outside marriage has increased _ but many governments
won't even acknowledge teenage sexuality, the report said.
	   While some parents argue that sex education and access to
contraceptives promotes sexual activity, Sadik said research shows
that young people who attend good sex education programs are much
more responsible, and that access to contraception reduces teenage
pregnancies.
	   The Population Fund urged reproductive health programs to
``address adolescents and their sexuality openly and honestly,
provide more options, sensitive counseling and better information
to promote effective use of the most appropriate means of
contraception.''
	   The world's population also is changing in another major way,
the report found.
	   The proportion of people over the age of 65 is growing and will
more than double in the next 50 years, from 6.8 percent to 15.1
percent. That means a record 1.42 billion people will live beyond
their 65th birthdays in 2050, 3 1/2 times the number today and more
than 10 times as many as in 1950, the report said.
	   The Population Fund plans a meeting in which industrialized
countries of Europe, North America and Japan with greying
populations can share their exeriences in dealing with the elderly
with developing nations, Sadik said.

Delegation of Crimea's top officials to visit NATO headquarters
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ A high-ranking delegation from Ukraine's
Crimean Peninsula will visit NATO headquarters in Brussels on Sept.
5-9, the Crimean parliament's press service reported.
	   The 12-strong delegation is headed by Crimean parliament speaker
Leonid Hrach and Crimean Premier Serhiy Kunitsyn, the press service
said, according to the Interfax news agency.
	   The visit comes in response to an invitation from NATO
headquarters earlier this year.
	   Ukraine has repeatedly stressed that it wants close relations
with NATO, and has hosted and participated in peacekeeping
maneuvers under the alliance's Partnership for Peace program.
	   Those maneuvers included the so-called Sea Breeze land and sea
exercises, which were held at the Crimean peninsula last summer and
are planned to be conducted again this fall.
	   NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana visited Kiev in July to
mark the first anniversary of a cooperation charter between NATO
and Ukraine.
	   However, Ukraine's stance toward NATO is largely influenced by
Russia, the country's giant northern neighbor, which has vehemently
protested against any of the former Soviet republics' joining the
alliance.

Austrian recommendation to tighten asylum rights stirs controversy
</HEADLINE>
in Europe &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT H. REID &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Faced with sharp increases in asylum
seekers, Austria has proposed curbs on the right of refugees to
seek shelter in European Union countries, triggering harsh
criticism from human rights organizations.
	   A proposal, drafted by the Austrian Interior Ministry and
circulated Wednesday at EU headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, would
no longer recognize a universal right of asylum for those fleeing
oppression and instead consider it a ``political offer'' by
countries which choose to allow refugees.
	   The proposal was offered as part of an on-going debate within
the EU on a common policy toward asylum-seekers, who have been
knocking at the door of the 15 EU members in increasing numbers at
a time when the Europeans are grappling with longterm economic,
social and employment problems.
	   The right of asylum has been recognized under international law
as a fundamental human right since the 1951 Geneva Convention on
Migration, which was adopted in wake of the massive dislocation
during World War II and the Cold War division of Europe into rival
camps.
	   In the decades that followed, however, most refugees have been
seeking better economic opportunities in wealthier countries. Many
western European countries face problems providing jobs for their
own nationals and have been increasingly reluctant to make room for
``economic refugees'' from eastern Europe, the Middle East or
Africa.
	   As of Aug. 1, a total of 5,645 people from many countries had
sought asylum in Austria, surpassing the 5,500 figure for the whole
of last year. Of the overall figure, the majority -- about 2,800 --
were Kosovo Albanians fleeing the fighting between Serb police and
sececiionist rebels.
	   Many Austrians feel their presence is an increasing burden in a
country of 7.8 million inhabitants -- or about the same population
as New York City.
	   Iraqis, including Iraqi Kurds, make up the second largest
number. As the easternmost member of the European Union, Austria is
often the first EU state reached by asylum-seekers from the Balkans
and the Middle East.
	   Neverthless, the Interior Ministry's proposal has drawn sharp
criticism from human rights groups and liberal and left-leaning
Austrian politicians alike.
	   The Vienna director of the Roman Catholic charity Caritas asked
Austria's interior minister, Karl Schloegl, for a clarification of
his position on the right of asylum.
	   ``I cannot imagine that this is really the view of the
minister,'' the Caritas director, Michael Landau, said. ``It could
only be the idea of an individual bureaucrat.''
	   Laundau said Austria had a ``good tradition'' of offering ayslum
to people ``whose lives have been threatened.''
	   A member of the European parliament from Austria's ruling
Socialist Party, Maria Berger, said ``no policy is possible which
attempts to remove the individual's right of asylum.''
	   ``This lunacy from the interior minister to raise the Geneva
Convention off its foundation is shocking,'' said Johannes
Voggenhuber, a member of Austria's Green Party.
	   Volker Kier of the Liberal party called the report a ``backdoor
attempt'' to abolish the 47-year-old asylum convention.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES thruout with Clinton meeting opposition leaders,
recasts &QL; 
 &UR; By BARRY SCHWEID &QC; 
 &UR; AP Diplomatic Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Asserting an unshakable friendship with Russia but
offering only general remedies for its ailing economy, President
Bill Clinton sought Wednesday to reassert his statesman role by
cajoling President Boris Yeltsin and his political foes to find
common ground on reform.
	   Ending a two-day summit that marked his first venture on the
world stage since his acknowledgment of an affair with a young
White House intern, Clinton assured Yeltsin he could count on new
offers of economic aid if Russia shows it will complete its
free-market reforms.
	   ``The answer is to finish the job that has been begun, not to
stop it in midstream or to reverse course,'' Clinton said at a
joint news conference with Yeltsin at the Kremlin.
	   ``America and the international community are, I am convinced,
ready to offer further assistance if Russia stays with the path of
reform,'' Clinton said.
	   While speaking bluntly of Moscow's differences with Washington
over NATO and other security issues, Yeltsin said his country was
determined to ``conclude our reforms'' and recognized that, in the
end, it was up to Russia itself to make the right moves on the
economic front.
	   ``What we need from the United States is political support to
the effect that the United States is in favor of reforms in
Russia,'' Yeltsin said. ``This is what we really need, and then all
the investors who would like to come to the Russian reformed market
will do so, will come with their investments.''
	   Clinton sounded a similar theme in a meeting with some two dozen
members of the communist-led Duma, the lower house of the Russian
parliament, and regional leaders at the residence of U.S.
Ambassador James Collins. Clinton told the meeting, ``Russia must
have its own approaches that keep the nation strong.''
	   It was a recognition of the diversity that marks the parliament
in Russia's seventh year of experimenting with democracy. And it
was represented in the turnout that ranged from Communist leader
Gennady Zyuganov and Alexander Lebed, the hard-line former general
from Siberia, to Grigory Yavlinsky, leader of the liberal Yabloko
bloc.
	   ``I come here as someone who considers himself a friend of your
country and someone who deeply believes that in the century just
ahead of us America and Russia must be partners,'' Clinton said.
``I hope you will able to bridge your differences to agree on,
first, a program to stabilize the current situation, and then a
path to finish the framework of basic things that every successful
economy has.''
	   Clinton's care in not stepping on anyone's toes apparently
succeeded. Asked afterward if the American president was afraid of
Communists, Zyuganov said ``he is not afraid.''
	   But whether Clinton persuaded the Duma leaders to collaborate
with Yeltsin, after rejecting his choice for prime minister, Viktor
Chernomyrdin, remains to be seen.
	   The Duma evidently is at sea on how to right the economy.
``Nobody knows what to do,'' Lebed said.
	   And when Yeltsin was asked at the news conference what he would
do if the Russian parliament refused to confirm Chernomyrdin's
return as prime minister, Yeltsin said it was too soon to tell.
``We will witness quite a few events for us to be able to achieve
all those results,'' he said.
	   As Clinton and reporters waited for more from the usual voluble
Russian leader, Yeltsin added with a smile: ``That's all.''
	   Clinton seized on the terse response. Asked whether he struck
the right tone in his acknowledgment on television Aug. 17 of an
affair with Monica Lewinsky. the President quipped: ``That's my
answer, too.''
	   Clinton went on to say it should have been clear he was
expressing his regret and that ``it's time for us to now go back to
the work of the country.''
	   Administration officials later were peppered with questions
whether Yeltsin had experienced physical or mental fatigue. They
defended his performance and said the decision to keep the news
conference relatively brief had been made by the Russian government
beforehand.
	   Both presidents described their meetings as successful, and
Yeltsin told reporters he and Clinton discussed ways to intensify
U.S.-Russian economic relations to pull Russia out of its economic
tailspin.
	   ``We shall have to suffer through much blood, sweat and tears
before new forms of business cooperation worthy of our two great
powers are found,'' Yeltsin said without mentioning the political
paralysis he faces with the Duma over forming a new government.
	   Clinton said: ``I know this is a difficult time, but there is no
short cut.''
	   Before taking questions, Yeltsin and Clinton signed two security
agreements. One commits each country to ridding itself of 50 tons
of weapons-grade plutonium from old nuclear warheads; the other
calls for sharing information on missile launch warnings.
	   They also signed joint statements on biological weapons control
and on the situation in the Kosovo, the Balkan region torn with
civil strife.
	   On biological weapons, the leaders called for adoption of
measures to effectively implement a 1972 ban on development and
stockpiling and pledged to work to bring other nations aboard.
	   On Kosovo, they said the conflict between Serbs and ethnic
Albanians in the Yugoslav province was causing ``great alarm''
around the world and insisted that President Slobodan Milosevic
halt the Serb offensive.
	   Clinton was flying to Belfast, Northern Ireland early Thursday
to try to promote a peaceful settlement with the Irish Republic.

Police target dozens of suspected pedophiles in 12-country raids
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with more arrests in Germany graf 9

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Police in 12 countries raided the homes of more
than 100 suspected pedophiles Wednesday in what authorities called
one of the largest efforts ever to break an Internet child
pornography ring.
	   The British National Crime Squad coordinated the early morning
raids as part of a five-month investigation into the so-called
Wonderland club, which authorities said exchanged pornographic
pictures of children as young as 2 on the Internet.
	   During the investigation, code-named ``Cathedral,'' police said
they found a database containing more than 100,000 pornographic
photographs of naked boys and girls and confiscated computers and
computer programs from dozens of suspects.
	   Police said they targeted 180 suspects and arrested more than
100 in the raids, which took place at 0400 GMT on three continents
_ in Australia, Austria, Belgium, Britain, Finland, France,
Germany, Italy, Norway, Portugal, Sweden and the United States.
	   ``I am unaware of another police operation that has ever pulled
together so many law enforcement agencies worldwide to effect
simultaneous raids and arrests,'' said Bob Packham, deputy director
general of the National Crime Squad.
	   In Britain, police arrested 11 men in a raid on 14 addresses. In
the United States, where the pornographic ring originated, the U.S.
Customs Service announced it had conducted 32 federal search and
seizure warrants in 22 states.
	   One man was arrested in Sweden, and French police arrested four
people after raids in Roubaix, Strasbourg, Toulouse and Lille. Four
people were also arrested in Australia.
	   In Italy, police carried out raids in Rome, Naples, Catanzaro,
Turin, Bologna and Florence, the Italian news agency ANSA said.
	   The federal crime office in Wiesbaden, Germany, said
investigators arrested nine suspects in different parts of the
country and raided 19 apartments, confiscating computer equipment.
	   Britain's Detective Superintendent John Stewardson, who led the
operation, said children had been abused on a massive scale to
produce material to feed the international ring.
	   ``The content would turn the stomach of any right-minded person.
It's really disgusting,'' he said.
	   Police said they would now attempt to trace some of the children
in the pictures.
	   The investigation began earlier this year when Sussex police in
southeast England discovered pedophiles downloading child
pornography from the Internet, authorities said.

Sons of Princess Diana appeal to nation to end their mourning

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Princess Diana's sons appealed to the nation
Wednesday to let their mother and her memory finally rest in peace,
saying ``constant reminders of her death can create nothing but
pain to those she left behind.''
	   In a statement issued two days after the first anniversary of
Diana's death, Prince William, 16, and Prince Harry, 13, declared
that the public mourning period should now end.
	   ``Throughout the last year, since the death of their mother,
Prince William and Prince Harry have been comforted enormously by
the public sympathy and support they have been given,'' said a
statement issued by Sandy Henney, the press secretary to their
father, Prince Charles.
	   ``It has meant a great deal to them and they have asked me to
express their thanks once again to everyone,'' Ms. Henney said in
the statement. ``They have also asked me to say that they believe
their mother would want people now to move on _ because she would
have known that constant reminders of her death can create nothing
but pain to those she left behind.
	   ``They therefore hope, very much, that their mother and her
memory will now finally be allowed to rest in peace.''
	   Press Association, the British news agency, said the appeal
apparently was decided upon over the weekend at Balmoral, Queen's
Elizabeth II's Scottish estate, where the boys spent the
anniversary with the rest of the royal family.
	   The news agency said the boys were prompted to issue it by their
concern over the constant references to their mother and the
``Diana industry'' that has sprouted up in the past year.
	   On Wednesday, Harry began his first year at Eton, the elite
boarding school favored by the aristocracy for centuries, which his
brother already attends.

Government scientists recommend breast cancer prevention drug
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LAURAN NEERGAARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Medical Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BETHESDA, Maryland (AP) _ U.S. government scientists recommended
Wednesday that certain healthy women take a powerful drug called
tamoxifen to reduce their risk of breast cancer later in life _
even though the pills can cause serious side effects.
	   But advisers to the Food and Drug Administration stressed that
they weren't sure exactly who should take tamoxifen. And despite
headlines last spring touting tamoxifen, the FDA panel said there's
no proof that it prevents breast cancer from ever appearing in
these women _ it may just delay the inevitable tumor for a few
years.
	   ``We don't know who to treat,'' complained Dr. Janice Dutcher of
Montefiore Medical Center in New York, the panel's chairman.
	   Still, a National Cancer Institute study did show a short-term
benefit in women at very high risk of getting breast cancer later
in life.
	   The recommendation came despite pleas from women's groups that
the drug is too dangerous and offers too little benefit for
millions of healthy women to take _ and despite conflicting
findings from British researchers.
	   The National Cancer Institute announced last spring that
tamoxifen could cut the chances of developing breast cancer by 45
percent in women at high risk of the disease.
	   But the effect was small. Some 6,600 American women took
tamoxifen for 3 1/2 years and the drug prevented just 69 more cases
of breast cancer than occurred in another 6,000 women who took a
dummy pill. The drug appeared most protective against small, more
easily treated tumors, ``not the bad actors,'' noted Dr. George
Sledge of the Indiana Cancer Pavilion.
	   Along with the slight amount of protection, the U.S. study
showed tamoxifen doubled women's risk of uterine cancer, tripled
the risk of a potentially fatal blood clot and increased the
chances of developing cataracts that hurt their eyesight.
	   Nor does anyone know if breast cancer that appears in women who
unsuccessfully tried tamoxifen will have more aggressive cancer
that is less vulnerable to drug treatment.
	   Tamoxifen has been sold for 25 years to treat breast cancer, and
in cancer patients the side effects are considered a small price.
But the NCI has always stressed that only high-risk women should
consider using tamoxifen to prevent breast cancer.

U.N. ``concerned'' at Angola's suspension of former rebels
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The Angolan government's suspension of
members of the former rebel group UNITA from the cabinet is cause
for ``grave concern,'' the United Nations said Wednesday.
	   The fledgling peace process in the war-ravaged southwest African
nation slipped deeper into crisis on Monday when the governing
party said it was suspending members of UNITA.
	   The ruling MPLA said UNITA's ``dubious attitude'' towards the
implementation of the 1994 peace pact had caused ``a grave
situation.''
	   Four ministers and seven deputy ministers were suspended, and
the MPLA-dominated parliament also asked the Supreme Court whether
it could suspend UNITA legislators.
	   The suspensions ``further jeopardize attempts to get the peace
process back on track,'' U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said at U.N.
headquarters in New York, and the U.N. mission in Angola was
``gravely concerned'' about the consequences.
	   Implementation of the U.N.-brokered peace deal, which has been
stymied by mistrust between the former foes, is more than a year
behind schedule. The deal ended more than two decades of civil war.
	   Eckhard said Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who is in South
Africa attending a summit of the Non-Aligned movement, would bring
up the suspensions with Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos.
	   UNITA refuses to give control of its central highland
strongholds to the government, which it accuses of human rights
abuses in areas already handed over. The government claims UNITA
still has troops in the bush who have attacked villages in recent
months.
	   The MPLA _ a Portuguese acronym for the Popular Movement for the
Liberation of Angola _ said after the suspension that it remained
committed to the peace deal.
	   UNITA _ the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola
_ has complained its members of the government were never consulted
by the rest of the MPLA-dominated administration.

Sons of Princess Diana appeal to nation to end their mourning
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Eds: incorporates some material from Britain-People-Prince Harry &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Princess Diana's sons appealed to the nation
Wednesday to let their mother and her memory finally rest in peace,
saying ``constant reminders of her death can create nothing but
pain to those she left behind.''
	   In a statement issued two days after the first anniversary of
Diana's death, Prince William, 16, and Prince Harry, 13, declared
that the public mourning period should now end.
	   ``Throughout the last year, since the death of their mother,
Prince William and Prince Harry have been comforted enormously by
the public sympathy and support they have been given,'' said a
statement issued by Sandy Henney, the press secretary to their
father, Prince Charles.
	   ``It has meant a great deal to them and they have asked me to
express their thanks once again to everyone,'' Ms. Henney said in
the statement. ``They have also asked me to say that they believe
their mother would want people now to move on _ because she would
have known that constant reminders of her death can create nothing
but pain to those she left behind.
	   ``They therefore hope, very much, that their mother and her
memory will now finally be allowed to rest in peace.''
	   Press Association, the British news agency, said the appeal
apparently was decided upon over the weekend at Balmoral, Queen's
Elizabeth II's Scottish estate, where the boys spent the
anniversary with the rest of the royal family.
	   The news agency said the boys were prompted to issue it by their
concern over the constant references to their mother and the
``Diana industry'' that has sprouted up in the past year.
	   On Wednesday, Harry began his first year at Eton, the elite
boarding school favored by the aristocracy for centuries, which his
brother already attends.
	   The school is just across the River Thames from Windsor Castle,
a weekend base for the queen.

 &UR; Pakistan struggles to curb runaway population growth &QL; 
 &UR; By DOUG MELLGREN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ A runaway growth rate could push
Pakistan's population over that of giant Russia in five years,
without the resources in this Texas-sized nation to support such
numbers, the minister of population and welfare said Wednesday.
	   The world's population is likely to exceed 6 billion people in
1999, increasing pressure on resources, the environment, food and
human health, according to an annual report released by U.N.
Population Fund in cities worldwide on Wednesday.
	   The increase is due to rising birth rates outside Europe and in
life expectancy worldwide.
	   At the report's release in Islamabad, Minister of Population and
Welfare Syeda Abida Hussain said Pakistan's population growth is
among the world's highest, at 2.6 percent a year. She said that is
higher than the average for Asia and developing world. It also
matches the average for Africa, the fastest growing region.
	   Pakistan, already suffering widespread poverty, is the world's
seventh most populous country, with 130.6 million people, according
to a March 1998 national census.
	   ``Pakistan, in recent years, has already surpassed Nigeria,
Bangladesh and Japan in population size,'' she said. ``If the
present trend ... continues, the population of Pakistan will exceed
that of Russia by the year 2003.''
	   According to the U.N. report, 1998 population estimates for
Russia were 147.2 million, slightly under the 147.8 million cited
for Pakistan. However, the U.N. report did not reflect Pakistan's
1998 census, its first in 17 years.
	   ``The old figures were a `guesstimate,''' said Hussain. ``The
new ones are accurate.''
	   Whatever the total number of Pakistanis, at least 37 million of
them - about 28 percent _ already live in poverty, said the
minister. Literacy rates are low, at 40 percent overall and just 12
percent for rural women, hampering efforts to spread birth control
information.
	   And the environment is already suffering.
	   ``Population growth in Pakistan has led to environmental
degradation at an unprecedented level. Some of its natural
resources, including forests, water supply and agricultural land
are being depleted at alarming rate,'' Hussain said.
	   After decades of national indifference, Hussain said Pakistan's
current government aims to increase family planning services and
birth control availability in a drive to cut the birth rate to 1.7
percent by 2003.
	   But large families, with 4.2 children on the average, are a
strong tradition in Pakistan ``and such things change slowly,''
said Francois M. Farah, the U.N. agency's representative in
Pakistan.
	   While Hussain said the religion of this Muslim nation does not
prohibit family planning, a national reticence about sexual matters
might hamper open discussion about it.
	   ``Pakistanis are puritanical, and will probably remain so,'' she
said.

Congo war creates divisiveness at Nonaligned Movement summit
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Nujoma, Kabila reportedly preparing to leave

<TEXT>
	   DURBAN, South Africa (AP) _ In a surprise appearance at the
Nonaligned Movement summit Wednesday, Congo President Laurent
Kabila blasted Rwanda and Uganda, saying they had invaded his vast
central African country.
	   Instead of being a love fest of leaders of developing countries,
the Congo war _ which involves troops from as many as six countries
_ proved divisive. Underscoring his hostility toward mediation
efforts spearheaded by South Africa, Kabila bypassed President
Nelson Mandela as he was greeting the 53 heads of government who
arrived for the summit Wednesday.
	   Kabila then took the podium to ask the leaders of developing
nations to ``unequivocally condemn the aggression'' of Uganda and
Rwanda and request their troops' withdrawal from Congo.
	   ``At this very moment, my country fellows in occupied territory
are being assassinated, women are being raped and children are
being used as cannon fodder,'' Kabila said, wearing his trademark
safari suit and reading his speech through thick glasses.
	   Kabila also promised to hold free and fair elections by 1999.
	   Kabila's appearance set a tense tone as U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan was trying to hold peace talks here with regional
leaders. Kabila met with Annan. No details were immediately
available.
	   Uganda and Rwanda have denied their forces are helping Congolese
rebels. But senior U.S. diplomat Princeton Lyman, a guest at the
summit, indicated Rwanda and Uganda do have troops in Congo.
	   ``There are foreign troops on both sides, and that's got to be
recognized, and a plan for withdrawing them has to be part of the
(peace) process,'' Lyman said in an interview with The Associated
Press.
	   Kabila, meanwhile, thanked Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia for
sending troops to help battle the rebels and later lunched with
Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos, Zimbabwean President
Robert Mugabe and Namibian President Sam Nujoma, said Kabila
spokesman Kikaya Bin Karubi.
	   Lyman said his delegation was asking all parties involved in the
Congo war to come to an agreement that includes a cease-fire, the
withdrawal of foreign troops, a broadening of the government in
Congo to be more representative and a plan to deal with the
humanitarian situation.
	   ``We've been very concerned about the humanitarian situation.
There are reports of massacres, hate radio going on, people in
detention whose lives may be in danger,'' Lyman said.
	   Hate broadcasts in Rwanda in 1994 prodded the Hutu majority to
massacre ethnic Tutsis.
	   Summit sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, have said
Annan hoped to hold joint talks with African leaders involved in
the Congo war on Thursday. Karubi said he didn't know if Kabila
would attend. Nujoma was preparing to leave Durban Wednesday night
and Kabila's pilot was filing a flight plan to also depart, said a
summit spokesman, Marco Boni.
	   Annan, addressing the summit, appealed for Africa's leaders to
solve their problems through political and not military means.
	   ``For every day that we fail to do so, the innocent people of
this continent pay a terrible price,'' Annan said, citing trouble
spots including Congo and Angola, where he said the U.N.-brokered
peace process is ``hanging by a thread.''
	   Another issue dominating the Nonaligned Movement, created in the
1950s to fend off supperpower domination, was nuclear weapons.
	   India was pushing for the Nonaligned Movement to recognize it as
a nuclear power _ a status shared by five other nations, according
to Lyman and another source at the summit. If India _ which along
with Pakistan tested nuclear weapons this year _ is declared a
nuclear power, it could argue it doesn't have to dispose of its
nuclear weapons as called for by the nuclear nonproliferation
treaty, Lyman said.
	   ``We encourage them to reconsider what they've done and where
they'e going ... and then slowly think about coming back into the
nonproliferation regime,'' Lyman said. ``But if (more countries)
get declared nuclear weapons states, you're already moving in the
wrong direction.''
	   Lyman also said his delegation has lobbied delegates to soften
the ``excessive'' tone of a resolution being considered here which
denounces the U.S. cruise missile attack on Sudan. Sudan had
requested the condemnation.
	   Despite the sometimes tense climate at the summit, there were
moments of warmth.
	   At the receiving line before the summit began, Mandela and his
new wife Graca Machel _ widow of Mozambican leader and black
liberation leader Samora Machel _ shared an emotional moment with
Cuban President Fidel Castro.
	   ``Fidel, Fidel, Fidel,'' Mandela said as he threw his arms
around Castro, dressed in a grey business suit. The two old
revolutionaries hugged, then Castro embraced Mrs. Machel.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Despite new clashes between Serbs
and ethnic Albanians in Kosovo, progress was reported Wednesday on
an agreement aimed at ending the fighting and reducing Serbia's
tight grip on the province's ethnic Albanian majority.
	   A senior Western diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the framework of an agreement between the Serb-led government
and Albanian politicians was taking shape as a result of shuttle
diplomacy by special U.S. envoy Christopher Hill.
	   Rather than tackling the issue of Kosovo's final status, U.S.
efforts are now focusing on reaching an interim agreement to end
the six months of fighting and slowly democratize Kosovo, giving
Albanians some self-rule, the diplomat said.
	   After an interim period of three years, the two sides could
review the agreement. The diplomat said both Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic and Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova have accepted
the idea in principle.
	   The diplomat, who is familiar with Hills' talks with both sides,
said he hoped an agreement on an ``interim accord'' would be
possible within months.
	   Continuing the U.S. scrutiny of Kosovo, John Shattuck, assistant
secretary of state for human rights, and former presidential
candidate Sen. Robert Dole were expected in Pristina in coming
days.
	   U.S. officials, who asked not to be identified, said Shattuck
was arriving Friday evening and Dole on Saturday. Both were likely
to tour refugee areas and investigate kidnappings by both sides
before leaving Sunday.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Despite new clashes between Serbs
and ethnic Albanians, progress was reported Wednesday on an
agreement aimed at ending the fighting and reducing Serbia's tight
grip on the province's ethnic Albanian majority.
	   A senior Western diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the framework of an agreement between the Serb-led government
and Albanian politicians was taking shape as a result of shuttle
diplomacy by special U.S. envoy Christopher Hill.
	   Rather than tackling the issue of Kosovo's final status, U.S.
efforts are now focusing on reaching an interim agreement to end
the six months of fighting and slowly democratize Kosovo, giving
Albanians some self-rule, the diplomat said.
	   After an interim period of three years, the two sides could
review the agreement. The diplomat said both Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic and Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova have accepted
the idea in principle.
	   The diplomat, who is familiar with Hills' talks with both sides,
said he hoped an agreement on an ``interim accord'' would be
possible within months.
	   ``It may not be a touchdown, but at least we have a first
down,'' the diplomat told reporters.
	   Continuing the U.S. scrutiny of Kosovo, John Shattuck, assistant
secretary of state for human rights, and Senator Robert Dole were
expected in Pristina in the coming days.
	   U.S. officials, who asked not to be identified said Shattuck was
arriving Friday evening and Dole Saturday. Both were likely to tour
refugee areas and investage kidnappings by both sides before
leaving Sunday.
	   Kosovo Albanians want independence from Serbia, a Yugoslav
republic, while Milosevic refuses to discuss anything beyond some
form of limited autonomy. The Americans and the Europeans have
called for ``substantial autonomy'' for Albanians, who outnumber
Serbs in the province 9-to-one.
	   The rebel Kosovo Liberation Army has rejected any formula short
of full independence. But the rebels have suffered substantial
losses on the battlefield. The leader of the KLA's political wing,
Adem Demaci, admitted last month that the rebels were ``aware that
we, too, cannot win militarily, and one day we will have to
negotiate.''
	   In Moscow, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Nikolai Afanasyevsky,
who has acted as Moscow's shuttle to the region, said the agreement
could be a breakthrough. ITAR-Tass news agency suggested the peace
agreement would decide Kosovo's status in three to five years.
	   ``If there is success in agreeing on the organization of
Kosovo's self-administration, on the joint protection of order, and
help to refugees _ this will be a serious breakthrough,''
Afanasyevsky said.
	   The Western diplomat said details still under discussion
included creation of a mixed-Serbian-Albanian police force and new
Kosovo elections. He suggested that Serbian losses in fighting _
although smaller than among ethnic Albanian guerrillas _ were
contributing to Milosevic's desire for agreement.
	   He said that during Hill's meeting Tuesday with Milosevic, a
senior official complained ``about signing condolence letters to
the families of (Serb police) officers killed.''
	   On Wednesday, Hill met with Rugova. Afterward, Rugova's
followers issued a statement saying the two discussed a ``temporary
agreement between Belgrade and Pristina about a normalization of
situation in Kosovo.''
	   ``This agreement will last three years and its purpose will be
stabilization of the overall situation in Kosovo and functioning of
all institutions,'' the statement said. ``This will create
preconditions for a definitive solution of status of Kosovo.''
	   Washington and the Europeans oppose full independence because
they fear it would lead to a redrawing of borders in neighboring
countries with large Albanian populations. As a minimum, they want
Milosevic to restore the autonomy to Kosovo which he revoked in
1989.
	   Despite the reported diplomatic progress, fighting continued
Wednesday southwest of here. Albanian sources said Serb police
attacked the village of Tusis, a suburb of the southern town of
Prizren, in fighting that left ``many dead and wounded.''
	   The Serbian Media Center in the province's capital Pristina said
the fighting began Tuesday when Albanian militants ambushed a Serb
police patrol. In the ensuing action, the center said 15 fighters
of the Kosovo Liberation Army has been killed and two policemen
were wounded.
	   The area south of Prizren, near the border with Macedonia, is
believed to be important to the guerrillas in their efforts to
smuggle arms in from Albania.

U.S. embassies in Kuwait, Manila face attack threats
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Coca Cola denial, fixes attribution in 13th graf &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ The U.S. Embassy in Kuwait said Wednesday an
attack was possibly being planned against it, and a note found on a
plane in Kuwait warned of a bomb attack on the U.S. mission in the
Philippines.
	   Meanwhile, the Coca-Cola factory in Yemen also received a threat
on Monday, employees at the factory said.
	   A company spokesman in London, however, denied that report.
	   Washington has closed some of its diplomatic missions around the
world and maximized security in others following last month's twin
bombings of its embassies in Nairobi, Kenya and Dar es Salaam,
Tanzania. More than 250 people were killed and some 5,000 injured.
	   A taped message on a telephone line at the embassy in Kuwait
said: The ``U.S. government has received information indicating
that a similar attack (to those in Kenya and Tanzania) may be being
planned in Kuwait.''
	   The message said the embassy was taking ``appropriate security
precautions.''
	   Embassy spokesman Claud Young told The Associated Press that the
mission does not have immediate plans to close down because of the
threat, but was closed for the Labor Day holiday on Monday.
	   He would not say how or where the threat was received.
	   The embassy in this oil-rich state has received several bomb
threats since the end of the 1991 Gulf War.
	   Another threat, this time against the U.S. Embassy in Manila,
Philippines, was delivered Tuesday on board an Emirates flight in a
handwritten note, the Interior Ministry said.
	   The unsigned note in English was found in the toilet of the
aircraft that arrived from Dubai, Col. Bader Saleh, the ministry
spokesman, said.
	   He quoted the note as saying: ``The American Embassy in the
Philippines will be bombed on Sept. 4, 1998.''
	   Security people searched the aircraft thoroughly but found
nothing suspicious, Saleh said.
	   In the Yemeni capital of San`a, the Coca-Cola factory was sent
an anonymous fax that said: ``This is an American factory and
should be closed or we will blow it up without further warning.
This is a final warning,'' employees at the plant said.
	   Reports of the threat were also printed in the al-Balagh
newspaper, an independent weekly.
	   A spokesman for the company, however, denied the report.
	   ``We believe this report to be completely unfounded and untrue
and no communication of this nature has been received,'' said David
Cox, a London-based spokesman for Coca-Cola.
	   Extra police have been posted around the factory, which was
still running.
	   Cox said Coca-Cola has not increased its own security at the
plant.
	   The embassy bombings in Africa led to U.S. missile strikes at
suspected training camps for fundamentalist Muslims in Afghanistan
and a pharmaceutical plant in the Sudanese capital that the U.S.
government accused of making precursors for chemical weapons.

Clinton calls Netanyahu, Arafat
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BARRY SCHWEID &QC; 
 &UR; AP Diplomatic Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Bill Clinton telephoned Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday to register his
disappointment that no agreement has been concluded with the
Palestinians over the West Bank.
	   ``It's very frustrating,'' a senior U.S. official told a small
group of reporters covering Clinton's summit talks with Russian
President Boris Yeltsin. ``We need to get closure.''
	   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Clinton
later called Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, who is attending a
conference in South Africa. He offered no description of the
conversation.
	   ``We're closer than we have every been before,'' the official
said of negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority
over the West Bank.
	   The Clinton administration has urged Israel to yield 13 percent
of the territory to the Palestinians as part of a graduated
pullback from areas on the West Bank.
	   Clinton talked to Netanyahu for about 25 minutes, describing his
meetings with Yeltsin, the official said. The call with Arafat
lasted 15 minutes.
	   Netanyahu has resisted a 13 percent pullback, saying it would
jeopardize Israel's security. But he has told the Palestinians he
was willing to work out an acceptable arrangement.
	   Arafat has insisted on the 13 percent pullback prescribed by the
United States and laid claim to virtually all of the territory
between Israel and Jordan that Israel won in the 1967 Middle East
War.
	   Critics of Israel have complained Clinton was not being tough
with Netanyahu.

Clinton defends Lewinsky comments, says he's asked forgiveness
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Russia Summit &QL; 
 &UR; By TERENCE HUNT &QC; 
 &UR; AP White House Correspondent &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ In an ornate Kremlin hall alongside the president
of Russia, President Bill Clinton insisted Wednesday he had
acknowledged ``a mistake'' and had asked ``to be forgiven'' in his
much-criticized explanation of his affair with Monica Lewinsky.
	   The president had not used either word in the Aug. 17 televised
address in which he acknowledged an improper relationship with Ms.
Lewinsky and said he regretted misleading people. The tone of that
address had prompted criticism from Democrats and Republicans alike
that Clinton was too defensive, insufficiently contrite and showing
too much anger about Kenneth Starr's long-running investigation.
	   Clinton, asked about his affair with Ms. Lewinsky at a news
conference with Boris Yeltsin, said he had gone back and reread his
speech.
	   ``I thought it was clear that I was expressing my profound
regret to all who were hurt and to all who were involved and my
desire not to see any more people hurt by this process and caught
up in it,'' the president said. He said it was for others to judge
whether his earlier remarks were too contentious _ but he did not
repeat his stinging criticism of Starr's inquiry or complain about
prying into private lives.
	   ``I have acknowledged that I made a mistake, said that I
regretted it, asked to be forgiven, spent a lot of very valuable
time with my family in the last couple of weeks and said I was
going back to work,'' Clinton said.
	   The president made his remarks as he concluded two days of talks
with Yeltsin on Russia's economic and political crisis. The
Lewinsky matter did not come up in their discussions, nor did they
compare notes about their political weaknesses, a senior
administration official said.
	   In the elegant setting under the dome of Catherine's Hall, the
Lewinsky questions were an awkward reminder of the embarrassing
investigation awaiting Clinton at home. White House aides had
concluded he would have to say more after last month's speech was
generally deemed a disaster and failed to stem impeachment talk
even among Democrats. The White House sought outside advice on how
to proceed and a vacationing Clinton reached out by telephone to a
wide circle of friends.
	   It was not clear whether Clinton's latest remarks would satisfy
demands for contrition.
	   ``I would like to see him apologize,'' said Sen. Patty Murray.
Another Democrat, Sen. Mary Landrieu said, ``I don't know what else
he could say that would help.''
	   In his August address, Clinton had said the relationship was
wrong and that he regretted that he had misled people, including
his wife.
	   Still enjoying high approval ratings, Clinton said he was
``quite encouraged'' by that support _ and by conversations with
world leaders.
	   James Steinberg, deputy national security adviser, said every
foreign leader with whom Clinton has spoken in recent months has
expressed ``strong desire for sustained American leadership and
their conviction that the president can provide that leadership.''
	   As for his criticism of Starr's investigation, Clinton said
Wednesday that ``it seemed to be something that most reasonable
people would think had consumed a disproportionate amount of
America's time, money and resources and attention and now continued
to involve more and more people.''

Pope sends condolences to families in Ecuador crash
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ Pope John Paul II expressed his condolences
Wednesday to families of Ecuadorean and Cuban victims in the crash
of a Cuban airliner.
	   The Cubana de Aviacion flight crashed on takeoff Saturday at
Quito, Ecuador, killing 69 of those aboard and 10 people on the
ground.
	   The Vatican's secretary of state, Cardinal Angelo Sodano, sent
Cardinal Jaime Lucas Ortega, the archbishop of Havana, a telegram
``expressing the paternal solicitude of the pope with his
comforting blessing.''
	   The message was for families of the Cuban victims. A similar
message to relatives of the Ecuadorean victims was sent in a
telegram to Archbishop Francesco Canalini of Ecuador.

Korda ousted in first round of U.S. Open
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS with Korda loss, other results; WILL be UPDATED. &QL; 
 &UR; By BOB GREENE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Australian Open champion Petr Korda failed to
reach the second round of the U.S. Open, falling Wednesday to
qualifier Bernd Karbacher of Germany 2-6, 6-3, 6-2, 6-1.
	   The fourth-seeded Korda was the highest seed to lose on Day 3 of
the year's final Grand Slam tournament.
	   In other first-round men's matches Wednesday, 13th-seeded Tim
Henman of Britain advanced to the second round with a 6-3, 7-6
(7-4), 7-6 (7-3) victory over Australia's Scott Draper; American
Michael Chang eliminated Eyal Erlich of Israel 6-1, 6-3, 6-1, and
Italy's Giorgio Galimberti stopped Michael Russell of the United
States, 7-5, 6-4, 3-6, 6-3.
	   Ai Sugiyama of Japan became the first women's seed to fall when
she sprained her left ankle and retired in the first set while
leading Gala Leon Garcia of Spain 3-2.
	   In other women's matches, Steffi Graf, the eighth seed, took
only 41 minutes to zip past German compatriot Marlene Weingartner
6-0, 6-1; No. 11 Patty Schnyder of Switzerland ousted American
Aubrie Rippner 6-1, 6-2 in 52 minutes, and No. 14 Dominique Van
Roost of Belgium was on court for only 47 minutes in beating
Poland's Magdalena Grzybowska 6-0, 6-0.
	   Also posting early victories Wednesday were Kimberly Po of the
United States and Mirjana Lucic of Croatia.
	   After Korda captured his first Grand Slam tournament singles
title in January, he lost in the first round at the French Open.
The left-hander from the Czech Republic followed by reaching the
quarterfinals at Wimbledon before losing in the opening round here.
	   ``I like the surface,'' Karbacher said of the asphalt courts at
the National Tennis Center. ``I like the city and I am always
looking forward to come here. When you come to a tournament you
like, then you play better.''
	   Korda appeared to be having an easy time, sweeping through the
first set in 36 minutes and breaking Karbacher in the second game
to take a 2-0 lead in the second set. But the German broke right
back.
	   ``I started playing more aggressive and played some good shots
in this game,'' Karbacher said. ``Then I started to think
different.''
	   Karbacher started pounding his groundstrokes deeper into Korda's
court and taking charge of the points. The strategy worked.
	   ``I was juggling every game,'' Korda said. ``Whatever I did
today, I did wrong.''
	   Graf got just what she was looking for: an easy match, yet one
that let her get into the groove as Weingartner kept the ball in
play, but could do nothing to hurt the former No. 1 player.
	   Graf controlled nearly every point as she pounded out the easy
victory and ran her consecutive match winning streak at the U.S.
Open to 16. She won the title in her last two appearances here, but
missed last year's tournament when she was recuperating from knee
surgery.

Police target dozens of suspected pedophiles in 12-country raids
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: SUBS 4th graf to UPDATE with officials now saying only more
than 40 arrested, sted more than 100 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Police in 12 countries raided the homes of more
than 100 suspected pedophiles Wednesday in what authorities called
one of the largest efforts ever to break an Internet child
pornography ring.
	   The British National Crime Squad coordinated the pre-dawn raids
as part of a five-month investigation into the so-called Wonderland
club, which authorities said exchanged pornographic pictures of
children as young as 2 on the Internet.
	   During the investigation, code-named ``Cathedral,'' police said
they found a database containing more than 100,000 pornographic
photographs of naked boys and girls and confiscated computers and
computer programs from dozens of suspects.
	   Police said they targeted 180 suspects and arrested more than 40
people in the raids, which took place at 0400 GMT on three
continents _ in Australia, Austria, Belgium, Britain, Finland,
France, Germany, Italy, Norway, Portugal, Sweden and the United
States.
	   ``I am unaware of another police operation that has ever pulled
together so many law enforcement agencies worldwide to effect
simultaneous raids and arrests,'' said Bob Packham, deputy director
general of the National Crime Squad.
	   In Britain, police arrested 11 men in a raid on 14 addresses. In
the United States, where the pornographic ring originated, the U.S.
Customs Service announced it had conducted 32 federal search and
seizure warrants in 22 states and arrested four people.
	   Jackie Bennett, a spokeswoman for the National Crime Squad, said
10 people were arrested in Germany, eight in Norway, five in France
and three in Italy.
	   Police in Sweden also reported one arrest, and four arrests were
reported in Australia.
	   Britain's Detective Superintendent John Stewardson, who led the
operation, said children had been abused on a massive scale to
produce material to feed the international ring.
	   ``The content would turn the stomach of any right-minded person.
It's really disgusting,'' he said.
	   Police said they would now attempt to trace some of the children
in the pictures.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ In an ornate Kremlin hall alongside the president
of Russia, President Bill Clinton insisted Wednesday he had
acknowledged ``a mistake'' and had asked ``to be forgiven'' in his
much-criticized explanation of his affair with Monica Lewinsky.
	   The president had not used either word in the Aug. 17 televised
address in which he acknowledged an improper relationship with Ms.
Lewinsky and said he regretted misleading people. The tone of that
address had prompted criticism from Democrats and Republicans alike
that Clinton was too defensive, insufficiently contrite and showing
too much anger about Kenneth Starr's long-running investigation.
	   Clinton, asked about his affair with Ms. Lewinsky at a news
conference with Boris Yeltsin, said he had gone back and reread his
speech.
	   ``I thought it was clear that I was expressing my profound
regret to all who were hurt and to all who were involved and my
desire not to see any more people hurt by this process and caught
up in it,'' the president said. He said it was for others to judge
whether his earlier remarks were too contentious _ but he did not
repeat his stinging criticism of Starr's inquiry or complain about
prying into private lives.
	   ``I have acknowledged that I made a mistake, said that I
regretted it, asked to be forgiven, spent a lot of very valuable
time with my family in the last couple of weeks and said I was
going back to work,'' Clinton said.
	   The president made his remarks as he concluded two days of talks
with Yeltsin on Russia's economic and political crisis. The
Lewinsky matter did not come up in their discussions, nor did they
compare notes about their political weaknesses, a senior
administration official said.
	   In the elegant setting under the dome of Catherine's Hall, the
Lewinsky questions were an awkward reminder of the embarrassing
investigation awaiting Clinton at home. White House aides had
concluded he would have to say more after last month's speech was
generally deemed a disaster and failed to stem impeachment talk
even among Democrats. The White House sought outside advice on how
to proceed and a vacationing Clinton reached out by telephone to a
wide circle of friends.
	   It was not clear whether Clinton's latest remarks would satisfy
demands for contrition.
	   ``I would like to see him apologize,'' said Sen. Patty Murray.
Another Democrat, Sen. Mary Landrieu said, ``I don't know what else
he could say that would help.''
	   In his August address, Clinton had said the relationship was
wrong and that he regretted that he had misled people, including
his wife.
	   Still enjoying high approval ratings, Clinton said he was
``quite encouraged'' by that support _ and by conversations with
world leaders.
	   James Steinberg, deputy national security adviser, said every
foreign leader with whom Clinton has spoken in recent months has
expressed ``strong desire for sustained American leadership and
their conviction that the president can provide that leadership.''
	   As for his criticism of Starr's investigation, Clinton said
Wednesday that ``it seemed to be something that most reasonable
people would think had consumed a disproportionate amount of
America's time, money and resources and attention and now continued
to involve more and more people.''

U.S. embassies in Kuwait, Manila face attack threats
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Coca Cola denial, fixes attribution in 13th graf &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ The U.S. Embassy in Kuwait said Wednesday an
attack was possibly being planned against it, and a note found on a
plane in Kuwait warned of a bomb attack on the U.S. mission in the
Philippines.
	   Meanwhile, the Coca-Cola factory in Yemen also received a threat
on Monday, employees at the factory said.
	   A company spokesman in London, however, denied that report.
	   Washington has closed some of its diplomatic missions around the
world and maximized security in others following last month's twin
bombings of its embassies in Nairobi, Kenya and Dar es Salaam,
Tanzania. More than 250 people were killed and some 5,000 injured.
	   A taped message on a telephone line at the embassy in Kuwait
said: The ``U.S. government has received information indicating
that a similar attack (to those in Kenya and Tanzania) may be being
planned in Kuwait.''
	   The message said the embassy was taking ``appropriate security
precautions.''
	   Embassy spokesman Claud Young told The Associated Press that the
mission does not have immediate plans to close down because of the
threat, but would be closed for the Labor Day holiday on Monday.
	   He would not say how or where the threat was received.
	   The embassy in this oil-rich state has received several bomb
threats since the end of the 1991 Gulf War.
	   Another threat, this time against the U.S. Embassy in Manila,
Philippines, was delivered Tuesday on board an Emirates flight in a
handwritten note, the Interior Ministry said.
	   The unsigned note in English was found in the toilet of the
aircraft that arrived from Dubai, Col. Bader Saleh, the ministry
spokesman, said.
	   He quoted the note as saying: ``The American Embassy in the
Philippines will be bombed on Sept. 4, 1998.''
	   Security people searched the aircraft but found nothing
suspicious, Saleh said.
	   In the Yemeni capital of San`a, the Coca-Cola factory was sent
an anonymous fax that said: ``This is an American factory and
should be closed or we will blow it up without further warning.
This is a final warning,'' employees at the plant said.
	   Reports of the threat were also printed in the al-Balagh
newspaper, an independent weekly.
	   A spokesman for the company, however, denied the report.
	   ``We believe this report to be completely unfounded and untrue
and no communication of this nature has been received,'' said David
Cox, a London-based spokesman for Coca-Cola.
	   Extra police have been posted around the factory, which was
still running.
	   Cox said Coca-Cola has not increased its own security at the
plant.
	   The embassy bombings in Africa led to U.S. missile strikes at
suspected training camps for fundamentalist Muslims in Afghanistan
and a pharmaceutical plant in the Sudanese capital that the U.S.
government accused of making precursors for chemical weapons.

Lawyers, nearly half of defendants skip second day of mass trial
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FLEURY-MEROGIS, France (AP) _ France's biggest trial of
suspected Islamic extremists moved into its second day Wednesday
with most defense lawyers, all protesting the proceedings, absent
and barely half of the 138 defendants present.
	   Protesting the mass trial being held in a prison gymnasium, the
lawyers walked out on the first day of the trial on Monday, which
some lawyers have dubbed a ``masquerade.''
	   One defendant questioned Wednesday, Karim Chelamat, refused to
respond to Presiding Judge Bruno Steinmann, saying he does not
``recognize the legitimacy of the court.''
	   The defendants, all arrested in 1994-95, are accused of
belonging to three separate but overlapping networks that served as
support bases for Islamic insurgents in Algeria.
	   Only 27 of the defendants have been jailed since their arrests,
and the lawyers feel that several smaller trials should be held,
avoiding the gymnasium setting near the Fleury-Merogis Prison
outside Paris.
	   Chelamat was one of three defendants questioned by Judge
Steinmann whose homes contained weapons at the time of their
arrests.
	   One of the three, Ismail Debboub, conceded the arms found at his
Val-de-Marne home west of Paris were destined for Algeria but
denied he was a member of an insurgency group.
	   Another defendant, Farak Haddad, said he was storing the weapons
for a friend at his home in the Seine-Saint-Denis region outside
Paris.
	   ``My religious convictions do not allow me to have solidarity''
with the insurgency, he said, referring to the guerrilla-style war
by Islamic militants in Algeria that began in 1992. Some 75,000
people have been killed in the violence and counter-violence.
	   The suspects are accused of sending arms and medicine,
recruiting fighters and providing safe havens in France for
insurgents and funds for the cause.
	   Charged with ``criminal association with a terrorist
enterprise,'' they face up to 10 years in prison if convicted.

Two killed, three injured in apartment gas explosion
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BAKU, Azerbaijan (AP) _ A gas explosion ripped through an
apartment building in Azerbaijan on Wednesday, killing at least two
people and injuring three others.
	   The Ministry of Emergency Situations said that up to six people
could still be buried in the debris of the partially-collapsed
five-story building in Shemakha, some 300 kilometers (187 miles)
west of the capital Baku.
	   An electric spark was believed to have ignited gas that had
built up in the basement of the building, the ministry said.

Russian Defense Minister pledges START-2 will win ratification
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's acting defense minister predicted
Wednesday that Parliament will ratify the long-delayed START-2
treaty on nuclear arms despite lawmakers' objections.
	   ``The position of many deputies upon whom decision-making
depends has changed in favor of this document,'' Igor Sergeyev said
in the southern Russian city of Astrakhan.
	   President Boris Yeltsin has made similar pledges about
ratification but hard-line lawmakers have balked at approving it,
reiterating allegations that the United States has violated the
previous arms control agreement.
	   Russia's current economic crisis also may make it more difficult
for the government to find money to carry out such an arms-slashing
agreement.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton pressed during this week's summit in
Moscow for Russian legislators to ratify START-2 so the two nations
could take arms cuts further with START-3.

Austrian recommendation to tighten asylum rights stirs controversy
</HEADLINE>
in Europe
 &UR; By ROBERT H. REID &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Faced with sharp increases in asylum
seekers, Austria has proposed curbs on the right of refugees to
seek shelter in European Union countries, triggering harsh
criticism from human rights organizations.
	   A proposal, drafted by the Austrian Interior Ministry and
circulated Wednesday at EU headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, would
no longer recognize a universal right of asylum for those fleeing
oppression and instead consider it a ``political offer'' by
countries which choose to allow refugees.
	   The proposal was offered as part of an on-going debate within
the EU on a common policy toward asylum-seekers, who have been
knocking at the door of the 15 EU members in increasing numbers at
a time when the Europeans are grappling with longterm economic,
social and employment problems.
	   The right of asylum has been recognized under international law
as a fundamental human right since the 1951 Geneva Convention on
Migration, which was adopted in wake of the massive dislocation
during World War II and the Cold War division of Europe into rival
camps.
	   In the decades that followed, however, most refugees have been
seeking better economic opportunities in wealthier countries. Many
western European countries face problems providing jobs for their
own nationals and have been increasingly reluctant to make room for
``economic refugees'' from eastern Europe, the Middle East or
Africa.
	   As of Aug. 1, a total of 5,645 people from many countries had
sought asylum in Austria, surpassing the 5,500 figure for the whole
of last year. Of the overall figure, the majority -- about 2,800
--were Kosovo Albanians fleeing the fighting between Serb police
and sececiionist rebels.
	   Many Austrians feel their presence is an increasing burden in a
country of 7.8 million inhabitants -- or about the same population
as New York City.
	   Iraqis, including Iraqi Kurds, make up the second largest
number. As the easternmost member of the European Union, Austria is
often the first EU state reached by asylum-seekers from the Balkans
and the Middle East.
	   Neverthless, the Interior Ministry's proposal has drawn sharp
criticism from human rights groups and liberal and left-leaning
Austrian politicians alike.
	   The Vienna director of the Roman Catholic charity Caritas asked
Austria's interior minister, Karl Schloegl, for a clarification of
his position on the right of asylum.
	   ``I cannot imagine that this is really the view of the
minister,'' the Caritas director, Michael Landau, said. ``It could
only be the idea of an individual bureaucrat.''
	   Laundau said Austria had a ``good tradition'' of offering ayslum
to people ``whose lives have been threatened.''
	   A member of the European parliament from Austria's ruling
Socialist Party, Maria Berger, said ``no policy is possible which
attempts to remove the individual's right of asylum.''
	   ``This lunacy from the interior minister to raise the Geneva
Convention off its foundation is shocking,'' said Johannes
Voggenhuber, a member of Austria's Green Party.
	   Volker Kier of the Liberal party called the report a ``backdoor
attempt'' to abolish the 47-year-old asylum convention.

Iraqi rival Kurdish factions exchange hundreds of detainees
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Barzani aide saying two sides to discuss possible
joint administration in Washington talks &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Iraq's two main rival Kurdish groups have
released more than 200 prisoners of war, the British Broadcasting
Corp. reported Wednesday.
	   The prisoners were freed on Tuesday, BBC's monitoring service
said, quoting the Kurdistan Democratic Party's radio. It said the
KDP freed about 160 fighters while the PUK released 44.
	   The release came amid efforts aimed at ending the conflict
between the KDP and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, which have
been wrestling for control of the autonomous Kurdish zone in
northern Iraq since 1991.
	   The zone was created by the United States and Britain after the
Iraqi government suppressed a Kurdish revolt in 1991. Recently,
officials of the two factions have been negotiating moves to
consolidate a U.S.-brokered cease-fire signed in May 1997.
	   KDP leader Massoud Barzani and head of the PUK, Jalal Talabani,
are scheduled to visit the United States next week for talks with
senior administration officials on reconciliation efforts.
	   Barzani arrived in Ankara Wednesday for talks with Turkish
officials.
	   Barzani's aide, Sami Abdurrahman, told reporters that an
informal meeting was planned between Barzani and Talabani in the
United States to discuss formation of a possible joint
administration in northern Iraq.

	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ U.N. staff in Pakistan, Afghanistan and
Tajikistan will be the first to receive security training under a
new program targeting staff at risk, the United Nations announced
Wednesday.
	   The U.N. Security Coordinator's Office recently set up a trust
fund for U.N. staff in at-risk areas.
	   The first contribution to the fund _ dlrs 100,000 by Norway _
will pay for mobile training teams made up of security experts and
stress counselors, spokesman Fred Eckhard said at U.N. headquarters
in New York.
	   The first team will will work with U.N. staff in Tajikistan,
Afghanistan and Pakistan, Eckhard said.
	   He said that the training would begin in November at a site not
yet selected.
	   Eventually, he said, a number of duty stations will be set up
worldwide,
	   Two U.N. staffers were killed in Tajikistan in July, and a U.N.
staffer was shot dead in Afghanistan last month after U.S. missiles
hit an alleged terror base run by Islamic militant Osama bin Laden.
	   U.N. offices in Pakistan serve as a base for operations in
neighboring Afghanistan.
	   A July study by the United Nation's health arm concluded that
preparations for staff headed to dangerous areas are
``inadequate.''
	   ``Briefing on security issues and political matters appears to
be especially deficient and staff sometimes feel they are placed at
unnecessary risk as a result,'' the World Health Organization study
said.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Despite new clashes between Serbs
and ethnic Albanians, progress was reported Wednesday on an
agreement aimed at ending the fighting and reducing Serbia's grip
on the province's ethnic Albanian majority.
	   A senior Western diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the framework of an agreement between the Serb-led government
and Albanian politicians was taking shape as a result of shuttle
diplomacy by special U.S. envoy Christopher Hill.
	   Rather than tackling the issue of Kosovo's final status, U.S.
efforts are now focusing on reaching an interim agreement to end
the six months of fighting and slowly democratize Kosovo, giving
Albanians some self-rule, the diplomat said.
	   After three years, the two sides could review the agreement. The
diplomat said both Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and
Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova have accepted the idea in principle.
	   The diplomat, who is familiar with Hills' talks with both sides,
said he hoped an agreement on an ``interim accord'' would be
possible within months.
	   Continuing the U.S. scrutiny of Kosovo, John Shattuck, assistant
secretary of state for human rights, and Senator Robert Dole were
expected in Pristina in the coming days.
	   U.S. officials, who asked not to be identified, said Shattuck
was scheduled to arrive Friday evening and Dole on Saturday. Both
were likely to tour refugee areas and investigate kidnappings by
both sides before leaving Sunday.
	   Kosovo Albanians want independence from Serbia, a Yugoslav
republic, while Milosevic refuses to discuss anything beyond some
form of limited autonomy. The Americans and the Europeans have
called for ``substantial autonomy'' for Albanians, who outnumber
Serbs in the province 9-to-one.
	   On Wednesday, Hill met with Rugova. Afterward, Rugova's
followers issued a statement saying the two discussed a ``temporary
agreement between Belgrade and Pristina about a normalization of
situation in Kosovo.''
	   ``This agreement will last three years and its purpose will be
stabilization of the overall situation in Kosovo and functioning of
all institutions,'' the statement said. ``This will create
preconditions for a definitive solution of status of Kosovo.''
	   Washington and the Europeans oppose full independence because
they fear it would lead to a redrawing of borders in neighboring
countries with large Albanian populations. As a minimum, they want
Milosevic to restore the autonomy to Kosovo which he revoked in
1989.

	   VALLETTA, Malta (AP) _ The new-look German team got off to a
rocky start Wednesday, struggling to a 2-1 victory in an exhibition
match over low-rated Malta and showing little of the promised
flair.
	   Stephan Passlack scored Germany's winner in the 72nd minute
after being left unmarked in the Maltese penalty area. But Malta
could have gotten away with a draw as well against the reigning
European champion.
	   The German team, which had two rookies in the starting lineup
and which is being rebuilt after getting eliminated in the
quarterfinals of the World Cup, tried out a new system, dropping
the role of sweeper, or libero.
	   The position, made famous by Franz Beckenbauer, has been a key
role in the German team for 25 years.
	   Berti Vogts, the German coach, is trying to bring the German
game more up to date and sent out a four-man back line, a system
now used by most top-rated teams.
	   The game also marked the return of midfielder Stefan Effenberg,
who had been out of favor with Vogts for four years. Effenberg was
kicked off the national team at the 1994 World Cup in the United
States after showing an obscene gesture to German fans.
	   Germany went ahead in the 16th minute on an own goal by Malta
defender Dorren Debono. Mario Basler sent a corner-kick cross to
the far post and Debono struck the ball into his own net while
trying to clear in front of new German captain Oliver Bierhoff.
	   But the home team quickly recovered and only one minute later
Germany's goalkeeper Oliver Kahn did well to punch over the bar a
shot by Hubert Suda.
	   Malta tied the score in the 26th minute, after tearing the
German defense apart with several swift and polished moves that
ended with veteran Carmel Busuttil feeding Joseph Brincat, who
easily beat Kahn from 10 meters (yards).
	   Two minutes from halftime, Antoin Zahra shook the far post of
the German goal with a brilliant, angled free-kick shot.
	   Germany made several changes in the second halftime and two
foreign-born forwards made their debuts for their new country _
Brazilian-born Paulo Rink, and Swiss-born Oliver Neuville. Both
received German citizenship his summer.

	   NIAGARA FALLS, Ontario (AP) _ The mayor of the Canadian city of
Niagara Falls was beaten bloody with a cane in his City Hall office
by his opponent in last fall's election, police said.
	   Wayne Thomson, 58, suffered cuts on his head and face Tuesday
and was listed in satisfactory condition Wednesday.
	   Giuseppe Pietrangelo, 53, who lost to Thomson last November in a
landslide, 89 percent to 11 percent, was arrested at his home
shortly after the attack and was charged with attempted murder.
	   Thomson was thrashed with a homemade solid steel cane.
	   ``The mayor was hurt and weak, barely able to talk,'' said K.R.
Davidson, deputy chief of the Niagara Regional Police. ``He lost a
lot of blood.''
	   Police gave no motive for the attack.
	   Pietrangelo appeared at a bail hearing Wednesday. His next court
appearance is Sept. 8.

Clinton calls Netanyahu, Arafat
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Israeli comment &QL; 
 &UR; By BARRY SCHWEID &QC; 
 &UR; AP Diplomatic Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Bill Clinton telephoned Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday to register his
disappointment that no agreement has been concluded with the
Palestinians over the West Bank.
	   ``It's very frustrating,'' a senior U.S. official told a small
group of reporters covering Clinton's summit talks with Russian
President Boris Yeltsin. ``We need to get closure.''
	   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Clinton
later called Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, who is attending a
conference in South Africa. He offered no description of the
conversation.
	   ``We're closer than we have every been before,'' the official
said of negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority
over the West Bank.
	   The Clinton administration has urged Israel to yield 13 percent
of the territory to the Palestinians as part of a graduated
pullback from areas on the West Bank.
	   Clinton talked to Netanyahu for about 25 minutes, describing his
meetings with Yeltsin, the official said. The call with Arafat
lasted 15 minutes.
	   In Israel, Netanyahu spokesman Aviv Bushinsky said in a
statement, ``The president said he intends to take steps to speed
up the talks with the Palestinians, as soon as he gets back from
Russia.''
	   Netanyahu has resisted a 13 percent pullback, saying it would
jeopardize Israel's security. But he has told the Palestinians he
was willing to work out an acceptable arrangement.
	   Arafat has insisted on the 13 percent pullback prescribed by the
United States and laid claim to virtually all of the territory
between Israel and Jordan that Israel won in the 1967 Middle East
War.
	   Critics of Israel have complained Clinton was not being tough
with Netanyahu.

Moves on anti-terror laws, IRA arms on eve of Clinton's visit

	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ The Irish Republican Army took
a step closer towards disarming, and the British and Irish
governments to imprisoning IRA dissidents, as peacemaking momentum
mounted Wednesday on the eve of President Clinton's visit.
	   Ending months of delay, the IRA-allied Sinn Fein party announced
that Martin McGuinness _ its senior negotiator and the IRA's
reputed former chief _ would work with the Canadian-led commission
tasked with disarming paramilitary groups under terms of the
Belfast peace accord.
	   In London and Dublin, the British and Irish governments welcomed
Sinn Fein's move as they convened emergency sessions of lawmakers
to push through laws designed to imprison IRA dissidents who oppose
April's compromise deal on how Northern Ireland should be governed.
	   British Prime Minister Tony Blair faced stronger-than-expected
criticism from a vociferous minority of lawmakers _ including 16
from his own dominant Labor Party _ over his determination to see
his Terrorism and Conspiracy Bill pass through both houses of
Parliament by Thursday night.
	   Most of his critics said they supported the proposed crackdown
but thought Parliament deserved more time to consider amendments to
the bill, which would restrict the right to silence for suspected
IRA dissidents and give greater weight in court to police claims
that people were members of the splinter group.
	   But Blair easily won a preliminary vote to restrict debating
time and keep the bill on schedule to be passed as Clinton travels
from Belfast to the bomb-shattered town of Omagh and on to Dublin
on Thursday.
	   In Dublin, Prime Minister Bertie Ahern enjoyed near-total unity
as he condemned the IRA dissidents responsible for the Aug. 15 car
bombing of Omagh, an attack that killed 28 civilians.
	   ``These people are about to learn a lesson that will teach them
to respect the strength of Irish democracy,'' Ahern said.
	   He said the dissidents, who opposed the IRA's July 1997 truce
but announced a ``suspension'' of their attacks on Northern Ireland
towns following the Omagh atrocity, might ``defy us to put them out
of business.''
	   ``If they do, they should not be in any doubt about this
government's determination to crush and dismantle any organizations
that still engage in violence.''
	   The Irish parliament's lone Sinn Fein member, Caoimhghin O
Caolain, was one of a few lawmakers to criticize Ahern's bill,
which includes plans to allow police to hold suspects without
charge for up to four days and for authorities to seize the
property of convicted IRA dissidents.
	   But Ahern's predecessor as Irish premier, John Bruton, accused
Sinn Fein leaders of providing an ``implicit justification'' for
the IRA dissidents' violence because they have refused until now to
pursue IRA disarmament as the agreement requires.
	   David Trimble, the Protestant leader of Northern Ireland's
envisioned cross-community government, welcomed Sinn Fein's
appointment of McGuinness as ``a first step'' towards demonstrating
that the IRA was prepared to leave violence ``clearly and
decisively behind.''
	   And Trimble confirmed he would convene leaders of all
pro-agreement parties, including Sinn Fein, on Monday in Belfast to
discuss forming a new legislative Assembly and multi-party
administration.
	   Also Wednesday, the British government infuriated many Catholics
with the surprise parole of two soldiers sentenced to life for
murdering a Catholic teen-ager in Belfast in 1992.
	   The two Scots Guardsmen had claimed that the 18-year-old victim
was about to throw a homemade grenade, but the court ruled that
Peter McBride was unarmed and had been running away when shot in
the back. It was the last killing of a civilian committed by
British troops in Northern Ireland.
	   Britain's governor for Northern Ireland, Mo Mowlam, justified
the move in light of the peace agreement's plans to parole more
than 400 convicted members of the IRA and pro-British paramilitary
groups, starting next week.
	   A moderate Catholic politician condemned the decision as
confirming a pattern whereby ``no British soldier convicted of
murder has ever served in any real sense a life sentence.''
	   ``To add insult to injury the soldiers are to be readmitted to
the British army. This is an international scandal,'' said Alban
Maginness, a lawyer who last year served as Belfast's first
Catholic mayor.
	   And the victim's father, Peter McBride Sr., said Mowlam's
decision was deliberately timed ``to be pushed under the carpet
because Clinton is coming.''
	   ``The British thought they could get them out now and there
would be no trouble, no violence on the streets, that peace is here
at last,'' he said bitterly.

Congo war creates divisiveness at Nonaligned Movement summit

<TEXT>
	   DURBAN, South Africa (AP) _ In a surprise appearance at the
Nonaligned Movement summit Wednesday, Congo President Laurent
Kabila blasted Rwanda and Uganda, saying they had invaded his vast
central African country.
	   Instead of being a love fest of leaders of developing countries,
the Congo war _ which involves troops from as many as six countries
_ proved divisive. Underscoring his hostility toward mediation
efforts spearheaded by South Africa, Kabila bypassed President
Nelson Mandela as he was greeting the 53 heads of government who
arrived for the summit Wednesday.
	   Kabila then took the podium to ask the leaders of developing
nations to ``unequivocally condemn the aggression'' of Uganda and
Rwanda and request their troops' withdrawal from Congo.
	   ``At this very moment, my country fellows in occupied territory
are being assassinated, women are being raped and children are
being used as cannon fodder,'' Kabila said, wearing his trademark
safari suit and reading his speech through thick glasses.
	   Kabila also promised to hold free and fair elections by 1999.
	   Kabila's appearance set a tense tone hours before U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan held peace talks here with Kabila, and
with Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe and Namibian President Sam
Nujoma, whose troops are fighting alongside Kabila's.
	   Annan told a TV interviewer the talks were ``very helpful and
useful'' but acknowledged ``we are at a very early stage'' in
negotiating a possible peace agreement.
	   Annan said he planned to meet on Thursday with the presidents of
Uganda and Rwanda, who deny their forces are helping Congolese
rebels. Senior U.S. diplomat Princeton Lyman, a guest at the
summit, indicated Rwanda and Uganda do have troops in Congo.
	   ``There are foreign troops on both sides, and that's got to be
recognized, and a plan for withdrawing them has to be part of the
(peace) process,'' Lyman said in an interview with The Associated
Press.
	   Kabila, meanwhile, thanked Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia for
sending troops to help battle the rebels and later lunched with
Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos, Mugabe and Nujoma, said
Kabila spokesman Kikaya Bin Karubi.

Israeli merchant marine faces murder charge in Senegal

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ An Israeli merchant marine, arrested in Italy,
is wanted by Senegal for allegedly setting adrift four Senegalese
stowaways in the open seas, an Israeli official said Wednesday.
	   Italian authorities arrested Boris German when he arrived at its
southern port of Taranto two months ago at the request of Interpol,
an Israeli diplomatic source said, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
	   Italy is now considering an extradition request from Senegal
which wants to try German in the case. A conviction could mean a
death sentence, said Israel's Absorption Minister Yuli Edelstein,
who is handling the matter, because Senegal has claimed one of the
stowaways died at sea.
	   No comment was immediately available from Senegalese or Italian
authorities.
	   The incident happened seven years ago, when German worked as
second officer on a Cypriot ship with a Russian crew, his wife
Tatiana told The Associated Press. The couple moved to Israel two
years later from the former Soviet Union.
	   Mrs. German said her husband was third in command aboard the
Cypriot chip but Senegalese authorities hold him responsible for
casting the stowaways adrift because he was on watch at the time.
	   She said her husband's ship was traveling between ports along
the African continent when they discovered the stowaways. It was
not known where the four boarded the ship, but they wanted to get
off off in Dakar, Senegal. But in Dakar, Senegalese authorities
refused to allow them to disembark because they had no passports
and could not prove that they were Senegalese citizens, she said.
	   So, the crew set the four men adrift about 600 meters from the
port, Mrs. German said. Three of the stowaways reached the shore on
the raft, but the fourth disappeared.
	   If German is found guilty, ``he could be sentenced to death for
a crime he did not commit,'' said Edelstein, maintaining German's
innocence in the incident. Mrs. German turned to the minister, also
an immigrant, for help.

	   TRIPOLI, Libya (AP) _ If the two Libyans accused of the 1988
bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 are convicted, they should serve their
time in Libya and not in Britain, their Libyan lawyer said
Wednesday.
	   Ibrahim Legwell told reporters that he wanted further guarantees
on the rights of the suspects from those outlined in the plan
endorsed by the U.N. Security Council on Aug. 27.
	   The United States and Britain, which drew up the plan, have said
it is non-negotiable.
	   The plan provides for the United Nations to suspend sanctions
against Libya once it turns over two men suspected in the bombing
of the flight which exploded over Lockerbie, Scotland, on Dec. 21,
1988, killing 270 people.
	   Under the plan, the suspects _ Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi and
Lamen Khalifa Fhimah _ would be tried in the Netherlands by a panel
of three Scottish judges according to Scottish law. If convicted,
they will serve their sentences in a British prison.
	   A delegation of the 22-member Arab League left Cairo for Libya
Wednesday, where they are expected to hold talks with Libyan
officials on possible arrangements for handing over the suspects.

	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Government-allied troops on Wednesday
were pushing east toward the rebel-held town of Kalemie, taking
Congo's monthlong civil war away from the capital of Kinshasa and
into the heart of rebel territory.
	   The offensive came as President Laurent Kabila's military allies
said they may not stay in the Congolese war much longer and Kabila
lashed out what he said was a foreign invasion of his country.
	   Information Minister Didier Mumengi said the loyalist forces had
closed in on Kalemie, about 400 kilometers (250 miles) south of the
key rebel stronghold of Bukavu on the eastern fringe of this
central African state.
	   Rebel leaders in the eastern city of Goma, however, said they
were reinforcing their positions in Kalemie and two other
apparently rebel-held towns _ Moba and Manono, Kabila's birthplace
_ in the copper-rich Katanga province of southern Congo.
	   But in the propaganda battle that has also raged throughout the
Congolese war, both sides weighed Wednesday on the latest fighting
_ with rebels denying Kalemie was under seige and the government
denying Moba and Manono had ever fallen from their control.
	   Chief rebel commander Jean-Pierre Ondekane said his forces
continued to advance into Katanga, but gave no details.
	   The coalition rebel force of ethnic Tutsi fighters and former
troops in Kabila's military was pushed out of western Congo over
the weekend, halting a month-long advance on the capital, Kinshasa,
and shifting the focus of the war on the east.
	   In Angola, though, defense chiefs from Kabila's military allies
agreed Wednesday to end their involvement soon in the Congolese
war.
	   ``We intervened to prevent a military power-grab. This first
step was completed successfully. We believe it will be fully
accomplished in the next few days,'' Angolan armed forces chief
Gen. Joao de Matos told reporters after talks in Angola's capital,
Luanda, with defense ministers from Namibia and Zimbabwe. He
declined to give a timetable for any withdrawal.
	   However, Namibian President Sam Nujoma, whose country has sent
more than 100 soldiers to Congo, said at the Nonaligned Movement
summit in South Africa that ``we will leave only when the job is
done.''

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Despite new clashes between Serbs
and ethnic Albanians, progress was reported Wednesday on an
agreement aimed at ending the fighting and reducing Serbia's tight
grip on the province's ethnic Albanian majority.
	   A senior Western diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the framework of an agreement between the Serb-led government
and Albanian politicians was taking shape as a result of shuttle
diplomacy by special U.S. envoy Christopher Hill.
	   Rather than tackling the issue of Kosovo's final status, U.S.
efforts are now focusing on reaching an interim agreement to end
the six months of fighting and slowly democratize Kosovo, giving
Albanians some self-rule, the diplomat said.
	   After an interim period of three years, the two sides could
review the agreement. The diplomat said both Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic and Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova have accepted
the idea in principle.
	   The diplomat, who is familiar with Hills' talks with both sides,
said he hoped an agreement on an ``interim accord'' would be
possible within months.
	   While no breakthrough had been reached, talks were making
progress, the diplomat told reporters.

Two Polish divers die in underwater cave
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   L'ESCALA, Spain (AP) _ The bodies of two Polish divers were
discovered on Wednesday in a cave off the northeast coast of Spain,
the rescue team said.
	   Marius Kanikowski, 27, Waldemar Lamparki, 38, were part of a
group of five Polish firemen who were on vacation in Spain to
practise cave diving, said a firebrigade spokesman in L'Escala,
some 140 kilometers (88 miles) north of Barcelona.
	   The cave is known as the Frenchman's cave as a French diver died
there last year.
	   It was not clear how they became separated from the rest of the
group, but on Tuesday they apparently could not find an exit before
their air tanks ran out, the spokesman said.
	   On Wednesday, Spanish diver Josep Guardiola, 57, was found dead.
His body surfaced near the nearby town of Tossa de Mar, the state
news agency EFE reported.

<TEXT>
	   DURBAN, South Africa (AP) _ In a surprise appearance at the
Nonaligned Movement summit Wednesday, Congo President Laurent
Kabila blasted Rwanda and Uganda, saying they had invaded his vast
central African country.
	   Instead of being a love fest of leaders of developing countries,
the Congo war _ which involves troops from as many as six countries
_ brought divisiveness into the summit of 53 heads of government.
	   Underscoring his hostility toward mediation efforts spearheaded
by South Africa, Kabila bypassed President Nelson Mandela as he was
greeting the 53 heads of government who arrived for the summit
Wednesday.
	   Kabila then took the podium to ask the leaders of developing
nations to ``unequivocally condemn the aggression'' of Uganda and
Rwanda and request their troops' withdrawal from Congo.
	   ``At this very moment, my country fellows in occupied territory
are being assassinated, women are being raped and children are
being used as cannon fodder,'' Kabila said, wearing his trademark
safari suit and reading his speech through thick glasses.
	   Kabila also promised to hold free and fair elections by 1999.
	   Hours later, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan held peace talks
here with Kabila, and with Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe and
Namibian President Sam Nujoma, both of whose countries have troops
fighting alongside Kabila's.
	   But chances that Annan could hold joint talks with all the
factions on Thursday were slim. Nujoma was leaving the summit
Wednesday night and Kabila said he didn't know if he wanted to have
any more discussions.
	   The presidents of Uganda and Rwanda deny their forces are
helping Congolese rebels, but senior U.S. diplomat Princeton Lyman,
a guest at the summit, indicated Rwanda and Uganda do have troops
in Congo.
	   ``There are foreign troops on both sides, and that's got to be
recognized, and a plan for withdrawing them has to be part of the
(peace) process,'' Lyman said in an interview with The Associated
Press.
	   Lyman said his delegation was asking all parties involved in the
Congo war to come to an agreement that includes a cease-fire, the
withdrawal of foreign troops, a broadening of the government in
Congo to be more representative and a plan to deal with the
humanitarian situation.
	   ``We've been very concerned ... there are reports of massacres,
hate radio going on, people in detention whose lives may be in
danger,'' Lyman said.
	   Hate broadcasts in Rwanda in 1994 prodded the Hutu majority to
massacre ethnic Tutsis.
	   Annan, addressing the summit, appealed for Africa's leaders to
solve their problems through political and not military means.
	   ``For every day that we fail to do so, the innocent people of
this continent pay a terrible price,'' Annan said, citing trouble
spots including Congo and Angola, where he said the U.N.-brokered
peace process is ``hanging by a thread.''
	   Another issue dominating the Nonaligned Movement, created in the
1950s to fend off supperpower domination, was nuclear weapons.
	   India was pushing for the Nonaligned Movement to recognize it as
a nuclear power _ a status shared by five other nations, according
to Lyman and another source at the summit. If India _ which along
with Pakistan tested nuclear weapons this year _ is declared a
nuclear power, it could argue it doesn't have to dispose of its
nuclear weapons as called for by the nuclear nonproliferation
treaty, Lyman said.
	   ``We encourage them to reconsider what they've done and where
they'e going ... and then slowly think about coming back into the
nonproliferation regime,'' Lyman said. ``But if (more countries)
get declared nuclear weapons states, you're already moving in the
wrong direction.''
	   Lyman also said his delegation has lobbied delegates to soften
the ``excessive'' tone of a resolution being considered here which
denounces the U.S. cruise missile attack on Sudan. Sudan had
requested the condemnation.
	   Despite the sometimes tense climate at the summit, there were
moments of warmth.
	   At the receiving line before the summit began, Mandela and his
new wife Graca Machel _ widow of Mozambican leader and black
liberation leader Samora Machel _ shared an emotional moment with
Cuban President Fidel Castro.
	   ``Fidel, Fidel, Fidel,'' Mandela said as he threw his arms
around Castro, dressed in a grey business suit. The two old
revolutionaries hugged, then Castro embraced Mrs. Machel.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ An Israeli merchant marine, arrested in Italy,
is wanted by Senegal for allegedly setting adrift four Senegalese
stowaways in open seas, an Israeli official said Wednesday.
	   Italian authorities arrested Boris German at the request of
Interpol when he arrived at the southern port of Taranto two months
ago, an Israeli diplomatic source said, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
	   Italy is now considering an extradition request from Senegal
which wants to try German in the case. A conviction could mean a
death sentence, said Israel's Absorption Minister Yuli Edelstein,
who is handling the matter. The minister is in charge of immigrant
affairs and German is an immigrant.
	   No comment was immediately available from Senegalese or Italian
authorities.
	   The incident happened seven years ago, when German worked as
second officer on a Cypriot ship with a Russian crew, his wife
Tatiana told The Associated Press. The couple moved to Israel two
years later from the former Soviet Union.
	   Mrs. German said her husband was third in command aboard the
Cypriot chip but Senegalese authorities hold him responsible for
casting the stowaways adrift because he was on watch at the time.
	   She said her husband's ship was traveling between ports along
the African continent when they discovered the stowaways. It was
not known where the four boarded the ship, but they wanted to get
off off in Dakar, Senegal. But in Dakar, Senegalese authorities
refused to allow them to disembark because they had no passports
and could not prove that they were Senegalese citizens, she said.
	   So, the crew set the four men adrift about 600 meters from the
port, Mrs. German said. Three of the stowaways reached the shore on
the raft, but the fourth disappeared. Senegalese officials said the
fourth died at sea.
	   If German is found guilty, ``he could be sentenced to death for
a crime he did not commit,'' said Edelstein, maintaining German's
innocence in the incident. Mrs. German turned to the minister, also
an immigrant, for help.

Netanyahu says Clinton pledged to work hard for Mideast peace
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said
that U.S. President Bill Clinton, in a telephone call Wednesday,
pledged to do more to help the troubled Mideast peace process.
	   Asked by Israel TV whether Clinton pressured him to move forward
in the stalled peace talks, Netanyahu said: ``No, it was a
conversation in a totally different spirit.''
	   ``He phoned me at his initiative, and he told me that as soon as
he returns from Russia, he intends to give a new impetus to his
support for the diplomatic process with the Palestinians,''
Netanyahu said.
	   Clinton called Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat,
who is in South Africa, from Moscow where he held summit talks with
Russian President Boris Yeltsin.
	   A U.S. official told a small group of reporters covering the
Moscow talks that Clinton telephoned Netanyahu to register his
disappointment that no agreement has been concluded with the
Palestinians over an Israeli troop withdrawal in the West Bank.
	   ``It's very frustrating,'' the official said. ``We need to get
closure.''
	   In Jerusalem, Netanyahu's aide Aviv Bushinsky said the prime
minister was also frustrated and disappointed at the lack of
progress but he was very satisfied after speaking with Clinton.
	   ``We had a very good talk and I think it's very important that
the United States will come in as we have called upon it to do at
certain stages in the past few weeks and help us to achieve a good
agreement, an agreement of peace with security,'' Netanyahu said.
	   ``(Clinton) told me he intends to work together with me to
achieve an agreement that meets the needs of both sides,''
Netanyahu said.
	   The process has been stalled for 18 months. Israel and the
Palestinians have been haggling, with little success, over the
details of an American proposal for Israel to withdraw troops from
13 percent of the West Bank.

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ A late bout of selling Wednesday cut short the
Dow industrial's bid to extend Tuesday's rebound from August's
scary selloff.
	   The Dow Jones industrial average, down 512.61 on Monday and up
288.23 Tuesday, fell 45.06 to close at 7,782.37. The average of 30
blue chips had been holding onto gains until the final minutes of
trading.
	   At one point, the Dow was up as much as 125.13 at 7,952.56, or
44 points above where it began the year, at 7,908.25.
	   Some broader indicators rose, however, including the Nasdaq
composite index, which was adding to Tuesday's record point gain.
	   Wednesday's decline left the Dow 16.7 percent below its record
of 9,337.97 set on July 17.

	   GORIC, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Rain above, mud below and biting chill
all around. It's still summer on the calendar but for tens of
thousands of refugees huddled at best under plastic sheeting,
Kosovo's bitter autumn is already here.
	   Some days, the sun still provides a few hours' warmth to the
estimated 50,000 people scattered in fields, forests, meadows and
mountains by the government offensive that has destroyed hundreds
of ethnic Albanian villages since March.
	   But nights bring cold and rain, foreshadowing the tragedy to
come unless Kosovo's new nomads are sheltered _ and fast.
	   After a recent visit to refugee sites, U.S. Assistant Secretary
of State Julia Taft warned of a ``catastrophe that is looming,''
and predicted suffering and death this winter for tens of thousands
of the most vulnerable.
	   For field workers such as Maggie Bryson of the International
Committee of the Red Cross, the catastrophe is already here. The
onset of cold weather is ``absolutely dreadful'' she says. On a
recent tour of devastated southwest Kosovo, she saw the corpse of a
10-day-old baby who died of exposure.
	   Nothing unusual, say refugees camped in abandoned buses, cars,
burned-out houses or in makeshift tents _ leaky plastic sheeting
propped up by branches or stretched over trailers covered-wagon
style.
	   Some of the trailers remain hooked up to tractors _ the better
to flee quickly in case shelling starts again.
	   ``It's already very cold at night, close to freezing,'' says
Zuka Miradic, rocking an infant in a wooden cradle as other women
tend to the fire in the iron stove inside their plastic shelter.
``Three people died in the last few days, an old woman, a
4-month-old child and a newborn baby.''
	   Their ``tent'' near Goric, just south of the former Kosovo
Liberation Army stronghold of Malisevo, is pitched in a meadow.
Nearby stand similar shelters _ two buses and cars piled with
carpets, blankets _ anything to provide nighttime warmth.
	   The muddy patch is bordered on one side by a creek of
ocher-colored water where a woman is slapping a shirt against rocks
to try to get it clean. Cows and water buffalo roll in the muck
upstream, less than 50 meters (yards) from a girl cupping her hands
for a drink.
	   Two nights of rain have made dry wood a precious commodity, only
used for cooking. The adults hug each other for warmth at night.
Most of the kids _ about 80 of them in the whole settlement _ sleep
in the buses.
	   ``I don't mind the cold in the night for myself. It's the kids
that suffer,'' says Ajshe Bytyci, one of about a dozen women
sharing space in the ``tent'' with the children who crowd in during
the day. ``The children are already getting sick, them and the
older women.''
	   Most of the kids are sockless and wear only thin wooden clogs.
But it's not the runny noses that bother the women. Diarrhea and
dysentery, both potential child-killers, are on the increase, they
say, the result of contaminated water and lack of hygiene. With the
cold, most of the children haven't bathed for a week.
	   Peppers stew on the stove _ a gift from nearby villagers.
``Other than that we have nothing,'' says Bytyci. Asked if they
have seen any international humanitarian aid in her five days of
camping out, the women shake their heads.
	   Though U.N. and other aid agencies are operating in the Serbian
province, their efforts are hampered by the particular nature of
Kosovo's war and by Serbian government red tape.
	   Many of the estimated 265,000 Kosovo refugees don't stay put
more than a few days, forced to flee again and again by an
offensive that Serbia says means to target only separatist
guerrillas. Most of the victims, however, are civilians. By the
time they arrive at a campsite, aid convoys often find the
makeshift refugee camps empty, their inhabitants on the run again.
	   International agencies complain that the government in Belgrade
refuses to issue visas to their staffers. The U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees says that it's working at half strength
because of such delays.
	   The violence of the offensive _ Albanian villages first shelled,
then often torched _ has led many refugees to believe their enemy
is bent not only on wiping out separatist guerrillas but Kosovo
Albanians themselves.
	   Small wonder that Serbian promises to set up 11 ``safe zones''
throughout Kosovo, where refugees can come to get food, medicines
and building materials, are met with anger.
	   ``They're not interested in helping us,'' says Shefki Bytygi,
who says his nearby house was destroyed in a recent attack.
	   Others nod as he demands stronger international action than
promises of aid that never arrive.
	   ``Bomb the bloody bastards as quick as you can if you want to
save these women, these children,'' he says, his hands sweeping the
refugee area around him. ``Kill the Serb killing machine!''

Romania beats Liechtenstein 7-0 in Euro qualification
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Romania easily defeated a modest
Liechtenstein team 7-0 Wednesday in its opening qualifier for
European soccer Championship in 2000.
	   The Romanians, under the direction of new coach Victor Piturca,
played a relaxed game against the mostly amateur team from
Liechtenstein.
	   Gica Popescu, who plays for Galatasaray Istambul opened the
scoring in the 18th minute when he headed into the net a ball from
just few meters (yards).
	   The Romanians continued a game dominated by the brilliant
tactics of star player, Bucharest Valencia's Adrian ``Cobra'' Ilie.
	   Ilie scored three times in the 32nd, 45th and 51st minutes.
	   His second goal was a wonderful shot from the left corner of the
penalty area that hit the net in the upper right corner leaving
Liechtenstein goalie Martin Oehri speechless.
	   Catalin Munteanu, who plays for Spain's Salamanca, scored
another goal in the 30th minute and Moldovan Fenerbahce's Viorel
scored in the 54th. Five minutes later, Liechtenstein's Modestus
Haas hit his own net trying for a rebound.
	   Romania and Liechtenstein play in qualification Group 7,
together with Adzerbaidjan, Portugal, Hungary and Slovakia.
	    &UR; Lineups:
	   Roma Bogdan Stelea, Dan Petrescu, Cosmin Contra, Florin Batranu,
Costel Galca, Gica Popescu, Florentin Petre, Dorinel Munteanu,
Viorel Moldovan, Catalin Munteanu, Adrian Ilie

Yale-trained economist moves ahead in Venezuelan presidential
</HEADLINE>
race. &QL; 
 &UR; By STEVEN GUTKIN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ Until just weeks ago, the joke in
Venezuela was that the presidential race was between The Beauty and
The Beast: a former Miss Universe who avoided serious issues and a
former coup leader who scared off investors.
	   But the latest opinion polls say The Beauty is sinking,
outplayed by a Yale-trained economist.
	   Henrique Salas Romer has taken second place in the polls,
surpassing Irene Saez and becoming the main challenger to Hugo
Chavez, the one-time paratrooper who tried to overthrow the
government six years ago.
	   Salas may not have Chavez's charisma or Saez's good looks, but
the 62-year-old former state governor is painting himself as the
most sensible alternative in December's voting.
	   ``How can we rationalize voting for someone who attacked the
rule of law?'' Salas, referring to Chavez, asked in an interview
Wednesday with The Associated Press.
	   Salas favors open markets, a smaller and decentralized
government, and an overhaul of the health and education systems. As
governor of the northern state of Carabobo, he was criticized for
having an authoritarian style, but even his detractors admitted his
government worked more efficiently than most.
	   In a poll released last week by the private firm Datanalisis,
Salas was favored by 27 percent of voters, compared to 46 percent
for Chavez. Saez, until recently the mayor of a well-run Caracas
municipality, was third with 10 percent. The survey, conducted Aug.
20-23, included interviews with 1,200 people and reported a margin
of error of 2.83 percent.
	   Overcoming Chavez's lead won't be easy. The former coup leader
enjoys widespread support among the poor and middle classes who
have seen their earning power steadily erode in recent years.
Chavez favors ending privatizations and limiting interest payments
on the country's foreign debt.
	   ``I think it's doubtful that Salas Romer has enough appeal in
terms of his personal characteristics or in terms of his message to
take a sufficient quantity of votes away from Chavez in order to
beat him,'' said political consultant Eric Ekvall.
	   A precipitous drop in international oil prices has exacerbated
Venezuela's economic troubles. The country relies on oil for more
than 75 percent of its export earnings and over half of all
government revenues.
	   According to Salas, the tough times could work either for or
against Chavez, whose surging candidacy has already led many
investors to take their money out of Venezuela.
	   ``When you face uncertainty, do you look for an avenger or a man
who is going to bring you more security?'' he asked.

Police arrest man for biting off chunk of nose

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Dutch police Wednesday arrested a
54-year-old man for biting off a chunk of another man's nose in an
argument last month. The officers also found the chunk of nose in
the arrested man's freezer.
	   The suspect told police he had kept the 2-by-2.5-centimeter
(0.8-by-1-inch) piece of nose, which was frozen in a glass of milk,
to prove he did not use a knife in the Aug. 14 attack in an
Amsterdam cafe, according to a police statement.
	   Police thawed out the piece of nose but said there was no longer
any chance of grafting it back on to the victim's face. The
suspect, whose name was not released, was expected to be charged
with aggravated assault.

Police say Planet Hollywood bomb linked to other Cape Town blasts
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES and RECASTS with new material &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ The bomb that ripped through a
Planet Hollywood restaurant last month resembled previous bombs
aimed at police targets, authorities said Wednesday.
	   Experts had finished reconstructing the Planet Hollywood bomb,
which killed a man and injured 27 people Aug. 25.
	   ``It had a similar timing device and similar type of explosives
were used,'' said Western Cape Province police commissioner Leon
Wessels.
	   He said the materials used to build the gun were available from
most gun ships to buyers who had appropriate licenses.
	   Earlier on Wednesday, National Police Commissioner George Fivaz
ruled out international involvement in the bombing.
	   ``We believe if we are making arrests it will be proved that
local people are responsible for that specific bomb,'' Fivaz said.
	   The finding contradicted statements immediately after the blast
by top South African officials, including Safety and Security
Minister Sydney Mufamadi, that the restaurant bombing was connected
to U.S. missile strikes against alleged Islamic terrorist sites in
Sudan and Afghanistan.
	   The U.S. strikes were retaliation for the Aug. 7 bombing of U.S.
embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.
	   The only claim of responsibility for the bombing came from a
caller to a radio station who said he represented the
anti-American, anti-Israeli group called Muslims Against Global
Oppression.
	   The group later repudiated the claim.
	   Cape Town and its surrounding slums have been subject to a wave
of recent bombings, which authorities have linked to a vigilante
group, People Against Gangsterism and Drugs.
	   One bomb went off Aug. 6 outside police offices, killing a
street vendor, and another outside a local police station struck
about a month before that. No one was injured in that attack.
	   Police had no leads on the earlier blasts, he said. Media
reports at the time had linked them to PAGAD.

Mexicans seek ways to let citizens in U.S., elsewhere vote
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ADOLFO GARZA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ A recent law ended a ban on voting by some 7
million Mexicans living abroad. But electoral authorities said
Wednesday that Mexico's Congress needs to pass another law telling
them how to hold elections there.
	   Mexican citizens living in the United States, who annually send
billions of dollars back home, are still waiting for implementation
of a 1996 act on foreign voting.
	   ``A considerable part of the Mexican population is currently
marginalized from the political decisions that affect it, even
though they continue to significantly contribute to the wellbeing
of their families and the nation's economy,'' said Juan Molinar
Horcasitas, a member of the Federal Electoral Institute board.
	   At the request of Congress, the institute is analyzing the
technical hurdles that have delayed foreign voting.
	   ``There is no legal reference that regulates and indicates to
the electoral authorities how to organize an election abroad,''
institute President Jose Woldenberg said.
	   The conclusions reached by the institute are to be delivered to
legislators next November.
	   Many analysts believe that Mexicans abroad would tend to support
opposition parties. Many left Mexico for lack of economic
opportunity and are often beyond the reach of government patronage.
	   Molinar said external voting would be an important step toward
universal suffrage.
	   ``Just as at one time there was a struggle to extend citizenship
rights to the illiterate, indigenous people and women, some seem to
yield today to the prejudice that discriminates against our fellow
countrymen who emigrated,'' he said.
	   The electoral officials spoke at a conference sponsored by the
Washington D.C.-based International Foundation for Election
Systems.
	   Horacio Boneo of the United Nations' Electoral Assistance Unit
said Mexico would face some problems in allowing voting beyond its
borders, including Mexicans' historic lack of confidence in the
cleanliness of their elections.
	   ``I don't even want to think what would happen if the external
vote could change the result of an election,'' he said.
	   According to the foundation, almost 50 countries have some form
of elections for citizens living abroad. At least 31, including the
United States, them to vote in both presidential and legislative
elections.

Austrian recommendation to tighten asylum rights stirs controversy
</HEADLINE>
in Europe
 &UR; By ROBERT H. REID &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Faced with sharp increases in asylum
seekers, Austria has proposed curbs on the right of refugees to
seek shelter in European Union countries, triggering harsh
criticism from human rights organizations.
	   A proposal, drafted by the Austrian Interior Ministry and
circulated Wednesday at EU headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, would
no longer recognize a universal right of asylum for those fleeing
oppression and instead consider it a ``political offer'' by
countries which choose to allow refugees.
	   The proposal was offered as part of an on-going debate within
the EU on a common policy toward asylum-seekers, who have been
knocking at the door of the 15 EU members in increasing numbers at
a time when the Europeans are grappling with longterm economic,
social and employment problems.
	   The right of asylum has been recognized under international law
as a fundamental human right since the 1951 Geneva Convention on
Migration, which was adopted in wake of the massive dislocation
during World War II and the Cold War division of Europe into rival
camps.
	   In the decades that followed, however, most refugees have been
seeking better economic opportunities in wealthier countries. Many
western European countries face problems providing jobs for their
own nationals and have been increasingly reluctant to make room for
``economic refugees'' from eastern Europe, the Middle East or
Africa.
	   As of Aug. 1, a total of 5,645 people from many countries had
sought asylum in Austria, surpassing the 5,500 figure for the whole
of last year. Of the overall figure, the majority -- about 2,800
--were Kosovo Albanians fleeing the fighting between Serb police
and secessionist rebels.
	   Many Austrians feel their presence is an increasing burden in a
country of 7.8 million inhabitants -- or about the same population
as New York City.
	   Iraqis, including Iraqi Kurds, make up the second largest
number. As the easternmost member of the European Union, Austria is
often the first EU state reached by asylum-seekers from the Balkans
and the Middle East.
	   Nevertheless, the Interior Ministry's proposal has drawn sharp
criticism from human rights groups and liberal and left-leaning
Austrian politicians alike.
	   The Vienna director of the Roman Catholic charity Caritas asked
Austria's interior minister, Karl Schloegl, for a clarification of
his position on the right of asylum.
	   ``I cannot imagine that this is really the view of the
minister,'' the Caritas director, Michael Landau, said. ``It could
only be the idea of an individual bureaucrat.''
	   Laundau said Austria had a ``good tradition'' of offering asylum
to people ``whose lives have been threatened.''
	   A member of the European parliament from Austria's ruling
Socialist Party, Maria Berger, said ``no policy is possible which
attempts to remove the individual's right of asylum.''
	   ``This lunacy from the interior minister to raise the Geneva
Convention off its foundation is shocking,'' said Johannes
Voggenhuber, a member of Austria's Green Party.
	   Volker Kier of the Liberal party called the report a ``backdoor
attempt'' to abolish the 47-year-old asylum convention.

Former classmate tried to blackmail Israel's first lady
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) - A former classmate of the prime minister's wife
threatened to publish ``embarrassing,'' information about the Sarah
Netanyahu if he was not paid 10,000 shekels (about dlrs 3,000),
Israel TV reported.
	   But the former classmate was caught by police and the
embarrassing evidence turned out to be school work books from third
grade.
	   The classmate, Shmuel Elimelech, told Israel TV that he found
the notebooks in the garbage outside Mrs. Netanyahu's childhood
home in northern Israel. He said the books had been thrown out by
new owners who found them after they moved in.
	   Elimelech admitted he called Mrs. Netanyahu and demanded the
money. Israel's Channel 2 TV said a letter was also sent to Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office.
	   A policeman posing as a representative of the first lady met
Elimelech, handed him an enveloped containing banknotes, received
the notebooks in return and arrested him.
	   After confessing, Elimelech was released on bail, and faces
charges of attempted extortion.

IOC Coordination Commission visits Athens for first time
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ An International Olympic Committee
commission Wednesday received its first progress report on the
Athens 2004 Games, and reviewed some proposed venue changes made by
Greek organizers.
	   IOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch also took the opportunity
to sign an agreement for Athens to organize a four-year Cultural
Olympiad starting in 2000.
	   ``There are indeed some changes being proposed on the location
of sports venues,'' said Jacques Rogge, president of the IOC
Coordination Committee. ``Basically a change is not a bad thing.
The changes proposed meet the requirements ... I believe the end
result will be better locations.''
	   Some of the changes include moving venues for some sports such
as baseball and equestrian events. Rowing and canoeing may also be
changed because of environmental concerns.
	   There are no major changes planned as Athens has completed more
than two-thirds of the facilities necessary to stage the Games. Key
projects _ including a new subway and a new airport _ are due for
completion by 2001.
	   Rogge and IOC General Manager Francois Carrard late Wednesday
held the first of a series of meetings with the Greek organizing
committee. They were the first meetings since Athens was awarded
the Games one year ago and announcements about the talks are
expected Friday.
	   Preparations for the Summer Games have been mired in
bureaucratic wrangling and complaints by the Greek organizing
committee of a lack of communication with government agencies and
officials.
	   On the sidelines, Samaranch signed an agreement with Greek
Culture Minister Evangelos Venizelos and a UNESCO representative to
set up a foundation to organize the Cultural Olympiad.
	   Proposed by Venizelos to UNESCO last October and accepted by all
member countries, the Cultural Olympiad foundation will undertake
to organize a series of cultural events during the four years
leading up to the 2004 Games. It is not binding on any future
Olympic Games organizers.
	   Samaranch also signed a deal setting up a special space for
Greece in the Olympic Museum in Lausanne, Switzerland. It will
initially house ancient art and statues from the archeological
museum in Ancient Olympia, birthplace of the Olympic Games nearly
3,000 years ago. They were revived here in 1896.
	   After signing the deal, Samaranch said he was looking forward to
the Athens Games because they would have a third dimension beyond
sports and culture.
	   ``They can be different. There is sport and culture, But in
Athens we have a third dimension. Real Olympic history,'' Samaranch
said.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ U.S. President Bill Clinton telephoned Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday to register his
disappointment that no agreement has been concluded with the
Palestinians over the West Bank.
	   A senior U.S. official said Clinton also called Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat, who is attending a conference in South
Africa. The official offered no description of the conversation.
	   ``We're closer than we have every been before,'' the official
said of West Bank negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian
Authority.
	   The United States has urged Israel to yield 13 percent of the
territory to the Palestinians as part of a graduated pullback from
areas on the West Bank.
	   Clinton talked to Netanyahu for about 25 minutes and described
his meetings with Yeltsin, the official said. The call with Arafat
lasted 15 minutes.
	   In Israel, Netanyahu spokesman Aviv Bushinsky said in a
statement: ``The president said he intends to take steps to speed
up the talks with the Palestinians, as soon as he gets back from
Russia.'' Clinton was in Moscow for a two-day summit with Russian
President Boris Yeltsin.
	   ``I think President Clinton is disappointed that there is no
agreement, and so is the prime minister,'' Bushinsky said. ``This
does not imply that the president was criticizing the prime
minister or putting the blame on Israel. The prime minister was
very satisfied with the conversation.''

Chang is unseeded but healthy and happy

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Wrap Michael Chang's tennis season in some
bandages and heavy gauze and just hope nothing else bad happens to
him.
	   It has been one injury after another for Chang, who finished
last year ranked third in the world after reaching the semifinals
at the U.S. Open. This year, he is unseeded and all but forgotten
in a season more noted for his wounds than wins.
	   Still, Chang is in the Open in an upbeat mood after ending a
13-month winless streak a week ago in Boston. And Wednesday's 6-1,
6-3, 6-1 victory over Eyal Erlich did nothing to diminish his
enthusiasm.
	   ``Boston obviously helped quite a bit,'' he said. ``It was nice
to be able to finally win a tournament. It has been a while and
that does good things for your confidence. I feel like my
capability and stuff as far as beating the best players hasn't
changed.''
	   Erlich doesn't fit that description. This was only his second
Grand Slam tournament and only the 18th tour-level match of his
career. Chang beat him in only 88 minutes.
	   It hardly qualified as a major test but it will do for starters
for Chang, who never has fulfilled the promise he displayed when he
won the French Open as a 17-year-old in 1989. That is his only
Grand Slam victory. Can he make the Open his second?
	   ``Sure,'' he said, ``Why not?''
	   Past failures might be one reason. Chang, however, refuses to
let them interfere.
	   ``I think I could look back through the past few years, looking
at missed opportunities and things like that,'' he said. ``But one
thing I have learned is not to dwell on missed chances or missed
opportunities or times where you have failed.
	   ``What is important is to be able to pick yourself back up and
try again.''
	   So Chang is trying despite his string of injuries, some major,
some minor, all disruptive. He prefers a positive attitude.
	   ``I am still left in the draw,'' he said. That puts him ahead of
64 first-round losers.
	   ``I feel like I have as good a shot a anybody and I have gotten
close in the past, so why not have the attitude that I can come out
and play great tennis and maybe even win the tournament,'' Chang
said.
	   That would be a huge accomplishment in Chang's season of aches
and pains that started early. Ask him about his injuries and he
wonders if there's enough time to list them all.
	   ``I have had two major injuries and I have had some smaller
injuries,'' Chang said. ``I strained a stomach muscle just prior to
the Australian Open. I had a bruised foot at the end of the
tournament in Memphis.''
	   Then at Indian Wells, Chang was practicing with Andrei Medvedev
when the sprinklers suddenly started watering the adjacent clay
court. The mist drifted Chang's way and he slipped, tearing his
left knee.
	   As he worked his way back from a 25 percent tear in his medial
collateral ligament, Chang altered his backhand and the change
caused tendinitis to develop in his wrist.
	   ``All in all, I can look back at my career and honestly say I
have been pretty injury-free,'' he said. ``They have come in
bunches, but I feel like I'm doing good. I am here at the U.S.
Open. I am in the second round. We will keep it going.''

Cuban exiles plead innocent to Castro assassination plot
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHRIS HAWLEY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ In a trial that could signal a thaw
in decades of U.S.-Cuban enmity, three Cuban exiles, including a
director of a key Miami-based lobby, pleaded innocent Wednesday to
charges they plotted to kill Fidel Castro.
	   They are among a group of seven exiles indicted by a federal
grand jury in San Juan in what is believed to be the first such
proceeding after years of reported assassination plots against the
Cuban dictator. The others pleaded innocent last week.
	   Bail was set at dlrs 100,000 for Jose Antonio Llama, 68, a
director of the influential, Miami-based Cuban American National
Foundation, and dlrs 75,000 each for Jose Rodriguez, 59, and
Alfredo Domingo Otero, 68.
	   Attorneys for the other four _ Angel Manuel Alfonso, 58, Angel
Hernandez Rojo, 64, Juan Bautista Marquez, 62, and Francisco
Secundino Cordova, 51 _ have condemned the charges as hypocritical
given past alleged U.S.-sponsored attempts on Castro's life.
	   But Llama's lawyer Jose Antonio Pagan said they ``have not made
a decision on whether we're going to follow that line'' also.
	   Llama told reporters: ``I am going to cooperate in everything.''
	   For Cubans who fled Castro's 1959 revolution, the trial is a
bitter pill _ especially at a time when the man they revile is
being embraced by his Caribbean neighbors and many countries are
challenging the 37-year U.S.-led economic boycott of Cuba.
	   Some observers believe the case might reflect a desire by the
Clinton Administration to back away from the demonization and
isolation of Castro.
	   ``If this were Ronald Reagan or George Bush, they'd be giving
these people a freedom medal,'' said Juan Masimi Soler, lawyer for
Bautista Marquez.
	   Asked last week whether the indictments represented a change in
U.S. policy toward Cuba, Attorney General Janet Reno said she was
not aware of any change.
	   It could be months before the case comes to trial. The FBI said
more arrests and indictments were expected.
	   The case stems from the arrest of the four men off Puerto Rico
on Oct. 27 after a search of their yacht revealed weapons that
included two .50-caliber assault rifles.
	   Alfonso, who like the others initially denied there were weapons
aboard, said he alone was responsible for the guns. According to an
initial complaint, he admitted planning to use them to kill Castro
at a November summit of Latin American leaders in Venezuela.
	   Llama has admitted that he owns the 46-foot yacht. He is accused
of providing one of the two rifles. That rifle is registered to
Francisco ``Pepe'' Hernandez, the exile group's president.
Hernandez was questioned by the FBI but has not been indicted.
	   Llama's indictment was a blow to the Cuban American National
Foundation, which is widely credited with the U.S. hard line on
Cuba. Castro has accused the foundation of plotting to kill him,
but it professes a commitment to peaceful persuasion.
	   ``We don't know why they are accusing him of those things,''
said son Jose L. Llama. ``Here's a country that for years has been
fighting communism and now it's going to protect (Castro) or at
least try to socialize him,'' he added.

Seles no longer treating tennis as catharsis
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with additional results; CHANGES byline &QL; 
 &UR; By ROB GLOSTER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Monica Seles no longer wears her father's ring
on a chain around her neck, and her all-black outfit was replaced
by white on a hazy summer afternoon at the U.S. Open.
	   Though she still mourns, Seles has stopped treating tennis as a
catharsis as she deals with her father's death. It is back to being
simply a game, albeit a game at which she once was the best in the
world.
	   It was an easy game for her Wednesday, as the sixth-seeded Seles
reached the third round with a 6-2, 6-3 win over Joannette Kruger.
	   Seles was on an emotional roller-coaster when she reached the
French Open final in June, less than a month after being at her
father's side when he died May 14. She wore his ring on a necklace,
and said playing was her solace amid sadness.
	   ``I think it was different (in Paris) because it was so soon
after my dad's death and because I had so many raw emotions,'' she
said Wednesday. ``Now I definitely step on the court and think more
about the ball.''
	   Seles' coach, Gavin Hopper, said she's no longer relying on
tennis to forget about her troubles.
	   ``I think that's past,'' Hopper said. ``She's putting a lot of
things behind her and a lot of her energy's going back into pure
perfection, and we're still a way off that. Once the first couple
of months are gone, now we're into the day-to-day grind of getting
better.''
	   While Seles is back to focusing on tennis, Petr Korda had his
mind elsewhere as he lost his first-round match to qualifier Bernd
Karbacher, ranked No. 155 in the world.
	   The fourth-seeded Korda, whose wife had their second daughter in
late July but has been home only five days since the birth, lost
2-6, 6-3, 6-2, 6-1 and said he was mentally exhausted.
	   ``I need to leave the game of tennis for a while and spend some
time with the family,'' said Korda, who won the Australian Open
this year for his first Grand Slam title.
	   Top-seeded Pete Sampras, seeking to tie Roy Emerson's record of
12 Grand Slam singles titles, was scheduled to play Wednesday
night, as was women's No. 1 seed Martina Hingis.
	   Men's No. 2 Marcelo Rios and No. 11 Yevgeny Kafelnikov reached
the second round with straight-sets victories.
	   Steffi Graf, a five-time U.S. Open winner who missed the
tournament last year while recovering from knee surgery, needed
only 41 minutes to win her second-round match and move within two
victories of surpassing Martina Navratilova as the women's career
leader in prize money.
	   Other women joining Seles and the eighth-seeded Graf in the
third round were No. 3 Jana Novotna, No. 9 Irina Spirlea, No. 11
Patty Schnyder, No. 14 Dominique Van Roost and Serena Williams, who
did not seem bothered by a heavily bandaged right thigh in a 6-2,
6-1 victory over a qualifier.
	   No. 16 Ai Sugiyama became the first seeded woman to exit the
tournament, withdrawing midway through the opening set of her match
Wednesday with a sprained left ankle.
	   Spirlea and Williams will meet in the third round. Last year at
the U.S. Open, Spirlea collided with Venus Williams, Serena's older
sister, during a changeover in their match.
	   That led Richard Williams, the father of Venus and Serena, to
call Spirlea a ``big, tall, white turkey'' and warn, ``She ought to
be glad it wasn't Serena she bumped into. She would have been
decked.''

Romania beats Liechtenstein 7-0 in Euro qualification
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Romania easily defeated a modest
Liechtenstein team 7-0 Wednesday in its opening qualifier for
European soccer Championship in 2000.
	   The Romanians, under the direction of new coach Victor Piturca,
played a relaxed game against the mostly amateur team from
Liechtenstein.
	   Gica Popescu, who plays for Galatasaray Istambul opened the
scoring in the 18th minute when he headed into the net a ball from
just few meters (yards).
	   The Romanians continued a game dominated by the brilliant
tactics of star player, Bucharest Valencia's Adrian ``Cobra'' Ilie.
	   Ilie scored three times in the 32nd, 45th and 51st minutes.
	   His second goal was a wonderful shot from the left corner of the
penalty area that hit the net in the upper right corner leaving
Liechtenstein goalie Martin Oehri speechless.
	   Catalin Munteanu, who plays for Spain's Salamanca, scored
another goal in the 30th minute and Moldovan Fenerbahce's Viorel
scored in the 54th. Five minutes later, Liechtenstein's Modestus
Haas hit his own net trying for a rebound.
	   Romania and Liechtenstein play in qualification Group 7,
together with Adzerbaidjan, Portugal, Hungary and Slovakia.
	    &UR; Lineups:
	   Roma Bogdan Stelea, Dan Petrescu, Cosmin Contra, Florin Batranu,
Costel Galca, Gica Popescu, Florentin Petre, Dorinel Munteanu,

Women's tour, star square off over lack of a logo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LARRY SIDDONS &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ What's a uniform logo patch worth? The lack of
one could cost Venus Williams more than dlrs 25,000.
	   Williams was fined dlrs 100 when she showed up for her
first-round match at the U.S. Open without wearing the required WTA
patch.
	   Bartlett McGuire, CEO of the women's tour, said the 18-year-old
had been warned about not wearing the patch at the Lipton
Championships last March, but was not fined then.
	   A third offense would cost dlrs 300. Then the fine jumps
dramatically _ to dlrs 25,000 for each violation after that.
	   ``It's a major part of our sponsorship program,'' McGuire said.
The patch carries the name of Corel, the software company that is
the tour's title sponsor.
	   Although most players wear the patch on their chest or shoulder,
McGuire said Williams, one of the emerging stars of women's tennis,
had other options _ including her trademark headgear.
	   ``She can wear it on her hip, on her leg _ she can wear it on
her beads,'' he said.
	   Williams brought seven outfits to the Open, all designed by
Reebok, which said in a statement that it was willing to
``accommodate the WTA'' by having Williams carry towels, water
bottles or other objects with the WTA logo.
	   The sportswear company was adamant, however, that forcing
Williams to wear the patch ``would represent a breach of Reebok's
contract with Venus.''
	   The patch _ about 2 inches (5 cms) square _ is required on
virtually all women's uniforms. The only exception is for players
under contract to Nike, which has a no-patch policy for its
athletes that predates the WTA rule and was given a special
exemption, the association said.
	   Williams' father, Richard, thinks the same rule should apply to
Reebok players, like his oldest daughter, and threatened court
action.
	   ``It's more than unfair,'' Williams said. ``If Nike people can
do it, we should be allowed to do it.''
	   Reebok said the rule was ``arbitrarily enforced, wit selected
players not being required to wear the patch.''
	   That defiance apparently didn't extend to the younger Williams
daughter.
	   Serena Williams, Venus' 16-year-old sister, wore a WTA patch on
her Puma outfit Wednesday in a 6-2, 6-1 victory over Pavlina
Stoyanova.
	   ``She put it on as soon as one was brought out to her,'' McGuire
said.
	   ``I wear it,'' Serena said. ``I think everyone has to make their
own choices.''

Man who says Tyson kicked him files assault charge
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DENISE CABRERA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ A man who says he was kicked in the groin by
Mike Tyson following a minor traffic accident filed an assault
charge Wednesday against the former heavyweight boxing champion.
	   Richard Hardick, 50, says Tyson kicked him after his car
rear-ended a Mercedes driven by Tyson's wife, Monica, on Monday.
Hardick said his car was forced into Tyson's car after it was
rear-ended by a third vehicle.
	   The complaint charges misdemeanor second-degree assault, said
Michael Johnson, administrative commissioner for the District Court
of Montgomery County, Md. Hardick said Tyson also punched the
driver of the other car.
	   ``I did not kick anyone. I did not punch anyone,'' Tyson said in
a statement released through his lawyer, John G. Branca.
	   ``My wife and I were the victims of a traffic accident. I am
distressed by these false allegations. I did not touch anyone,'' he
said.
	   His wife backed up his story, saying: ``Mike did not punch, kick
or touch anyone at any time.''
	   In the complaint, Hardick said he was talking to the driver of
the third car about the accident when he saw Tyson punch the
driver. Tyson's wife and another man _ a Tyson bodyguard, witnesses
told police _ were trying to restrain the boxer, he said.
	   ``Despite being restrained, Mr. Tyson hit the man in the face,''
Hardick said. Fearing for his own safety, Hardick said he returned
to his car and locked it, but subsequently rolled down his window
to talk with the man who had earlier tried to restrain Tyson.
	   ``I then thought that Mr. Tyson had calmed down and we could
proceed with the exchange of information,'' Hardick said in the
complaint, explaining why he got out of his car a second time.
	   Tyson was being restrained again, but managed to kick Hardick in
the groin, he said.
	   The boxer left the scene but later was pulled over by police,
who had received calls from witnesses. Tyson, 32, was not
originally charged because there was no evidence of serious injury.
	   Officers usually don't file charges in misdemeanor assaults that
they do not witness, said Derek Baliles, a spokesman for Montgomery
County police.
	   Tyson and his wife declined to give officers a statement Monday,
providing ``only personal information,'' police said.
	   A preliminary hearing on the assault charge has been set for
Oct. 2. If convicted, Tyson faces 10 years in jail and-or a dlrs
2,500 fine.
	   In Indianapolis, Marion Superior Court Judge Patricia Gifford,
who sentenced Tyson following his rape conviction, said Tuesday she
expected probation officials would review the Maryland incident.
	   Tyson is due to released from court supervision in March.
	   He served three years in an Indiana prison for rape, and a
lawsuit is pending in Montgomery County in which two women contend
Tyson yelled slurs at them and flipped a table over in a Washington
restaurant in March.
	   Last year, Tyson lost his license to box and was fined $3
million after he bit Evander Holyfield's ears in a title bout. He
is scheduled to appear before the Nevada Athletic Commission Sept.
19 seeking a new license. Commission members have said they will
want an explanation of the events surrounding Monday's accident.

Hoch will be hard-pressed to match last year's drama
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROBERT IMRIE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MILWAUKEE (AP) _ A year ago, Scott Hoch chipped in from 60 yards
(55 meters) for an eagle on the final hole to win the Greater
Milwaukee Open by one stroke.
	   It will be hard to match that drama when he begins his quest
Thursday for a third title in four years, but he thinks he has an
edge.
	   ``The success I've had here makes me look forward to coming,''
he said Wednesday. ``Once you keep playing a course well over and
over, it's probably a two-stroke advantage. I have putted well here
and have read greens well.''
	   Hoch's eagle gave him the victory over Loren Roberts and David
Sutherland. Hoch, also the 1995 winner, closed with a 6-under 66
for a 16-under 268 total.
	   The field for the tournament at the Brown Deer Park Golf Course
also includes Roberts, who won in 1996, Sutherland, PGA champion
Vijay Singh and Mark Calcavecchia, who is playing in his 18th
consecutive Greater Milwaukee Open but has yet to win.
	   Hoch is seeking his first tournament win this year. He ranks
ninth on the PGA money list, having won dlrs 1.13 million in 22
tournaments.
	   Steve Stricker of Edgerton, Wisconsin is the sentimental
favorite.
	   Stricker, who finished second to Singh in the PGA championship,
became a father for the first time Monday. His daughter, Bobbie
Jean, was born at St. Mary's Hospital in Madison, only 70 miles
(112 kilometers) away.
	   Stricker, 18th on the money list at dlrs 972,881, withdrew from
Wednesday's Pro-Am tournament.
	   Calcavecchia said Stricker would come to the tournament on
``cloud nine. Having a baby girl, there is nothing that beats it.
There is nothing he is going to get upset about this week.''
	   ``All of us are excited for him that his game is back and this
is his hometown, a new kid ... He has got to be a happy guy,''
Calcavecchia said.
	   Hoch said the keys to the 6,739-yard (6,133-meter) course are
driving well and staying in the fairways.
	   ``Whoever hits it long has an advantage,'' he said. ``If they
hit it straight, they have a big advantage.''
	   Hoch has been struggling with his putting and chipping, and
picked Singh as the favorite. ``He's not the mold for this course,
but he hits it long,'' Hoch said.
	   Making his first appearance in the Greater Milwaukee Open, Singh
said his confidence was soaring after the PGA win. ``Winning a
major lifts your confidence so high that you feel you can win every
time you tee it up,'' he said.
	   Singh likes the Brown Deer course and its big, undulating
greens. ``You can have fast, almost impossible putts if you are on
the wrong side of the hole,'' he said. ``I am surprised not too
many players come to play here because the golf course is so
nice.''
	   Calcavecchia, who is 19th on the money list with one victory,
hopes to break out of a long putting slump.
	   ``I have always enjoyed coming here,'' he said. ``I have been
trying to win this tournament for a long time. The GMO was the
first tournament I played in on the tour.''
	   Calcavecchia, who finished second in 1988 and 1993, expects a
crowded field atop the leader board, given the Brown Deer layout.
	   ``There's plenty of birdies for everybody,'' Calcavecchia said.
``That is why it has been a fairly tight event every year.''
	   But Singh's long drives give him an advantage, Calcavecchia
said.

Three Brazilian soccer players reportedly fail doping tests
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ Three Brazilian soccer players
will go before a tribunal accused of taking performance-enhancing
drugs, sports officials said Wednesday.
	   Gil Baiano, Luciano Viana and Marcos Alberto all failed doping
tests after national league games last month, said Ana Lucia
Rangel, spokeswoman for the Brazilian Soccer Federation.
	   Baiano, who played for Brazil's national team in 1990, and Viana
play for First Division side Parana. Alberto plays for Second
Division team Americano de Campos.

Cubs down Reds as Sosa homers again
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: NEW with Wednesday's early game; will be updated &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Sammy Sosa played catchup but couldn't overtake
Mark McGwire in the home run race. Still, the Chicago Cubs kept
winning.
	   Sosa hit his 56th homer to tie Hack Wilson's 68-year-old club
record and Gary Gaetti hit a two-run homer Wednesday in the eighth
inning to send Chicago to a 4-2 victory over the Cincinnati Reds.
	   Wilson set what had been the National League record with 56
homers in 1930 before McGwire connected twice Tuesday night against
Florida to give him 57.
	   McGwire and the Cardinals played again in Miami on Wednesday
night.
	   Sosa, leading off the bottom of the sixth, hit an 0-1 pitch from
Cincinnati's Jason Bere into the first row of the right field
bleachers. Sosa had gone eight at-bats without a homer prior to
connecting.
	   Sosa's homer gave the Cubs a 1-0 lead and charged the crowd.
Fans chanted for a curtain call and as usual he gave them what they
wanted.
 &UR; Giants 12, Expos 3
	   In San Francisco, Barry Bonds hit his fourth home run in four
games and Jeff Kent had two doubles and four RBIs as the Giants
beat the Montreal Expos.
	   Bonds' 32nd home run of the season, a three-run shot into the
upper-deck in right field off reliever Shayne Bennett made it 12-2
in the fifth inning. Bonds, who went 3-for-3 also had an RBI single
in the second inning.
	   Kirk Rueter (14-9) gave up two runs and five hits in 5 1-3
innings to pick up the win, keeping the Giants two games behind
Chicago in the National League wild-card race.

Goldwire, Bowen opt to play overseas
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DENVER (AP) _ Unsure of their immediate future in the National
Basketball Association, point guard Anthony Goldwire and rookie
forward Ryan Bowen have decided to take their games overseas.
	   Goldwire, who started 32 games for the Denver Nuggets last
season, has signed a contract to play with Olympiakos in Greece,
and Bowen recently finished training camp with Oyak Renault in
Turkey.
	   ``Anthony's dream is to play in the NBA and be successful in the
NBA, but he's also realistic,'' Goldwire's agent, Mitch Frankel,
said.
	   Goldwire is a free agent, and his chances of re-signing with the
Nuggets were slim because of the offseason trade for all-star point
guard Nick Van Exel.
	   Bowen, Denver's second-round pick in the June draft, did not get
a chance to participate in the NBA's summer rookie camp because of
the continuing lockout. The camp gives coaches and players a chance
to gauge whether on-the-bubble rookies can win a spot on an NBA
roster.
	   The Nuggets will retain Bowen's NBA rights after he finishes his
one-year contract in Turkey.

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan ended all charter flights to and from North
Korea Wednesday in retaliation for the communist country's firing
of a missile over Japan and into the Pacific Ocean.
	   The decision affects nine cargo flights from North Korea to
Japan and 14 other flights that were still up for approval, said
Transport Ministry official Eiichiro Oishi.
	   Tokyo has already decided to drop further talks to establish
diplomatic ties with North Korea to protest Monday's test launch.
It has ruled out additional food aid and suspended work on an
international project to build nuclear reactors there.
	   ``We must make North Korea understand that this kind of action
will be costly,'' Foreign Minister Masahiko Komura said.
	   Japan also plans to file a protest in the United Nations, both
in the Security Council and the General Assembly, officials said.
	   Also Wednesday, North Korea commented on the missile for the
first time.
	   ``We bitterly denounce Japan for making a fuss over the matter
that belongs to our sovereignty while being unaware of its
background,'' the North's official Korean Central News Agency said.
``Japan's behavior is ridiculous.''
	   That elicited a strong reaction from Japan, with Chief Cabinet
Secretary Hiromu Nonaka reportedly calling it unacceptable.
	   ``We refuse to accept such remarks from a country that
completely ignored international rules and shot missiles that flew
over another nation,'' Nonaka, the government spokesman, was quoted
as saying by the Yomiuri newspaper.
	   The missile launch, which has shaken Japan and heightened fears
about Asian security, has also brought the Japanese government
under scrutiny for what some see as an overly slow, fumbling
response to crisis.
	   The Defense Agency acknowledged Wednesday that it waited more
than eight hours before disclosing to the public that the missile
had landed not in the Sea of Japan, as initially reported, but in
the Pacific Ocean, just some 500 kilometers (300 miles) off the
eastern coast of Japan.
	   The first news of the missile came from the U.S. military at
about noon (0300 GMT) Monday. Japan, which has no independent
missile-monitoring system, did not know about the firing until it
received word from U.S. forces.
	   The original report said the missile _ believed to be a test of
the new Taepo Dong 1 missile _ had landed in the Sea of Japan,
about midway between Russia and the western coast of Japan.
	   Three hours later, the Defense Agency learned from the U.S.
military and its own forces that the missile had landed in the
Pacific, said agency spokesman Tatsuhiko Fukui. But it waited until
after 11 p.m. (1400 GMT) to hold a news conference to announce
that.
	   The fact that the missile had landed in the Pacific was critical
because it proved North Korea has the capability to strike any part
of Japan, including U.S. bases that house some 50,000 troops.
	   When North Korea fired its last missile five years ago, it
reached only as far as the Sea of Japan.
	   Fukui, the agency official, said Monday's missile appeared to be
two-stage, with the booster, or first stage, falling into the Sea
of Japan. The second stage landed in the Pacific, with the warhead
falling nearby, he said.
	   ``We did not want to unnecessarily fan the fears of the public.
We wanted to wait on the announcement until we were more certain of
the facts,'' Fukui said. ``We do not think we were too slow. We
don't want to cry wolf.''
	   But others were more critical.
	   ``Crisis management gets nowhere,'' said the headline of
Wednesday's national Mainichi newspaper. TBS TV commentator Tetsuya
Chikushi accused the government of taking a condescending view
toward ordinary people and withholding information.
	   ``Nothing is working to respond to the crisis. I don't feel
safe,'' said Kazunobu Imura, a 46-year-old owner of a health food
store.
	   ``The system doesn't seem to be functioning,'' said Takashi
Suzuki, a 32-year-old temporary worker. ``We want to know more.''
	   Charges of shoddy crisis management are not new to Tokyo. Japan
came under fire for moving too slowly after the 1995 Kobe
earthquake that killed more than 6,000 people.
	   More recently, it has been labeled a procrastinator in
implementing economic reforms to wrest the nation out of a
recession.
	   The Defense Agency gave up its search for fallen missile parts
late Wednesday. Three military ships and two planes were sent early
Tuesday to the Pacific and one ship to the Sea of Japan to try to
find pieces of the missile.
	   In Moscow, Russian officials said they had asked Pyongyang for
an explanation of the missile-firing.
	   ``It is our principled stance that we want a normal, neighborly
relationship with North Korea,'' Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman
Vladimir Rakhmanin told the Interfax news agency on Wednesday.

FDA recommends two breast cancer drugs
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with U.S. government advisers recommending sale of
drug &QL; 
 &UR; By LAURAN NEERGAARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Medical Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BETHESDA, Maryland (AP) _ The first in a wave of gene-based
attacks on cancer took a major step forward Wednesday as U.S.
government scientists recommended that the drug, Herceptin, be sold
to fight advanced breast cancer.
	   Herceptin does not cure breast cancer. But for some 30 percent
of patients whose tumors are fueled by a bad gene, it offers a
chance at living a little longer after the cancer has spread
through a woman's body, scientific advisers to the Food and Drug
Administration concluded.
	   In a second potentially critical advance against breast cancer
on Wednesday, the FDA's advisers said another drug, tamoxifen, may
reduce the chances that certain healthy women will get the disease
later in life. But the panelists stressed that the FDA should
approve tamoxifen only for women considered at high risk of
developing breast cancer, because it also can cause
life-threatening side effects.
	   The FDA is scheduled to make final decisions on both drugs by
November. It is not bound by advisory panel recommendations, but
typically follows them.

	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ The Irish Republican Army took
a step closer towards disarming, and the British and Irish
governments to imprisoning IRA dissidents, as peacemaking momentum
mounted Wednesday on the eve of President Clinton's visit.
	   Ending months of delay, the IRA-allied Sinn Fein party announced
that Martin McGuinness _ its senior negotiator and the IRA's
reputed former chief _ would work with the Canadian-led commission
tasked with disarming paramilitary groups under terms of the
Belfast peace accord.
	   In London and Dublin, the British and Irish governments welcomed
Sinn Fein's move as they convened emergency sessions of lawmakers
to push through laws designed to imprison IRA dissidents who oppose
April's compromise deal on how Northern Ireland should be governed.
	   British Prime Minister Tony Blair faced stronger-than-expected
criticism from a vociferous minority of lawmakers _ including 16
from his own dominant Labor Party _ over his determination to see
his Terrorism and Conspiracy Bill pass through both houses of
Parliament by Thursday night.
	   Most of his critics said they supported the proposed crackdown
but thought Parliament deserved more time to consider amendments to
the bill, which would restrict the right to silence for suspected
IRA dissidents and give greater weight in court to police claims
that people were members of the splinter group.
	   In Dublin, Prime Minister Bertie Ahern enjoyed near-total unity
as he condemned the IRA dissidents responsible for the Aug. 15 car
bombing of Omagh, an attack that killed 28 civilians. Lawmakers in
the key lower house of parliament passed his bill without a formal
tally of votes after a verbal call showed the bill had overwhelming
support. It will now be sent for certain approval Thursday to the
upper house, the Seanad.

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister
Anwar Ibrahim was sacked on after months of economic policy
differences with the prime minister.
	   A three-paragraph statement issued Wednesday by the prime
minister's department said Anwar had been removed from all
positions, including that of finance minister.
	   Anwar's firing came after weeks of rumors about his being sacked
or quitting, speculation that was always followed by emphatic
denials.
	   Dozens of Anwar supporters flocked to his residence Wednesday
night, pushing through a horde of reporters who had been camped
outside all afternoon. Some said that Anwar's defense would be made
public Thursday and that he had evidence to prove that he was being
falsely accused.
	   Three truckloads of riot police were posted around the nearby
residence of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, apparently to prevent
protests by Anwar supporters.
	   There were unconfirmed reports that Anwar was under house arrest
or facing imminent arrest on unspecified criminal charges. A lawyer
representing him in a libel case was seen entering the house.
	   But Malaysia's police chief, Rahim Noor, denied that Anwar was
under house arrest. He was, however, being investigated on charges
contained in a book that has widespread allegations about sexual
misconduct, police said.
	   ``He didn't want to resign, so he was sacked,'' said a close
aide to Mahathir. The aide, who asked not to be identified, said
Anwar's successor had not yet been chosen.
	   The aide said the Supreme Council of the ruling United Malays
National Organization would meet Thursday to discuss Anwar's
position in the party. Anwar is UMNO vice president.
	   A man who came from Anwar's house to talk to reporters
identified himself only as a ``long-time friend.'' He said Anwar
was not under house arrest.
	   ``He's steady, strong and full of spirit,'' said the man, adding
that several hundred supporters had come to the house.
	   ``He wants everybody to stay calm and not to do anything to
jeopardize the nation.''
	   Lim Kit Siang, the opposition leader in Parliament, said the
move would push the Southeast Asian country into further chaos
during the regional economic crisis.
	   ``The sacking of the deputy prime minister will plunge the
country into an unprecedented political crisis and turmoil,'' said
Lim. ``Unless Dr. Mahathir can convincingly establish the
legitimacy of the drastic action.''
	   The 51-year-old Anwar, for years seen as Mahathir's successor,
had been left out of economic decisions for months after differing
with his boss on the course for economic recovery.
	   Malaysia's currency, the ringgit, and the markets have plummeted
since the Asian economic crisis broke out in July 1997. The
country's economy, which boasted 8 percent growth for the last
decade, formally went into recession last week after its economy
shrank another 6.8 percent.
	   Anwar and the central bank had preferred high interest rates and
austerity measures to control Malaysia's sliding currency. Mahathir
and his chief economic aide, Daim Zainuddin, have pushed through a
policy of greater government spending and lower rates to boost the
economy.
	   Although Mahathir has never openly blamed his finance minister
for the economic mess, he openly said the tight monetary policies
of the central bank were not going to deliver recovery.
	   When Bank Negara governor Ahmad Mohamed Don and his deputy, Fong
Weng Phak, quit last week in opposition to Mahathir's plans to fix
the ringgit at 3.8 to the U.S. dollar, the writing was on the wall
for Anwar.
	   On Tuesday, when Mahathir and central bank officials announced
sweeping currency exchange controls, Anwar was nowhere to be seen.
	   Mahathir has been consolidating his hold on power for months,
first naming Daim as his chief economic aide and then replacing the
chiefs of Malaysia's two largest Malay newspapers. The editors were
viewed as Anwar supporters.
	   In July, Anwar was seen as being at the forefront of a campaign
for political reform when UMNO held its annual convention.
	   Mahathir crushed the campaign against nepotism and cronyism
among the UMNO leadership by releasing a list of beneficiaries of
the affirmative action program for the majority Malay population.
Relatives of Anwar and those seen leading the attack on Mahathir
were on the list.
	   In recent weeks, Anwar also has been embarrassed by accusations
of sexual misconduct contained in a book, ``50 Reasons Why Anwar
Shouldn't Be Prime Minister.'' The authors are being tried in a
court for defamation and the trial could rake up more controversy
about Anwar's personal life.
	   Some political observers saw the book as a part of a campaign to
humiliate Anwar and push him to resign, which he reportedly
resisted for weeks.

	   The FDA advisers' other move Wednesday, on tamoxifen, is aimed
at healthy women who are at high risk of getting breast cancer
later in life. The advisers decided the drug tamoxifen may reduce
those women's risk of cancer.
	   But the panel's backing of tamoxifen was a reluctant one,
because the drug also causes serious side effects even in these
healthy women. It doubles their risk of uterine cancer, triples the
risk of a potentially deadly blood clot and increases the chances
of cataracts that hurt eyesight.
	   Complicating matters further, the FDA panel said tamoxifen's
benefit actually was small.
	   Headlines touted the drug last spring when the National Cancer
Institute announced a study found the drug could prevent 45 percent
of breast cancer cases in high-risk women. But when those numbers
were translated to real life, the FDA advisers noted that 6,600
women took tamoxifen for 3 1/2 years, but it prevented only 69
cases of cancer.
	   Doctors couldn't tell which women were most likely to get that
benefit _ nor if tamoxifen simply delayed cancer's inevitable
appearance, meaning women took big risks for just a short-term
benefit.
	   ``We don't know who to treat,'' complained panel chairman Dr.
Janice Dutcher of Montefiore Medical Center in New York.
	   She said FDA must vigorously educate doctors about tamoxifen's
risks so they will prescribe it carefully to just those women whose
high chance of breast cancer outweighs the side effect risk.

	   Ending months of delay, the IRA-allied Sinn Fein party announced

	   But the lower House of Commons voted 391-17 early Thursday in
favor of sending the bill for approval and possible amendment in
the upper House of Lords.
	   If the Lords approve it, the bill would come immediately back to
the Commons for a second decisive vote late Thursday as Clinton
travels from Belfast to the bomb-shattered town of Omagh and on to
Dublin.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Asserting an unshakable friendship with Russia but
offering only general remedies for its ailing economy, President
Bill Clinton sought Wednesday to reassert his statesman role by
cajoling President Boris Yeltsin and his political foes to find
common ground on reform. Ending a two-day summit that marked his
first venture on the world stage since his acknowledgment of an
affair with a young White House intern, Clinton assured Yeltsin he
could count on new offers of economic aid if Russia shows it will
complete its free-market reforms. (RUSSIA-SUMMIT)
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister
Anwar Ibrahim was sacked on Wednesday after months of economic
policy differences with the prime minister. A three-paragraph
statement issued by the prime minister's department said Anwar had
been removed from all positions, including that of finance
minister. Anwar's firing came after weeks of rumors about his being
sacked or quitting, speculation that was always followed by
emphatic denials. Dozens of Anwar supporters flocked to his
residence Wednesday night, pushing through a horde of reporters who
had been camped outside his house all afternoon. (MALAYSIA-ANWAR)
	   ARUSHA, Tanzania (AP) _ He painted himself as a lowly village
mayor powerless to halt the ``force of evil'' that engulfed Rwanda
in 1994. Still, prosecutors held Jean-Paul Akayesu responsible for
the slayings of 2,000 minority Tutsis who had sought his
protection. After nearly four years of work, the International
Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda rendered a verdict Wednesday, the
first of its kind by an international court: Guilty of genocide.
Guilty of crimes against humanity. Guilty of rape, murder and
torture. Akayesu winced and knotted his fingers behind his back as
chief Judge Laity Kama read out each verdict in a subdued
courtroom, where bulletproof glass shielded the defendant from the
public gallery. It was the U.N. tribunal's first conviction. His
lawyer said Akayesu, who maintained his innocence throughout his
20-month trial, would appeal. (RWANDA-GENOCIDE TRIBUNAL)
	   DURBAN, South Africa (AP) _ In a surprise appearance at the
Nonaligned Movement summit Wednesday, Congo President Laurent
Kabila criticized Rwanda and Uganda, saying they had invaded his
vast central African country. Instead of being a love fest of
leaders of developing countries, the Congo war _ which involves
troops from as many as six countries _ brought divisiveness into
the summit of 53 heads of government. Underscoring his hostility
toward mediation efforts spearheaded by South Africa, Kabila
bypassed President Nelson Mandela as he was greeting the 53 heads
of government who arrived for the summit Wednesday. Kabila then
took the podium to ask the leaders of developing nations to
``unequivocally condemn the aggression'' of Uganda and Rwanda and
request their troops' withdrawal from Congo. (NONALIGNED SUMMIT)
	   LONDON (AP) _ Police in 12 countries raided the homes of more
than 100 suspected pedophiles Wednesday in what authorities called
one of the largest efforts ever to break an Internet child
pornography ring. The British National Crime Squad coordinated the
pre-dawn raids as part of a five-month investigation into the
so-called Wonderland club, which authorities said exchanged
pornographic pictures of children as young as 2 on the Internet.
During the investigation, code-named ``Cathedral,'' police said
they found a database containing more than 100,000 pornographic
photographs of naked boys and girls and confiscated computers and
computer programs from dozens of suspects. Police said they
targeted 180 suspects and arrested more than 40 people in the
raids, which took place at 0400 GMT on three continents _ in
Australia, Austria, Belgium, Britain, Finland, France, Germany,
Italy, Norway, Portugal, Sweden and the United States.

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 0000 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Stocks fell Wednesday, faltering in late trading
after trying to shrug off August's steep selloff. The Dow
Industrials stayed well below positive territory for the year and
nearly 20 percent below its July record high. The Dow average
dropped 45.06 _ or 0.6 percent _ at 7,782.37, after climbing as
high as 7,952.56 earlier in the day. Broader indicators ended
mixed. (US-CLOSING STOCKS)
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Wall Street's rebound sent Asian and European
stocks rising Wednesday, but some analysts wondered whether the
rallies could be sustained against a gloomy outlook in many
economies. Blue chips rose on the biggest European stock markets _
London; Frankfurt, Germany; and Paris _ following gains in Tokyo,
Hong Kong and Singapore. London's Financial Times-Stock Exchange
100-share index closed with a gain of 1.3 percent, with a rise of
1.9 percent in Frankfurt's electronic Xetra DAX index and a gain of
2.3 percent in the CAC 40 index in Paris. (WORLD MARKETS)
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The dollar was mixed Wednesday, falling against
the Japanese yen but rising slightly vs. the German mark as traders
remained uncertain about whether the stock market will recover from
its recent plunge. The decline against the yen was also affected by
the devaluation of the Colombian peso, which the Colombian
government blamed on turmoil in world financial markets. Some
traders worried that the devaluation could hurt U.S. banks with
exposure in Colombia, and the move also increased nervousness about
broader Latin American markets. In late New York trading, the
dollar was quoted at 137.50 yen, down from 139.25 late Tuesday. The
U.S. currency also was changing hands at 1.7500 marks, up from
1.7493. (US-DOLLAR)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Orders to American factories jumped 1.2
percent in July, the best showing since last November, with growth
led by a rebound in demand for electronics and industrial
machinery. Orders totaled a seasonally adjusted dlrs 335.2 billion,
the Commerce Department said Wednesday. July was the second month
of recovery in factory orders from a 2.2 percent May drop that was
the biggest in three years. In June, orders rose 0.3 percent _
slightly more than originally reported. Even with the two-month
recovery, analysts say that U.S. manufacturers haven't felt the
last of the economic turmoil in Asia. Export sales are plummeting,
and imports, made cheaper by currency devaluations in Asia, are
becoming more attractive to American consumers. (US-ECONOMY)
	   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) _ Northwest Airlines laid off 27,500 more
employees Wednesday and canceled all its flights through the
upcoming Labor Day weekend because of a strike by its pilots. The
affected employees include mechanics, flight attendants, customer
service employees and other ground workers. Northwest's first
layoffs, announced Tuesday, covered 177 workers. Northwest said
more layoffs among its approximately 50,000 employees may follow.
Because of the layoffs, the airline would need eight to 10 days to
resume a full flight schedule when the strike ends, spokesman Jon
Austin said. (US-NORTHWEST STRIKE)
	   TORONTO (AP) _ Air Canada canceled all its flights for Wednesday
and Thursday after its 2,100 pilots launched the first strike in
the airline's history, demanding higher pay and better working
conditions. Further flight cancellations would be made on a
day-to-day basis, the company said. Air Canada, Canada's largest
airline, carries approximately 60,000 passengers daily. Many were
stranded at airports around the world. The strike followed a
breakdown Tuesday night in talks between the airline and pilots. No
further talks were scheduled. The airline tried to make
arrangements with 15 other airlines to take its passengers in the
event of a strike. However, many airlines were already booked solid
with late-summer travelers. (CANADA-AIR CANADA-STRIKE)
	   LONDON (AP) _ Cable and Wireless Communications PLC has formed a
dlrs 3 billion information technology partnership with IBM. As part
of the 10-year deal, 1,000 workers from Cable and Wireless will be
transferred to IBM Global Services, according to an announcement
Wednesday. IBM will hire up to another 400 people to help Cable and
Wireless use computers to operate more efficiently and to better
serve its customers. The Cable and Wireless chief executive, Graham
Wallace, said that by teaming up with IBM, his company can improve
its operations ``much more quickly and effectively.''

singer Ian Gillan, German artist Wolfgang Schwarzenfeld,
Jean-Claude Van Damme. Some items may have moved as separates. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Three years after Prince William signed the
historic entrance book at Eton College, his little brother, Prince
Harry, headed for the elite boarding school.
	   The 13-year-old traveled with his father Wednesday to Eton, a
dlrs 24,000-a-year school that has been favored by the upper class
for centuries. It is just across the River Thames from Windsor
Castle, the weekend home for the princes' grandmother, Queen
Elizabeth II.
	   While William had both parents with him when he enrolled,
red-haired Harry, who is said to be easy-going and not too
academically inclined, came only with his father. His mother,
Princess Diana, died in a car crash a year ago Monday.
	   William was expected to leave for school late Wednesday.
	   ___
	   PONTIAC, Michigan (AP) _ Deep Purple singer Ian Gillan may be
making an encore appearance here in court.
	   Gillan was charged Tuesday with assault and battery for
allegedly hitting a security guard in the head with a microphone
during a concert Aug. 15 at Pine Knob.
	   The guard, Michael Kennedy, was trying to move an unruly fan
from near the stage. He suffered a small cut.
	   ``I've seen everything at Pine Knob, but I've never seen it
where the lead singer bends over and hits someone,'' sheriff's
Detective Dirk Feneley said.
	   ___
	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ Responding to protests from Indians
and ecologists, a German artist says he will return a 30-ton rock
he took from a pristine national park.
	   Wolfgang Schwarzenfeld wanted to include the rock in a Berlin
exhibit of stones from around the world. But it was taken from
Canaima National Park, home of the world's highest waterfall and
mysterious flat-topped mountains that help inspired Sir Arthur
Conan Doyle's classic adventure story, ``The Lost World.''
	   Schwarzenfeld decided to return the rock after protesters tried
to block a truck that was carrying it out of the park, German
Embassy spokesman Derk Schulz said Wednesday. The rock is still in
Venezuela and Schwarzenfeld said it will be returned to its
original site.
	   There have been conflicting reports about the rock's
composition. Ecologists say it is semi-precious jasper, but
officials say it's less valuable red sandstone. Authorities had
granted Schwarzenfeld permission to take it.
	   ___
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Now that Jean-Claude Van Damme's demons are
under control, he's got his eye on putting his career back on track
in a big way.
	   His action thriller ``Knockoff'' will open Friday. His period
action movie ``Legionnaire'' is due out soon, and then there's Van
Damme's romantic action movie ``Inferno.''
	   Van Damme, 37, admits he's haunted by his self-destructive
battle with cocaine, which he talks about in the Sept. 4
Entertainment Weekly. He says that after a brush with death, he
quit ``cold turkey.''
	   He's also taking medicine for diagnosed manic-depression. ``I
don't feel the change (on medication) ... but I see the difference
in me in the people around me,'' says Van Damme.
	   And with three new movies under his belt, Van Damme says he's
ready to make good again. He'd like to try his hand at directing a
more artful epic: ``I know I can do it,'' he says.
	   Of his last few years, which included his downward spiral after
he started using cocaine in 1993 while filming ``Sudden Death,''
Van Damme says: ``When you dig a big hole and come out of it,
you're moving lots of dirt, you know?''

Hundreds of coca leaf farmers reach La Paz after crossing the Andes

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LA PAZ, Bolivia (AP) _ Hundreds of farmers crossed the Andes
from the country's coca leaf producing region and reached La Paz on
Wednesday to protest against government eradication of illegal coca
fields.
	   Farmers marched through the center of La Paz carrying colorful
banners and shouting anti-government slogans. Some set off dynamite
caps that exploded with a bang but caused no damage.
	   Interior Minister Guido Nayar said the march was funded and
supported by cocaine traffickers, a charge coca farmers deny.
	   The farmers said they wanted to meet President Hugo Banzer, but
he refused, saying he will not stop the eradication. Coca producers
say they will start a hunger strike if their demands, including the
removal of soldiers from the coca producing region of Chapare, are
not met.
	   Farmers, including women and some children, started out three
weeks ago from Villa Tunari, a town 780 kms (484 miles) from La Paz
and on the edge of Chapare.
	   March organizers say they expected thousands of farmers along
the way to join the march, but only around 300 farmers made it to
La Paz. Several hundred workers, university students and coca leaf
farmers from the Yungas region 160 kms (99 miles) east of La Paz
joined the march in the last couple of days.
	   Evo Morales, the charismatic leader of the Coca Growers
Federation, accused the government of repressing farmers and not
the real traffickers. ``We cultivate coca because we have no other
source for our survival,'' he said.
	   But interior minister Nayar said the farmers had no right to
oppose the implementation of laws. ``Coca plants that feed the
cocaine industry must be destroyed,'' he said.
	   He accused farmers of not only growing the raw material for
cocaine but also of processing the leaves into cocaine paste.
	   President Hugo Banzer has vowed to stop cocaine production in
Bolivia within five years and destroy all illegal coca plantations.
	   At least 150,000 farmers depend on coca leaf cultivation for
their livelihood.
	   The government eradicated 6,000 hectares (14,800 acres) of coca
this year to comply with Bolivian law and an agreement with the
United States Government.
	   An estimated 40,000 hectares (98,840 acres) of coca are grown in
the Chapare and feed the thriving cocaine industry.
	   The Bolivian Government is paying farmers 2,500 dollars per
hectare of coca plants destroyed voluntarily by farmers. New coca
fields are considered illegal and destroyed without compensation.
	   Coca leaf is grown in the Andean foothills of Bolivia and Peru.
Most of it is processed into cocaine. Coca leaf has been used for
centuries in Andean countries as a tea and for medicinal and
religious purposes.

	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ The Irish Republican Army took
a step closer towards disarming, and the British and Irish
governments to imprisoning IRA dissidents, as peacemaking momentum
mounted Wednesday on the eve of President Clinton's visit.
	   Ending months of delay, the IRA-allied Sinn Fein party announced
that Martin McGuinness _ its senior negotiator and the IRA's
reputed former chief _ would work with the Canadian-led commission
tasked with disarming paramilitary groups under terms of the
Belfast peace accord.
	   In London and Dublin, the British and Irish governments welcomed
Sinn Fein's move as they convened emergency sessions of lawmakers
to push through laws designed to imprison IRA dissidents who oppose
April's compromise deal on how Northern Ireland should be governed.
	   British Prime Minister Tony Blair faced stronger-than-expected
criticism from a vociferous minority of lawmakers _ including 16
from his own dominant Labor Party _ over his determination to see
his Terrorism and Conspiracy Bill pass through both houses of
Parliament by Thursday night.
	   Most of his critics said they supported the proposed crackdown
but thought Parliament deserved more time to consider amendments to
the bill, which would restrict the right to silence for suspected
IRA dissidents and give greater weight in court to police claims
that people were members of the splinter group.
	   In a clear sign of strong sentiment in the House of Commons, the
bill cleared its second reading on a vote 391-17 early Thursday and
was on course to move to the House of Lords.

First major poll has government in front in Australian election
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ The first major opinion poll taken
since the Australian election was called has put the coalition
Liberal-National government ahead of the Australian Labor Party by
a slim margin.
	   The A.C. Nielsen poll in Melbourne's The Age and Sydney Morning
Herald newspapers Thursday puts support for the government at 43
percent, up three percentage points since the election was called
on Aug. 30.
	   Support for the ALP is also up one point to 42.
	   The poll is bad news for Pauline Hanson's One Nation party whose
support is down two percentage points to 10 percent following the
election announcement.
	   The telephone poll, conducted nationwide from Aug. 31 to Sept. 1
with 2,083 respondents and a margin of error of two percent,
conflicts with two other major surveys released this week.
	   Newspoll recorded a big drop in support for the coalition with
the ALP and the government even at 40 percent and One Nation's vote
rising to 10 percent.
	   The Bulletin magazine's Morgan poll was even better news for
Labor, putting the ALP four points ahead of the coalition, 40 to
36, with One Nation again at 10 percent.
	   Those two polls were both taken immediately prior to the
election being called.
	   The three-poll average has Labor just in front of the coalition,
40.7 to 39.7 percent, with support for both parties down slightly
over the past month.
	   The election will be held Oct. 3.

Cuban exiles plead innocent to Castro assassination plot

<TEXT>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ In a trial that could signal a thaw
in decades of U.S.-Cuban enmity, three Cuban exiles, including a
director of a key Miami-based lobby, pleaded innocent Wednesday to
charges they plotted to kill Fidel Castro.
	   They are among a group of seven exiles indicted by a federal
grand jury in San Juan in what is believed to be the first such
proceeding after years of reported assassination plots against the
Cuban dictator. The others pleaded innocent last week.
	   Bail was set at dlrs 100,000 for Jose Antonio Llama, 68, a
director of the influential, Miami-based Cuban American National
Foundation, and dlrs 75,000 each for Jose Rodriguez, 59, and
Alfredo Domingo Otero, 68.
	   The four men stood together, flanked by their lawyers, as they
entered their pleas before Magistrate Judge Jesus Castellanos.
	   Under the terms of their bail, the men must get court permission
to leave southern Florida, where they live, except to travel to
Puerto Rico on court business.
	   Attorneys for the other four defendants _ Angel Manuel Alfonso,
58, Angel Hernandez Rojo, 64, Juan Bautista Marquez, 62, and
Francisco Secundino Cordova, 51 _ have condemned the charges as
hypocritical given past alleged U.S.-sponsored attempts on Castro's
life.
	   But Llama's lawyer Jose Antonio Pagan said they ``have not made
a decision on whether we're going to follow that line'' also.
	   Llama told reporters: ``I am going to cooperate in everything.''
	   For Cubans who fled Castro's 1959 revolution, the trial is a
bitter pill _ especially at a time when the man they revile is
being embraced by his Caribbean neighbors and many countries are
challenging the 37-year U.S.-led economic boycott of Cuba.
	   Some observers believe the case might reflect a desire by the
Clinton Administration to back away from the demonization and
isolation of Castro.
	   ``If this were Ronald Reagan or George Bush, they'd be giving
these people a freedom medal,'' said Juan Masini Soler, lawyer for
Bautista Marquez.
	   Asked last week whether the indictments represented a change in
U.S. policy toward Cuba, Attorney General Janet Reno said she was
not aware of any change.
	   It could be months before the case comes to trial. The FBI said
more arrests and indictments were expected.
	   The case stems from the arrest of the four men off Puerto Rico
on Oct. 27 after a search of their yacht revealed weapons that
included two .50-caliber assault rifles.
	   Alfonso, who like the others initially denied there were weapons
aboard, said he alone was responsible for the guns. According to an
initial complaint, he admitted planning to use them to kill Castro
at a November summit of Latin American leaders in Venezuela.
	   Llama has admitted that he owns the 46-foot yacht. He is accused
of providing one of the two rifles. That rifle is registered to
Francisco ``Pepe'' Hernandez, the exile group's president.
Hernandez was questioned by the FBI but has not been indicted.
	   Llama's indictment was a blow to the Cuban American National
Foundation, which is widely credited with the U.S. hard line on
Cuba. Castro has accused the foundation of plotting to kill him,
but it professes a commitment to peaceful persuasion.
	   ``We don't know why they are accusing him of those things,''
said son Jose L. Llama. ``Here's a country that for years has been
fighting communism and now it's going to protect (Castro) or at
least try to socialize him,'' he added.

Ranks of Chernomyrdin opponents begin to thin; ruble slides

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ As Russia's ruble slipped and the International
Monetary Fund signaled it might delay a loan payment to Russia this
month, some lawmakers signaled they wanted to step back from a
confrontation with President Boris Yeltsin over his choice of prime
minister.
	   Yeltsin and his candidate Viktor Chernomyrdin have squared off
against opposition lawmakers over who should lead Russia out of its
roiling economic crisis. After overwhelmingly rejecting
Chernomyrdin on Monday, the lower house of parliament, or State
Duma, set a second confirmation vote for Friday.
	   If Chernomyrdin fails to win confirmation a second and third
time, Yeltsin is constitutionally empowered to dissolve the
parliament.
	   Parties across Russia's political spectrum have been united
against Chernomyrdin, whom many blame for landing Russia in its
present economic mess. Chernomyrdin served as prime minister for
five years before Yeltsin dumped him in the spring.
	   However, the ranks of those opposing the acting prime minister
began to thin on Wednesday.
	   Ultranationalist leader Vladimir Zhirinovsky indicated that his
50-member faction, third largest in the Duma, would support the
acting premier after having abstained from the vote on Monday.
	   ``It would be easier for him to continue the surgery since he
has just come out of the operation room,'' the Liberal Democratic
Party leader said.
	   Influential regional leaders in the Federation Council also
endorsed Chernomyrdin. The chamber will likely pass a resolution
Friday backing Chernomyrdin's candidacy, council member Murtaza
Rakhimov said _ putting more pressure on the law-making Duma to
confirm him.
	   Economic pressure was also increasing. The Russian ruble went
far beyond the state-set fluctuation band Wednesday and the Central
Bank said it had no choice but to leave the currency to the mercy
of market forces.
	   The Central Bank had announced on Aug. 17 that the ruble would
be allowed to fluctuate in a band of 6.0-9.5 to the U.S. dollar.
But the official rate broke through the lower limit for the ruble
Tuesday, and was set at 10.88 against the dollar. By Wednesday, it
had fallen to as low as 12.82 _ around the level it has reached in
street trading.
	   The government's revenues have continued to fall. Acting tax
chief Boris Fyodorov said that tax collections in August had
amounted to 11.2 billion rubles, some 2 billion rubles (dlrs 150
million at the current exchange rate) less than planned. He said
the financial crisis had pushed many taxpayers to delay payments,
while those actually made often were stranded in the banks.
	   Meanwhile, International Monetary Fund officials were quoted as
saying the fund might delay its next disbursement of a major
stabilization loan.
	   A dlrs 4.3 billion installment is expected in coming weeks, but
IMF officials said Russia must do more to improve the economic
situation, Russian media reported.
	   Russia reached a deal in July with the IMF and other
international financial institutions for more than dlrs 22 billion
in loans this year and next, but the money did not ward off the
latest economic crisis.

	   ARUSHA, Tanzania (AP) _ The prime minister during Rwanda's
massacre of more than 500,000 Tutsis in 1994 may seek a lighter
sentence Thursday for being the first to admit guilty for genocide
and pledging to testify against other alleged ringleaders.
	   Jean Kambanda, 42, pleaded guilty on May 1 to six counts of
genocide and crimes against humanity, including responsibility for
the murder and extermination of civilians.
	   ``He became the first person to accept culpability for genocide
before an international court,'' the International Criminal
Tribunal for Rwanda said. The offense was decreed and defined in
1948 after the Nuremberg trials.
	   On Wednesday, the tribunal issued its first judgment, declaring
Jean-Paul Akayesu, a former village mayor, guilty of nine counts of
genocide, torture, murder and rape.
	   The 300-page judgment marks the first conviction for genocide,
and is the first time an international tribunal defined rape as a
genocidal crime.
	   His lawyer said Akayesu, who maintained his innocence throughout
his 20-month trial, would appeal.
	   Under the tribunal's rules, a convicted person may be sentenced
to a maximum of life imprisonment.
	   But Kambanda, who will be sentenced Friday, was expected to seek
leniency at a hearing Thursday because he has helped the
prosecution.
	   In determining the sentence, the tribunal's rules allow it to
consider factors including substantial cooperation with the
prosecutor.
	   Deputy Prosecutor Bernard Muna said Kambanda was willing to
testify against others accused of genocide. The tribunal is holding
31 people in Arusha, four of whom are on trial. An elderly Rwandan
priest is in custody in Texas. Eight others have been indicted but
not apprehended.
	   Kambanda is the highest-ranking former political leader in the
tribunal's custody.
	   He led a hard-line Hutu government after the assassination of
Prime Minister Agathe Uwilingiyimana on April 7, 1994. She was
among the first killed in a bloodbath sparked by the shooting down
of President Juvenal Habyarimana's plane the day before.
	   The indictment said as prime minister, Kambanda controlled
government ministers and military officers during the massacres.
	   He was also accused of distributing weapons he knew would be
used in the slayings. In a radio address, Kambanda incited
massacres of Tutsis, saying genocide was ``an indispensable weapon
in the fight against the enemy.''
	   The killing stopped only when Tutsi rebels seized power in July
1994. Kambanda fled Rwanda that month, and was arrested in Nairobi
three years later with six other high-level officials.
	   Rwandan courts _ in proceedings condemned by many foreign
lawyers as unjust _ have tried at least 330 people for involvement
in the genocide, and 116 have been sentenced to death. More than
125,000 people are imprisoned and awaiting trial.
	   On April 24, Rwandan firing squads executed 22 people convicted
of genocide, the first executions for the slaughter.

Staffer fired after opponent's website altered
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Australia's four-day-old election
campaign has struck trouble in cyberspace, with a Labor staffer
fired over allegations that he advised hackers on how to alter the
Liberal party's website.
	   Last week, hackers targeted the Internet site, changing
Australian leader John Howard's title to ``Prime Minister for Pain,
Suffering and Inequity.''
	   The Liberal party's coalition with the National Party forms the
Australian government which is going to the polls on Oct. 3.
	   The pranksters also altered Australian Treasurer Peter
Costello's portfolio to ``Minister for the Rich, Stomping the Poor
and Wrecking the Economy.''
	   Labor opposition leader Kim Beazley confirmed Thursday that he
had fired a new staffer who had been accused of giving hackers
advice on how to defile the site.
	   ``It was totally inappropriate.'' Beazley said. ``The person who
was offering that advice, or may well have been offering that
advice _ we're not absolutely certain _ has been dismissed.
	   ``I, above all, don't want to run a campaign which is in any way
tainted.''

Australian man charged following pornography raids
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PERTH, Australia (AP) _ A 43-year-old Perth man has been charged
in relation to an international child pornography raid, West
Australian police said Thursday.
	   Raids took place in 12 countries at the homes of more than 100
suspected pedophiles in what authorities called one of the largest
efforts to break an Internet child pornography ring.
	   The British National Crime Squad coordinated the pre-dawn raids
as part of a five-month investigation into the so-called Wonderland
club, which authorities said exchanged pornographic pictures of
children as young as 2 on the Internet.
	   Stephen Allan Jones, of the coastal Perth suburb of Hillarys,
was charged by the Western Australian Police child abuse unit
Wednesday night with possession of child pornography.
	   They said in a statement it would be alleged in court that the
man had CD-ROMs of child pornography at his house. Further analysis
was being conducted on computer data seized in the raid.
	   Jones was granted police bail to appear at Perth's Central Law
Courts on Monday.

McGwire hits No. 58
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STEVEN WINE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MIAMI (AP) _ Mark McGwire homered into the upper deck Wednesday
night at Pro Player Stadium to reach 58 home runs for the second
season in a row and close within three homers of Roger Maris' major
league record.
	   McGwire hit a 2-1 pitch for a two-run homer in the seventh
inning, giving the St. Louis Cardinals a 9-0 lead against the
Florida Marlins. The homer came against reliever Brian Edmonson
after McGwire hit into a double play and walked twice in his
previous plate appearances.
	   The homer was estimated at 497 feet (150 meters), making it the
third-longest in the history of Pro Player Stadium.
	   After McGwire hit the pitch, he pumped his right first as he
trotted toward first base. The crowd's standing ovation lasted for
about a minute, prompting a curtain call by the slugger. The homer
was his third in two nights.
	   Maris hit 61 homers in 1961.
	   ``I didn't expect to have 57 by Sept. 1,'' McGwire said before
the game, ``but when I got to 50, I began to think about the
record.''
	   His 58th came hours after Sammy Sosa hit No. 56 for the Chicago
Cubs.
	   ``Sammy's a September player, so you have to watch out for
him,'' McGwire said. ``It's crunch time _ time to make history.''
	   McGwire broke Hack Wilson's 68-year-old National League record
of 56 home runs with two Tuesday night. With 23 games remaining
after Wednesday night, McGwire was on a 68-homer pace.
	   The Cardinals slugger also hit 58 homers last year _ 34 for
Oakland and 24 for St. Louis. The only players to hit more home
runs in a season were Maris and Babe Ruth, who hit 60 in 1927 and
59 in 1921. Hank Greenberg hit 58 in 1930, and Jimmy Foxx hit 58 in
1932.
	   McGwire has surpassed Ruth's major league record of 114 homers
in consecutive seasons, set in 1927-28.
	   McGwire came into the game leading the major leagues with 143
walks, a .736 slugging percentage and a .473 on-base percentage.
The game attracted more than 400 credentialed media _ the largest
following yet for McGwire's home-run chase.

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ A pair of straight-set victories Wednesday set
up a third-round match with more than a bit of bad blood.
	   Irina Spirlea, seeded ninth, next plays Serena Williams a year
after a courtside collision with big sister Venus Williams that
sparked a racially charged, long-distance exchange.
	   Spirlea bumped into Venus on a changeover and later used
profanity to say she wasn't about to back off from the highly
touted _ and hyped _ teen-ager.
	   Richard Williams, the sisters' father, called Spirlea ``a big,
white turkey,'' for which he later apologized. He also said that
when he first heard of the bump, he thought Serena was involved,
``and if it was, she would have decked her.''
	   Serena Williams has won both matches against Spirlea this
season, including a 6-7, 6-3, 6-1 victory in the first round of the
Australian Open and said she would approach the next match like any
other.
	   ``I'm just going out there to have a lot of fun,'' Williams
said. ``And I'm sure she's going to be serious.''
	   But Williams did agree with her father on one point.
	   ``I can get out of control,'' she said. ``And if that had been
me, I probably wouldn't be here right now.''
	   Spirlea beat Miriam Schnitzer 6-3, 6-2 Wednesday, while Serena
Williams beat Pavlina Stoyanova 6-2, 6-1.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; HOMESICK HURTS: &LR;  On July 28, Petr Korda's wife gave birth. Five
days later, the Australian Open champion left home to keep a tennis
commitment in Toronto, part of the marathon schedule that tennis
pros follow.
	   ``I miss my family,'' the No. 4 seed said Wednesday after losing
a first-round match at the U.S. Open to qualifier Bernd Karbacher.
``I am a player who needs my family.''
	   Korda was up a set when it all came apart for him. He committed
57 unforced errors, losing 2-6, 6-3, 6-2, 6-1.
	   ``It just happened,'' he said. ``I don't have any answers. It's
a big disappointment. ... I was not pumped up at all today.''
	   Korda said when Karbacher picked up the pace, he was unable to
respond. ``He played better tennis and I didn't play the way I want
to play,'' he said. ``I was juggling every game. Whatever I did
today, I did wrong. It is very difficult to play tennis the way I
want anymore. I don't have any answers.''
	   Korda said he had a plan and it involves going home to his
family.
	   ``I need to leave the game for a while to get back my mental
energy,'' he said.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; BABY MAKES THREE: &LR;  Another new family member cost the Open its
top-ranked men's doubles team _ and one player a shot at a Grand
Slam sweep.
	   Jacco Eltingh and Paul Haarhuis of the Netherlands withdrew from
the tournament when Eltingh flew home to be his wife and their
newborn son, Lars.
	   That ended Eltingh's hopes of being the first man in the Open
era to sweep the doubles crowns at the four majors. He won the
Australian Open with Jonas Bjorkman, and Wimbledon and the French
Open with Haarhuis.
	   ``I told him I can't believe he dumped me for some kid he's
never seen before,'' Haarhuis joked.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; GRASSROOTS TENNIS: &LR;  If you've noticed more people carrying
tennis rackets, there's a good reason. The U.S. Tennis Association
said its program to bring new players into the sport is working.
	   USA Tennis 1-2-3 has attracted more than 100,000 new players and
should surpass its first-year goal of 120,000, the USTA said
Wednesday.
	   The program, in 161 markets, provides free 90-minute lessons for
newcomers and is part of a five-year, dlrs 50 million initiative.
	   ``We have made great strides in the first year of the program,''
said Judy Levering, first vice president of the USTA. She said the
program's budget would be increased by 16 percent next year.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; BLACK IS BLACK: &LR;  The Zimbabwe Davis Cup team was in action
Wednesday on opposite sides of the net.
	   Brothers Byron and Wayne Black played against each other in
first-round doubles.
	   Older brother Byron teamed with American Alex O'Brien to upset
his younger brother and Sebastien Lareau of Canada, the 12th seeds,
6-2, 6-3.

Lights, camera, action: Russian politics go live
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RECAPS pvs.
 &UR; By MAURA REYNOLDS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ In the past, Russian crises have tended to take
place on the streets, in the parliament, or behind closed doors.
The country's latest upheaval is taking place on the airwaves.
	   When Boris Yeltsin fired the prime minister, he did it on
television. When he wanted to announce that he wouldn't resign, he
did it on television.
	   And when Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov decided to
scuttle a political deal to end the crisis, he didn't issue a news
release or talk to reporters waiting outside. He went on live
television.
	   ``The news is all being broken on television,'' says Masha
Slonim, a producer at Internews, a Western-backed media assistance
project. ``And as a result, everyone is watching the news.''
	   Like never before, television has become a major player in
Russian politics. It's fast, it reaches across an ungainly nation
of 11 time zones, and _ especially when live _ provides politicians
direct contact with the people.
	   ``People in Russia don't read newspapers,'' says Yevgeny Volk,
director of the Moscow office of the U.S.-based Heritage
Foundation. ``Television has become the most powerful source of
information.''
	   The past two weeks have shown the evolution of Russian
television from the days of Soviet-style information control to
today's slick news magazines and live satellite hookups.
	   In fact, in a country where there is little money to pay for
fancy TV dramas or sitcoms, politics can provide cheap
entertainment.
	   There are few daily newspapers and their small circulations
rarely extend beyond Moscow and one or two other cities, but just
about every household has a TV.
	   Once, ultranationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky tossed a glass of
orange juice in the face of his reformist opponent, Boris Nemtsov,
during a live debate. Footage of parliament _ with deputies nodding
off, cleaning their noses or uttering malaprops _ has provided more
than a few chuckles on the evening news.
	   In fact, deputies have been so dismayed by the TV candidness
that they have moved to reassert a kind of censorship over the
three major networks.
	   But while television has gradually taken central stage in the
public debate, the current crisis has also put it in a spotlight.
	   The most dramatic moment came last Sunday, after days of
down-and-dirty political talks to redivide power between the
president and parliament. Just after the deal was reportedly
clinched, the analytical news magazine Itogi came on with live
hookups to the leaders of parliament's four main factions.
	   Zyuganov, looking grumpy and rumpled, frowned into the camera.
``The (Communist Party's) presidium has taken the unanimous
decision not to sign this document,'' he said.
	   The statement _ delivered late at night just hours before
parliament was to convene _ was a bombshell, busting the deal and
setting up a showdown between the president and parliament.
	   Alan Rousso, director of the Carnegie Moscow Center, says
Zyuganov's appearance suggested that even the Communists are
growing more adept at using television.
	   ``They are doing what people do in other media cultures _ play
out your negotiations in the media,'' he explains. ``It shows a new
degree of sophistication, and it brings the public into these
debates.''
	   Not everyone sees the growing role of television as a good thing
for Russian democracy. Volk says live television offers the
illusion of accessibility without accountability.
	   ``Politicians can say whatever they want and hide their real
agenda,'' he complains. Especially for the Communists, he says,
``Openness is not a value. They hate transparency. They hate
openness.''
	   But for better or worse, as in the West, television seems to
have become Russia's main political forum. And Slonim says it may
do Russians some good to put their leaders under bright lights.
	   ``People are not that stupid,'' she explains. ``They will see
who is worth what.''

Dollar higher against yen, Japanese stocks lower
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar was higher against the yen in early
trading Thursday amid sentiment that Wall Street might be
stabilizing. But Tokyo stocks slipped on lingering worries over the
direction of world markets.
	   The dollar bought 138.16 yen in early trading, up 0.54 yen from
late Wednesday in Tokyo and also above its late New York level of
137.50 yen overnight.
	   The dollar, however, slipped as low as 137.65 yen after comments
by Japan's top Finance Ministry officials warning that the yen was
still too weak against its U.S. counterpart.
	   Vice-Finance Minister for international affairs, Eisuke
Sakakibara, said the correction of the yen's weakening trend isn't
over, and that Japanese investors should be aware of the risk of
holding foreign currency-denominated assets.
	   Also, the head of the ministry's international bureau, Haruhiko
Kuroda, said, ``(The yen) must go up much, much more ... It is
still not nearly corrected.''
	   Meanwhile, Tokyo stocks slipped in early trading Thursday
because of lingering uncertainty over the movement of stock markets
around the world after recent instability.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 104.34 points,
or 0.73 percent, to 14,272.28 after the first one hour of morning
trading. On Wednesday, the index had gained 6.99 points, or 0.05
percent.

FDA recommends two breast cancer drugs
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Combines previous &QL;

 &UR; AP Medical Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BETHESDA, Maryland (AP) _ The first in a wave of gene-based
attacks on cancer took a major step forward as U.S. government
scientists recommended that the drug, Herceptin, be sold to fight
advanced breast cancer.
	   Herceptin does not cure breast cancer. But for some 30 percent
of patients whose tumors are fueled by a bad gene, it offers a
chance at living a little longer after the cancer has spread
through a woman's body, scientific advisers to the Food and Drug
Administration concluded.
	   In a second potentially critical advance against breast cancer
on Wednesday, the FDA's advisers said another drug, tamoxifen, may
reduce the chances that certain healthy women will get the disease
later in life. But the panelists stressed that the FDA should
approve tamoxifen only for women considered at high risk of
developing breast cancer, because it also can cause
life-threatening side effects.
	   The FDA is scheduled to make final decisions on both drugs by
November. It is not bound by advisory panel recommendations, but
typically follows them.
	   The question of whether women should take Herceptin was an
easier decision _ because it is for women whose advanced breast
cancer has spread to other parts of their bodies, giving them just
a slim chance of surviving for long.
	   ``It's very exciting,'' said Dr. Dennis Slamon of the University
of California, Los Angeles, whose genetic research led to
Herceptin.
	   Thirty percent of breast cancer patients have a defective gene
called HER2/neu. In a healthy cell, the gene produces a protein
that helps signal cells to grow normally and multiply. In women who
have too much HER2, the breast cells reproduce out of control and
spread through the body.
	   Herceptin's manufacturer, Genentech Inc., genetically engineered
an antibody that blocks excess HER2 to inhibit tumor growth and
possibly even kill cancer.
	   It's not a magic bullet _ it helped only half of the women who
tested it.
	   But adding Herceptin to chemotherapy or Taxol, another
therapy,doubled women's chances that tumors would shrink. In women
who already had failed standard therapy, Herceptin alone cut in
half tumors in 15 percent of women. Amazingly, a handful of women
went into remission. They weren't cured _ most later relapsed _ but
one is alive six years later and another three years later.
	   For most patients, Herceptin provided about three more months
before the cancer progressed. Still, experts say a three-month
respite in patients that sick is an important advance.
	   A year later, 78 percent of women who took Herceptin together
with chemotherapy were alive, compared with 67 percent who took
chemotherapy alone.
	   Thus, the FDA advisers voted unanimously that Herceptin offered
benefit to patients who had failed other chemotherapies, and that
it could be used as first-line therapy together with Taxol.
	   But they said patients should not use Herceptin together with
other chemotherapy drugs known as anthracyclines. While Herceptin
causes far fewer side effects than most chemotherapy, it surprised
doctors by causing one serious problem: heart damage, sometimes
severe.
	   The problem seemed worse in patients who were taking
anthracyclines: One in four of them suffered some heart damage. By
a 9-2 vote, the panel decided the risk of heart damage outweighed
the benefit of a few more months for this group of patients.
	   The FDA advisers' other move Wednesday, on tamoxifen, is aimed
at healthy women who are at high risk of getting breast cancer
later in life. The advisers decided the drug may reduce those
women's risk of cancer.
	   But the panel's backing of tamoxifen was a reluctant one,
because the drug also causes serious side effects even in these
healthy women. It doubles their risk of uterine cancer, triples the
risk of a potentially deadly blood clot and increases the chances
of cataracts that hurt eyesight.
	   Complicating matters further, the FDA panel said tamoxifen's
benefit actually was small.
	   Headlines touted the drug last spring when the National Cancer
Institute announced a study found the drug could prevent 45 percent
of breast cancer cases in high-risk women. But when those numbers
were translated to real life, the FDA advisers noted that 6,600
women took tamoxifen for 3 1/2 years, but it prevented only 69
cases of cancer.
	   Doctors couldn't tell which women were most likely to get that
benefit _ nor if tamoxifen simply delayed cancer's inevitable
appearance, meaning women took big risks for just a short-term
benefit.
	   ``We don't know who to treat,'' complained panel chairman Dr.
Janice Dutcher of Montefiore Medical Center in New York.
	   She said FDA must vigorously educate doctors about tamoxifen's
risks so they will prescribe it carefully to just those women whose
high chance of breast cancer outweighs the side effect risk.

Dollar higher against yen, Japanese stocks lower

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar was higher against the yen in early
trading Thursday amid sentiment that Wall Street might be
stabilizing. But Tokyo stocks slipped on lingering worries over the
direction of world markets.
	   The dollar bought 138.16 yen in early trading, up 0.54 yen from
late Wednesday in Tokyo and also above its late New York level of
137.50 yen overnight.
	   The dollar, however, slipped as low as 137.65 yen after comments
by Japan's top Finance Ministry officials warning that the yen was
still too weak against its U.S. counterpart.
	   Vice-Finance Minister for international affairs, Eisuke
Sakakibara, said the correction of the yen's weakening trend isn't
over, and that Japanese investors should be aware of the risk of
holding foreign currency-denominated assets.
	   Also, the head of the ministry's international bureau, Haruhiko
Kuroda, said, ``(The yen) must go up much, much more ... It is
still not nearly corrected.''
	   Meanwhile, Tokyo stocks slipped in early trading Thursday
because of lingering uncertainty over the movement of stock markets
around the world after recent instability.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 104.34 points,
or 0.73 percent, to 14,272.28 after the first one hour of morning
trading. On Wednesday, the index had gained 6.99 points, or 0.05
percent.
	   Overnight on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average
dropped 45.06 _ or 0.6 percent _ at 7,782.37, after climbing as
high as 7,952.56 earlier in the day.
	   The drop came a day after the Dow made gains and buoyed spirits
on Tuesday when it stemmed a plunge of 1,000 points from the
previous three days.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section of the exchange was down 2.22 points, or 0.20
percent, to 1,116.54. The TOPIX rose 8.61 points, or 0.78 percent,
the previous day.
	   Hitachi was among the losers at the opening, following a report
by Japan's leading economic newspaper Nihon Keizai that the company
will likely post a pretax loss of more than 100 billion yen (dlrs
724.6 million) for the current fiscal year ending in March, 1999.
	   Hitachi shares opened down 35 yen (25 cents) at 725 yen (dlrs
5.3).
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese government

Fighting spreads south, two sides slowly move toward agreement.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ With Yugoslavia's harsh autumn
weather quickly approaching, U.S. diplomacy in embattled Kosovo
province appears to be making progress.
	   In Kosovo's provincial capital Pristina, a senior Western
diplomat said Wednesday that the framework of an agreement between
the Serb-led government and Kosovo's ethnic Albanian majority was
taking shap as a result of shuttle diplomacy by U.S. envoy
Christopher Hill.
	   The diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, was hopeful
that an ``interim accord'' would be possible within months. The
agreement would focus on stopping the fighting and restoring
self-rule to the Albanians over three years.
	   After three years, the two sides could review the agreement. The
diplomat said both Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and
Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova have accepted the idea in principle.
	   Kosovo Albanians want independence from Serbia, Yugoslavia's
most powerful republic, while Milosevic refuses to discuss anything
beyond limited autonomy.
	   The United States and European countries have called for
``substantial autonomy'' for Albanians, who outnumber Serbs in the
province 9-to-one.
	   Washington and the Europeans oppose full independence because
they fear it would lead to a redrawing of borders in neighboring
countries with large Albanian populations. But as a minimum, they
want Milosevic to restore the autonomy which he revoked in 1989.
	   Despite the reported progress, fighting continued in the south
of the province Wednesday, with both sides reporting casualties.
Hundreds of people have been killed, and tens of thousands
displaced, since heavy fighting began in March.
	   Continuing the U.S. efforts in the region, John Shattuck,
assistant secretary of state for human rights, and former Sen.
Robert Dole were expected in Pristina over the weekend.
	   U.S. officials, who asked not to be identified, said both were
likely to tour refugee areas and investigate kidnappings by both
sides before leaving Sunday.

Seles advances; Sampras match rained out at U.S. Open
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous to update with rain wiping out evening
matches &QL;

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Monica Seles no longer wears her father's ring
on a chain around her neck, and her all-black outfit was replaced
by white on a hazy summer afternoon at the U.S. Open.
	   Though she still mourns, Seles has stopped treating tennis as a
catharsis as she deals with her father's death. It is back to being
simply a game, albeit a game at which she once was the best in the
world.
	   It was an easy game for her Wednesday, as the sixth-seeded Seles
reached the third round with a 6-2, 6-3 win over Joannette Kruger.
	   Seles was on an emotional roller-coaster when she reached the
French Open final in June, less than a month after being at her
father's side when he died May 14. She wore his ring on a necklace,
and said playing was her solace amid sadness.
	   ``I think it was different (in Paris) because it was so soon
after my dad's death and because I had so many raw emotions,'' she
said Wednesday. ``Now I definitely step on the court and think more
about the ball.''
	   Seles' coach, Gavin Hopper, said she's no longer relying on
tennis to forget about her troubles.
	   ``I think that's past,'' Hopper said. ``She's putting a lot of
things behind her and a lot of her energy's going back into pure
perfection, and we're still a way off that. Once the first couple
of months are gone, now we're into the day-to-day grind of getting
better.''
	   While Seles is back to focusing on tennis, Petr Korda had his
mind elsewhere as he lost his first-round match to qualifier Bernd
Karbacher, ranked No. 155 in the world.
	   The fourth-seeded Korda, whose wife had their second daughter in
late July but has been home only five days since the birth, lost
2-6, 6-3, 6-2, 6-1 and said he was mentally exhausted.
	   ``I need to leave the game of tennis for a while and spend some
time with the family,'' said Korda, who won the Australian Open
this year for his first Grand Slam title.
	   Top-seeded Pete Sampras, seeking to tie Roy Emerson's record of
12 Grand Slam singles titles, and women's No. 1 seed Martina Hingis
had matches wiped out Wednesday night by torrential rain and strong
winds.
	   Men's No. 2 Marcelo Rios and No. 11 Yevgeny Kafelnikov reached
the second round with straight-sets victories.
	   Steffi Graf, a five-time U.S. Open winner who missed the
tournament last year while recovering from knee surgery, needed
only 41 minutes to win her second-round match and move within two
victories of surpassing Martina Navratilova as the women's career
leader in prize money.
	   Other women joining Seles and the eighth-seeded Graf in the
third round were No. 3 Jana Novotna, No. 9 Irina Spirlea, No. 11
Patty Schnyder, No. 14 Dominique Van Roost and Serena Williams, who
did not seem bothered by a heavily bandaged right thigh in a 6-2,
6-1 victory over a qualifier.
	   No. 16 Ai Sugiyama became the first seeded woman to exit the
tournament, withdrawing midway through the opening set of her match
Wednesday with a sprained left ankle.
	   Spirlea and Williams will meet in the third round. Last year at
the U.S. Open, Spirlea collided with Venus Williams, Serena's older
sister, during a changeover in their match.

Plague: There are still sporadic outbreaks around the world

<TEXT>
	   SANTA FE, New Mexico (AP) _ Veterinarian Barbara Swanson didn't
think much about it when the sweet, sick cat she was treating for
an infection bit her on the thumb.
	   Four days later, a high fever and intense pain in her arm sent
her to the hospital. The diagnosis: bubonic plague.
	   Esther Morrison believed her 70-year-old husband was exhausted
when he stopped splitting wood, complained of stomach pain and told
her not to count on him for supper.
	   Two days later, he was dead. The diagnosis: septicemic plague.
	   Despite its medieval aura _ the Black Death (the pneumonic form
of the plague) wiped out one-quarter of Europe's population in the
14th century _ plague has a decidedly modern face. There are still
sporadic outbreaks around the world. In the United States, an
average of 10 to 15 cases are reported in humans each year, mostly
in the West.
	   That makes it rare _ but worrisome nonetheless.
	   ``We treat it very seriously because of the risk of
human-to-human spread and the high fatality rate,'' said Kenneth
Gage, chief of the plague section of the Division of Vector-Borne
Infectious Diseases with the federal Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention.
	   Plague is a bacterial disease of rodents that generally is
transmitted through flea bites. The culprits are most likely to be
rock squirrels, ground squirrels, prairie dogs or pack rats living
roughly in the western half of the United States.
	   Most of the human cases occur in the Southwest _ New Mexico
accounts for more than half _ and along the Sierra Nevada in
California. There have been human cases reported in at least 13
Western states.
	   ``The closer you get to the Rocky Mountains and on west, the
more plague you're going to find,'' said Gage, whose office is in
Fort Collins, Colorado.
	   And it doesn't require unsanitary conditions or urban squalor. A
roaming cat can bring plague back to a pristine home.
	   Although flea powder and other precautions can reduce the risk,
and prompt treatment with antibiotics can cure it, plague kills
about 16 percent of its human victims, according to the CDC.
	   There were 394 human plague cases in the nation from 1949
through 1997, 63 of them fatal, the CDC said. New Mexico logged 218
of those, including 30 fatalities, said Paul Ettestad, public
health veterinarian with the state Department of Health.
	   ``It's a disease that can be fatal if not recognized and treated
early enough,'' Ettestad said.
	   Swanson, the nation's first human plague case this year, saw a
doctor as soon as she felt sick and spent two days in the hospital.
Several months later, she still had lingering fatigue.
	   Esther Morrison's husband, Donald, a retired metallurgical
engineer, died in August 1984 after being stricken at their house
on a wooded hillside a few miles from Santa Fe.
	   Dead ground squirrels found in the family's woodpile were later
determined to have had plague. But the doctor he saw twice didn't
recognize the disease.
	   Septicemic plague ``is so sneaky,'' said Mrs. Morrison, whose
family created a memorial fund after her husband's death to educate
doctors in rural areas about the disease.
	   Bubonic plague, which accounts for 80 percent of cases, is
marked by swollen lymph glands, called buboes. It's harder to
diagnose septicemic plague, which circulates in the bloodstream,
and pneumonic plague, which infects the lungs and is particularly
dangerous because it can be transmitted through coughing.
Generally, those in contact with a pneumonic plague victim are also
treated with antibiotics.
	   ``In the United States, we actually haven't had person-to-person
transmission since the 1920s _ not that it couldn't occur,'' said
the CDC's Gage.
	   Most people become sick two to seven days after infection. Other
symptoms are fever, chills, headache, muscle pain, nausea, vomiting
and diarrhea.
	   The incidence of plague appears to be cyclical, apparently
linked to the high-moisture, milder winters typical of El Nino
years that cause rodents to thrive, Ettestad said. This year, the
rodent population in New Mexico is estimated at 10 to 20 times
higher than last year, when no one in the state caught plague.
	   Believed to have evolved in central Asia, plague is new to the
United States. It arrived about 1900 in San Francisco aboard
trading ships from China and spread from urban rats into the wild
rodent population of the West. There were outbreaks in ports along
the Gulf of Mexico, but it never got established in the native
rodents there, according to the CDC's Gage.
	   Cats are more susceptible to plague than dogs and get sicker.
Listlessness and not eating are clues that a cat is ill. ``If you
become sick and there's a sick cat in the house, go see your
doctor,'' Swanson advised.
	   Plague also can be contracted by handling infected animals.
Hunters, for example, are at risk if they don't wear gloves while
skinning animals.
	   Esther Morrison gives her cat anti-flea treatment regularly and
sprays her woodpiles. She says if she were to get sick and
suspected plague, she would be aggressive about demanding the
appropriate treatment.
	   ``I'm not afraid of plague any more because I've read so much,''
she said.

Police break up strike at South Korea's largest auto parts firm
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Riot police stormed plants of South
Korea's largest auto parts maker Thursday to break up an 18-day-old
strike by thousands of workers protesting layoffs.
	   In coordinated dawn assaults at seven Mando Machinery Corp.
plants around the country, some 8,000 riot police used bulldozers
and tear gas to break through barricades and disperse strikers.
	   MBC-TV said one worker was taken to a hospital after falling
from a fourth-floor building in an apparent suicide attempt. His
condition was not immediately known.
	   Police quickly overpowered workers in five smaller plants, but
fierce fighting erupted at the company's two main plants in Asan
and Pyongtaek in central South Korea, where about 800 workers were
holed up.
	   Mando's 4,300 unionized workers went on strike Aug. 17 to
protest the company's plan to dismiss 1,090 employees. Authorities
outlawed the strike because the union did not go through mandatory
government mediation. Arrest warrants were issued for 24
organizers.
	   Police said they detained about 500 workers. All but the 24
union leaders being sought for arrest will be released, they said.
	   It was the first use of police force to break up a labor protest
under the new government of President Kim Dae-jung. Layoffs are
legal but new to Korean workers, long accustomed to lifetime
employment.
	   Mando is a monopoly supplier of air conditioners, heaters,
alternators and other key components for Hyundai Motor Co. and
other domestic automakers.
	   South Korean auto companies have been operating since early this
year at about 50 percent of their combined capacity of 4 million
vehicles a year.
	   Mando is a subsidiary of the Halla group, South Korea's 12th
largest conglomerate. Halla defaulted on dlrs 220 million in debts
last December.
	   Halla plans to sell off an undisclosed amount of stock in Mando
to foreign investors. So far, Ford, General Motors and a few other
foreign carmakers reportedly have shown interest.
	   Mando sold dlrs 1 billion worth of car components last year, 80
percent of them to Hyundai, the nation's largest automaker.

McGwire hits Nos. 58 and 59
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with second homer &QL; 
 &UR; By STEVEN WINE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MIAMI (AP) _ Mark McGwire hit two homers for the second
consecutive night Wednesday against the Florida Marlins, giving him
a career-high 59. He needs just two more to tie Roger Maris'
37-year-old major league record.
	   McGwire homered in the seventh inning against Brian Edmondson
and again in the eighth on the first pitch from Rob Stanifer. Each
was a two-run shot.
	   The first, which landed halfway up in the upper deck in left
field, was estimated at 497 feet (149 meters), making it the
third-longest in the history of Pro Player Stadium. His second
homer 30 minutes later was to left-center and traveled an estimated
458 feet (137 meters), giving the St. Louis Cardinals a 14-3 lead.
	   It was his eighth multihomer game this season and the 51st of
his career.
	   Maris hit 61 homers in 1961.
	   ``I didn't expect to have 57 by Sept. 1,'' McGwire said before
the game, ``but when I got to 50, I began to think about the
record.''
	   His 58th came hours after Sammy Sosa hit No. 56 for the Chicago
Cubs.
	   ``Sammy's a September player, so you have to watch out for
him,'' McGwire said. ``It's crunch time _ time to make history.''
	   After homering Wednesday afternoon in the Cubs' 4-2 win over
Cincinnati, Sosa predicted McGwire might break loose again.
	   ``Mark has the possibility to come back tonight and hit two
more. He's playing in Miami, don't forget,'' Sosa said.
	   McGwire broke Hack Wilson's 68-year-old National League record
of 56 home runs with two Tuesday.
	   The Cardinals slugger surpassed his career best of 58 homers
last year _ 34 for Oakland and 24 for St. Louis. The only players
to hit more home runs in a season were Maris and Babe Ruth, who hit
60 in 1927. Ruth hit 59 in 1921.
	   McGwire has surpassed Ruth's major-league record of 114 homers
in consecutive seasons, set in 1927-28.
	   McGwire homered on a 2-1 pitch in the seventh, giving the
Cardinals a 9-0 lead. The homer came after McGwire hit into a
double play and walked twice in his previous plate appearances.
	   After McGwire hit a pitch that appeared low and inside, he
pumped his right first as he trotted toward first base. The
standing ovation from the crowd of 45,170 lasted for about a
minute, prompting a curtain call by the Cardinals slugger.
	   There was another curtain call after the homer in the eighth.
Then McGwire was taken out of the game by manager Tony La Russa.
	   McGwire came into the game leading the major leagues with 143
walks, a .736 slugging percentage and a .473 on-base percentage.
The game attracted more than 400 credentialed media _ the largest
following yet for McGwire's home-run chase.

Keiko's off to Iceland, but can this whale hunt?
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Keiko's move is scheduled for Wednesday, Sept. 9 &QL; 
 &UR; AP photos NY315-316, AP graphic FREE WILLY &QL; 
 &UR; By DAVID FOSTER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEWPORT, Oregon (AP) _ The fans are growing restless, but the
star makes them wait.
	   Ten minutes, 15 minutes pass. Flip-flops shuffle on the concrete
floor. Babies wail, but nobody leaves.
	   ``Here he comes!'' someone finally shouts, and camcorders leap
to shoulders as the long-awaited one glides into view. Nodding his
head with quiet assurance, he notices a little girl near the front
and sidles up to the window between them.
	   Then he sticks out a tongue the size of a ham and wags it. The
gallery erupts in laughter. Cameras flash.
	   Keiko, the world's most famous killer whale, has charmed yet
another audience.
	   Millions of children know him from ``Free Willy,'' the 1993
box-office hit that made this 5-ton orca a big name in Hollywood.
	   He became even better known when word spread that Keiko, unlike
the killer whale he portrayed, didn't get to swim free at the
movie's end. He was seriously ill, held captive in a cramped, tepid
pool at a Mexico City amusement park.
	   Airlifted out in January 1996 and nursed back to vigor at the
Oregon Coast Aquarium here in Newport, he's now being coached for
his most challenging role yet _ transforming from Keiko the
charming performer to Keiko the ruthless predator.
	   Next Wednesday, weather permitting, an Air Force C-17 will fly
Keiko back to his home waters off the coast of Iceland. There, he
will shuck the celebrity he has known for most of his 20 years,
trading it for a remote sea pen visited only by his trainers.
	   His benefactors hope the pen, 60 percent larger than his pool
here and exposed to ocean currents and noise, will be a halfway
house for Keiko's eventual release into the North Atlantic. But
despite a dlrs 12 million investment, they say there's no guarantee
that Keiko will ever be ready for life in the wild.
	   Setting a captive orca free has never been tried, and nobody is
certain that good intentions won't pave Keiko's road to a watery
hell.
	   He's in good health, but questions remain: Will this whale hunt?
Does he want to? What makes Keiko happy, or can an orca even know
what happiness is?
	   It all seemed so simple in the movie. Threatened by a villainous
amusement-park owner who tries to kill him for insurance money,
Willy escapes to the open ocean with the help of a boy named Jesse.
A happy ending for all _ especially for Warner Bros., which grossed
dlrs 78 million from the film.
	   Keiko's real-life story, while not so tidy, is no less dramatic.
Captured in 1979 off the coast of Iceland as a whale no more than 2
years old, he was shuttled to aquariums in Iceland and Ontario,
then sold in 1985 to Reino Aventura, an amusement park in Mexico
City.
	   There he performed several shows daily for 11 years, in a pool
that seemed increasingly cramped as he doubled in length to 20 feet
(6 meters). His native Icelandic waters were a chilly,
whale-friendly 40 to 50 F (4.4 to 10 C); his Mexico City pool of
artificially salted tap water could reach 80 F (26.6 C) in summer.
	   Warty lesions erupted on his flippers and tail. Sapped by the
heat, Keiko spent most of his time between performances floating
like a log. His back was out of the water so much that his dorsal
fin drooped.
	   By 1992, when the ``Free Willy'' crew arrived to start filming,
Keiko was one ton underweight.
	   Reino Aventura's owners had been trying to find him a better
home for years, but there were no takers for their ailing whale _
until the movie was released and publicity spread about the real
Willy's plight.
	   School kids collected pennies to help save Keiko. Warner Bros.
gave more than dlrs 2 million. The owners of Reino Aventura donated
Keiko to the newly formed Free Willy Keiko Foundation, which in
January 1996 installed Keiko in a dlrs 7.3 million pool built
especially for him at the Oregon Coast Aquarium.
	   The pool holds 2 million gallons, nearly four times more than
his old one. It's filled with fresh sea water filtered and chilled
to 50 F (10 C). Ten trainers feed Keiko, play with him and fret
over his every move and utterance.
	   There are no performances, but visitors get to gawk at Keiko
from underwater windows. He gawks right back, paying special
attention to children.
	   Keiko has gained at least a ton of muscle and blubber, so much
that he has stretch marks across his belly. The unsightly warts,
caused by a virus, have all but disappeared. When he arrived in
Oregon, he could hold his breath for three minutes. Now he can stay
under for 18.
	   But there's more to surviving in the wild than physical prowess,
and some whale experts believe Keiko's long association with humans
has made him a poor candidate for release. He may look like a wild
orca, they argue, but in disposition he has more in common with a
golden retriever.
	   His trainers often discipline him simply by turning their backs,
withholding the attention he craves. One of Keiko's favorite
rewards is to turn belly-up and get a nice, long scratch on his
flippers and flukes.
	   ``If they end up letting him go, he'll have to adapt to a very
different environment. He's not going to get his tummy rubbed,''
says Brad Andrews, who oversees 20 captive orcas for Sea World
theme parks and has no intention of letting his whales join the
``Free Willy'' bandwagon.

NEWPORT: ``Free Willy'' bandwagon.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ``Will Keiko adapt? We really don't know,'' Andrews says. ``I
don't think we should put the animal at risk by experimenting.''
	   Keiko's handlers acknowledge the risk but say it is justified.
	   ``Keiko is exquisitely cared for here,'' says Diane Hammond, a
spokeswoman for the Free Willy Keiko Foundation. ``But his life is
lacking in ways we can't compensate for. He needs companionship,
stimulation. He needs to be in his world, not our world.''
	   His trainers have tried to prepare him for independence with
games, problem-solving exercises and fish-chasing sessions.
	   Having dined for years on dead seafood, Keiko initially didn't
realize he was supposed to eat the live, wriggling fish that were
placed in his mouth. He has made rapid progress, however. A few
weeks ago, he chased down his entire daily ration of fish _ about
140 pounds (65 kilograms) _ for the first time.
	   ``His skills are by no means up to what he'd need in the wild,''
Hammond says. ``But it's a good start.''
	   Keiko recognizes more than 50 hand signals, including one _ arms
reaching forward, index fingers pointing _ that means ``Do anything
you want, as long as you didn't already do it.'' Trainers use the
command to prod Keiko's creativity; his record is 38 behaviors with
no repeats.
	   Such displays of intelligence, combined with an imposing
presence that can only be described as charisma, are what endear
Keiko to his fans.
	   Visitors often talk to him through the viewing windows. A few
even claim he talks back, including one self-described ``animal
communicator'' who says Keiko told her he wants to stay at the
aquarium as an ambassador from the animal kingdom.
	   Keiko's trainers laugh off such ``anthropomorphism,'' the
assigning of human qualities to an animal. But they can't help
doing it, either. Even scientists end up describing Keiko in very
unscientific terms.
	   They say he can be mischievous, trustworthy, bored, gentle,
kind, exuberant, shameless, playful, stubborn, moody, or eager to
please. They tell of the security guard who one night sobbed out
her troubles by the pool while Keiko floated nearby, listening
patiently. But they warn that Keiko can also be fickle, bonding
with certain trainers and then dropping them for no apparent
reason.
	   ``You can be the flavor of the month, then all of a sudden
you're not. It's happened to several people,'' trainer Brian
O'Neill says.
	   O'Neill is this month's flavor. Not given to small talk with
humans or whales, O'Neill is a stern taskmaster in training
sessions, and Keiko seems to respect him.
	   As much as anyone, O'Neill is tuned in to Keiko's attempts to
communicate. When the killer whale lets out a short, ascending
squeak _ it sounds like ``doo-WHIP'' _ O'Neill knows Keiko is
resting near the visitor's gallery. When O'Neill hears a harsh
squawk on the hydrophone, he can tell without looking that Keiko is
aggressively batting around one of his toys.
	   ``But do I know what he's thinking? Not a clue,'' O'Neill says.
``I wouldn't even make a guess.''
	   It's that gulf, at once frustrating and soul-stirring, that
convinces Keiko's handlers they are doing what's best for him.
	   Throughout his years in concrete pools, Keiko has never stopped
talking, and his human companions have listened without
understanding.
	   In a few days, if all goes as planned, he will squeak and squawk
inside a commodious pen floating in a sheltered cove of the North
Atlantic.
	   This time, he may get a reply.

UN convening high-level dialogue on globalization implication
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The United Nations is convening a two-day
session on globalization and the economic and social implications
of the global economy, U.N. officials said.
	   The high-level meeting, Sept. 17-18, is expected to be attended
by ministers from around the world.
	   Secretary-General Kofi Annan cited the meeting in a speech
Wednesday at the Nonaligned Movement summit in Durban, South Africa
as a means to make progress on a host of globalization issues,
particularly those confronting the developing world.
	   He called for faster action to remove the debt burden of
developing countries, increase official development aid, and open
industrialized markets to goods from the developing world.

Report: Iraq must prioritize its purchases
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Despite being allowed to pump dlrs 5.26
billion in oil over six months under a special U.N. program, Iraq
is only expected to produce dlrs 2.86 billion because of low oil
prices and its dilapidated pumping facilities, the U.N. chief said
in a report.
	   Wednesday's report confirmed what U.N. and Iraqi officials had
predicted for months. But it represented the first solid figure of
Iraq's expected capability for the second half of the year to buy
badly needed food and medicine for its 22 million people suffering
under U.N. sanctions.
	   Because of the shortfall, U.N. officials have begun discussions
with Baghdad to prioritize its humanitarian purchases,
Secretary-General Kofi Annan said in the report to the Security
Council.
	   Though it's up to Baghdad to decide what to buy, U.N. officials
and western diplomats are emphasizing the need to give priority to
food, medicine and spare parts to improve Iraq's oil
infrastructure, officials said.
	   Iraq has been barred from selling oil _ its economic mainstay _
on the open market since sanctions were imposed after Baghdad
invaded Kuwait in 1990. A unique U.N. program, called oil-for-food,
was launched in 1996 to allow Iraq to sell its oil in exchange for
humanitarian goods.
	   The Security Council, citing the need to better provide for
Iraqis, agreed in February to increase the amount of oil Iraq could
sell over six months from dlrs 2.14 billion to dlrs 5.26 billion.
	   Of the dlrs 2.86 billion Iraq is expected to pump in the second
half of the year, only dlrs 1.79 is expected to be spent on
humanitarian goods, Annan said. According to U.N. resolutions, 34
cents of every oil-for-food dollar go for Gulf War reparations and
administrative costs.
	   Iraq has complained about delays in contract approvals and
deliveries of goods. On Wednesday, an Iraqi health official said
that less than 1 percent of the dlrs 200 million in medical
supplies that Baghdad was permitted to buy during the first six
months of 1998 had arrived in the country.
	   U.N. spokesman Eric Falt acknowledged that medicine deliveries
were ``slower than expected,'' but said dlrs 17 million, or 9
percent of the medical supplies, arrived during the third phase.
	   The head of the oil-for-food program, Benon Sevan, is expected
to brief the Security Council on Annan's report Friday.

Old-time astronauts rally around John Glenn, but question science
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; AP Aerospace Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAPE CANAVERAL, Florida (AP) _ Wally Schirra couldn't wait to
try out his new three-liner on his old buddy, John Glenn, when the
two got together a few weeks ago.
	   Back in the spotlight because of Glenn's fall space shuttle
ride, Schirra _ the only astronaut to fly in Mercury, Gemini and
Apollo _ needed a quick, witty response to The Question: Wish it
were you?
	   ``One, I'm not that old. Two, I don't need the flight time. And
three, I, too, would do anything to get out of that U.S. Senate,''
the 75-year-old Schirra says, laughing.
	   ``I told those to John,'' he adds, laughing harder.
	   Schirra also passed on an acquaintance's observation.
	   ``I said to John, `One of our local club members came up to me
and said, `If they want to send an old guy, why don't they send up
Strom Thurmond?' John laughed like mad and said, `That's not as
funny as you might think.' He said the very next day after the
announcement, Strom Thurmond had a note on John's desk: `I'll be
your backup or replace you if required.' John's already framed
it.''
	   The way NASA's old-time astronauts see it, the 95-year-old
Thurmond would have a better shot at a space shuttle flight than
they would.
	   Thurmond, after all, is a U.S. senator just like the 77-year-old
Glenn, an Ohio Democrat who's retiring from politics in January.
	   Without his political punch _ not to mention his name and fame _
Glenn wouldn't be returning to orbit, many retired astronauts
contend. Yet most are quick to add their approval.
	   Glenn, after all, came up with the ingenious idea two years ago
of launching a senior citizen to better understand the disorders
shared by the elderly on Earth as well as astronauts in space:
flabby muscles, brittle bones, weakened immune systems, dizzy
spells, fitful sleep.
	   ``If I can pass a physical,'' Glenn figured, ``why not me?''
	   After months of stewing over Glenn's proposal, NASA finally
agreed, setting the stage for one of the most eagerly anticipated
launches since the Apollo moon shots.
	   America's first man in orbit will become the oldest man in orbit
ever when space shuttle Discovery lifts off Oct. 29 atop a blaze of
publicity, 36 1-2 years after his first rocket ride.
	   Mercury astronauts Schirra, Gordon Cooper and Scott Carpenter
will be among the tens of thousands jamming Kennedy Space Center
for Glenn's send-off, providing color commentary for network TV.
	   Alan Shepard, the first of the original Mercury seven to fly,
hoped to join them, but died July 21 following a battle with
leukemia. Deke Slayton died of a brain tumor in 1993. Gus Grissom
perished in the Apollo 1 fire in 1967.
	   The survivors, drawn closer because of their dwindling numbers,
wouldn't miss this late-in-life hurrah for anything.
	   ``I'm glad to see him getting a chance,'' says Cooper, who at
age 71 is the youngest of the Mercury bunch.
	   Carpenter, 73, who followed Glenn into orbit in 1962, says he
has already informed Glenn, ``I'd be glad to be his backup again,
but this time I'd sabotage him for sure.''
	   Seriously, though, says Carpenter: ``I'm four years younger and
I don't have a senator's clout. Sure, that means something. That
was helpful, certainly helpful, and being the first to fly, the
first orbiting American. Everything helps.''
	   Apollo 15 astronaut Al Worden isn't as subtle, or charitable.
	   ``Geriatric study, give me a break!'' Worden, 66, grumbles,
roaring with laughter. ``If I had been in the Senate for 24 years
and had the political clout that John Glenn had, I'd probably be
bugging NASA to go, too.''
	   Grissom's widow sees Glenn's flight as a political reward and
publicity stunt, nothing more.
	   ``He's getting payback for whatever it is, the Senate campaign,
whatever it is,'' fumes Betty Grissom. ``He's just going to go. He
likes the press to follow him around and he likes to separate
himself.''
	   ``They're spending taxpayers' money, and I think they should be
more frugal with it,'' she adds. ``I just can't see it at all.''
	   NASA Administrator Daniel Goldin says the medical tests to be
conducted on Glenn during the nine-day shuttle flight will benefit
both astronauts and the aged.
	   Designated a payload specialist _ a bottom-of-the-totem-pole
shuttle passenger specializing in science _ Glenn will collect
urine, blood and saliva in orbit. He'll also have his heart rate,
breathing and other body functions monitored by the doctors on the
seven-person crew.
	   What makes Glenn so valuable as a test subject, NASA says, is
that his entire medical history is on file, dating all the way back
to his days as a Marine combat pilot during World War II.
	   Goldin and Glenn insist the White House had nothing to do with
the decision, nor did Glenn's prominence in Washington.
	   ``The fact that I'm a senator didn't have anything to do with
pushing him (Goldin) into it,'' Glenn says. ``It was done on a
scientific basis, and I passed the physical.''
	   Adds Glenn: ``We're up there to learn new things. That's the
purpose of the whole NASA program is to learn the new.''
	   Despite such assertions, many of Glenn's space peers question
the scientific relevance of a single test subject. Indeed, NASA
says it has no intention of flying more seniors in the foreseeable
future.
	   The scientific bonanza will be slim at best, Schirra says _
``not of the magnitude that we'd expect.'' He notes that Glenn's
Feb. 20, 1962, flight lasted a mere five hours, offering little in
the way of comparison.
	   Six-time space shuttle flier Story Musgrave, a doctor who became
the world's oldest spaceman in 1996 at age 61, would be a better
choice, says Schirra.
	   ``Now there's a man you'd want to check on for osteoporosis,''
Schirra says. ``He's a real good data bank.''
	   Musgrave quit the astronaut corps last year after NASA told him
he'd never fly again. The reason? Too old.
	   NASA also has reams of medical data on the nine men who flew on
Skylab in the early 1970s. Their space station missions lasted
between one and three months, and emphasized medical research. But
they weren't asked to go up again, either.
	   Skylab astronaut Ed Gibson will be watching Glenn's aging
studies ``real close.'' That's because when he grows up, he'd like
to go back into space, too.
	   It will be a while. He's only 61.

Researchers suspect exercise may immunize people against heart
</HEADLINE>
disease &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Consistent exercise may teach the body how to
fight off buildups of a form of cholesterol that can lead to
clogged arteries, a study finds.
	   Long-term exercisers seem to have a way to keep low-density
lipoprotein cholesterol, LDL, from turning into deposits that
eventually can result in reduced blood flow or artery-blocking
clots, according to researchers at Emory University School of
Medicine in Atlanta.
	   Exercise apparently changes the way in which the body handles
free radicals, highly reactive oxygen molecules that encourage LDL
particles to form the deposits, according to researcher Sampath
Parthasarathy.
	   The study was an attempt to resolve a paradox. Aerobic exercise,
which requires the body to use more oxygen, raises levels of free
radicals. Yet exercisers have a reduced risk of heart disease.
	   ``At present, oxidation is suggested to be a detrimental factor,
and antioxidants are said to be beneficial,'' Parthasarathy said.
``How can an oxidative stress be beneficial in preventing heart
disease?''
	   The experiments were reported in an American Heart Association
journal, Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis and Vascular Biology.

 &UR; Geyser in Yellowstone erupts for first time since 1975
	   YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK, Wyoming (AP) _ Twin Geyser, which
last erupted for two days following an earthquake in June 1975,
erupted again, spewing twin jets of boiling water about 70 feet (21
meters) high.
	   It is one of the largest geysers in one of Yellowstone National
Park's smallest geyser basins.
	   Twin Geyser was first seen erupting in Yellowstone's West Thumb
Geyser Basin at about 10:30 a.m. on Aug. 23 and repeated its
performance three or four times during the day, park spokeswoman
Cheryl Matthews said.
	   The short eruptions lasted only a few minutes and came roughly
every three to four hours, Matthews said. By Aug. 24, the activity
had subsided, although the geyser craters were still boiling
vigorously.
	   The geyser's activity came within just a few hours of two
earthquakes reported roughly 50 miles (80 kilometers) away along
the Wyoming-Idaho border just west of Grand Teton National Park.
The U.S. Geological Survey reported a shallow 4.2 magnitude
earthquake at 12:16 p.m. Aug. 23, preceded by a 3.2 magnitude
foreshock three minutes earlier.
	   The earthquake was centered about 30 miles (50 kilometers)
northwest of Jackson, Wyoming.

 &UR; Mouth-to-snout is no sacrifice to rescue a friend
	   PHILADELPHIA (AP) _ Nancy Nayowith lives with a wolf tattooed on
her leg and a menagerie _ seven cats, three dogs_ at home.
	   Pets in distress? She is unabashedly loyal: ``I'd do anything.''
	   Even mouth-to-snout? ``Definitely. They're worth it.''
	   Ms. Nayowith, a teacher at Philadelphia's Overbrook High School,
is prepared. The American Red Cross, best known for delivering
blood and emergency services to people, has begun helping pets _
with pet first-aid courses for owners.
	   ``People want to learn how to care for their pets better,'' says
Mona Bennett, a Red Cross instructor who helped develop the course
for the Philadelphia area chapter and has three dogs herself. ``You
can't just call 911 for them.''
	   In a recent class, Ms. Nayowith practiced cardiopulmonary
resuscitation on a dog mannequin designed by a Hollywood prop
maker. Outfitted with a sack that acts like lungs, the dog seemed
to spring to life, ``breathing'' when participants apply CPR.
	   The southeastern Pennsylvania chapter of the Red Cross in
Philadelphia is one of the first to offer the class. So far, 65 of
1,350 chapters nationwide do so.

 &UR; Police help cardiac victims with defibrillators
	   PITTSBURGH (AP) _ For 13 long minutes on a weekday in December
1992, dentist William Hall lay unconscious on his office floor
while his son and partner, James, furiously performed CPR to revive
his still heart.
	   Paramedics were caught in traffic, but two Mount Lebanon police
officers, Bill Hindman and Daniel Reig, answered a 911 call armed
with a device to give Hall's heart a life-restoring shock.
	   Twenty-four hours later, Hall, then 67, awakened in a hospital,
grateful for the officers' quick response.
	   ``They shocked me four times,'' Hall said recently. ``If they
hadn't been there so fast, I would have died.''
	   Hall was an unwitting participant in a three-year University of
Pittsburgh Medical Center study in which 170 police officers in
seven suburban Pittsburgh police departments were trained to use
automated external defibrillators to shock the hearts of cardiac
arrest victims.
	   Cardiac arrest is not a heart attack. In a cardiac arrest,
electrical signals that tell the muscles to pump go haywire so the
heart actually stops. Victims pass out almost immediately and the
average survival rate is only 5 percent, according to the American
Heart Association. By contrast, a heart attack occurs when the
organ is damaged.
	   The study showed that the patients were nearly 10 times more
likely to survive if the officer shocked them instead of waiting
for paramedics, said Vince Mosesso, assistant professor of medicine
in UPMC's department of emergency medicine.

Worldwide investigation uncovers child pornography ring
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous versions of BC-Britain-Child Pornography &QL;

 &UR; By SARAH WYATT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Suspected members of a child pornography ring
who allegedly traded pictures of children as young as 18 months old
over the Internet were targeted in a sting in 12 countries
including the United States and Britain.
	   The raids that led to almost four dozen arrests worldwide were
conducted against suspected members of the Wonderland Club who,
according to authorities, exchanged thousands of pornographic
images of children via cyberspace.
	   The British National Crime Squad began the investigation five
months ago and uncovered a database of more than 100,000
pornographic photos of children, officials said.
	   ``People try to smuggle in smut just like they try to smuggle
dope across the border and we're ready to pounce on them,'' said
Dick Weart, a special agent for the U.S. Customs Service, which
carried out 32 raids in 22 states with the help of state and local
police.
	   Police confiscated ``boxes of pornography, various software
materials and hardware that were part and parcel'' of the ring
during the raids, Weart said.
	   To join the child pornography ring, members had to have multiple
images of child pornography, and some had as many as 10,000
pictures, U.S. Customs said. The ring allegedly began in the United
States.
	   British authorities said more than 40 arrests worldwide were
made Wednesday, and U.S. Customs predicted there would be more as
officials evaluated the evidence collected. Hundreds of people are
suspected of being connected with the pornography ring.
	   ``The people who exploit children in this way think they can
hide in cyberspace. They are wrong. We will find them and bring
them to justice,'' U.S. Customs Commissioner Raymond Kelly said
Wednesday.
	   The raids occurred in Australia, Austria, Belgium, Britain,
Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Norway, Portugal, Sweden and the
United States.
	   ``I am unaware of another police operation that has ever pulled
together so many law enforcement agencies worldwide to effect
simultaneous raids and arrests,'' said Bob Packham, deputy director
general of the British National Crime Squad.
	   According to international and U.S. authorities, police arrested
11 people in Britain, 10 in Germany, eight in Norway, five in
France, four each in the United States and Australia, three in
Italy and one in Sweden.
	   The investigation, code-named ``Cathedral,'' linked members of
the Wonderland Club through the types of images they allegedly sent
to each other.
	   ``The content would turn the stomach of any right-minded person.
It's really disgusting,'' said Britain's Detective Superintendent
John Stewardson, who led the operation.
	   Weart said the investigation's next step would be to identify
the children pictured.
	   ``This investigation is about bringing these criminals to
justice and hopefully saving some children from awful existence
that they certainly don't deserve,'' Weart said.
	   While this investigation began in Britain, it grew out of a
large Customs investigation on the West Coast that culminated in
1996, Weart said. ``A lot of the information gleaned from that
investigation was given to our British counterparts'' and the other
countries, he said.
	   The U.S. states where raids occurred were California, Colorado,
Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Maine,

Which breast cancer drug, for which women?
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   Advisers to the Food and Drug Administration recommended
approval of two very different breast cancer drugs Wednesday.
	   Information on which women should consider which drug:
	   _The FDA panel decided that tamoxifen, now sold to treat breast
cancer, also could help certain healthy women reduce their risk of
getting breast cancer later in life.
	   A study suggested it could cut that risk by 45 percent, but in
real life, 6,600 at-risk women had to take tamoxifen for 3 1/2
years to see 69 fewer cases of cancer than among 6,000 women who
took a dummy pill.
	   The pills also can cause serious side effects, doubling women's
risk of uterine cancer, tripling the risk of potentially deadly
blood clots and increasing the chances of cataracts.
	   The FDA panel couldn't say exactly which women had a high enough
risk of cancer to chance those side effects and take tamoxifen.
	   But the National Cancer Institute next week will begin issuing
computer programs designed to help doctors calculate women's risk.
The ``risk disk'' considers a woman's age, whether close relatives
had breast cancer, at what age she had her first child and first
menstrual period, whether she's had previous breast biopsies and
other factors.
	   As one example, a 35-year-old woman whose mother and aunt had
breast cancer and who has had previous breast biopsies for
suspicious lumps might be a good tamoxifen candidate.
	   Anyone with a previous history of blood clots should not take
tamoxifen.
	   The FDA panel also noted that tamoxifen was studied mostly in
white women, and urged further study of its benefits and risks in
minority women.
	   _____
	   _Herceptin, in contrast, is for women who already have advanced
breast cancer that has spread to other parts of the body. But it's
only for a subset of them _ the 30 percent who have a bad gene
called HER2/neu that is fueling the tumor's growth.
	   To get Herceptin, cancer patients first would have their tumor
tissue tested for the amount of HER2/neu.
	   Patients who have metastatic cancer _ it has spread to other
parts of the body _ and who have significantly excess amounts of
HER2 could consider Herceptin as part of their overall treatment.
	   The FDA panel said it could be a first-line therapy together
with the drug Taxol, or be taken alone as a last-ditch therapy by
women who already have failed other chemotherapies.
	   But women taking other chemotherapeutic drugs called
anthracyclines, such as Adriamycin, should not take Herceptin
because the combination appears too risky, the FDA panel said.
Occasionally, Herceptin can cause heart damage, sometimes severe.
In women taking anthracyclines that risk jumped to a one-in-four
chance.

Japan on alert against possible second missile test by North Korea

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's military was put on an increased level of
alert Thursday to prepare for a possible second ballistic missile
test launch by North Korea.
	   Defense Agency spokesman Hiromitsu Kuwano said Japan's military
had upgraded its level of alertness against any possible test. He
declined to comment specifically on what sort of measures Japan is
taking, or on what information Japan had about a possible test.
	   Kyodo News said military ships were being dispatched to the Sea
of Japan to monitor any possible missile launch. Kuwano refused to
confirm that report.
	   Muneo Suzuki, a spokesman for the Cabinet, told reporters ``We
cannot deny the possibility of a second missile launch.''
	   He also refused to elaborate.
	   On Monday, North Korea test fired a Taepo Dong 1 ballistic
missile that flew across northern Japan and crashed into the
Pacific Ocean. The first stage, or booster, of the missile landed
in the Sea of Japan.
	   That test sent shockwaves through the region because it
demonstrated North Korea now has the capability to strike any part
of Japan, including U.S. military bases around the country.
	   Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi and other government leaders were
expected to answer questions in Parliament later Thursday on how
Japan will respond to the North Korean test launch.
	   Japanese media urged strong action Thursday to discourage North
Korea from further escalating tensions in the region.

Two suspects arrested in killing of British aid worker
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELIZE CITY, Belize (AP) _ Two men were charged Wednesday in the
rape and murder of a British aid worker killed in this Central
American country last week.
	   Ana Lightfoot, 27, was one of nine Raleigh International
volunteers helping to build a school in San Pablo, about 100 miles
(160 kilometers) from Belize City. Her body was found last Thursday
in a jungle near a village she had visited three days earlier.
	   Estevan Sho, 21, and Alan Cal, 20, both of the southern village
of Red Bank, were arraigned before a judge on charges of murder,
robbery and rape. They were arrested Sunday while getting hair
cuts.
	   Police said they were led to the suspects after another woman
reported having been raped by Sho. They say both men have confessed
to killing Lightfoot.
	   At a news conference, government pathologist Mario Estadrabran
said Lightfoot apparently struggled with her attackers before she
was stabbed in the neck.
	   ``She died right away. And after she died right away, the
assailants were trying to make sure that she died and they made
repeated, superficial injuries to different parts of her body,'' he
said.
	   Police say the murder weapon, a 4-inch (10-centimeter) knife,
has been recovered.
	   The two suspects are being held without bail.
	   Raleigh International has recalled its entire 17-member team
building classrooms at San Pablo.

Congo's war creates divisiveness at Nonaligned Movement summit
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DURBAN, South Africa (AP) _ In a surprise appearance at the
Nonaligned Movement summit, Congo President Laurent Kabila has
brought divisiveness into a gathering of 53 heads of government, a
rift the U.N's top negotiator hopes to solve.
	   During a speech Wednesday, Kabila accused neighboring Rwanda and
Uganda of invading his vast Central African country. Since at least
six countries are involved in the Congo war, U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan is shuttling from leader to leader, trying to calm
tempers.
	   Underscoring his hostility toward mediation efforts spearheaded
by South Africa, Kabila bypassed President Nelson Mandela as he was
greeting the leaders who arrived for the summit Wednesday.
	   Kabila then took the podium to ask the leaders of developing
nations to ``unequivocally condemn the aggression'' of Uganda and
Rwanda and request their troops' withdrawal from Congo.
	   ``At this very moment, my country fellows in occupied territory
are being assassinated, women are being raped and children are
being used as cannon fodder,'' Kabila said, wearing his trademark
safari suit and reading through thick glasses.
	   Kabila also promised to hold fair elections by 1999.
	   Hours later, Annan held talks here with Kabila, and with
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe and Namibian President Sam
Nujoma, both of whose countries have troops fighting alongside
Kabila's.
	   But chances that Annan could hold joint talks with all the
factions on Thursday were slim. Nujoma was leaving the summit
Wednesday night and Kabila said he didn't know if he wanted to have
any more discussions.
	   The presidents of Uganda and Rwanda deny their forces are
helping Congo rebels, but senior U.S. diplomat Princeton Lyman, a
guest at the summit, indicated Rwanda and Uganda do have troops in
Congo.
	   ``There are foreign troops on both sides, and that's got to be
recognized, and a plan for withdrawing them has to be part of the
(peace) process,'' Lyman told The Associated Press.
	   Lyman said his delegation was asking all parties involved in the
Congo war to come to an agreement that includes a cease-fire, the
withdrawal of foreign troops, a broadening of the government in
Congo to be more representative and a plan to deal with the
humanitarian situation.
	   Annan, addressing the summit, appealed for Africa's leaders to
solve their problems through political and not military means.
	   ``For every day that we fail to do so, the innocent people of
this continent pay a terrible price,'' Annan said.
	   He cited trouble spots including Congo and Angola, where he said
the U.N.-brokered peace process is ``hanging by a thread.''
	   Another issue dominating the Nonaligned Movement, created in the
1950s to fend off supperpower domination, was nuclear weapons.
	   India was pushing for the Nonaligned Movement to recognize it as
a nuclear power _ a status shared by five other nations, according
to Lyman and another source at the summit.
	   If India _ which along with Pakistan tested nuclear weapons this
year _ is declared a nuclear power, it could argue it doesn't have
to dispose of its nuclear weapons as called for by the nuclear
nonproliferation treaty, Lyman said.

Report: Iraq must prioritize its purchases
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS dropped ``billion'' in graf 7 &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Despite being allowed to pump dlrs 5.26
billion in oil over six months under a special U.N. program, Iraq
is only expected to produce dlrs 2.86 billion because of low oil
prices and its dilapidated pumping facilities, the U.N. chief said
in a report.
	   Wednesday's report confirmed what U.N. and Iraqi officials had
predicted for months. But it represented the first solid figure of
Iraq's expected capability for the second half of the year to buy
badly needed food and medicine for its 22 million people suffering
under U.N. sanctions.
	   Because of the shortfall, U.N. officials have begun discussions
with Baghdad to prioritize its humanitarian purchases,
Secretary-General Kofi Annan said in the report to the Security
Council.
	   Though it's up to Baghdad to decide what to buy, U.N. officials
and western diplomats are emphasizing the need to give priority to
food, medicine and spare parts to improve Iraq's oil
infrastructure, officials said.
	   Iraq has been barred from selling oil _ its economic mainstay _
on the open market since sanctions were imposed after Baghdad
invaded Kuwait in 1990. A unique U.N. program, called oil-for-food,
was launched in 1996 to allow Iraq to sell its oil in exchange for
humanitarian goods.
	   The Security Council, citing the need to better provide for
Iraqis, agreed in February to increase the amount of oil Iraq could
sell over six months from dlrs 2.14 billion to dlrs 5.26 billion.
	   Of the dlrs 2.86 billion Iraq is expected to pump in the second
half of the year, only dlrs 1.79 billion is expected to be spent on
humanitarian goods, Annan said. According to U.N. resolutions, 34
cents of every oil-for-food dollar go for Gulf War reparations and
administrative costs.
	   Iraq has complained about delays in contract approvals and
deliveries of goods. On Wednesday, an Iraqi health official said
that less than 1 percent of the dlrs 200 million in medical
supplies that Baghdad was permitted to buy during the first six
months of 1998 had arrived in the country.
	   U.N. spokesman Eric Falt acknowledged that medicine deliveries
were ``slower than expected,'' but said dlrs 17 million, or 9
percent of the medical supplies, arrived during the third phase.
	   The head of the oil-for-food program, Benon Sevan, is expected
to brief the Security Council on Annan's report Friday.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's military was put on an increased level of
alert Thursday to prepare for a second ballistic missile test
launch by North Korea, possibly within a matter of days.
	   Defense Agency spokesman Hiromitsu Kuwano said Japan's military
had upgraded its level of alertness against any possible test. He
declined to comment specifically on what sort of measures Japan is
taking.
	   Kyodo News said military ships were being dispatched to the Sea
of Japan to monitor any possible missile launch.
	   Kuwano refused to confirm that report.
	   Japanese media also quoted Hiromu Nonaka, chief Cabinet
secretary, as saying the government had information the launch
could be conducted as early as Saturday.
	   It was not immediately clear where the information came from.
	   On Monday, North Korea test fired a Taepo Dong 1 ballistic
missile that flew across northern Japan and crashed into the
Pacific Ocean. The first stage, or booster, of the missile landed
in the Sea of Japan.
	   That test sent shockwaves through the region because it
demonstrated North Korea now has the capability to strike any part
of Japan, including U.S. military bases around the country.
	   Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi and other government leaders were
expected to answer questions in Parliament later Thursday on how
Japan will respond to the North Korean test launch.
	   Japanese media urged strong action Thursday to discourage North
Korea from further escalating tensions in the region.
	   ``Japan must prevent this rogue nation from taking even more
extreme action,'' the mass-circulation Yomiuri Shimbun said in an
editorial.

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Tropical Storm Isis grew into a hurricane
Wednesday in the Gulf of California, drenching both the Baja
California peninsula and the Mexican mainland.
	   The storm forced residents from their homes, knocked out power
and phone service and killed at least one person.
	   As of 2400 GMT the storm was 65 miles (104 kilometers) south of
Los Mochis on the mainland and heading north at 12 mph (19 kph),
the U.S. National Weather Service in Miami reported. Forecasters
said it may veer slightly to the west, moving up the Gulf of
California
	   One woman was killed and her husband was missing after they
tried to cross a stream in Los Cabos on the southern tip of the
peninsula, said Emigdio Suarez Aguilar, a civil protection official
in Baja California Sur state. The body of Josefina Espinosa
Agundez, 48, has been recovered. Her husband is presumed dead.
	   Reports that a family was missing in the state capital of La Paz
were false, Suarez Aguilar said.
	   The government news agency Notimex reported that 2,500 people
have been placed in shelters in the state.
	   ``It's tremendously bad,'' said Leopoldo Zazueta, a receptionist
at the Presidente Intercontinental Hotel in San Jose del Cabo _ one
of the few in the area that could be reached by telephone on
Wednesday.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's military was put on an increased level of
alert Thursday to prepare for a second ballistic missile test
launch by North Korea, possibly within a matter of days.
	   Defense Agency spokesman Hiromitsu Kuwano said Japan's military
had upgraded its level of alertness against any possible test.
	   He declined to comment specifically on what sort of measures
Japan is taking, or what information Japan had indicating a launch
was planned.
	   But South Korea's Yonhap News Agency, quoting an unidentified
government source, said launch preparations had been spotted by
U.S. military satellites and reconnaissance planes.
	   The report did not give further details and Park No-yol, a
Defense Ministry spokesman, said he was unable to confirm it.
	   Japan's Kyodo News, meanwhile, said military ships were being
dispatched to the Sea of Japan to monitor any possible missile
launch. Kuwano refused to confirm that report.
	   Hiromu Nonaka, chief Cabinet secretary, said the government was
concerned the North might conduct a second launch to coincide with
the convening of its national congress on Saturday or the country's
national day celebrations next Wednesday.
	   He said Japan is trying to dissuade the North from further
launches through diplomatic channels.
	   ``But they are rejecting our protests,'' he said.
	   On Monday, North Korea test fired a Taepo Dong 1 ballistic
missile that flew across northern Japan and crashed into the

	   BLANDFORD, Nova Scotia (AP) _ A Swissair jetliner has reportedly
crashed near the tiny community of Blandford on Nova Scotia's South
Shore.
	   There were no immediate reports of fatalities. It was unclear if
the plane went down on land or water, according to the Canadian
Press news agency.
	   ``The whole house shook like something bumped against it,'' said
a woman who lives in Blandford.
	   ``A plane went over here so low I went down to check on the
children because I was afraid it would wake them,'' she said.
	   Fifty ambulances were sent to the scene and at least 100 people
were reportedly on board the aircraft, according to CP.

Dollar higher against yen, Japanese stocks lower
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with midday stock, late morning bond and currency
prices.

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar fell against the yen in early
trading Thursday on concern over speculation that foreign funds
were dumping dollar holdings. Japanese stocks declined.
	   The dollar bought 137.46 yen in early trading, down 0.16 yen
from late Wednesday in Tokyo and slightly below its late New York
level of 137.50 yen overnight.
	   Word that unnamed U.S.-based funds had placed dollar sale orders
around 138.50 yen weighed on the American currency, traders said.
	   The dollar was also pushed lower following yen-bullish comments
from Japanese officials early Thursday, they said.
	   Eisuke Sakakibara, the Japanese Finance Ministry's vice minister
for international affairs, said the yen may strengthen further. And
the head of the ministry's international bureau, Haruhiko Kuroda,
said, ``(The yen) must go up much, much more ... It is still not
nearly corrected.''
	   Meanwhile, Tokyo stocks slipped in early trading Thursday
because of lingering uncertainty over the movement of stock markets
around the world after recent instability.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 144.95 points,
or 1.0 percent, to 14,231.67 as of midday. On Wednesday, the index
had gained 6.99 points, or 0.05 percent.
	   Overnight on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average
dropped 45.06 _ or 0.6 percent _ at 7,782.37, after climbing as
high as 7,952.56 earlier in the day.
	   The drop came a day after the Dow made gains and buoyed spirits
on Tuesday when it stemmed a plunge of 1,000 points from the
previous three days.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section of the exchange was down 4.95 points, or 0.42
percent, to 1,113.81. The TOPIX rose 8.61 points, or 0.78 percent,
the previous day.
	   Hitachi was among the biggest losers. The company reversed a
previous net profit forecast for the fiscal year through March to a
net loss _ the first red ink ever for the leading electronics
manufacturer.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese government
bond was at 1.065 percent, unchanged from Tuesday's finish. Its
price also remained at 112.66 yen.

Japan's Hitachi to post first-ever loss for full year
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Hitachi Ltd., one of Japan's biggest electronics
manufacturers, said Thursday that it expects to fall into the red
for the first time ever due to sluggish sales and shrinking profit
margins.
	   The Tokyo-based company said it now forecasts a group net loss
of 250 billion yen (U.S. dlrs 1.81 billion) in the fiscal year
through next March, reversing an earlier estimate for a 40 billion
yen (dlrs 290 million) net profit.
	   Hitachi blamed its woes on a deterioration in prices for
computer memory chips, falling demand for consumer electronics and
personal computers and increased restructuring costs.
	   The company's fortunes appear to have worsened considerably
since May when it announced the initial profit projection and
posted a group net profit of 3.47 billion yen (dlrs 25 million) for
the fiscal year ended in March.
	   Also Thursday, Hitachi cut its consolidated sales forecast to
7.94 trillion yen (dlrs 57 billion), down 5.5 percent from a
previous estimate released in May.
	   At the parent company level, Hitachi said it expects a net loss
of 260 billion yen (dlrs 1.88 billion), down from an initial
forecast for a net profit of 20 billion yen (dlrs 145 million).
	   It also slashed its core parent revenue estimate by more than
six percent to 3.75 trillion yen (dlrs 27 billion).

Jetliner reportedly crashes in Nova Scotia

<TEXT>
	   BLANDFORD, Nova Scotia (AP) _ A Swissair jetliner has crashed
into the ocean off the coast of Nova Scotia's South Shore,
according to a local Canadian television station.
	   There were between 100 and 150 people on board of the flight
from New York, the ATV television station in nearby Blandford
reported late Wednesday night.
	   The plane tried to make an emergency water landing Wednesday
evening near the fishing village of Northwest Cove about 50 miles
(80 kilometers) from Blandford.
	   Rescue workers have not located the plane, the station reported.
	   About 300 rescuers and 50 ambulances were sent to the scene, the
station reported.
	   ``We heard the plane go over our home, then my husband and son
heard quite an explosion,'' Blandford resident Audrey Cove told The
Associated Press. She said she was sleeping at the time of the
crash.
	   Her husband is a member of the auxiliary coast guard and was
called out to search for the plane.
	   Local fishermen were being called into the area because they
know the waters best, she said.
	   There was no official comment from authorities.

	   BALTIMORE (AP) _ Rookie John Snyder pitched seven innings of
three-hit ball as the Chicago White Sox beat Baltimore 3-2 on
Wednesday night, extending the Orioles' losing streak to a
season-high 10 games.
	   The 10-game skid is the Orioles' worst since they lost 21
straight to open the 1988 season. They fell below .500 for the
first time since July 26.
	   Snyder (5-2) struck out one and walked one as Chicago registered
its second three-game sweep of the Orioles in a nine-day span _ the
first in Baltimore since June 1996.
	   Carlos Castillo pitched the eighth, and Bob Howry got three outs
for his fourth save. Albert Belle drove in his 126th run and walked
twice for the White Sox, whose four-game winning streak matches
their season high.
	   Alan Mills (1-4) took the loss.
 &UR; Angels 13, Indians 5
	   In Cleveland, Randy Velarde homered and had four hits as the
Anaheim Angels rocked Bartolo Colon with seven runs in the first
two innings.
	   Gregg Jefferies tied his career high with four hits and drove in
three runs, and Jim Edmonds had three hits including a 415-foot,
three-run homer in the second _ a crushing blow to sputtering
Cleveland.
	   Colon (13-8) had his shortest outing this year and second
shortest of his career, lasting one inning plus five batters. He
allowed seven runs and nine hits. He is 4-4 with a 5.94 ERA since
appearing in his first All-Star game.
	   The AL West-leading Angels matched their season high with 21
hits.
	   Knuckleballer Steve Sparks (9-2) held Cleveland at bay until
allowing two runs in the seventh, the first on Manny Ramirez's 35th
homer.
 &UR; Rangers 5, Tigers 3 &QC; 
	   In Detroit, Ivan Rodriguez snapped a 1-for-11 slump with two
hits, including a two-run homer that helped Texas beat Detroit.
	   Rick Helling (17-7) gave up one run on six hits with four walks
and seven strikeouts over 6 1-3 innings, becoming the first Texas
pitcher since Kenny Rogers in 1995 to win 17 games.
	   John Wetteland pitched the ninth for his 39th save. He allowed a
run on Bobby Higginson's sacrifice fly.
	   Brian Moehler (12-12), who started the season 9-0 at home, lost
his fifth straight decision and dropped to 9-3 in Tiger Stadium.
 &UR; Red Sox 7, Mariners 3 &QC; 
	   In Boston, Nomar Garciaparra hit a ninth-inning grand slam to
join Mark McGwire as one of five players to hit 30 homers in each
of his first two seasons.
	   Boston overcame a 3-0 deficit and a 15-hit attack and won with
just six hits to maintain an eight-game lead over Texas in the AL
wild-card race.
	   The winning burst against Bobby Ayala (1-10) began when third
baseman Russ Davis dropped a backhanded stab at Mike Benjamin's
grounder for an error. Darren Lewis walked, the runners moved up on
Darren Bragg's sacrifice bunt and Mo Vaughn was walked
intentionally.
	   Garciaparra, who had 30 homers last year, hit his first career
grand slam into the screen above the left-field wall. Rudy York,
Ron Kittle and Jose Canseco also had at least 30 homers in each of
their first two seasons.
	   Benjamin also homered for Boston for support of Tom Gordon
(7-3).
	   Jay Buhner homered for Seattle.
 &UR; Devil Rays 4, Twins 1 &QC; 
	   In Minneapolis, Quinton McCracken extended his team-record
hitting streak to 15 games and doubled home the go-ahead run in the
seventh as Tampa Bay beat Minnesota.
	   McCracken, who singled in the fifth, broke a 1-1 tie in the
seventh. Miguel Cairo led off with a triple that left fielder Marty
Cordova lost in the lights and McCracken doubled against LaTroy
Hawkins (7-13).
	   With one out in the ninth, McCracken hit a ground ball that
shortstop Pat Meares misplayed for an error, allowing two runs to
score.
	   Esteban Yan (5-4) pitched 2 1-3 innings for the victory. Albie
Lopez pitched a scoreless ninth for his first major league save.
 &UR; Blue Jays 5, Royals 0 &QC; 
	   In Kansas City, Missouri, Toronto's Kelvim Escobar limited
Kansas City to four hits in 8 1-3 innings and Alex Gonzalez hit his
12th homer.
	   Escobar (4-2) struck out seven _ including five straight in the
fourth and fifth innings _ in his second consecutive victory over
Kansas City. He beat the Royals 11-1 last week in Toronto.
	   The Blue Jays have won six straight to improve to 73-66, the
first time they've been seven games over .500 since April 1994.
	   Jose Rosado (7-11) was the loser.

McGwire hits two more homers as Cardinals rout Marlins
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MIAMI (AP) _ Mark McGwire hit a pair of home runs for the second
consecutive night Wednesday against Florida, giving him a
career-best 59. He needs just two more to tie Roger Maris'
37-year-old U.S. Major League Baseball record.
	   McGwire homered in the seventh inning against Brian Edmondson
and again in the eighth on the first pitch from Rob Stanifer. Each
was a two-run homer, helping the St. Louis Cardinals win 14-4.
	   The first homer, which landed halfway up in the upper deck in
left field, was estimated at 497 feet (149 meters), making it the
third-longest in the history of Pro Player Stadium. The second
homer was to left center and traveled an estimated 458 feet (137
meters).
	   In his first three at-bats, McGwire grounded into a double play,
walked twice and scored on pitcher Kent Mercker's grand slam in the
fourth. Mercker (9-11) allowed two earned runs in seven innings.
	   Jesus Sanchez (6-8) took the loss. Mark Kotsay homered for
Florida.
 &UR; Astros 4, Braves 2 &QC; 
	   In Atlanta, Houston's Randy Johnson dominated Atlanta for eight
innings and easily won the showdown with four-time Cy Young winner
Greg Maddux.
	   Johnson allowed only four hits and fanned 10, the 99th time he's
reached double figures in strikeouts, second in baseball history to
Nolan Ryan's 215.
	   Johnson (6-1) batted in the ninth and began warming up for the
final inning before feeling a cramp in his left leg. The trainer
came out and then walked back to the dugout with Johnson at his
side.
	   The Astros ace retired 14 of the last 15 hitters he faced. Billy
Wagner worked the ninth for his 27th save despite giving up a homer
to Andruw Jones.
	   The Astros pounded Maddux (17-7) for 10 hits in seven innings,
scoring all of their runs on three homers. Jeff Bagwell hit his
29th homer in the second, Craig Biggio put the Astros head for good
with a two-run drive in the fifth, and Sean Berry hit a leadoff
shot in the seventh.
 &UR; Cubs 4, Reds 2 &QC; 
	   In Chicago, Sammy Sosa hit his 56th homer to tie Hack Wilson's
68-year-old club record and Gary Gaetti added a two-run shot for
Chicago.
	   Sosa, leading off the bottom of the sixth, hit an 0-1 pitch from
Cincinnati's Jason Bere into the first row of the right-field
bleachers.
	   Glenallen Hill singled with one out in the eighth off Gabe White
(5-5) and Gaetti hit a 3-0 pitch into the left-field bleachers for
his 14th homer and third since joining the Cubs on Aug. 19. One out
later, Scott Servais hit his seventh homer to give the Cubs a
two-run cushion.
	   Felix Heredia (2-3), who gave up a two-run double to Dmitri
Young that put the Reds ahead 2-1 in the top of the eighth, got the
win. Rod Beck pitched the ninth for his 42nd save.
 &UR; Giants 12, Expos 3 &QC; 
	   In San Francisco, Barry Bonds hit his fourth home run in four
games and Jeff Kent had two doubles and four RBIs for San
Francisco.
	   Bonds' 32nd home run of the season, a three-run shot into the
upper-deck in right off reliever Shayne Bennett made it 12-2 in the
fifth inning. Bonds, who went 3-for-3, also had an RBI single in
the second.
	   Kirk Rueter (14-9) gave up two runs and five hits in 5 1-3
innings to pick up the win. Javier Vazquez (4-14) took the loss.
	   Mike Mordecai homered for Montreal.
 &UR; Diamondbacks 2, Pirates 1, 11 innings &QC; 
	   In Pittsburgh, Tony Batista hit a tying home run in the ninth,
then tripled and scored on Devon White's single in the 11th as
Arizona beat Pittsburgh for a team-record five-game winning streak.
	   Batista led off the 11th with a triple into the right-field
corner off reliever Jeff Tabaka (2-2). White singled to left for
the go-ahead run.
	   Aaron Small (3-0) pitched the 10th as Arizona improved its
extra-innings record to 5-2. Gregg Olson pitched the 11th for his
25th save.
	   Batista tied it with a one-out home run in the ninth off Pirates
closer Ricardo Rincon, who blew his third consecutive save chance.
 &UR; Brewers 8, Rockies 4 &QC; 
	   In Milwaukee, Jeff Cirillo, Dave Nilsson and Jeromy Burnitz hit
two-run homers in Milwaukee's victory over Colorado.
	   Burnitz's 31st homer capped a five-run sixth that put Milwaukee
ahead 7-2. Rafael Roque (3-1) allowed two runs on five hits in six
innings.
	   Pedro Astacio (11-14) gave up seven runs on six hits in six
innings.
	   Kirt Manwaring homered for Colorado.

Chinese premier calls for shelter for flood victims in far north
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Premier Zhu Rongji is demanding China give
priority to helping flood victims in the far northeast survive the
long, bitter winter that will arrive soon, state media reported
Thursday.
	   The worst flooding in decades in the northeast and central
China's Yangtze River basin has killed more than 3,000 people
nationwide and left millions homeless, by the government's count.
Floodwaters were not expected to recede for weeks.
	   In the northeast, temperatures at night already are down to 10
degrees (50 degrees Fahrenheit), and winter weather will arrive in
less than a month. State media has reported that at least a million
northeasterners face the prospect of spending the winter in tents,
where temperatures in January drop to minus 32 (minus 26
Fahrenheit).
	   The premier, who returned Wednesday from a six-day visit to the
northern flood zones, said bank loans, donations and government
subsidies should be used for housing construction.
	   Flood victims will need to rely on grain they borrow from the
government or earn by bartering their labor, and they will mainly
depend on donated winter clothing, Zhu was quoted as saying by the
state-run Xinhua News Agency.
	   The Red Cross appealed Wednesday for an additional dlrs 5.2
million to provide water purification tablets, medicine, food and
quilts for 2 million flood victims in China.
	   Chinese officials have warned that conditions along the Yangtze,
where the weather is still hot, were ripe for disease. Flood
victims and livestock are crowded together in camps, sanitation is
poor and drinking water is limited.
	   Chinese medical teams working in the flood zones have been able
to prevent epidemics, but report an increase in cases of intestinal
ailments.
	   Food was another concern. Flooding this summer heavily damaged
vegetable fields in the Yangtze basin and in the northeast. Despite
government-ordered controls, prices of vegetables in the flood-hit
areas have gone up by 70 percent to 80 percent, China Daily
reported.
	   The government will guarantee a basic supply of vegetables in
the flood areas from other parts of the country, but greens are
scarce and cost twice the normal amount in flooded areas, it said.

Thai manager resigns after Tiger Cup match disgrace
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ The team manager of Thailand's national
soccer squad has resigned in disgrace following a Tiger Cup match
against Indonesia in which neither side played to win.
	   The poor performance drew outcries from fans and unspecified
fines, though demands that the teams should be expelled from the
rest of the Southeast Asian tournament were rejected.
	   Teerachai Wutitham, the Thai team manager, accepted
responsibility for Thailand and announced his resignation Wednesday
in Hanoi, Vietnam, the tournament's host country.
	   ``When things that are unacceptable to the public occur, it is
inevitable that someone has to take responsibility,'' Teerachai was
quoted as saying in the Bangkok newspaper, The Nation.
	   Teerachai apologized to Thai fans and urged them to stop
criticism of the team or the players would be demoralized in the
semifinal Thursday night against Vietnam.
	   The resignation was tendered to the Football Association of
Thailand and was accepted by President Vijit Getkaew, who asked
Teerachai to stay on until the tournament ends.
	   An FAT official said Thursday that no decision had been made
about a replacement. Vijit said he would call a meeting Sept. 9 to
determine what happened and the players would be closely
questioned.
	   In their final group match in Ho Chi Minh City, neither Thailand
nor Indonesia wanted to win, since the victor would have to play
before a highly partisan Vietnam crowd in Hanoi in the semifinals.
	   In one of the most bizarre moments in soccer history, Indonesia
scored an intentional own goal in the final seconds, handing
Thailand an unwanted 3-2 victory.
	   Vijit tried to lift responsibility from the players, whom he
said ``lacked experience.''
	   ``They just wanted the best thing for the team without realizing
the damage,'' Vijit was quoted as saying by the Bangkok Post. ``
	   Vijit said that the match showed ``lack of sportsmanship'' but
didn't think that suspension by Asian or world soccer authorities
would be warranted.
	   Teerachai has been Thailand's team manager since early 1997 and
helped the team win the Southeast Asian Games gold medal in
Jakarta.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Fire-Fusion; will be updated with late games &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   EAST RUTHERFORD, New Jersey (AP) _ First-half goals by Joe-Max
Moore and Edwin Gorter carried the New England Revolution to a 2-0
Major League Soccer victory over the New York-New Jersey MetroStars
on Wednesday.
	   The victory gave New England coach Walter Zenga, who replaced
Thomas Rongen on Aug. 24, his first professional win. It also
snapped a two-game Revolution losing streak, moved New England out
of the cellar in the MLS Eastern Conference with a 9-19 record good
for 23 points and kept its slim post-season hopes alive.
	   The MetroStars, who had already clinched a post-season berth,
suffered their third straight setback, losing for the fourth time
in their last five games. New York-New Jersey is now 14-14 with 38
points and remained in third place in the MLS East.
 &UR; Fire 3, Fusion 2
	   In Chicago, rookie Josh Wolff broke a 2-2 tie with his fourth
MLS goal in the 84th minute as the Chicago Fire defeated the Miami
Fusion.
	   The Fire (17-10) won both games this season against the league's
other expansion club.
	   Wolff knocked a rebound into the net after Fusion goalie Matt
Napoleon had made two diving saves just a minute earlier.
	   Ante Razov gave Chicago a 2-0 lead in the first half. He scored
in the 19th minute on a cross by Roman Kosecki and in the 30th
minute with an assist by Jerzy Podbrozny.
	   Miami (13-14) rallied on goals by rookie Tyrone Marshall and
midfielder Henry Gutierrez. Marshall took a pass from Diego Serna
in the 63rd minute and dribbled around Fire goalie Jorge Campos for
his first career goal. Five minutes later, Gutierrez scored on a

Sacked deputy prime minister awaits possible criminal charges

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia's sacked deputy prime
minister remained holed up at his home Thursday awaiting possible
criminal charges.
	   Anwar Ibrahim, who was also finance minister, was sacked
Wednesday after months of bitter political differences with Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad.
	   The firing came a day after Mahathir imposed rigid currency
controls, virtually isolating the Southeast Asian country from the
global free-market system.
	   It also comes just as Malaysia prepares to host the 16th
Commonwealth Games and welcome Queen Elizabeth II for an official
state visit later this month.
	   Dozens of reporters were held in check by police at the criminal
court building in downtown Kuala Lumpur Thursday as speculation
spread Anwar would be charged under the country's Internal Security
Act. The law allows suspects to be held without trial if deemed a
threat to national security.
	   Malaysia's police chief, Rahim Noor, told a press conference
late Wednesday night that Anwar was under investigation on charges
contained in a book that has widespread allegations about sexual
misconduct.
	   When also asked to comment on rumors that Anwar had been accused
of leaking classified information, Rahim would only say that
Anwar's offices had been sealed by police ``so as to ensure that
government documents are not removed.''
	   The authors of the book, ``50 Reasons Why Anwar Shouldn't Be
Prime Minister,'' are currently being tried for defamation. Anwar,
who is married and has six children, has vehemently denied all
charges of sexual affairs.
	   Some political observers saw the book as a part of a campaign to
humiliate Anwar and push him to resign, which he reportedly had
resisted for weeks.
	   An aide to the prime minister said the Supreme Council of the
ruling United Malays National Organization would meet Thursday to
discuss Anwar's position in the party. Anwar is UMNO vice
president, though it was likely he would be stripped of the post.
	   A close friend and longtime UMNO member said Anwar supporters
were devastated by the political events.
	   ``He made a huge mistake by mixing with the wrong people,'' said
the well-known attorney who asked not to be identified. ``He
discarded his old friends and relied on untrustworthy people.''
	   The 51-year-old Anwar, for years seen as Mahathir's successor,
had been left out of economic decisions for months after differing
with his boss on the course for economic recovery.
	   Malaysia's currency, the ringgit, and the markets have plummeted
since the Asian economic crisis broke out in July 1997. The
country's economy, which boasted 8 percent growth for the last
decade, formally went into recession last week after its economy
shrank another 6.8 percent.
	   Anwar and the central bank had preferred high interest rates and
austerity measures to control Malaysia's sliding currency. Mahathir
and his chief economic aide, Daim Zainuddin, have pushed through a
policy of greater government spending and lower rates to boost the
economy.
	   Although Mahathir has never publicly blamed his finance minister
for the economic mess, he openly said the tight monetary policies
of the central bank were not going to deliver recovery.
	   The unprecedented political conflict sent Asian currencies
falling against the U.S. dollar Thursday. The Singapore dollar has
proved most vulnerable to the uncertainty, dropping steeply in
early trading.

Revolution, Fire and Rapids post victories
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Rapids-Wizards; will be updated with late game &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   EAST RUTHERFORD, New Jersey (AP) _ First-half goals by Joe-Max
Moore and Edwin Gorter carried the New England Revolution to a 2-0
Major League Soccer victory over the New York-New Jersey MetroStars
on Wednesday.
	   The victory gave New England coach Walter Zenga, who replaced
Thomas Rongen on Aug. 24, his first professional win. It also
snapped a two-game Revolution losing streak, moved New England out
of the cellar in the MLS Eastern Conference with a 9-19 record good
for 23 points and kept its slim post-season hopes alive.
	   The MetroStars, who had already clinched a post-season berth,
suffered their third straight setback, losing for the fourth time
in their last five games. New York-New Jersey is now 14-14 with 38
points and remained in third place in the MLS East.
 &UR; Fire 3, Fusion 2
	   In Chicago, rookie Josh Wolff broke a 2-2 tie with his fourth
MLS goal in the 84th minute as the Chicago Fire defeated the Miami
Fusion.
	   The Fire (17-10) won both games this season against the league's
other expansion club.
	   Wolff knocked a rebound into the net after Fusion goalie Matt
Napoleon had made two diving saves just a minute earlier.
	   Ante Razov gave Chicago a 2-0 lead in the first half. He scored
in the 19th minute on a cross by Roman Kosecki and in the 30th
minute with an assist by Jerzy Podbrozny.
	   Miami (13-14) rallied on goals by rookie Tyrone Marshall and
midfielder Henry Gutierrez. Marshall took a pass from Diego Serna
in the 63rd minute and dribbled around Fire goalie Jorge Campos for
his first career goal. Five minutes later, Gutierrez scored on a
header with assists from Leo Cullen and Pablo Mastroeni.
 &UR; Rapids 3, Wizards 2
	   In Denver, second-half substitute Wolde Harris scored two goals
and added an assist to lead the Colorado Rapids to a victory over
the Kansas City Wizards.
	   Ross Paule scored the game-winner on a give-and-go with Harris
in the 84th minute as the Rapids (13-15, 35 points) took control of
third place in the Western Conference with a six-point swing
against the fifth-place Wizards (11-17, 29 points).
	   The Wizards took a 1-0 lead in the first half on a goal by
Digital Takawira, assisted by Paul Rideout and Preki. Takawira has
scored 10 goals in 13 career games against Colorado.
	   Harris, who entered the match in the 59th minute, tied the score
at 1-1 with an assist from Adrian Paz in the 72nd minute. Colorado
took a 2-1 lead five minutes later when a shot by Paz deflected off
Harris and beat Wizards goalkeeper Mike Ammann inside the near
post.
	   The Wizards tied the score at 2-2 in the 83rd minute when Mark
Chung scored his second goal in as many games. Twenty seconds
later, Paule netted the winning goal.

	   BLANDFORD, Nova Scotia (AP) _ A SwissAir jetliner flying from
New York to Geneva has crashed in the Atlantic Ocean off the coast
of Nova Scotia, a Canadian rescue official said.
	   There was no word on survivors.
	   Swissair Flight 111 was flying Wednesday night with 213
passengers and a crew of 14 when it declared an emergency at 10:30
p.m. EDT (0230 GMT), Lt. Cmdr. Glenn Chamberlain of the Halifax
Rescue Coordination Center.
	   The flight left New York's Kennedy Airport at 8:30 p.m. EDT
(0030 GMT)
	   The plane attempted an emergency landing at the Halifax Airport
and disappeared moments later, he said.
	   The plane is believed to have crashed about seven miles (11
kilometers) south of Peggy's Cove on Nova Scotia's South Shore.
	   A Hercules, two Labrador helicopters and several coast guard
vessels were on their way to the scene. Witnesses said emergency
crews were scouring the area.
	   Up to 50 ambulances were en route to the area.
	   The plane was reportedly an MD-11, authorities said.
	   Lt. Cmdr. Mike Considine of the search and rescue center said
the weather in the area had been good, with clear skies and
relatively calm seas.
	   ``We heard the plane go over our home, then my husband and son
heard quite an explosion,'' Blandford resident Audrey Bachman told
The Associated Press. She said she was sleeping at the time of the
crash.
	   Her husband is a member of the auxiliary coast guard and was
called out to search for the plane.
	   Local fishermen were being called into the area because they
know the waters best, she said.

Philippine police investigating bomb threat at U.S. Embassy

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine Defense Secretary Orlando
Mercado said Thursday police are investigating a bomb threat at the
U.S. Embassy in Manila but added there was no cause for alarm.
	   Police blocked off a lane of the boulevard which passes in front
of the seaside embassy and added more men to guard the area
following the threat.
	   Kuwait's Interior Ministry said Wednesday that a handwritten
note was found in a plane that arrived from Dubai warning of a bomb
attack on the U.S. Embassy in Manila on Friday.
	   U.S. Embassy spokesman Tom Skippers said security at the embassy
has been heightened following the threat and the Aug. 7 bombings of
American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.
	   After the bomb attacks, Americans worldwide were advised to take
extra precautions, he said.
	   Mercado said without elaborating that there was no immediate
danger resulting from the threat against the embassy.
	   Police had previously tightened security at the embassy after
the bombings of the U.S. embassies in Africa.
	   Cars parked near the embassy are being randomly checked, two
police assault teams have been posted nearby, and patrol cars are
scouring the area, police said. Security was also tightened at
other U.S. facilities, including the residence of U.S. Ambassador
Thomas Hubbard.
	   At Manila's international airport, security officials said they
have tightened screenings of passengers, baggage and planes.
Airline officials said all baggage arriving at the airport is being
X-rayed.
	   The threat of a bomb attack on the embassy Friday coincides with
a planned protest by a newly formed group of Filipino Muslims
called the Philippine Task Force Against U.S. Aggression.
	   Firdausi Abbas, a leader of the group, said it will demonstrate
in front of the embassy to condemn the U.S. missile attacks on
Sudan and Afghanistan following the Aug. 7 bombings of the U.S.
embassies.
	   Abbas said the group will ask the U.N. Security Council to
investigate the U.S. attacks.
	   Following the African embassy attacks, U.S. President Clinton
ordered missile strikes on several sites in Sudan and Afghanistan
in what U.S. officials said was an attempt to weaken the terrorist
network of Saudi millionaire Osama bin Laden, who is suspected of
plotting the attacks.

Kashmiri separatist group admits getting help from Taliban
</HEADLINE>
fighters &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ For the first time in the nine-year
separatist campaign in Kashmir, a top guerrilla group has admitted
that Taliban fighters from Afghanistan are helping its rebels fight
Indian soldiers, a newspaper reported Thursday.
	   On Wednesday, the Harkat-ul-Mujahedeen group said in a statement
that fighters from the extremist Taliban religious militia that
controls most of Afghanistan were its ``guests'' in Kashmir and
they were coming in large numbers now, The Asian Age newspaper
reported.
	   Pakistan-based Harkat, declared a terrorist organization by the
United States, also has said several of its members were killed in
last month's U.S. missile attack on alleged militant training camps
in Afghanistan.
	   For years, New Delhi has said that Muslim militants from
Pakistan and Afghanistan are fighting along with Kashmiri
separatists in the Himalayan territory that has been the central
dispute between India and Pakistan for 50 years.
	   Pakistan has repeatedly denied the charge; Afghanistan's
successive fragile governments have not commented.
	   Indian-held Kashmir is the only predominately Muslim state in
this mostly Hindu country. Kashmir is divided between India and
officially Islamic Pakistan, and both countries claim the region in
its entirety.
	   The secessionist campaign has left more than 16,000 people dead
so far. Dozens of rebel groups, some of them with just a handful of
members, have set off bombs, hurled grenades and opened fire on
soldiers and civilians in Kashmir.

Indonesian government scraps subsidies on some staple foods
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) - The government has lifted subsidies on
wheat flour, sugar and soybeans and said private companies were
free to import the staple foods.
	   Trade and Industry Minister Rahardi Ramelan said Wednesday that
the government won't allow any monopolistic practices in the
provision and trade of such commodities.
	   Indonesia is grappling with its worst economic crisis in
decades, blamed partly on a web of alleged corruption in business
while former President Suharto was in power. He quit in May after
riots and student protests.
	   Under a deal with the International Monetary Fund, Indonesia is
opening up its economy in exchange for billions of dollars in aid.
After decades of economic growth, prices and unemployment are
soaring.
	   Rahardi said the scrapping of some subsidies was effective
immediately and that the move was ``aimed at reducing inflation.''
	   He said the government also decided to gradually lift the
subsidy on cooking oil in order to stabilize its price in the
domestic market.
	   The government had been buying cooking oil from private
companies at a weekly tender up until two weeks ago, and then
selling it at a discount to cooperatives to distribute it.
	   On rice, the government said it would remove Bulog, the state
logistics agency, as the controller of the domestic rice trade and
would let market forces dominate.
	   Under the most recent agreement with the IMF, Indonesia was
permitted to extend subsidies on commodities because of the
hardship suffered by millions of people slipping into poverty.
	   Originally, the subsidies were to be eliminated by Oct. 1, 1998.

Japan on alert against possible second missile test by North Korea
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with reports South Korean military on
alert, Japan condemning earlier launch, North unlikely to be
prepared to launch by Saturday &QL; 
 &UR; By JOJI SAKURAI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan and South Korean armed forces were put on an
increased level of alert Thursday to prepare for another ballistic
missile test launch by North Korea, possibly within a matter of
days.
	   Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiromu Nonaka said the
government has information the North may attempt another missile
test and is trying to dissuade the Communist state through
diplomatic channels.
	   ``They are rejecting our protests,'' he told reporters at a
regular press conference.
	   Nonaka said the government was concerned the North might conduct
a second launch to coincide with the convening of its national
congress on Saturday or the country's national day celebrations
next Wednesday.
	   Defense Agency spokesman Hiromitsu Kuwano said Japan's military
had upgraded its level of alertness against a test. He declined to
comment on what measures Japan is taking, or what information Japan
had indicating a launch was planned.
	   South Korea's Yonhap News Agency, quoting an unidentified
government source, said South Korea's military has also been placed
on coastal alert, and that launch preparations had been spotted by
U.S. military satellites and reconnaissance planes.
	   But it said the South Korean government does not believe the
North will be prepared to launch another missile in time for the
Saturday congress, when de facto leader Kim Jong-il is expected to
be formally elected president.
	   Japan's Kyodo News said military ships were being dispatched to
the Sea of Japan to monitor any possible missile launch. Defense
Agency officials refused to confirm that report.
	   North Korea sent shock waves through the region Monday when it
test fired a Taepo Dong 1 ballistic missile that flew across
northern Japan and crashed into the Pacific Ocean. The first stage,
or booster, of the missile landed in the Sea of Japan.
	   It was the first test of the new missile and sent shockwaves
through the region because it demonstrated North Korea now has the
capability to strike any part of Japan, including U.S. military
bases around the country. Nearly 50,000 U.S. troops are stationed
here.
	   Japan's upper house of Parliament unanimously adopted a
resolution Thursday condemning North Korea's test launch and
calling for the government to take strong measures against the
renegade communist state.
	   Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi and other government leaders were
expected to answer questions in Parliament later Thursday on how
Japan will respond to the North Korean test launch.
	   Tokyo has already decided to drop further talks to establish
diplomatic ties with North Korea to protest Monday's test launch.
	   It has ruled out additional food aid, suspended work on an
international project to build nuclear reactors there and canceled
all charter flights to and from the North.

Beijing tourism drops sharply this year
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Tourism in Beijing has dropped sharply as a
result of the Asian financial crisis, the state-run Xinhua News
Agency reported Thursday.
	   The number of foreign tourists visiting the Chinese capital
declined 20 percent compared with the same period last year, the
report said.
	   Japan and the United States remained the top sources of foreign
tourists, but fewer people were visiting from Southeast Asian
countries hit by economic turmoil.
	   Malaysia, for example, fell from fourth to eight place among
China's chief markets for tourism.

Jetliner crashes in Nova Scotia, 227 missing.

<TEXT>
	   BLANDFORD, Nova Scotia (AP) _ A SwissAir jetliner carrying 227
passengers from New York to Geneva crashed in the Atlantic Ocean
off the coast of Nova Scotia, a Canadian rescue official said.
	   Rescuers were searching for survivors early Thursday morning and
search planes have spotted debris and an oil slick in the area
where the plane disappeared, authorities said.
	   Swissair Flight 111 was flying Wednesday night with 213
passengers and a crew of 14 when it declared an emergency at 10:30
p.m. EDT (0230 GMT), Lt. Cmdr. Glenn Chamberlain of the Halifax
Rescue Coordination Center.
	   The flight left New York's Kennedy Airport at 8:30 p.m. EDT
(0030 GMT Thursday).
	   The plane attempted an emergency landing at the Halifax Airport
and disappeared moments later, he said.
	   The pilot reported smoke from the cabin shortly before losing
contact with the air traffic control tower in Moncton, New
Brunswick, the province bordering Nova Scotia. The plane
disappeared off the radar screen about 9:30 p.m. EDT (0130 GMT
Thursday).
	   An airport worker said the pilot dumped 208 tons of fuel over
nearby St. Margaret's Bay.
	   The plane is believed to have crashed about seven miles (11
kilometers) south of Peggy's Cove on Nova Scotia's South Shore.
	   A Hercules, two Labrador helicopters and several coast guard
vessels were on their way to the scene. Witnesses said emergency
crews were scouring the area.
	   Dozens of ambulances and fire trucks were gathered along the
coastline.
	   The plane was reportedly an MD-11, authorities said.
	   Lt. Cmdr. Mike Considine of the search and rescue center said
the weather in the area had been good, with clear skies and
relatively calm seas.
	   Witnesses reported hearing sputtering sounds before a thunderous
crash.
	   ``The motors were still going, but it was the worst-sounding
deep groan that I've ever heard,'' said Claudia Zinck-Gilroy.
	   Local fishermen were being called into the area because they
know the waters best, she said.
	   In Moscow, U.S. President Bill Clinton was told of the Swiss Air

	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ A mechanical engineer testified
Wednesday that he warned contractors that a foot bridge built to
carry athletes across a polluted river, would buckle under the
pressure of large groups of people.
	   The bridge collapsed July 14th, 1997 at the opening ceremonies
of the Maccabiah Games, an international sporting event for Jewish
athletes, sending dozens of Australians into the waters below. Four
team members died and many were injured.

Philippine exports up 21 percent in July
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine exports in July rose a
hefty 21 percent from a year earlier to dlrs 2.49 billion as sales
of electronic products surged, the government said Thursday.
	   ``The sustained growth in Philippine exports of electronics
products has kept our export growth rate one of the highest in
Asia,'' Budget Secretary Benjamin Diokno said.
	   He said Philippine export growth is expected to average 15
percent this year, more than China's 7.6 percent, India's 5.2
percent, Thailand's 3.8 percent and South Korea's 2.8 percent
forecast growth in exports.
	   For the first seven months of the year, exports rose 19 percent
from a year earlier to dlrs 16.40 billion, the National Statistics
Office said.
	   Economists welcomed the robust July export growth, but warned
that the trend may not be sustainable, owing to the global economic
slowdown.
	   The sharp fall of the peso against the dollar as a result of the
year-long currency crisis also boosted export earnings by making
Philippine products less costly overseas, economists said.
	   Electronics and components topped the list of exports with a 48
percent share of total receipts, or dlrs 1.19 billion, 51 percent
more than the year-earlier level.
	   The United States remained the top destination of Philippine
exports with a 37 percent share of shipments while Japan was in
second place with a 14 percent share.
	   Imports are announced separately by the government each month.
	   The Philippines posted its first trade surplus in nearly a
decade in June as slowing economic growth and a weaker peso dragged
down imports. The dlrs 130 million trade surplus was a dramatic
turnaround from the dlrs 903 million deficit registered a year
earlier.
	   The peso has fallen by about 38 percent against the dollar since
the start of the Asian financial crisis in July 1997.

Singapore restricts `Private Ryan' movie to age 16 and up
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ The censorship board said Thursday that parents
will not have the discretion to take children under 16 to see the
new Steven Spielberg war movie, ``Saving Private Ryan.''
	   The Film and Publications Board said it was allowing the movie
to open later this month without cuts because the ``frank
brutality, graphic scenes of violence and shocking language,'' are
essential to the portrayal of war.
	   But the board said it would not have been appropriate to
restrict the movie only to adults.
	   So for the first time since it became an option in 1992, the
board used its ``No Admission to Children Below 16'' rating. That
takes away the parental discretion that is allowed under the
``parental guidance'' or ``PG'' rating that has been used in the
past.
	   The ``PG'' rating could not apply in this case because it
``would allow young children access to distressing experiences
unsuitable for them,'' the board said.
	   In the United States, the film is rated ``R,'' which means
parents have full discretion to let their children see the movie,
as long as they are accompanied by an adult.
	   ``The theme in this film is war, depicted with frank brutality,
graphic scenes of violence and shocking language,'' the censorship
board said. ``As realistic portrayals are integral to the theme of
war, these could not be removed from the film.''

In good times and bad, Hong Kong remains hooked on stocks

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Last year, it was standing room only in the
stock dealing room in a typical branch of the China and South Sea
Bank. Retirees, students and housewives alike yelled ``Buy! Buy!
Buy!'' as the curve tracking the Hang Seng index went up, up, up.
	   Today, such rooms are still crowded, but few people can be seen
lining up to buy. Some are too nervous to jump into the market.
Many more are busy counting their losses in it.
	   In money-conscious, gambling-mad Hong Kong, many people invest
in property, and about 15 percent of the adult population owns
stocks, not through mutual funds, but through their own purchases.
	   While the percentage of stock ownership is lower than in the
United States, the blue-chip Hang Seng Index is a territory-wide
obsession in Hong Kong. In good times and bad, people are hooked.
	   Every day, hordes crowd interactive terminals at banks and
Internet providers flashing the latest market news. Others jam
stock dealing rooms at retail banks and brokerages, waiting for
hours with clenched fists for the best moment to trade.
	   Last year, many people got caught up in the euphoria when the
Hang Seng peaked at more than 16,000 points. Some borrowed heavily.
Others used their student loans to get into the market.
	   There were plenty of success stories.
	   But since then Hong Kong has been dragged full tilt into Asia's
14-month-old economic crisis. Last month, as the index approached
6,600, many were sorry they had ever got involved.
	   One of them is a 66-year-old woman, who made her living serving
dim sum at a Chinese restaurant. In a territory with no social
security system, she lost most of her life savings in the market,
and is now too embarrassed to give her full name to a reporter or
to say how much she lost.
	   ``I don't even know what I bought,'' said the silver-haired
woman, who identified herself as Mrs. Mak.
	   ``I just bought the stocks last year because everyone was buying
and making money. Basically, I don't know anything about the
market,'' she said as she checked out share prices at the dealing
room, clutching a plastic bag she uses as a purse.
	   Many families are now left scrambling for cash. Most refuse to
sell their stocks at the bottom, preferring to sweat out the
downturn and wait for the market to rebound. Many analysts think
that will take them at least a year.
	   Meanwhile, interest rates remain high. That's the government's
way of keeping its currency link with the U.S. dollar intact. But
it also means families are paying more for mortgages, even though
property values have fallen and their apartments are now usually
worth 10 percent to 40 percent less than they were.
	   According to one estimate, sharp falls in both the property and
stock markets have chopped 4 trillion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs
516 billion) from Hong Kong's assets. That discourages spending and
has helped push the territory into a recession.
	   The jobless rate of 4.8 percent is at a 15-year high, and going
higher. The economy shrank 5 percent in the second quarter, and is
expected to shrink a total of 4 percent this year. Suicides of
badly indebted investors are a common newspaper staple.
	   Recently, to punish speculators who were betting that the market
would go down, the government actively bought blue chips to drive
the market up.
	   The two-week buying spree, which ended Friday, pushed the index
up 1,200 points by that day in a move that reassured many of the
people standing around nursing losses on the stock market.
	   But economists warn that such government intervention is
damaging Hong Kong's reputation as one of the freest economies, and
driving real investors away. And Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa
recently warned retail investors to avoid the volatile market.
	   ``There are only two players in the market: the government and
hedge funds,'' said George Chan, research analyst at Celestial Asia
Securities.
	   ``You've got to be crazy to buy anything in this kind of
environment,'' said Joseph Hung, a 53-year-old government clerk,
who has been investing in stocks for 20 years. His bifocals on his
forehead, he was squinting at the latest market figures on computer
screens facing a busy street.
	   Outside of a Star Internet outlet in downtown Hong Kong, Hung
engaged in a heated debate with Perry Ko, a 29-year-old owner of a
jewelry workshop, over whether to keep playing the market.
	   ``In the stock market, everyone wins over time,'' Ko insisted.
``The money's there. It's all timing.''
	   Hung, who has been buying stocks for 20 years, disagreed.
	   ``No. No one ever wins because you always end up putting what
you win back to the market,'' he said. ``But this is gambling, and
Hong Kong people love to gamble.''
