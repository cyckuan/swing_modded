COLUMBIA EERGY SETS DEADLINE FOR RESPONSE TO BID FOR CONSOLIDATED
NATURAL GAS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Seeking to force the Consolidated Natural Gas Co. to respond to
its $6.7 billion hostile bid, Columbia Energy Group said Friday
that it would send Consolidated's board a merger proposal with a
deadline of 5 p.m. on Monday
</P>
<P>
   Consolidated, which two-and-a-half months ago agreed to be
acquired by Dominion Resources Inc., based in Richmond, Va., for
$6.3 billion, stressed Friday that it still had a merger agreement
with Dominion. As for Columbia's offer, so far Consolidated has
only said that it is reviewing it.
</P>
<P>
   Columbia described its proposal Friday as good for the
shareholders of both companies. Oliver G. Richard III, chairman,
president and chief executive of Columbia, said, ``We believe the
CNG board will find it compelling.'' Columbia also said it had
provided additional requested information to Consolidated.
</P>
<P>
   A person involved in the negotiations on Columbia's behalf said
that Consolidated now had to act on the merger agreement. Between
now and the Monday deadline, ``the Consolidated board is absolutely
going to have to respond,'' this person said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can't drag it out any longer,'' the person added.
</P>
<P>
   Columbia, based in Herndon, Va., first made its cash-and-stock
bid to Consolidated, based in Pittsburgh, last month.
</P>
<P>
   Chet Wade, a spokesman for Consolidated, said its board ``had a
process in place regarding the Columbia Energy Group's proposal and
will respond in due course.''
</P>
<P>
   He declined to say if the company would meet Columbia's
deadline.
</P>
<P>
   As the utility industry is deregulating, companies have sought
to strengthen their competitive positions by taking over natural
gas companies like Consolidated so they can offer a package of
electricity and natural gas.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts had been critical of Dominion's offer because it would
not contribute to earnings for at least two years. Dominion had
said that it would not sweeten its offer to Consolidated. &QL;

NEW RANGERS PRESIDENT WON'T SHAPE TEAM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Jim Lites said he's a fan, not a baseball
guy. But by going to 10 games a year, the Rangers' new president
has had no trouble figuring out his new team's biggest need.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know this team can hit, run and field,'' Lites said. ``I
think it needs pitching. Obviously, we have to do a better job
keeping the other team off the scoreboard.''
</P>
<P>
   But Lites, who was announced yesterday as the Rangers' president
in addition to remaining the Stars' president, said finding more
pitching is general manager Doug Melvin's job and ``it will
continue to be so.''
</P>
<P>
   Owner Tom Hicks agreed.
</P>
<P>
   Lites is the boss, Hicks said, ``but both these two teams will
be run by professional sports people. Doug Melvin will run the
baseball team; Bob Gainey will run the hockey team.''
</P>
<P>
   That means Melvin will report directly to Hicks as much as he
does to Lites.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think this will have much of an impact,'' Melvin said.
``I feel confident it's something that will work out. We'll
continue to do the things we've always done, and that's put the
best product we can on the field.''
</P>
<P>
   Lites replaces Tom Schieffer, who spent eight years as the
Rangers' president before stepping down last week to concentrate on
the real estate development around The Ballpark in Arlington. The
change takes place immediately. Schieffer was serving as president
until a successor was hired.
</P>
<P>
   Lites, who spent the past six years as Stars president, grew up
a baseball fan in Michigan and played the sport through high
school. But he has spent the past 17 years working for the Stars
and Detroit Red Wings. He has never worked in baseball. He also
boasts of no expertise on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``In all the years I've been in sports, the one thing I've
learned is don't try to do the things you're not capable of
doing,'' Lites said. ``I'm not capable of making baseball player
evaluations, and I won't be. I can't tell you if a guy is a good
baseball player. Those decisions have to be made by the people
responsible.''
</P>
<P>
   Lites said he will not directly involve himself in player
contract negotiations or the pursuit of free agents. Schieffer took
an active role in both. Lites said he'll tell Melvin how much money
he can spend, but it's up to the general manager to decide how to
spend it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been doing that successfully the last three years with
the Stars, and it will hold true with Doug,'' Hicks said. ``He'll
make the recommendations, Jim will be his sounding board and make
the final recommendation, and I'll have the final say, yes or no.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the recommendations have to come from the bottom up, not
the top down.''
</P>
<P>
   For the Stars, there is a clear line between the hockey
operations department and the executive department. People under
Lites' immediate management handle marketing, sales, event
presentation, finance, communications, arena development and more.
</P>
<P>
   People under general manager Bob Gainey handle the on-ice
product, player contract negotiations, team travel and scouting.
Lites has been an intermediary for Hicks in matters such as
free-agent acquisitions and trades, but more to inform the owner
rather than inject opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't really talked about how we're going to handle
things, but I don't expect any changes,'' Gainey said. ``We know
where our departments intersect, and we know how to intersect well
with each other. We know what's in each of our departments, and we
know what is combined for both departments. We've had a very good
relationship in those matters, so I don't see why anything should
change.''
</P>
<P>
   Lites did say the Rangers' emphasis on scouting and player
development will continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your scouting and development through the minor leagues has to
be effective because you don't have enough money to buy free agents
for every position,'' Lites said. ``The emphasis has to be on
scouting and player development.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Melvin: ``The one thing he's familiar with is a farm
system. Hockey has a farm system as well, even though it's not the
magnitude of baseball.''  &LR; taptop:Staff writer Mike Heika

SECOND GROUP OF REFUGEES FROM KOSOVO REACHES U.S.  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT DIX, N.J. _ An additional 407 ethnic Albanians, among more
than a million pushed out of their homes in Kosovo by Yugoslav
forces, arrived at this training camp turned immigration center
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The newcomers appeared more exhausted than exhilarated by their
journey to a new life so far from home. Some hobbled down the steps
of the blue and white 747 charter plane that brought them here, and
a toddler burst into tears upon seeing an American soldier on the
runway.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the refugees who arrived Friday, like the first group of
453 Kosovar Albanians who arrived Wednesday, are beginning a lonely
journey. They do not have relatives in the United States and will
remain at Fort Dix for weeks. Yugoslav forces stripped many
Albanians of their identity documents before expelling them and
threatened them with death if they return to their homes, the
refugees here said.
</P>
<P>
   As Friday's newcomers stepped off the buses that brought them
here from nearby McGuire Air Force Base, those refugees who had
arrived on Wednesday crowded toward them, searching for friends and
relatives. Several embraced the new arrivals.
</P>
<P>
   The refugees are being housed in barracks outfitted to
accommodate families, with rows of iron beds and lockers that
remain largely empty of personal belongings. Many of the families
who had arrived Wednesday spoke with reporters, while children
played in a field dotted with swing sets, doll houses and a
volleyball net. While the parents and teen-agers seemed shaken,
describing shooting sprees and terror at the hands of masked
Serbian soldiers and paramilitaries, the children smiled and called
out ``Hello.''
</P>
<P>
   While the refugees are at Fort Dix, immigration inspectors will
screen them to make sure they are, indeed, refugees from Kosovo and
have no criminal records, while doctors examine. Afterward,
resettlement agencies are expected to find housing for them, and
help them find jobs and schools for their children. Donna Shalala,
the secretary of Health and Human Services, said the United States
would spend up to $100 million caring for the refugees.

DEVELOPER PURSUES PLANS FOR COMPLEX ALONG BROOKLYN'S WATERFRONT 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By HERBERT MUSCHAMP   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ One of Europe's most celebrated architects has been
hired to design a controversial shopping and entertainment complex
in Brooklyn that could transform the waterfront area north of
Brooklyn Heights.
</P>
<P>
   The site for the project lies between the Brooklyn and Manhattan
Bridges, in the area called Dumbo, for Down Under the Manhattan
Bridge Overpass. In recent years, the manufacturing district has
been transformed into a popular residential neighborhood, and the
developer of the new project, David Walentas, wants to make it a
commercial and artistic center as well. His plans include a
redesigned park at the foot of the Brooklyn Bridge, a hotel and a
sizable exhibition space for art in the historic brick warehouses.
</P>
<P>
   The architect, Jean Nouvel, a 53-year-old Frenchman, has created
a number of important buildings abroad. For the Brooklyn
development, he will work in association with the New York
architectural firm Beyer Blinder Belle, whose projects include the
renovation of Grand Central Terminal.
</P>
<P>
   But Walentas' plans have faced fierce opposition in nearby
Brooklyn Heights, where community leaders say the complex will
worsen the traffic congestion in downtown Brooklyn and undermine
efforts to open up waterfront land to the public.
</P>
<P>
   Neighborhood leaders have vowed to fight the plan on several
levels, and a draft land-use plan by Community Board 2, which
covers Dumbo, differs from Walentas' plan in various ways. It calls
for maintaining a mix of industrial and residential buildings in
Dumbo and seeks to preserve parkland along the waterfront by
restricting commercial development around Empire-Fulton Ferry State
Park.
</P>
<P>
   But Walentas' hiring of Nouvel signals that the developer is
serious about proceeding with his vision for the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   The project would be Nouvel's first building in the United
States. He was the architect of the Arab World Institute, one of
the ``grand projets'' of Paris commissioned during the 1980s by
President Francois Mitterrand. Nouvel also designed the Cartier
Foundation for Contemporary Art on the city's Left Bank, the
Galleries Lafayette department store in Berlin and a concert hall
in Lucerne, Switzerland. His most recent building is a Museum of
Advertising that will open in the fall as part of the Louvre.
</P>
<P>
   Nouvel's work features an inventive use of technology. For the
Arab World Institute, he designed a wall of photosensitive camera
eyes that control the natural light entering the structure. The
Cartier Foundation commands an imposing prospect on the Boulevard
Raspail with a free-standing wall of glass. For a building housing
the CLM BBDO advertising agency on the Seine River just north of
Paris, Nouvel devised a hydraulically operated roof that rises like
the wings of a butterfly.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Dumbo area offers considerable advantages to a
developer, not the least of which is the spectacular view of the
lower Manhattan skyline, the project still faces several hurdles.
</P>
<P>
   Walentas has been designated by New York state as the
conditional developer of the public property between the two
bridges, but community members have said that if he does not scale
back his designs and expand the state park, they will fight his
proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have a choice between a park at that spectacular
location and a shopping mall which could go anywhere, it doesn't
seem much of a choice,'' said Paul DiLeo, a member of Community
Board 2 who helped draft the board's plan. ``Even if a mall were a
good use of the property, which it's not, can anyone get there
without going insane?''
</P>
<P>
   Although community groups have been notified about the selection
of Nouvel and invited to preview Walentas' plans for the area, some
of these organizations have already objected to the choice of
architect. They expect him to propose a starkly modern structure
that would be inappropriate in an area notable for its cobblestone
streets and historic warehouses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Walentas has told us he wants to construct a Sydney Opera
House,'' said Marianna Koval, deputy director of the Brooklyn
Bridge Park Coalition, a community group that supports building a
greatly expanded park along the waterfront, stretching from just
southwest of the Brooklyn Heights Promenade to the Brooklyn Navy
Yard. ``I think there is community consensus that it is a totally
inappropriate structure for that site. To place a huge modern
edifice right next to Civil War-era warehouses and in this
turn-of-the-century manufacturing area seems ill-conceived.''
</P>
<P>
   The Walentas project is one of several projects by prominent
architects under way in New York. Others include the Austrian
Cultural Institute on East 52nd Street, designed by Raimund
Abraham; a commercial building on East 57th Street, designed by
Christian de Portzamparc; the expansion of the Museum of Modern
Art, a project designed by Yoshio Taniguchi; a hotel on 42nd Street
and Eighth Avenue, designed by Arquitectonica; and the remodeling
of 350 Madison Ave. by Skidmore, Owings and Merrill. The new Second
Stage Theater, at 307 W. 43rd St., a project by Richard Gluckman in
association with the Dutch architect Rem Koolhaas, is also a
notable addition to the New York cityscape.

A MAN HAUNTED BY HIS RICH FAMILY'S HISTORY OF TRAGEDY 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By JIM YARDLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ William Woodward III was born to a family with few
peers in New York society. The Woodwards had old money and blue
blood, but they also had a penchant for self-destruction that
landed them in the novels of Truman Capote and Dominick Dunne, as
well as in the headlines of newspapers around the world.
</P>
<P>
   William was only 11 years old in 1955 when his mother shot and
killed his father, mistaking him for a prowler at their weekend
estate. The crack of the shotgun did not wake young Woody, but the
shooting echoed throughout his life: His mother, Ann, was
exonerated, but she committed suicide in 1975 after Capote depicted
her as a murderous vamp.
</P>
<P>
   His younger brother, Jimmy, dabbled in drugs and spent time in
mental institutions before he jumped to his death from a hotel
window.
</P>
<P>
   But William Woodward III persevered, eager to become more than
another poor little rich boy. He became a journalist in the late
1960s and later ran for public office. He served as New York's
deputy superintendent of banks. Later, he got married and had a
daughter and lived, for a time, a quiet life. And then last Sunday,
at age 54, he jumped through the kitchen window of his East Side
apartment and fell 14 stories to his death. Police called it an
apparent suicide.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a terrible tragedy,'' said Lionel Larner, a friend who
attended Woodward's funeral Thursday. ``His desire was to give
something back, to try to do good. But there was always a shadow of
sadness. It seemed to emanate from him. He wanted very much to be
happy.''
</P>
<P>
   The shadows in Woodward's life had become darker in recent
years. Friends say he suffered periods of severe depression and had
been under psychiatric care. He and his wife, Lisa, had been waging
a divorce and custody fight since 1996. His wife's lawyer, Jerome
Tarnoff, said Woodward experienced dramatic mood swings, veering
from euphoria to despair. In his eulogy at the funeral, Parkman
Shaw, a longtime friend, said Woodward called him two weeks ago,
fearful that he had fallen into a depression without bottom.
</P>
<P>
   Tarnoff said: ``The man couldn't help himself. He had demons, so
to speak.''
</P>
<P>
   His closest friends, a few of whom regularly telephoned him in
recent years to ``check up,'' gathered at a small, private
reception after the funeral. In later interviews, several friends
described a man of vivid contrasts: He was charming and bright, a
patrician with liberal politics, a doting father, someone
determined to make his mark. He was also very private, sometimes
guarded and subject to increasingly unpredictable behavior.
</P>
<P>
   His death, a close friend said, was ``on one level shocking, but
on another level it was not.'' He added: ``I think mental illness
is so terrible and insidious.''
</P>
<P>
   The skyline of wealth in New York City is ever changing, with
new families rising and old ones falling, but the Woodwards ranked
at the summit for much of the century.
</P>
<P>
   William Woodward was a chairman of Central-Hanover Bank and a
sportsman who purchased the famous Belair Stud, the Maryland
thoroughbred farm that produced three Kentucky Derby winners. His
wife, Elsie, became a grande dame of high society and a leading
philanthropist. Their son, William ``Billy'' Woodward Jr., was an
international sportsmen, most famous for his thoroughbred, Nashua,
winner of two-thirds of racing's triple crown. He married Ann
Crowell, a woman of ordinary lineage but of extraordinary beauty.
She was a Powers model, and became a radio personality known,
somewhat oddly, as ``the most beautiful girl in radio.''
</P>
<P>
   They had two sons, William III and James, and if they were born
as princes of the realm, they ultimately became victims in a chain
of family destruction that seems almost Gothic.
</P>
<P>
   On the night of Oct. 30, 1955, Billy and Ann Woodward had
returned to their weekend estate in Oyster Bay on Long Island,
after attending a dinner party honoring the Duchess of Windsor.
There had been reports of a prowler, and the couple retired to
separate bedrooms armed with loaded weapons. Awakened by what she
later described as the sound of an intruder, Mrs. Woodward grabbed
her gun and fired at a shadow in her doorway. It was her husband,
and she had killed him. The two boys, asleep elsewhere in the
house, did not wake up.
</P>
<P>
   The shooting electrified the nation. Life magazine dubbed it
``The Shooting of the Century.'' Distraught and visibly anguished,
Mrs. Woodward was hospitalized for days but she eventually appeared
before a Nassau County grand jury, which deemed the shooting an
accident. But the family would never recover. Mrs. Woodward was
ostracized socially and hounded by whispers questioning her
innocence. The whispers eventually landed in the ears of Truman
Capote, whose unfinished, but published, novel, ``Answered
Prayers,'' included a thinly veiled fictional account of the
Woodward shooting. He depicted Mrs. Woodward as Ann Cutler, a
harlot and a gold digger who killed her husband because he had
discovered she was a bigamist.
</P>
<P>
   In 1975, Esquire published an excerpt from the novel, and Ann
Woodward was soon found dead in her Fifth Avenue apartment from
suicide. Susan Braudy, whose 1992 book, ``This Crazy Thing Called
Love,'' documented the shooting, said New York society quickly
accepted Capote's fictional account as fact.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, that's that,'' Elsie Woodward, then in her 90s, said six
weeks after Ann's death, according to Ms. Braudy's book. ``She shot
my son, and Truman just murdered her, and so now I suppose we don't
have to worry about that anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   But after eight years of research, Ms. Braudy concluded that the
shooting, in fact, had been an accident. Police had arrested a
prowler who admitted to being at the Woodward estate. Ms. Braudy
also discovered that Capote's story about her background was pure
fabrication, despite the whispers to the contrary.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``There was an awful lot of gossip about it among their friends
taking sides and wondering if it was an accident,'' said Ann
Slater, a friend of the Woodward family. ``The boys were at an age
where they couldn't miss it.''
</P>
<P>
   The youngest, Jimmy, died first. A handsome Vietnam veteran, he
quickly fell into the drug culture of the early 1970s, according to
Ms. Braudy. He bent heirloom silver spoons to heat heroin, and one
night in 1972, high on drugs, he jumped out of a fourth floor
window but survived. Released from a mental institution, Jimmy
befriended Xaviera Hollander, the self-proclaimed madam and author
of ``The Happy Hooker'' series. In one of her later books, she had
a chapter, ``Jimmy, Don't Jump Again.''
</P>
<P>
   He did. Less than a year after his mother's suicide, Jimmy
jumped out of a window of a hotel on Central Park South and died.
</P>
<P>
   Woody Woodward was the last of his family, and for years he
struggled to make a name for himself. He had attended an exclusive
Swiss boarding school and graduated from Harvard College. In 1968,
he became a reporter at The New York Post, and if newspapering
seemed an unlikely career for a multimillionaire, he embraced it.
He paid his own way to cover the Vietnam War, riding around the war
on a motorcycle. In New York, he represented the Newspaper Guild in
contract negotiations with management, another unlikely role for
the heir to a banking fortune.
</P>
<P>
   In 1971, two journalists, Richard Pollak and J. Anthony Lukas,
were searching for investors to underwrite a new magazine of media
criticism called More. They knew about Woodward's role in The
Post's contract negotiations, and they later met him at the Harvard
Club. ``Suddenly, Bill said, `Well, I might be willing to put up
money,''' Pollak recalled. He spent $5,000 to bankroll a trial
issue, and when it succeeded, More was born.
</P>
<P>
   He became the publisher, and More became acclaimed as an
influential, liberal critical voice.
</P>
<P>
   Woodward eventually left the magazine to attend Harvard Business
School and ultimately he turned to politics. He served in the
administrations of Gov. Hugh Carey and Mayor Ed Koch. In 1978, he
ran for the state Senate in the East Side's ``silk stocking
district'' but lost to the Republican incumbent, Roy Goodman.
</P>
<P>
   In 1981, he ran for an at-large seat in the City Council, but
the courts abolished those seats before the election. And then
Woodward essentially dropped out of the public eye.
</P>
<P>
   The family saga resurfaced when another fictional account of the
shooting, ``The Two Mrs. Grenvilles'' by Dunne, was published in
1985 and later produced as a television movie. Dunne said this week
that Woodward had called him before publication to ask that he not
mention the Woodward name while publicizing the book. Dunne said he
obliged.
</P>
<P>
   As ``The Two Mrs. Grenvilles'' reached the best-seller lists,
Woodward and Lisa Dawn Woodward were married Sept. 28, 1985 in
Paris. They had each attended the same Swiss private school, Le
Rosey, then reconnected later in life. Friends and Tarnoff, the
lawyer, say that for several years the couple lived a life of
comfort, sailing their boat in the Mediterranean and spending time
in apartments in London, Paris and New York.
</P>
<P>
   But Tarnoff said the marriage began to unravel in 1994. He said
Woodward spent much of the year traveling the world, calling from
train stations in Europe. In 1996, Mrs. Woodward filed for divorce,
and the couple began a contentious custody battle over their
daughter, now 7 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Woodward's lawyer, Steven E. Lewis, did not return telephone
calls left at his office, but Tarnoff said Mrs. Woodward had
temporary custody during the divorce proceedings. He said Woodward
was allowed to see their daughter ``40 percent of the time,'' and
that he took her on trips to Colorado and Rhode Island.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a very good father,'' Tarnoff said. ``He loved that
child more than life.''
</P>
<P>
   But friends said Woodward slid into another depression late last
year. Pollak, who had not spoken to Woodward since they worked
together at More, said they exchanged letters last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very unhappy letter,'' Pollak said of the note from
Woodward. ``He talked about how his marriage was breaking up, and
how he was not getting to see his child as much as he liked.''
</P>
<P>
   For Woodward's friends, this final image of a despondent man is
not how they wish to remember him. Instead, friends recalled his
sensitive nature and his unique style.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wore clothes differently,'' said Ms. Braudy, who became
friends with Woodward during the '70s, before she wrote her book.
``He had the manners of a European prince. He was a very attractive
personality, but he was vulnerability transcended in a way.''
</P>
<P>
   Another friend said simply, almost wishfully, upon receiving a
call from a reporter, ``Everybody is tired of this story, right?
It's tragic and awful and it's over, I hope.''

HEAT'S PLAN IS TO MAKE A RUN FOR IT AGAINST EWING
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By CHARLIE NOBLES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ P.J. Brown will wear basketball shoes when the Miami
Heat opens the playoffs on Saturday afternoon against the Knicks,
but the power forward will be thinking like a runner.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, a one-time brawler in this contentious series, is quite
aware that Knicks center Patrick Ewing, 36, and hampered by an
Achilles' tendon problem, is expected to defend him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I can run a little bit better than he does,'' Brown
said Friday at practice. ``If I get up and down and try to get him
tired, hopefully around the third or fourth quarter he won't be as
effective in the post. He's hurting and I'm going to try to take
advantage of it.''
</P>
<P>
   There is another reason Brown plans to sprint as this
best-of-5-game series begins: the former Net believes several
fast-break layups will be pivotal.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's going to be the big key to this series: who can get the
most easy baskets,'' he said. ``Our defenses are so compact and
there's going to be some ugly basketball, like there always is.''
</P>
<P>
   After a long study session and a short practice today at La
Salle High School in Coconut Grove, Heat players again faced
questions about the animosity between the teams. Most of their
answers were distilled for family consumption, but occasionally a
verbal spark or two would fly.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the teams hate each other, Brown said: ``I don't know
about hate. There's definitely a big dislike. There's no doubt
about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Center Alonzo Mourning, apparently tired of hearing how
difficult the Knicks have been for Miami to defeat in recent years,
said: ``I look at it this way. If we can't match up and play well
against anybody in the eighth spot, then we don't need to be in the
playoffs at all.''
</P>
<P>
   In another corner of the gym, forward Dan Majerle said:
``There's not a lot of love between these teams. We know they want
to play us. We're just going to go out and play our game and let
our game talk.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown even took exception to the notion that the Knicks take
more delight in beating Miami than other teams, and seem to save
their best basketball for the Heat.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Riley, the Heat coach, said Friday that Ewing is averaging
10 more points a game against Miami than he is against the rest of
the league, and forward Larry Johnson is averaging six more.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what type of team just points out one team and
wants them,'' Brown said. ``I look at the total picture. But if
they want us, they got us. They'll get a chance to prove
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Point guard Tim Hardaway also commented on how much better the
Knicks have played against Miami than they have against other
teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at the paper,'' Hardaway said. ``Against other teams,
they really don't produce. For some reason, they make it their
season when they play us. We have to start making it our season
when we play them. We have to show them that we are No. 1 and we
earned it and deserved it, and we have to come out and play like we
are the No. 1 seed in the East.''
</P>
<P>
   One factor that may hurt the Heat is that Hardaway, Miami's most
effective player against the Knicks over the last three seasons,
has been dragging a damaged left knee around since a Feb. 26
collision with Grant Hill of the Detroit Pistons. While Hardaway
only missed one game and has not called attention to the injury, it
has limited his explosiveness and penetrating ability.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been out there trying to be a threat,'' he said. ``Your
legs are everything to you in basketball. I can get back to that,
but I don't know if it will be until the off season.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Hardaway's competitiveness is bubbling over right now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the pressure, I like the challenges, I like whatever it
brings,'' he said. ``It's got to bring out the best in you. As a
team, our window of opportunity is wide open. It's mainly a matter
of just going out and doing what we know we can do.''  &QL;

HURTADO STATUS DOUBTFUL AS METROSTARS HIT ROAD 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By STEVE POPPER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The MetroStars have had many problems on offense this season,
from their own lack of scoring to the fruitless search for a
forward to fill the vacant foreigner slot on their roster. As if
those struggles were not enough, the MetroStars are expected to be
without Eduardo Hurtado when they travel to Washington to face D.C.
United Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Hurtado, the team's leading scorer this season with three goals,
is listed as doubtful with a right hamstring strain and did not
practice this week.
</P>
<P>
   Since joining the MetroStars in a trade from Los Angeles last
season, Hurtado has been the key to the MetroStars' offensive
success; the team has a 9-2 record in games in which he has scored
a goal and is 15-2 in games in which he has registered a point.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the trip to Washington is just what the MetroStars
(3-3) need to right themselves. The MetroStars have struggled
offensively at home, currently enduring a stretch of 280 minutes
without a goal.
</P>
<P>
   In the MetroStars' latest loss _ in a shootout to the Galaxy _
at least Mark Chung and Roy Myers were able to convert in the
shootout. Since scoring two goals in their first game, the
MetroStars have scored only two goals in the last five games and
rank 10th in Major League Soccer with 0.67 goals a game.
</P>
<P>
   D.C. United (3-3) is in a three-game losing streak, the longest
slide since the team lost its first four games in 1996, its
inaugural season, and has yet to win in two home games this season.
United is also struggling with injury problems, with defender Eddie
Pope out for four to six weeks with a broken foot and midfielder
Marco Etcheverry out with a groin strain.
</P>
<P>
   Still, D.C. United does have forward Roy Lassiter, who has six
goals this season and has scored 14 times in 16 games against the
MetroStars, the most by any opponent. Since joining United, he has
scored four goals in five matches against the MetroStars, including
the game-winning goal in the 47th minute of a 1-0 victory on April
9.
</P>
<P>
   The MetroStars may rely on an unlikely source to try to lift
them from their offensive doldrums, inserting Nansha Kalonji into
Hurtado's spot beside Myers at forward.
</P>
<P>
   Kalonji, 26, is from the Democratic Republic of Congo and played
at Ramapo College. He was selected in the supplemental draft in
February. Believed to be the fastest player in the league, he
played 20 minutes in Hurtado's place last week.

GIULIANI: ``I STIR THINGS UP'' 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DAN BARRY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The public breakdown of the professional, if not
private, relationship between Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and Schools
Chancellor Rudy Crew continued Friday, as the mayor asserted that
he was primarily responsible for whatever reform was being planned
for the city's school system.
</P>
<P>
   The reason, he said, is that ``I stir things up.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole reason why the chancellor is talking about ending
social promotion is because I stir things up,'' he said at a news
conference. ``The whole reason why there is a discussion of ending
principal tenure is because I stir things up.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor went on to say that discussions about school vouchers,
in which public money would pay for the private-school tuition of
disadvantaged children, were taking place ``because I stir things
up.'' He also said that discussions about abolishing the Board of
Education were occurring ``because I stir things up.''
</P>
<P>
   Crew and his aides chose Friday not to comment directly on the
mayor's comments. ``Situations like this are very volatile and
we've always tried to suppress volatility,'' said Chiara Coletti, a
spokeswoman for Crew.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Giuliani's remarks seemed to suggest that he
believed Crew had had little impact on the agenda for the city's
schools, and came just days after a power play by the mayor and his
aides seemed to undercut Crew's influence over the school board.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, a four-member majority of the school board,
including two of the mayor's appointees, rejected Crew's five-year
school construction plan and replaced it with one supported by the
mayor. It marked the chancellor's first defeat since assuming the
job in 1995, and left him complaining about politics polluting the
educational process.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's remarks Friday also suggested a continuing shift
away from the enthusiastic support he has expressed for Crew's
leadership in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the school board hired Crew in late 1995 _ with
the prodding of Giuliani _ he and the mayor developed what aides
say was a close personal relationship. Late at night, often after
delivering speeches or attending functions, they would meet for
dinner to talk about matters both professional and personal.
</P>
<P>
   But this year, the public has witnessed the gradual
deterioration of that relationship, often played out through
emotionally charged debates over school policy. Crew's aides say
that it began with the mayor's push earlier this year to begin a
pilot voucher program, which one school official suggested had more
to do with the mayor's political aspirations than anything else.
</P>
<P>
   Harry Spence, the deputy schools chancellor for operations, said
on a news program Thursday night that the mayor told Crew in
January not to worry about his promotion of vouchers, which the
chancellor vehemently opposes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not doing this to hurt you,'' Spence said the mayor
effectively told Crew at a time when Giuliani was traveling the
country and the state as a potential candidate for the Senate.
``It's not something I expect to be driving home. It's something I
need to be talking about.''
</P>
<P>
   Spence previously enjoyed the support of Giuliani, but his
television appearance seemed to have damaged his reputation in City
Hall. ``Harry's performance is not inconsistent with our past
experiences with him in not being able to tell the truth,'' Deputy
Mayor Joseph Lhota said. ``He's bringing dissembling to a lower
level, and it's disgusting.''

HICKS SMACKS HOME RUN WITH NEW RANGERS PRESIDENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LEBRETON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hicks with a kick save!
</P>
<P>
   Gee. That could have been a lot worse.
</P>
<P>
   But just when it looked as if multi-owner Tom Hicks had let his
first baseball blunder whiz under his cuff links, he rallied
yesterday in classic, Eddie Belfour-like fashion.
</P>
<P>
   In rawest baseball terms, Jim Lites is no Tom Schieffer. But he
could be. And if you listened real closely, that sound you heard
yesterday at The Ballpark in Arlington was Rangers fans, sighing
with relief.
</P>
<P>
   Club president. Don't dare shrug at yesterday's announcement.
</P>
<P>
   If you think that on the new millennium's organizational chart,
the club president can't affect a team's on-field performance, let
me remind you of two words: Frank and Zaccanelli.
</P>
<P>
   Lites is neither of them. He arrives with neither a hidden
agenda nor riding a power trip. Nor is the new Rangers president
some young bean counter that Bud Selig's office sent over.
</P>
<P>
   If you're apprehensive about Lites' baseball resume, remember
this: the hockey team he helped build has had the best record in
the NHL for the past two seasons. Lites' roll call of prior diamond
experience is, in fact, at least a couple of paragraphs beyond what
Schieffer's was when he first assumed the big chair.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few seasons ago, this would have seemed like folly, this
notion of one man guiding the business operations of two local
sports teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot more conventional now because of the size of the
investments that have occurred,'' Lites said on his first day on
the new job. ``There is a need to run these businesses as
businesses and not like owners' playthings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the level of investment that Mr. Hicks has made in these
two teams, and the importance of making them make business sense,
they treat them very seriously now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before, I guess, owners would go in and put a guy in charge
who ran one of his other businesses _ and then look out.''
</P>
<P>
   Look out below, he means. We only have to look at the rudderless
few weeks before Don Nelson joined the Mavericks for an example.
</P>
<P>
   So why shouldn't this work? Lites' new job isn't about finding a
new starting pitcher any more than his old job was scouring for a
new left winger. As Bob Gainey has been allowed to flex his general
manager elbows, so will Doug Melvin.
</P>
<P>
   As Lites said, ``When I talked with him today, I told him,
`Doug, I've worked with Bob Gainey, and I intend to have the same
relationship with you and hopefully that will evolve over time. I
won't bother you. I won't do your job, and I don't expect you to do
mine.' ''
</P>
<P>
   There are billboards to sell and seats to fill _ same as with
the NHL Stars. There is a physical plant to run and operational
details to tidy _ same as with the Stars.
</P>
<P>
   Lites plans to maintain an office both at the Dr Pepper
StarCenter and at The Ballpark. But until further notice, he says,
he will be spending ``about 80 percent'' of his time at the
baseball park.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a lot of learning to do,'' Lites said.
</P>
<P>
   He grew up a Detroit Tigers fan. Twice a season, Lites' father
would pack up his son and drive the 250 miles to Tiger Stadium for
what amounted to a five-game weekend. Yes, he skipped school to
watch Al Kaline, Norm Cash and Don Wert play.
</P>
<P>
   When Lites was a young vice president with the Detroit Red
Wings, his former father-in-law, Mike Ilitch, purchased the Tigers,
and Lites was given some additional baseball duties.
</P>
<P>
   ``In certain regards,'' Lites said, comparing the business ends
of baseball and hockey, ``they are exactly the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Hell truly does occasionally freeze over. How outrageous would
it have sounded to Texans, say, 10 years ago to hear that a hockey
guy was taking over as president of the Rangers?
</P>
<P>
   If it frightens you, you haven't been paying attention to the
Stars enough. While Owner Jones has been juggling the salary cap
plates at Valley Ranch, the local NHL team has stamped itself as
the area's model organization.
</P>
<P>
   Rome is done. Jones is old news. Hicks is the big sports man in
town now, and Lites has been a worthy lieutenant.
</P>
<P>
   Schieffer will be missed, as quality baseball people always are.
But replacing him could have been much worse.
</P>
<P>
   Save, Hicks. All you need to know about the new president is
that in his ``other job,'' he wins.

DODGERS FIND NEW SPOT FOR MADDUX
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Nine years after one horrendous start led to a
demotion, elbow surgery and ultimately his release, right-hander
Mike Maddux is back with the Dodgers. He entered Friday night's
game in the top of the eighth with L.A. trailing 6-3.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, the club purchased the minor-league contract
of Maddux, who pitched 11 games for the Dodgers in 1990 but is
better known as the brother of four-time Cy Young Award winner Greg
Maddux of the Atlanta Braves.
</P>
<P>
   Maddux, 37, spent 10 days at Single-A San Bernardino before the
recall. He fills the spot on the Dodgers' 25-man roster vacated by
outfielder Jacob Brumfield, claimed on waivers Friday by Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just glad to be pitching in the big leagues,'' said Maddux,
who has played for eight clubs in 12 seasons. ``It wasn't the best
of circumstances that year (in '90). I was coming off (elbow)
surgery in 1989 and needed it again after the season.''
</P>
<P>
   The low point of his career came that season in the Houston
Astrodome. He made a spot start but lasted just one-third of an
inning, allowing five hits and five runs, including two homers.
</P>
<P>
   He was ordered to the minors after the game but stunned
teammates by working out in the trainer's room the next day as if
nothing had happened. He caught on with San Diego the next season
and has remained in the big leagues with stops in New York,
Pittsburgh, Boston and Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a good opportunity for me,'' said Maddux, who will be
used in long and middle relief. ``Every day up here is a
blessing.''
</P>
<P>
   Brumfield, 33, made the Dodgers' opening-day roster after
signing a minor- league contract March 5. He batted .294 with a
triple, RBI and four runs in 18 games.
</P>
<P>
   Brumfield, who played two seasons with the Blue Jays (1996-97),
has a .259 career average with 30 home runs and 143 RBI in seven
major-league seasons.
</P>
<P>
   __ Young isn't ready: Second baseman Eric Young was hoping to
return Friday night after missing two starts with a strained right
calf but said he will be back tonight.
</P>
<P>
   Young, who leads the National League with 18 stolen bases, left
Monday's game at Montreal in the fifth inning after walking and
stealing second. He received treatment but found it difficult
running on the artificial surface at Olympic Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``That stuff is really hard,'' Young said. ``It was better to
get back here and work out. Everything will be fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Jose Vizcaino started at second for the third consecutive game.
Although he is considered the Dodgers' backup infielder, Vizcaino
has started 11 of the club's 29 games.
</P>
<P>
   __ Quick hits: Even without Young, the Dodgers are running. Raul
Mondesi stole second in the second, his seventh in eight attempts
and a league-leading 44th by the club. . . . Carlos Perez, who
missed his Wednesday start with an injury to the soft tissue in his
right thigh, threw lightly before Friday's game. Perez will test
his leg today by pitching in the bullpen and said he is confident
he can make his scheduled start _ Tuesday night against the Chicago
Cubs. . . . A bat and batting glove giveaway Friday was the reason
for the club's fourth sellout this year. It was the Dodgers' third
straight sellout dating back to the final two games of the
Cardinals series, the first time they've accomplished that since
the final weekend of the 1996 season.

OUTLINE FOR PEACE IN KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The diplomatic endgame has begun. That is the meaning of the
peace plan for Kosovo drafted by the Group of Seven countries _ the
United States, Great Britain, Germany, France, Italy, Canada, and
Japan _ plus Russia. Shrewdly, the drafters left crucial matters
vague enough to accommodate the compromises that will be needed for
a workable peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The most evident issue left unresolved in the G-7 statement is
what provoked the war in the first place: the Clinton
administration's insistence that an armed NATO force protect
civilians and keep the peace in Kosovo. The text authored by the
G-7 foreign ministers in Bonn backs away from that adamant demand,
calling instead for the deployment in Kosovo ``of effective
international civil and security presences endorsed by the United
Nations.''
</P>
<P>
   This is a formulation that leaves room for peacekeeping
contingents of varying kinds. One peacekeeping force that could
protect repatriated refugees and also be acceptable to all parties
would be an asymmetrical mixed contingent, with NATO troops
protecting Albanian Kosovars and Russian, Belorussian, and
Ukrainian soldiers stationed in areas populated by Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Some may object that such a division of labor among peacekeepers
would anticipate a partition of Kosovo into Serbian and Albanian
regions.
</P>
<P>
   Since the safety of returning refugees must be the world's
paramount consideration, however, a security formula that
foreshadows the de facto partition of Kosovo may be better suited
to protect Albanians and Serbs alike than an arrangement intended
to validate American conceptions of pluralism and diversity.
</P>
<P>
   What is certain is that any peacekeeping force that enters
Kosovo must be sufficiently well armed not only to protect itself
but to guarantee the safety of 1.5 million traumatized Albanian
Kosovars who have already seen their kinfolk slaughtered and their
houses burned to the ground.
</P>
<P>
   This newspaper has grave doubts about the bombing war, but it
would be a mistake now to halt it unless Slobodan Milosevic
demonstrates that he is willing to withdraw his troops and accept
the return of all the people he expelled from Kosovo.

FORMER SEATTLE OFFICER'S SUIT ALLEGES BRUTALITY, COVER-UP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By VANESSA HO  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ In 1996, Seattle Police Officer Paul Vang was writing
reports when a scuffle broke out in a nearby holding cell. Vang
says he ran over and saw three fellow officers punching and kicking
a 17-year-old boy who was bleeding, motionless and on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what you get for (expletive) with the police,'' one
officer said before cleaning blood from his clothes, Vang recounts.
</P>
<P>
   The boy complained of excessive force to the Seattle Police
Department's Internal Investigations unit, and Vang made a similar
complaint. But Vang says that when he tried to give his statement,
the unit's captain intimidated him and told him to go home and
reconsider his account. The boy's complaint was not sustained, even
though Vang was never interviewed by the investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Vang's allegations of brutality and cover-up have come to light
because of a lawsuit he filed against the department for emotional
distress. A few months after the scuffle, Vang quit the Seattle
police force. He said other officers were hostile to him at the
department, after trying to bury his allegations, and retaliated
against him. The lawsuit is scheduled for trial in November.
</P>
<P>
   His allegations are the latest to hit a police department
already smarting from criticism over its two-year failure to
investigate a homicide detective's alleged theft of $10,000 from a
crime scene.
</P>
<P>
   The revelations that at least eight officers, including a
sergeant in the internal investigations unit, knew of the alleged
1996 theft and did nothing has raised doubts about the integrity of
the department and its internal investigations unit. The case,
which resulted in a criminal charge against the detective last
week, also prompted the mayor to appoint an independent board to
review the entire department.
</P>
<P>
   Vang's account also illuminates one of hundreds of
excessive-force complaints filed against the department. From 1992
to 1998, 737 such complaints were made, with internal investigators
finding only 10 were valid, according to reports by an IIS civilian
auditor.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no doubt in my mind whatsoever what I saw then and
what I know now, as far as acceptable use of force,'' said Vang,
now 35 and a police officer in Wisconsin. ``He clearly wasn't
resisting, and (the officers) were still punching and kicking.''
</P>
<P>
   Police spokeswoman Carmen Best said the department can't comment
on the case because of Vang's pending lawsuit, but did say: ``We
don't believe Mr. Vang's characterizations of the facts are
accurate.''
</P>
<P>
   The incident Vang says he witnessed did result in criminal
charges _ against Demetrius Fisher, now 20, the man involved in the
scuffle. The officers said Fisher threw a punch, resisted being
handcuffed and fought them, forcing them to wrestle him to the
floor. He was convicted of three counts of assaulting the officers.
</P>
<P>
   The officers suffered injuries that required no medical
attention: One had a minor black eye and a lump on the head, and
the others had sore knees, wrists and hands.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher, who was being questioned about an alleged drug deal at
the time of the incident but was never charged in it, fared worse:
His ears and face were bruised, his nose was swollen, bloody and
bent; and his head had a small cut that needed sutures.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was clear from Demetrius' appearance on the day following
the incident that the officers used excessive force in this case,''
said George Yeannakis, Fisher's public defender.
</P>
<P>
   During his assault trial, Yeannakis said Fisher was flailing his
arms in self-defense. Vang's testimony might have helped Fisher's
case, but Yeannakis said he never interviewed him and didn't know
his account.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Satterberg, chief of staff for the King County Prosecutor's
Office, said police documents on the incident didn't name Vang.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The deputy prosecutor) was unaware that he was any type of
witness at all,'' Satterberg said. Fisher is in jail on an
unrelated weapons charge at the Regional Justice Center in Kent,
Wash. He declined comment.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Carroll, the internal investigations unit civilian
auditor, said he could not discuss the Fisher case, but said the
low rate of sustained excessive-force complaints (those ruled
supportable) is a concern.
</P>
<P>
   But he quickly added that many police departments have similar
low rates of sustaining such complaints.
</P>
<P>
   He said he doesn't believe Seattle has a ``systemic'' problem
with excessive force. The number of such complaints is low compared
with the large number of contacts between officers and citizens, he
notes. Also, the number of such complaints has steadily declined
over the years.
</P>
<P>
   He said it's difficult to sustain excessive force complaints
because it often boils down to ``he says-she says'' situations. He
said he has made suggestions to the department on how to improve
the sustaining rate, including doing more face-to-face interviews
with officers. The department now sometimes accepts written
statements or telephone interviews with witnesses and officers.
</P>
<P>
   But others say the internal investigations unit exonerates
officers even when confronted with physical evidence.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Charles Tomaras says, police officers wrenched his arm
behind his back after responding to what they thought was a
domestic-violence call. Arriving officers saw a Leatherman tool on
Tomaras' belt and asked Tomaras what it was.
</P>
<P>
   Tomaras said he moved to show them the tool when two officers
grabbed him, twisted his arm behind his back, slammed him against a
wall and threw him over a counter. His arm was broken, he said.
</P>
<P>
   He filed a complaint, but Internal Investigations ruled the
confrontation was justified, even though Tomaras never resisted. An
arbitrator recently ruled that he was entitled to about $17,000 in
compensation for his injury, but the city disagreed and requested a
trial now scheduled for July.
</P>
<P>
   ``They overreacted,'' said Tomaras, a 39-year-old sound mixer.
``They broke my arm, which was horribly bruised afterward.''
</P>
<P>
   Vang said Fisher also suffered, and describes the young man's
blood pooling on the floor after the officers punched and kicked
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't believe what I'm seeing. I thought you only saw
those things on TV,'' he said. ``I felt shameful, on behalf of what
the officers were doing. I feel terrible, sick to my stomach.''
</P>
<P>
   Two months later, after an investigator for Fisher's attorney
called Vang about the incident, Vang talked with Internal
Investigations.
</P>
<P>
   Vang said he was telling then-Capt. Clark Kimerer about the
incident when Kimerer interrupted and began grilling him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Capt. Kimerer intimidated and insulted me,'' Vang recalled.
``He tried to minimize what I saw with my very own eyes.'' Kimerer,
now an assistant chief, did not respond to a request for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Kimerer later asked him for a statement, but his request came
eight days after the excessive force complaint was dismissed and
the day after Fisher was convicted of assault.
</P>
<P>
   While Vang was drafting his statement, his sergeant told him to
consider self-preservation over personal integrity at that state of
his career, Vang said.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Vang never gave a statement. Vang quit in January
1997.

CLARK FUMBLES LEAD IN RANGERS' DEFEAT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ The Rangers play smash-mouth baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Their powerful lineup _ despite its inconsistencies this season
_ mashes and grinds opponents for nearly 5 1/2 runs per game.
</P>
<P>
   Their rotation plays a similar brand of football.
</P>
<P>
   Too often it provides three innings and a cloud of dust.
</P>
<P>
   That unstable combination produced another implosion with last
night's 9-6 defeat to the Toronto Blue Jays at SkyDome.
</P>
<P>
   Four home runs _ two by right fielder Juan Gonzalez and
unexpected ones from center fielder Tom Goodwin and second baseman
Mark McLemore _ accounted for the Rangers' six runs.
</P>
<P>
   It would not be nearly enough.
</P>
<P>
   Right-hander Mark Clark (2-3) produced the sixth start this
season in which a member of the rotation failed to pitch at least
four innings, and the Rangers completed only their 29th game of
this young, yet-growing-old-fast season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we've had three 1-2-3 innings this road trip,''
manager Johnny Oates said afterward. ``You can't play that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Seattle manager Lou Piniella shared a similar experience.
</P>
<P>
   Right-hander Ken Cloude survived the entire 1998 season in the
Mariners' rotation despite his 6.37 earned-run average _ the worst
since 1940 for a pitcher with a minimum of 154 innings pitched _
and 5.18 innings pitched per start.
</P>
<P>
   Cloude, though, was only one member of the Mariners' rotation.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers' rotation appears full of Cloudes. It will enter
this afternoon's game at SkyDome with a 6.35 ERA and averaging 5.08
innings per start.
</P>
<P>
   Clark, who retired only 11 batters before his premature shower,
received two runs in support before Blue Jays right-hander Pat
Hentgen (2-1) threw his ninth pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Goodwin pulled Hentgen's fifth pitch down the right-field line
for only the 10th home run of a major-league career that spans
2,293 at-bats. McLemore followed suit with his first home run of
the season three pitches later.
</P>
<P>
   Clark, though, surrendered four runs during the bottom half of
the inning, which included Carlos Delgado's two-run homer and Mike
Matheny's two-out, run-scoring double.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the first leadoff home run of Goodwin's career became only
a novelty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's just his command right now,'' Oates said of
Clark. ``He'll make two good pitches and then make a bad one. The
consistency just isn't there yet, but it will be. It's not like
we're talking about a 20-year-old kid.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez's second homer _ a three-run, seventh-inning blast off
left-hander Dan Plesac _ pulled the Rangers within a run. The Blue
Jays, though, strengthened their 7-6 lead with two runs during the
eighth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a chance to win this ballgame,'' Gonzalez said.
</P>
<P>
   The bullpen, though, also failed despite a scoreless seventh
inning from right-hander Danny Patterson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Juan's three-run homer made it respectable for half an
inning,'' Oates said. ``Goodwin's and McLemore's home runs made it
respectable for half an inning there.''
</P>
<P>
   Oates does not blame the rotation entirely.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just the pitching,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Left fielder Rusty Greer agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It goes back to getting all three parts _ pitching, hitting
and defense _ on a consistent basis,'' Greer said. ``It's not about
hitting when you don't pitch or pitching when you don't hit or not
playing well defensively.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the Rangers should be scoring enough runs.
</P>
<P>
   The rotation's failures, though, likely will become more
magnified tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers will part with a reliever to make room on the roster
for right-hander John Burkett, tomorrow's scheduled starter. The
Rangers likely will expose left-hander Eric Gunderson to outright
waivers by designating him for assignment or option right-hander
Danny Patterson or left-hander Mike Venafro to Triple-A Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't go with three extra guys'' on the bench, Oates said.
``What would I do with the 13 pitchers? I don't need more
pitchers.''
</P>
<P>
   The manager needs outs _ preferably in 1-2-3 fashion _ from the
existing staff.

BELFOUR LIKELY TO SEE AGGRESSIVE FOE IN GAME 2
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Insiders say Colorado has a chance to unseat defending
Stanley Cup champ Detroit because goalie Patrick Roy has an ability
to steal a series.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto's Curtis Joseph and Buffalo's Dominik Hasek were
credited for doing just that in Round 1. Boston's Byron Dafoe
supposedly has been playing his best hockey.
</P>
<P>
   Every goalie, it seemed, was being talked about as a
series-influencing type of player, except for Stars goalie Ed
Belfour.
</P>
<P>
   Until now.
</P>
<P>
   The St. Louis Blues couldn't stop talking about him after Game
1, a 3-0 Stars victory. Belfour finished with 23 saves and extended
his shutout streak to 130 minutes and one second.
</P>
<P>
   The Blues were suddenly buzzing about how to beat him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we need more traffic in front of him,'' St. Louis
coach Joel Quenneville said. ``I think we need to be hungrier in
front of the net.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Blues winger Geoff Courtnall: ``I think most of the
opportunities we had last night were from the outside. I think we
just have to get a little bit hungrier around the net and get
better opportunities. Their defense does such a good job of not
only blocking shots but clearing the pucks in front of them.''
Welcome back
</P>
<P>
   Blues winger Scott Pellerin skated yesterday, but he said not to
expect him back in the lineup for Game 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to say I'm still a little ways away,'' Pellerin said.
</P>
<P>
   He sprained his groin in St. Louis' opening series against
Phoenix and missed Games 6 and 7. He had an empty-net goal in Game
1.
</P>
<P>
   Pellerin said he planned to be back by Game 4, and maybe, Game 3
in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's day-to-day,'' Quenneville said. ``Maybe, he needs a
little more rest, but we'll see him in this series.''
OK, maybe a little
</P>
<P>
   Blues players were quick to downplay fatigue as a factor to
losing Game 1.
</P>
<P>
   Physical fatigue? No.
</P>
<P>
   Emotional fatigue? Yes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't play with the same enthusiasm that we just finished
the last series with,'' Quenneville said. ``It's just the way it
is. You play three games with all-out emotion, with life and death,
and maybe you let your guard down a bit.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I think we need to get back and get energized, get
enthused in getting back in the series.''

SALMON'S RETURN MIGHT IN IN NEW YORK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.1999 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; BOSTON _ Results of the MRI performed on right fielder Tim
Salmon's sprained left wrist showed nothing abnormal and he says he
hopes to return to the lineup before the end of the road trip.
</P>
<P>
   Salmon, who injured the wrist trying to make a sliding catch
last Monday in Anaheim, said it's feeling better each day, but
there's no reason to rush back, especially considering the
importance of his wrists when hitting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Waiting two or three more days right now may be the difference
in continuing to have a great year offensively or having a so-so
year because it still hurts,'' Salmon said. ``I don't see it as a
two-week thing. I'm day-to-day. It may not be here (in Boston) but
maybe in New York (Tuesday through Thursday).''
</P>
<P>
   Considering the bad news the Angels have received this season
regarding injuries, the news on Salmon was surprisingly
encouraging.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the biggest relief,'' said Salmon, who is hitting .347
with a team-high seven homers and 25 RBI. ``But I've got to let
time take its course to heal. The hardest thing is not to rush
it.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Help on the way: The Angels are expected to make a roster
move today to bolster the bench. With Salmon out for the next few
days and second baseman Randy Velarde out indefinitely with a stiff
lower back, the Angels bench is thin. And they've been playing a
man short to begin with because they're carrying 12 pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   A pitcher _ probably Scott Schoeneweis _ will be sent to
Triple-A Edmonton to make room on the roster.
</P>
<P>
   Velarde's MRI revealed results similar to an MRI performed on
his back last September. Velarde will continue to receive therapy,
but no conclusive diagnosis will be given until Angels medical
director Dr. Lewis Yocum reads the results.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's obviously frustrating, but what can you do?'' Velarde
said. ``Injuries happen. I just have to make sure I remain patient.
A back is something to be concerned about.''
</P>
<P>
   Velarde, who said any movement he makes feels like he's being
stabbed in the back, was off to a good start, hitting .336. But he
said he isn't worried about losing the good feeling at the plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I come back, I feel confident I'll pick up where I left
off,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   __ Familiar setting: Mo Vaughn's return to Fenway Park as a
member of an opposing team reminded some of pitcher Roger Clemens'
return as a member of the Toronto Blue Jays in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens, who hit Vaughn with a pitch in the first inning, struck
out 16 Red Sox that day, including Vaughn to end the eighth,
Clemens' final inning of work in a 3-1 Blue Jays win.

BUSINESSMAN OPENS MUSEUM TO HOUSE HIS PASSION FOR BUFFALO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. _ Buffalo roam at Gemmie Baker's insurance
office.
</P>
<P>
   For more than 40 years, Baker has collected buffalo memorabilia.
You name it, he has it: ceramics, pelts, movie posters, china,
silver spoons, miniatures, taxidermy.
</P>
<P>
   He has a stuffed buffalo that children can ride.
</P>
<P>
   He has a theater where he screens the movie ``Dances With
Wolves.''``
</P>
<P>
   He has documents written by ``Buffalo Bill'' Cody.
</P>
<P>
   He has wood carvings, bronzes, hood ornaments, plates and
platters.
</P>
<P>
   Insurance is his business, but buffaloes are his passion.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my hobby,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   That's an understatement. How many people open up a museum just
to house a hobby?
</P>
<P>
   Eight years ago, Baker founded the Buffalo Museum of America in
a strip center at Scottsdale Road and Shea Boulevard. His insurance
office takes up one corner of the first floor. The museum sprawls
across the rest of the two-story rented space, divided into such
areas as the Dances With Wolves room, the Buffalo Bill room and the
Wounded Knee room.
</P>
<P>
   He can't even estimate how many items he owns. Thousands. A
whole herd of stuff.
</P>
<P>
   The Buffalo Museum is one of more than 30 Valley institutions
that will offer free admission in May during Museum Month. The
event is sponsored by the Central Arizona Museum Association and
Robinsons-May department stores.
</P>
<P>
   Participants can pick up a Museum Passport and Museum Brochure
at Robinsons-May checkout counters. The pass allows one-time free
admission at each institution.
</P>
<P>
   Museum Month gives people a chance to visit not only such
well-known destinations as the Phoenix Art Museum and the Heard
Museum but also lesser-known Scottsdale venues, such as the
Hoo-Hoogam Ki Museum, the Sylvia Plotkin Judaica Museum and the
Buffalo Museum.
</P>
<P>
   Baker says his place is something of a well-kept secret, but he
believes it's the only one of its kind in the country. Despite the
popularity of the American icon, scientifically known as the bison,
his objects are rare.
</P>
<P>
   ``Buffalo items are hard to find today,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Although Baker had been a collector since he was a boy, amassing
stores of coins, antiques and iron works, he decided to concentrate
on buffalo 10 years ago. He and his wife moved to Arizona in 1972
and brought everything along, planning to open a museum someday to
show off the collection.
</P>
<P>
   It became a family project for Baker, married 43 years, father
of two children, grandfather of two.
</P>
<P>
   ``People wanted to see it, so I set it up,'' he says. Shaking
his head, he adds, ``It was so much work I would never do it
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet with the museum bursting its seams, Baker is determined to
expand into a larger facility. He's now cataloging every item, a
tedious task with no end in sight.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just trying to tie the history together,'' he says,
``for historians and museum buffs to look at.''
</P>
<P>
   It's the ``heritage part of it'' that attracts American
visitors, but European tourists also enjoy the place, he says.
</P>
<P>
   It's a favorite of schoolchildren, who eagerly climb aboard the
stuffed and saddled buffalo downstairs and delight in the animated,
talking buffalo family upstairs. Mom, Dad and calf croon a bison
version of ``Home on the Range'' while a prairie dog pops out of
its hole.
</P>
<P>
   In the Dances With Wolves room, a ``dead'' rubber buffalo lies
mortally wounded. Covered in fake fur and sporting a bloody gash,
it was one of the props used in the 1990 Kevin Costner film. Back
home in South Dakota, Baker and his brother, a truck driver, once
delivered buffalo to the ranch where the movie was filmed.
</P>
<P>
   The featured attraction in the Buffalo Bill room is a scrapbook,
event posters and a rifle owned by the Western showman.
</P>
<P>
   A collection of silver teaspoons, all bearing buffalo motifs,
includes one spoon commemorating the 1803 Louisiana Purchase
Exposition.
</P>
<P>
   Bronze sculptures have been collected from France, England,
Siberia and Czechoslovakia.
</P>
<P>
   ``People shake their heads. They don't have any idea how many
items there were that were buffalo,'' Baker says.
</P>
<P>
   Museum Month brings in more visitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get quite a few people who come out every year for that,''
Baker says, promising, ``they'll see things they haven't seen
before.'' &QL;

ONE WHO SURVIVED URGES STUDENTS TO BE TOLERANT 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ KENT, Wash. _ Teenager Sara Wilson leaned against a
wall in the school auditorium, unable to take her eyes off
Holocaust survivor Bronka Serebrin: ``I'll remember her and this
day forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Sara won't be the only one, judging from the reactions Friday of
other Sequoia Junior High School students who heard Serebrin
describe the horrors she endured as a teenager at the Auschwitz and
Mauthausen concentration camps during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   The 350 teenagers hung on to Serebrin's every word, so still and
silent not even a chair squeaked at Kent-Meridian High School's
performing arts center. They rushed to the stage to hug her when
she was through.
</P>
<P>
   During her speech, Serebrin implored the students to be nice to
each other and speculated that the Columbine High School massacre
in Littleton, Colo., was caused by two boys who had been treated
badly for years. She also urged them not to stand by and let others
suffer in any way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Help each other, love each other and don't ever hate. It's
hate that leads to bad things happening like the Holocaust or the
ethnic cleansing _ I hate those words _ in Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   What impressed Sara most were the vivid images Serebrin's words
evoked.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the power of her words!'' the 14-year-old said. ``This is
real. She's living proof that what we've been studying actually
happened, just the way we've heard.''
</P>
<P>
   The students were awestruck by the diminutive Serebrin, who told
her story bluntly and calmly.
</P>
<P>
   She described how her entire family, except for her sister,
perished in the Holocaust. She talked about working as a slave in a
munitions and airplane parts factory, with only a piece of bread
and soup to eat once a week. ``And the cold, we were always
freezing with the cold.''
</P>
<P>
   The teenagers, who have been studying the Holocaust for more
than a month, didn't even squirm when Serebrin finished her story
and started lecturing them about how to behave toward people who
are different.
</P>
<P>
   She warned against mistreating people of different races,
religions and ethnicities _ or who simply don't fit in.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what Hitler did, he went after the gypsies, gay people,
the mentally ill, the Jews, Jehovah's Witnesses, ethnic people,''
said Serebrin, who spent six years in concentration camps. ``Don't
pick on each other. That's what Hitler did to the Jews and I know
how very painful, very hurtful it can be.
</P>
<P>
   ``And you don't realize what it might do to someone. Look at
those two boys in Colorado. They were picked on and picked on until
something cracked.''
</P>
<P>
   Serebrin also advised her young audience to cherish their
families.
</P>
<P>
   ``My sister, who was in the same camps as I was, is the only
other survivor of a large family that numbered 65 with aunts,
uncles and cousins. I watched my mother die in the Jewish Ghetto in
Poland.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father is in that big pile of ashes they've saved as a
memorial at Auschwitz. He was put in the line that went to the gas
ovens so I know he's dead, too.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the Ku Klux Klan and other white supremacist groups, she
admonished: Stay away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Be against what they stand for. Don't listen to them,
especially that man (Louis) Farrakhan, who is teaching you to hate
me (the Jews). You don't want to hate me, you love me.''
</P>
<P>
   Serebrin was joined Friday by Leo Hymas, a World War II veteran
and a member of Gen. George Patton's 97th Infantry Division. Hymas,
who was at Sequoia Junior High to give another dimension to the
Holocaust, shared his memories of liberating the Buchenwald
concentration camp in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   When their turn came to question Serebrin and Hymas, the
students most often turned to Serebrin, who used to own Bronka, a
trendy Seattle clothing shop that's now closed.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the students prefaced their questions with ``I'm sorry
you had to suffer like that,'' and ``I'm glad you survived.''
</P>
<P>
   They wanted to know everything: what a day was like in the
camps, how she got through the beatings, what she did to survive
starvation (``we'd find a piece of raw potato skin and eat that'')
and what she did to keep from freezing to death.
</P>
<P>
   ``I survived because of my faith,'' Serebrin replied. ``And
never losing my spirit, like my father did when we were in the
ghetto before being sent to the concentration camps.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so spirited I would have gone and gotten Hitler out of
his bunker, if I could have escaped. But there was no escape, they
watched us all the time while we worked and when we slept.
</P>
<P>
   ``So instead, I sabotaged some of the small parts I made for the
German war planes, the ones called Messerschmitts. I would have
been killed instantly if they had caught me, but it was my way of
fighting back.''
</P>
<P>
   Serebrin was liberated from Mauthausen in 1945 by U.S. troops.
</P>
<P>
   When the question session finally ended, students were still
lined up at the microphones. That is, until they saw classmates
crowding around Serebrin. Suddenly everyone was down in front,
trying to get close to her.
</P>
<P>
   They all had something to say to her and were delighted when she
listened, then gave them big hugs and kisses. Even the most macho
male students looked pleased at the mushiness. And Serebrin? ``I
feel like a movie star.''
</P>
<P>
   But she still took the time to remind them, ``Don't forget,
don't ever forget.'' That's why she's telling her story publicly,
so people will remember the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they don't, it will happen again, it is already
happening,'' she said. ``Soon all the survivors will be gone and
there will be no one to tell with their own lips how it really was.
I think it's important that we do that now, while there is time.''
</P>

 CELL-PHONE USERS: LET US OFF THE HOOK

<P>
   There we were Thursday morning, in mid-workout, each of us
sweating on a Stairmaster. Well, actually, I was on the
Stairmaster. One machine over, Blondie was on her cellular phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I . . . erf . . . like . . . hof . . . can . . . uff . . . not
. . . hif . . . be . . . awg . . . lieve . . . her,'' she said.
``That's . . . ooof . . . lame.''
</P>
<P>
   Yours truly, like, couldn't have agreed more. Especially after
13 painful minutes (during which I, like, burned exactly 207.7
calories!).
</P>
<P>
   The good news: I am nothing if not a man of action.
</P>
<P>
   Me: ``Tell . . . erf . . . him . . . ooof . . . to . . . hold .
. . on!''
</P>
<P>
   Blondie: ``Huff?''
</P>
<P>
   Me: ``You're . . . hof . . . hif . . . rude.''
</P>
<P>
   Blondie: ``Whatever!''
</P>
<P>
   What followed was a hotly contested debate _ four minutes (63.3
calories!) _ on the subject of cell-phone etiquette. She made her
points, I made mine, and while I regret suggesting certain
anatomically-specific uses for a Motorola StarTac tele phone, I
don't regret the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   Blondie: ``I'll . . . erf . . . call . . . hof . . . you . . .
back.''
</P>
<P>
   Score one for right-thinking Americans everywhere. And welcome
to the new millennium, where we, citizens who de mand chitchat-free
personal space, will take back our restaurants, ballgames, pro duce
aisles, theaters and Stairmasters.
</P>
<P>
   OK, fine. They can have the Stairmas ters. Anywhere else, the
cellular plague has to stop. &QL; 
Forced etiquette
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks ago, I was watching The Matrix when a man one row
ahead of me took a call during the previews. I ex plained to him
that I like the previews, and that, compared to the acting of Keanu
Reeves, these previews might win an Academy Award. He explained
that he thought the previews ``didn't count as part of the movie.''
A large man two rows over then told Cellular Man he'd ``better have
911 on his speed dial.''
</P>
<P>
   End, happily, of debate.
</P>
<P>
   The debate is ending in other places as well. On Wednesday, the
New York Times reported on the latest Manhattan restau rant trend:
Cell-phone-free dining rooms.
</P>
<P>
   They've been outlawed for the beauti ful people eating at Tabla
and for the downscale types who frequent the Old Town Bar on East
18th Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a cellular-free zone. People have to go outside,'' Old
Town manager Gerard Meagher told the Times. ``We try to maintain
the spirit of a tavern, a place of good feeling and fellowship.
Talking on a cell phone is self-indulgent.''
</P>
<P>
   That self-indulgence sits at the heart of cellular sickness.
These phones have be come pocket Porsches, handheld status symbols,
the '90s equivalent of designer jeans. Every publicly uttered
syllable shouts, ``Here I am, and I'm important, too important to
be out of touch.'' &QL; 
A time for everything
</P>
<P>
   My own rule of thumb, as a longtime cell-phone owner and private
cell-phone user: If you feel compelled to reach out and touch
someone, do it where you can not be heard. Alone is the key. Coat
clos ets work fine, as do dark alleys and J.D. Hayworth press
conferences.
</P>
<P>
   Even a moving vehicle is an acceptable alternative: At least a
crash might mean once less cell-phone user in the world. Besides,
given the number of chitchatting drivers, chances are you'd merely
hit an other Cellular Person.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, I know that's harsh. But this is war. We can take no
prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   Which isn't to say we can't make ex ceptions. A perfect example:
</P>
<P>
   ALTA, Utah (Associated Press) _ A skier buried chest-high in an
avalanche found his cell phone in a jacket pocket and managed to
dial for help.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Ron Clark, his two sons and 12 other skiers and snowboarders
were swept up by a slide that roared down Lone Peak Ridge on
Wednesday. Clark said his jacket was twisted over his head by the
force of the slide, placing his cell phone in a pocket in front of
his face.
</P>
<P>
   To me, that scenario sounds frigid, frightening and really
painful.
</P>
<P>
   The moral: If it's a cold day in hell, then you can use the cell
phone. &QL;

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ NATO forces that were pounding the center of
Belgrade struck and badly damaged the Chinese embassy Friday night,
only hours after knocking out electrical power across much of the
country. Yugoslav authorities immediately reported numerous
injuries, both inside and outside the embassy, which they said held
26 people at the time, and offered conflicting accounts about
fatalities. China said two of its citizens were killed and two more
were missing.
</P>
<P>
   China quickly denounced the attack and Friday night called an
emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council, which
convened just before midnight.``We are greatly shocked by the
reports of NATO's bombing of the Chinese Embassy,'' China's
ambassador to the United Nations, Qin Huasun said, ``NATO's
barbarian act is a violation of the U.N. Charter.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement released late Friday, NATO said it had conducted
its ``most concentrated attack to date'' against Yugoslavia's
capital since the air war began on March 24. It also acknowledged
mistakenly bombing a hospital complex and marketplace in Nis, an
attack which the Yugoslav government said had killed 15 people.
</P>
<P>
   Among the targets in Belgrade was another of Milosevic's
residences, beneath which was a major bunker complex that NATO
described as the war-time political and military headquarters for
the Yugoslav government.
</P>
<P>
   ``NATO has information that suggests this is now the center of
Mr. Milosevic's high command, following the destruction and damage
done to other command facilities,'' NATO's statement said.
</P>
<P>
   NATO said it did not mean to hit the Chinese Embassy. ``NATO
regrets any damage to the embassy or injuries to Chinese diplomatic
personnel,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   Although NATO and U.S. officials offered no explanation for how
NATO could have hit the embassy, NATO did target the Hotel
Yugoslavia, which is close by. The officials said that this hotel
has been taken over as a headquarters and barracks for the special
paramilitary police, headed by Zeljko Raznjatovic, who is known as
Arkan.
</P>
<P>
   A senior Pentagon official declined to say whether NATO's
barrage was intended to kill him or any other Yugoslav leaders,
including Milosevic, but NATO's statement could be read as implying
as much. ``These strikes were planned to disrupt the national
leadership of military and special police operations,'' the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
   The barrage Friday night came after a day in which NATO faced
new questions about the consequences of its air war. Moments before
reports of the midnight strike against the embassy, NATO officials
acknowledged that cluster bombs dropped from an F-16 fighter jet
had caused extensive damage to a hospital complex and marketplace
in Nis, Yugoslavia's third largest city.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslav officials, who escorted journalists to the scene in
Nis, reported that an additional 60 to 70 people were wounded.
Dismembered bodies lay on a street nearby around yellow casings
from the cluster bombs. The bombs, after detonating, cover target
with smaller bomblets that float to the ground with small
parachutes.
</P>
<P>
   The damage to the embassy, which is in the new section of the
capital west of the Sava River, is certain to add still more tumult
to already strained relationship with NATO and the United States
for China, which has been sharply critical of NATO's air war. On
Thursday, China's foreign ministry called on NATO to halt the
bombing, saying it had caused ``great civilian casualties.''
</P>
<P>
   As a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council, China has
veto power over any settlement of the conflict that would have the
international body's imprimatur.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the Foreign Ministry of China called on NATO to
halt the bombing, saying that it had caused ``great civilian
casualties.'' Friday night, Qin, the representative to the United
Nations, said, ``We call on NATO to stop immediately its military
actions, so as to avoid further humanitarian disasters.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House immediately reached out to China's embassy in
Washington to inform its diplomats of the strike, an administration
official said. Later, America's ambassador to China, James Sasser,
spoke with Chinese government officials in Beijing, the official
said.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. secretary-general, Kofi Annan, was ``shocked and
distressed'' at the report, his spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the questions about casualties, officials vowed to press
ahead with the air war and predicted that a heavy night of
bombardment _ including aircraft and cruise missiles fired from
ships in the Adriatic _ was expected across the country, including
the intense barrage against the capital.
</P>
<P>
   The strikes began as evening fell in Yugoslavia and allied
planes attacked four electrical transformers in and around
Belgrade, once again darkening the capital and much of the rest of
the country, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In its statement, NATO also reported striking numerous
government and military buildings in the center of the city,
including the army's General Staff building, two Ministry of
Defense buildings, the federal paramilitary police headquarters and
two other buildings linked to Yugoslavia's weapons procurement.
</P>
<P>
   The barrage in Belgrade followed a three-day lull in strikes
against the capital that coincided with diplomatic efforts to end
NATO's air campaign against Yugoslavia, even though NATO officials
insisted there was no correlation.
</P>
<P>
   The strike at the embassy occurred after a second powerful
series of explosions rocked the capital. A Yugoslav official
reported that the building was evacuated and that some people had
been taken to hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I would like to see how NATO will justify this,'' a
Yugoslav minister, Goran Matic, said, according to The Associated
Press. ``It was a deliberate targeting of the Chinese Embassy. It's
high time to end this madness.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as diplomats from Washington to Moscow shuttled from
capital to capital carrying the outlines of a settlement, the
United States and NATO vowed to keep intensifying the attacks,
which continued for a 45th day.
</P>
<P>
   A consequence of NATO's intensified assault has been growing
numbers of misfires and civilian deaths, which the alliance has
repeatedly said it hoped to avoid.
</P>
<P>
   For the fifth time, a stray missile landed in Bulgaria. No one
was hurt.
</P>
<P>
   NATO and Pentagon officials reported a large attack by allied
warplanes against the airfield in Nis, as well as a radio tower,
but at least one bomb fell short of its targets, for reasons that
were still not clear, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, it is highly probable that a weapon went astray
and hit civilian buildings,'' a statement released late Friday at
NATO's headquarters in Brussels said. ``There was no intent to harm
civilians during this strike.''
</P>
<P>
   From the start, NATO has emphasized that civilian deaths were
always a possibility in warfare, despite the technological
precision of its laser- and satellite-guided weapons. But NATO has
found itself on the defensive after several incidents resulted in
dozens of deaths _ from the bombing of a train crossing the Juzna
Morava River in mid-April to the destruction of a neighborhood in
Surdulica last week.

   PASADENA, Calif. _ When defensive midfielder Danny Pena joined
the Galaxy in 1997, he brought much more than his reckless style of
play. He brought a hockey, drop-your-gloves-and-fight fierceness.
It's an attitude he carries off the field as well.

<P>
   That's why he has no problem explaining the Galaxy's poor 4-3
start, with only one of those victories coming in regulation.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles has scored only four goals in seven games as it
prepares to meet winless Kansas City (0-7) at Arrowhead Stadium
today at 5:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   As Pena explained, the Galaxy has been relying on Clint Mathis
and Cobi Jones to be the strikers because Welton is injured and
Carlos Hermosillo remains in Mexico. To make matters worse, Mathis
is unavailable this afternoon because of a red-card suspension and
Jones is questionable after injuring his toe last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have to understand that we have a couple of forwards up
top that are not natural forwards,'' Pena said. ``Cobi has always
been more effective out on the flanks and Clint has always been
more effective in the middle of the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a matter of getting our forwards healthy and letting
our guys move to their natural positions.''
</P>
<P>
   When people suggest the Galaxy's record is only a preview of
what lies ahead, Pena just shrugs and shakes his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no worry or panic with this team at all,'' said Pena.
``That's nonsense. The confidence on this team keeps rising,
whether it's a shootout win or not.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know it's just a matter of time before we start breaking
through and creating more opportunities for ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many other players have stated before, one of the reasons
for Pena's optimism is coach Sigi Schmid.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we go into a game, we feel like we're going in with a
game plan,'' Pena said. ``Not only offensively but defensively.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we defend, we're defending as a team as opposed to five
or six guys defending and the offensive players just sitting up
front and waiting for counter attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, the defending starts up front and moves all the way down.
It won't take long before the wins start piling up. We know we're
headed in the right direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as the Galaxy rewarded the newly hired Schmid with a
victory in his first game two weeks ago, the Wizards will be trying
to do the same for newly hired coach Bob Gansler, who replaced Ron
Newman on April 28.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Sigi came in here, San Jose was afraid to play us because
they knew Sigi would inject some new energy into us,'' said Pena.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why we expect them (Kansas City) to come out flying.
But if we do the things Sigi says he wants out of us, I don't think
we're going to have any problems with Kansas City.''

U.N. SECURITY COUNCIL MEETS AS CHINA VOICES ANGER 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ The U.N. Security Council met in an emergency
session early Saturday morning to consider the NATO bombing of the
Chinese Embassy in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese mission issued a statement condemning the bombing.
``NATO's barbarian act is a gross violation of the U.N. Charter,
international law and norms covering international relations,'' the
statement said. ``It is also a violation of the Geneva Convention.
NATO should be responsible for all the consequences. We call on
NATO to stop immediately its military actions.''
</P>
<P>
   The Russian representative, Sergei V. Lavrov, said early on
Saturday: ``I don't think it's a proper time for comment on the
diplomatic process. It means a lot for the Chinese Embassy.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As delegates filed into the Security Council chamber near
midnight, Peter Burleigh, the acting U.S. representative at the
United Nations, struck a tone that was both cautious and resolute.
``In case it was a NATO bomb, it is obviously something we deeply
regret, and we apologize for it. We never target civilians and we
would never target an embassy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Burleigh added: ``I also feel, and will say to the council, that
it's very important, despite this, to keep our eye on the big
picture, and the big picture is that Slobodan Milosevic is
responsible for what's going on in Yugoslavia now.''
</P>
<P>
   In Beijing, the Chinese government, in a statement read on
television news, called the attack a ``brutal encroachment on the
sovereignty of China.''
</P>
<P>
   The television report, on the main national news program at noon
Saturday, was the first notice to the public in Beijing of the
embassy bombing, which seems certain to evoke wide public outrage
and damage Chinese-American relations. Officials in Beijing said
the attack would create intense pressures on the government to more
forcefully oppose the American-led intervention in Yugoslavia.

__ Time: 5:30 p.m. at Arrowhead Stadium. 
!tvspt2!TV/Radio: KRLA_AM (1110), KTNQ-AM (1020), Channel 52. 
__ Galaxy (4-3) update: For a team looking to score goals any way
it can get them, it doesn't help that Clint Mathis is unavailable
because of a red-card suspension and Cobi Jones is questionable
because of a sore left toe. Welton, however, is listed as probable
after recovering from a sore ankle that caused him to miss the last
three games. If neither Jones nor Welton can play, the Galaxy might
look to rarely used forwards Lawrence Lozzano or rookie Marvin
Quijano. . . . Goalkeeper Kevin Hartman is looking to extend his
two-game shutout streak. Hartman, who has three shutouts this
season, moved to second place among goalkeepers with a 0.57 goals
against average. 
__ Wizards (0-7) update: By far the worst team in the league,
Kansas City has only scored two goals this season. The Wizards, who
acquired well-known Americans Alexi Lalas and goalkeeper Tony Meola
before the season, have given up a Western Conference-worst 12
goals. The poor start forced longtime coach Ron Newman to quit last
month. Bob Gansler, who coached the 1990 U.S. World Cup team, will
make his debut this afternoon.

<P>
   One suggestion to fix our culture in the wake of the Littleton,
Colo., killings is to teach media literacy to our citizens. The
idea: Had the coldblooded killers understood that TV shows and
music and computer games aren't real _ had they been intellectually
equipped to passionlessly process the messages they got from their
entertainment choices _ perhaps there would now be no grieving.
</P>
<P>
   Though it likely wouldn't have averted what happened at
Columbine High, media-literacy education for all is an excellent
idea. In the wake of Friday's verdict in the ``Jenny Jones'' case,
let's move right along to Lesson One: You, and only you, are
accountable for your actions.
</P>
<P>
   The news and entertainment industries aren't. They can't be,
because you really don't want them to be. Hollywood, the news and
entertainment media and all those creepy video games are made
possible by the brand of rapacious capitalism that we've agreed, as
a society, to worship.
</P>
<P>
   Network officials and movie moguls have no social agenda, no
conscience, no obligation to make the world a better place. They
are accountable only to profitability.
</P>
<P>
   When you consume their products, you vote for the system. The
operative criterion here, just to repeat, is bucks. All of the
other media-literacy lessons you'll get are secondary. I know it
sounds a lot like Ned Beatty's big speech in ``Network,'' but it's
pure truth.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, Friday's jury in Pontiac, Mich., would seem to
disagree, holding Jenny Jones' show accountable for the violent
actions of one of its guests. The jury was wrong, and its decision
will be negated by an appellate court. But what those jurors
attempted to articulate is worth talking about for a few more
minutes, or at least until the news cycle turns to another tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   The jury said, in the interpretation of Scott Amedure's family's
attorney Geoffrey Fieger, ``You can't abuse other people for
profit.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a humane concept, utterly holistic, quaint, nostalgic even.
It demonstrates a vague sense of civic anger at big-media
companies, and distaste for the daytime-TV muckbath enjoyed by a
significant percentage of the jury's neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Bringing suit and hoping for such a jury is one way of bucking
the system that produces shows like Jenny Jones'. Because this $25
million verdict is certain to be voided on appeal, the Amedure
family's victory _ and the jury's statement _ is rhetorical at
best. Besides, $25 million isn't very much to a company like Time
Warner, the ``Jenny Jones'' parent company whose executives likely
spend that much each year in airport newsstands.
</P>
<P>
   Another way _ the only way, really _ to buck the system is
taking yourself and your family off the pop-culture grid. Sounds
simple, right? If you believe that TV, pop music, computers,
computer games and the Internet played some part, however small, in
inspiring the Littleton rampage, don't call your congressman. He is
likely having lunch with a National Association of Broadcasters
lobbyist, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, quickly call your mutual-fund manager to ensure you're
not currently profiting from soaring digital-industry stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Also, forget about seeing ``The Wild Wild West'' this summer,
which is positioned as Warner Bros.' big popcorn movie of the
season. And while you're at it, black-out the ``TV Week'' listings
for ``The Drew Carey Show, Friends'' and ``ER.'' All are Warner
Bros. products. ``Buffy, the Vampire Slayer, Felicity, Dawson's
Creek'' _ all airing on the Warner Bros. television network _ get
crossed off, too.
</P>
<P>
   And, sorry, junior, no more Poke mon, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jenny Jones'' was all over CNN on Friday because we have
agreed, as a society, to let the marketplace run our lives. If you
do not approve of ``Jenny Jones,'' don't watch it. If it really
makes you angry, don't watch its local carrier, Fox affiliate
Channel 10 (KSAZ), at all. No more ``The X-Files.'' No more NFC
football. See ya, Homer Simpson.
</P>
<P>
   It's not going to be easy.
</P>
<P>
   But the only other option is government intervention, and based
on the vast numbers of people who call talk radio to gripe about
Big Brother, that's not going to happen.
</P>
<P>
   The point that Jones herself made on the stand in this case is
accurate. I'll restate it here: The people you see on daytime talk
shows are not conscripts. They're volunteers. They get what they
deserve. No, that doesn't include death, but consumers of the
``Jenny Jones'' show are as accountable as its producers. After
all, who holds the clicker?
</P>
<P>
   Arming yourself and your loved ones with media-literacy
knowledge and strategies is nice, but, as a consumer in this
culture, you're most powerful at the point of purchase.
</P>
<P>
   The best thing about absorbing live and late-breaking news on
one of the cable-news networks is how they keep you posted on the
true state of the Union by carrying the day's running financial box
scores. No matter how bad the real news might seem, the economy
rocks on.

EMBASSY BOMBING MAY WIDEN CHINA OPPOSITION TO NATO  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS lede to update with Chinese condemnation of embassy bombing;
3rd graf to delete outdated material; 5th graf to update New China
News Agency casualty report to 2 DEAD, 4 WOUNDED)  By ERIK ECKHOLM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ China strongly condemned the bombing of its embassy in
Belgrade, the official New China News Agency reported today, as
Chinese diplomats at the United Nations in New York called for an
emergency meeting of the Security Council. Foreign policy experts
and officials here said the attack would create intense pressures
on the government to oppose forcefully the U.S.-led air attacks in
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Late Saturday morning, news of the embassy bombing had not yet
been reported on television, and much of the public remained
unaware of the attack. But at the United Nations in New York, the
Chinese delegate, Qin Huasun, said, ``NATO's barbarian act is a
violation of the U.N. charter,'' and he repeated Chinese calls for
an immediate end to the air campaign.
</P>
<P>
   As news of the bombing and casualties becomes more widely known
here, it is certain to inflame the already passionate sense that
NATO's bombing raids in Yugoslavia constitute illegal aggression _
a view deeply held by much of the public as well as by officials.
</P>
<P>
   The New China News Agency said Saturday morning that two people
were confirmed dead and four were wounded.
</P>
<P>
   But if current diplomatic initiatives fail to stop the campaign,
it is not clear what direct measures China could take to counter
NATO.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government has already been under increasing pressure to
take stronger action against the NATO bombing,'' said a military
officer who spoke on the condition of anonymity, and did not know
about the embassy incident until he was told.
</P>
<P>
   The officer said that even before the attack, there was a
consensus among senior military officers that China should more
strongly counter the NATO raids, which China views as an illegal
intervention in a sovereign country.
</P>
<P>
   Jia Qingguo, a professor of international studies at Beijing
University, said, ``This strengthens the hand of those who have
argued for closer Chinese-Russian cooperation in aiding Serbia
against NATO.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, China opposed the bombing but Yugoslavia was far
away,'' Jia said. ``Now the war is brought closer to home.''

DEAL SKIRTS RIVAL'S WOES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY GREGORY J. WILCOX  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Litton Industries Inc.'s $2.4 billion bid to
become the nation's biggest military shipbuilder might not
encounter the same turbulence that scuttled a similar maneuver by
rival General Dynamics Corp., analysts said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Litton's separate offers late Thursday for Newport News
Shipbuilding and Avondale Industries Inc. came about two weeks
after the Department of Defense blocked General Dynamics' attempt
to buy Newport News. Antitrust regulators sunk that deal because of
its anti-competitive nature.
</P>
<P>
   Combining Litton's Pascagoula, Miss.,-based Ingalls Shipbuilding
with Newport News and Avondale would still give the Defense
Department a choice of two contractors for nuclear-powered ships
and submarines.
</P>
<P>
   Combined, the three companies would have revenue of about $7.4
billion and more than 58,000 employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``My feeling is that the Litton-Newport-Avondale merger has a
much greater chance of passing muster with the Pentagon,'' said
Robert Friedman, the aerospace and defense industry analyst at
Standard &AMP; Poors Equity Group in New York City. ``At least you have
two different companies making nuclear vessels, not just one.''
</P>
<P>
   General Dynamics' $1.4 billion unsolicited offer for Newport
News would have created a company that received about 90 percent of
the U.S. Navy's research and development money and 70 percent of
the construction funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``That did not go over well with the Department of Defense,''
said Brian Madonick, an analyst at Bear Stearns &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Under a bigger Litton, the research and development money would
be split evenly with General Dynamics; the construction funds would
be tipped about 60-40 in Litton's favor.
</P>
<P>
   Madonick does not believe there would be any major obstacles to
Litton acquiring either Newport News or Avondale.
</P>
<P>
   ``To acquire both is a little tougher but I think it has a
better chance than not of going through,'' he said. ``It's more
balanced this way in terms of the construction budget and
engineering plus you're better matching the teams, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Newport News, based in Newport News, Va., is the only U.S. maker
of nuclear-powered aircraft carriers. Avondale, based in Avondale,
La., manufactures amphibious assault vehicles and other military
ships.
</P>
<P>
   Buying these two companies would give Litton shipyards on the
East, West and Gulf coasts. The West Coast operations are at the
former Continental Marine site in San Diego, where maintenance,
repair and renovation work is done on Navy vessels.
</P>
<P>
   So far there is no timetable for the federal review process.
Litton's offer still must be evaluated by the boards of directors
at Newport News and Avondale.
</P>
<P>
   But the federal officials were made aware of Litton's intention
before the bid was made public.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had preliminary discussions with the Department of Defense
about our proposals and we are well aware of the considerations
that led to the rejection of the proposed combination between
General Dynamics and Newport News Shipbuilding,'' Michael R. Brown,
Litton chairman and chief executive officer, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Newport News and Avondale had already agreed to merge and that
deal won Department of Justice approval.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Department spokesman Glenn Flood said that the review of
Litton will still focus on competitive measures but it is not
likely to take very long once it starts in light of the General
Dynamics situation. That evaluation took about a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it should go faster since we've done a lot of the
homework already. But it's still early in the game,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The deal appeared to pick up support from two powerful
legislators on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The teaming of Avondale and Newport News would create the
world's most competitive shipbuilding force,'' Senate Majority
Leader Trent Lott and Sen. Thad Cochran said in a joint statement.
Both are Republicans from Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   They said the new shipbuilding team would save taxpayers
millions of dollars because of efficiencies gained in design and
construction.
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. John Warner, the Virginia Republican who chairs the
Senate Armed Services Committee, was more cautious.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will have to be a complete evaluation of this from a
national security standpoint and from the perspective of the
employees of the yards,'' Warner said. He holds some critical sway
because he had strong reservations about General Dynamics bid for
Newport News, which is headquartered in his state.

 &HT;    MARTINEZ STEALS SHOW IN VAUGHN'S RETURN
 &HT;    (For use by New York Times News Service clients)
 &HT;    By GORDON EDES
 &HT;    c.1999 The Boston Globe

</P>
<P>
   Turn your back on home, and chances are when you come back you
discover the locks have been changed, the neighbors are more apt to
snarl than smile, and your old room doesn't belong to you anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask Mo Vaughn, the erstwhile Red Sox slugger who signed
with the Anaheim Angels this offseason and returned Friday night to
his former haunts, Fenway Park, only to discover it is now the Casa
de Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   With thunderous ovations from the sellout crowd of 32,220
dwarfing the mixed reception Vaughn received, Red Sox ace Pedro
Martinez struck out a career-high 15 in eight innings and combined
with temporary closer Tim Wakefield to shut out Vaughn's Angels,
6-0.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thinking about that during the game,'' said Sox pitching
coach Joe Kerrigan, who likened Martinez's performance Friday night
to some of his finest moments, including his near-perfect game
against the San Diego Padres four years ago. ``This was supposed to
have been Mo's night, and it became Pedro's night.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite chants of ``Pedro, Pedro,'' manager Jimy Williams lifted
Martinez at the start of the ninth. By that time, Martinez had
thrown 126 pitches, and with a six-run lead generated in good
measure by two of Vaughn's closest friends he left behind, John
Valentin and Mike Stanley, Williams elected to save the slender
Dominican for another day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Big man coming in, big man on the mound,'' said left fielder
Troy O'Leary, aptly describing why Yawkey Way hummed with passion
uncommon this early in May. ``Pedro pitched great. He made my job
easy.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, who became the majors' first six-game winner (6-1)
with his fourth straight victory, did not walk a batter and allowed
just six hits in upstaging Vaughn, who went hitless in four trips
and went down swinging twice against the man who said he dreaded
facing Mo as much as he did pitching against his brother Ramon.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said `hi' to me,'' Martinez said of Vaughn, who waved at a
Martinez changeup to strike out in the first, reached on a
fielder's choice in the third after swinging away at a 3-and-0
pitch, whiffed again in the sixth on a full-count changeup, and
flied out harmlessly to end the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looked at me like he always used to from first base,''
Martinez said, ``to let me know he still loves me and respects
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez earned those feelings from Vaughn long before
Friday &UR;  &LR; night. The Sox ace, who leads the majors with 76
strikeouts, five more than Arizona's Randy Johnson, has struck out
10 or more in his last five outings, a feat never accomplished by
the Sox ace he succeeded, Roger Clemens. This was the 13th time in
40 starts with the Sox he has fanned 10 or more, the 40th time in
his career.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn, who had hugs for Stanley and Valentin as well as most of
his former teammates before the game, was booed during pregame
introductions, then heard more grumbling as he approached the plate
for his first at-bat. But those sour notes were drowned out by a
standing ovation, as Vaughn stepped out of the batter's box and
waved to the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was glad the fans stood up and clapped, and the cheers took
over,'' said shortstop Nomar Garciaparra, who reached on an error
and scored in the sixth. ``I was clapping. I took my glove off. He
deserves all the respect in the world. What he did for the
community, the organization, the city of Boston is unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn, who struck out three times Thursday night in Detroit and
is hitless in his last 10 at-bats, settled into the batter's box
for his first at-bat, but not before delivering an unusual greeting
to Sox catcher Jason Varitek. ``He whacked me with that club he
swings,'' Varitek said.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez whacked back, however, inducing Vaughn to chase a
1-and-2 changeup that faded from sight, triggering the first of
what became a night-long series of ovations for the Sox pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez struck out at least one in every inning he worked. He
struck out the side in the sixth, beginning with Vaughn, and twice
fanned four batters in succession.
</P>
<P>
   ``Man, didn't he throw awesome?'' Garciaparra said. ``Did he
feed off the excitement? I think so. Everybody does. You know what?
I was. You're excited for Mo, you're excited for Pedro, you're
excited to win the game. You feel that energy. The fans were
great.''
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Martinez downplayed the notion that he was lifted by
the emotion of the moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been around so long,'' said Martinez, who is only 27 but
has been paid to pitch for 10 years, ``you realize anything can
happen in this game.''
</P>
<P>
   Stanley, who used to spend hours talking hitting with Vaughn,
singled home two runs in the sixth after a Troy Glaus error, an
O'Leary single, and a wild pitch had placed runners on second and
third with no outs.
</P>
<P>
   That hit, off Angels starter Omar Olivares, gave the Sox a 4-0
lead, which became 6-0 an inning later when successive doubles by
Jose Offerman and Valentin scored one run and Stanley doubled home
Valentin.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox had taken a 2-0 lead in the third, which began with a
single by Buford. He was in motion when Trot Nixon's tapper went
off Olivares's glove and everyone was safe. Offerman walked to load
the bases, and Valentin's sacrifice fly made it 1-0. Olivares then
picked off Offerman from first, but in the subsequent rundown,
Nixon scored from third.
</P>
<P>
   When it was over, lockermate Jim Corsi attested to the Martinez
cool. Some pitchers retreat to an impenetrable zone before their
starts. Not Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before the game,'' Corsi said, ``Pedro answered my cell phone.
It was my cousin, looking for his tickets. Pedro took a message and
left it in my locker. I was trying to figure out who left it for
me.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the game, I said, `Congratulations.' He said, `Did you
get my message? The Big Cheese called.' ''
</P>
<P>
   No. The Big Cheese pitched.

FENWAY FANS FAITHFUL TO FORMER FAVORITE &HT;    (For use by New York Times News Service clients) 
 &HT;     By DAN SHAUGHNESSY 
 &HT;     c.1999 The Boston Globe 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There was a playoff atmosphere at Fenway Friday afternoon and
evening. Thanks to Pedro Martinez. Thanks to Mo Vaughn.
Unfortunately, it won't be like this again around the old yard
until the All-Star Game or until Roger Clemens pitches here for the
Yankees _ whichever comes first.
</P>
<P>
   Mo's Comeback Concert filled Fenway and the Mo bashers had their
way as the Hit Dog fanned twice and went 0 for 4 as the Angels
succumbed to the 15-strikeout mastery of Boston's new best player,
King Pedro.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn got a rousing ovation when he came to the plate in the
first inning, but as the evening wore on, fans hooted him as they
would any other rival star.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was already the enemy,'' Mo said with a grin after the game.
``But that's expected. The fans are gonna get behind their team.
It's really no big deal. I'm sure they'll be all over me
tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   It was an eventful day for Vaughn. He visited his youth
foundation in Dorchester, then arrived at Fenway, via limo, at
around 2 p.m. and took some early hitting in the cages under the
center field bleachers. He swapped greetings with Jim Rice and
Flash Gordon, and was surprised when Red Sox CEO John Harrington
stopped by the visitor's clubhouse to wish him well (apparently Shy
John is finally listening to those high-priced consultants he keeps
hiring).
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a good exchange between two men,'' said Vaughn. ``We
put things aside and it was nice. He didn't have to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Two hours before the first pitch, an overview of the field
provided a funny sight. From high above the diamond, it looked as
if somebody had tilted Fenway to the left, forcing all reporters to
roll toward the visitor's dugout.
</P>
<P>
   Pointing to the first base bench, Sox publicist Kevin ``Dean
Wormer'' Shea said, ``Ah, guys, the Red Sox dugout is over there.''
</P>
<P>
   True. The Sox dugout is on the first base side. But the story
was on the other side. The pregame story was the return of Mo.
</P>
<P>
   When Vaughn came out to stretch with his teammates, he said
hello to Jimy Williams, Mike Stanley, and best pal John Valentin.
Stanley and Vaughn inspected a first baseman's mitt. Mo has become
Stanley's glove supplier.
</P>
<P>
   The gates opened at 5:30 and Mo was an obvious target as he
stood on the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``We love you, Mo.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You're always welcome here, Mo.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Put two or three off the wall tonight. Put it right back in
Duquette's face.''
</P>
<P>
   And . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``You suck. Go home, Mo!''
</P>
<P>
   Red Sox general manager Dan Duquette did not make his customary
rounds behind the batting cage during the pregame drills. Just as
well. We were spared a phony handshake between enemies.
</P>
<P>
   There had been a report in a Boston paper that a group of
performers from the Foxy Lady might make the trek from Providence
to cheer for Mo. Your intrepid servant attempted to find said
representatives in the stands, but uncovered nothing. I spotted
three possible suspects, but let's face it: There is no way to
politely ask, ``Excuse me, are you a stripper?''
</P>
<P>
   At game time, Mo stood on the dugout step, bat in hand, as Darin
Erstad stepped in to face Pedro. When Erstad doubled off the glove
of Stanley (thousands quipped ``Mo would have had it''), Vaughn
walked to the on-deck circle. At 7:13 p.m., after Matt Walbeck
grounded to third, Mo stepped to the Fenway plate for the first
time.
</P>
<P>
   The initial reaction was a chorus of boos _ as if Antoine Walker
had just missed a pair of free throws. Then the groundswell
started. Fans stood and applauded. You may get arguments from
others who were there, but from an open air seat in the press box,
the first-inning boos were submerged by a wave of good will.
</P>
<P>
   As the applause mounted, Mo turned on his heels and saluted Red
Sox Nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was definitely nice,'' he said. ``I'll appreciate that as
long as I play this game. But it was really hard facing these guys.
It's tough facing guys you played with a long time. I did a lot of
good here, but to get your feet in that batter's box brings back a
lot of memories.''
</P>
<P>
   Pedro's first pitch to Mo was a called strike. On the next
pitch, Vaughn ripped a drive to the foul side of Pesky's Pole. He
fouled an 0-2 pitch, took ball one, then swung wildly and missed
Pedro's 1-2 offspeed offering.
</P>
<P>
   Mighty Mo had struck out and there was joy in Mudville, not to
mention smirks all around in Executive Box F.
</P>
<P>
   The booing was decidedly stronger in subsequent at-bats. Vaughn
grounded to first on a 3-0 pitch his second time up, then fanned
(swinging) on a 3-2 pitch in the sixth. By this time, he was
getting the Bob Stanley treatment.
</P>
<P>
   In the top of the eighth, with Pedro leading, 6-0, and the game
no longer in doubt, Vaughn came up for the last time. A hail of
boos. Ulf Samuelsson stuff. Pedro had taken over the game. Mo flied
to center on a 1-0 pitch.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd stood and cheered.
</P>
<P>
   For Pedro.

HENDERSON ON DISABLED LIST 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ When Steve Phillips, the Mets' general manager, signed
Rickey Henderson and acquired Bobby Bonilla during the off season,
there was speculation about whether the 40-year-old Henderson and
the 36-year-old Bonilla would be able to coax their bodies through
another season.
</P>
<P>
   One month into the season the answer is a resounding no.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips placed Henderson on the 15-day disabled list,
retroactive to May 3, after Friday night's 14-7 loss to the Arizona
Diamondbacks. Henderson, who sprained his right knee last Sunday,
will not be eligible to come off the list until May 18. But
Phillips insisted that he would not place Bonilla, who has been
bothered by a partial ligament tear in his right knee since spring
training, on the disabled list. Bonilla was 1 for 4 Friday night
and is batting .159.
</P>
<P>
   ``Release is not in the plans, nor is a trade in the plans,''
Phillips said. ``We have no plans to release, trade or disable him
at this point.''

HERSHISER FLOP DOOMS METS TO 3RD STRAIGHT LOSS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ No matter how many times the Mets tried to bail him
out Friday night, Orel Hershiser did not deserve to win. But the
Mets' 14-7 loss to the Arizona Diamondbacks _ the most runs New
York has allowed this season _ had to leave more than a few people
in the crowd wondering how Todd Stottlemyre, who fully deserved to
lose, picked up the victory instead.
</P>
<P>
   Stottlemyre (4-1) threw 111 pitches in just five innings and
allowed a 5-1 lead to disappear. But even after the Mets had
rallied for a short-lived 6-5 lead in the top of the fifth,
Hershiser (2-3) could not hold it in the bottom of the inning, and
the Mets (17-12) lost their third in a row.
</P>
<P>
   As poorly as Stottlemyre pitched _ allowing nine hits and six
runs (five earned) in his five innings _ Hershiser pitched even
worse. The 40-year-old right-hander allowed nine runs on nine hits
in four and a third innings, the first time in nearly three years
that he had allowed that many runs.
</P>
<P>
   In six starts this season, Hershiser has allowed 22 earned runs
in 291/3 innings for an earned run average of 6.75.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets scored once in the first on Robin Ventura's run-scoring
single but left the bases loaded when Bobby Bonilla grounded out to
first.
</P>
<P>
   And then it took Hershiser five batters just to record an out.
Tony Womack _ who would later establish a club record with two
triples _ walked on four pitches to open the Arizona first, and Jay
Bell singled. Luis Gonzalez, who later homered off Josias
Manzanillo to extend his major league-best hitting streak to 20
games, walked on five pitches to load the bases. And that brought
out the pitching coach Bob Apodaca.
</P>
<P>
   The bases were not loaded for very long. On a 1-0 pitch to Matt
Williams, the National League player of the month, Williams cracked
a bases-clearing double through the power alley in right-center
field and then took third when Brian McRae robbed Steve Finley with
a sliding catch in center. Tony Batista followed with a first-pitch
single to right to score Williams. And the Mets were down by 4-1.
</P>
<P>
   After each team scored, Alfonzo drilled a three-run homer off
Stottlemyre with two outs in the fourth to tie the game at 5-5. And
when Mike Piazza ripped an opposite-field double leading off the
Mets' fifth, took third on a Ventura fly to right and scored on a
McRae single, Hershiser and the Mets had a 6-5 lead.
</P>
<P>
   After the second inning, Hershiser had settled down, and when he
got the first out in the fifth he had retired 10 of the last 11
batters. But then Williams belted a double to center, Finley
walked, and Batista singled to load the bases with his ninth hit in
18 career at-bats versus Hershiser.
</P>
<P>
   That brought out Bobby Valentine, asking his starter whether he
thought he could escape the bases-loaded jam. Hershiser convinced
the manager to leave him in.
</P>
<P>
   One pitch later, however, Travis Lee's hit dropped just inside
the left-field line for a bases-clearing double, the Mets were down
by 8-6 and Hershiser was leaving the game.

 JONES LAWYERS WANT $496,000 FROM CLINTON  
(Eds: See also STARR-STEELE) 
(mk) 
 By NEIL A. LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Lawyers for Paula Jones told a federal judge in
Arkansas Friday that President Clinton owed them more than $496,000
as a result of extra work they say they were forced to perform
because of his dishonest testimony in her sexual misconduct case.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Bennett, Clinton's lawyer, immediately denounced the
request as ``unreasonable, greedy and contrary to law,'' and said
he would challenge the amount before the judge, Susan Webber
Wright.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Bennett said in a letter to Ms. Wright that
the president would not challenge her order of April 12 holding him
in civil contempt. Ms. Wright ruled then that the president lied in
a deposition in the Jones case when, on Jan. 17, 1998, he denied
having engaged in sex with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   It was this ruling that led to the filing by the Jones lawyers
Friday. In holding Clinton in civil contempt _ the first time a
president had ever been held in contempt of court _ Ms. Wright
ordered that he pay the Jones lawyers ``any reasonable expenses,''
including legal fees, incurred because of his false testimony. In
addition, she ordered him to reimburse the court $1,202, her
expenses for traveling from Little Rock, Ark., to Washington on
Jan. 17 to preside over the deposition.
</P>
<P>
   The size of the Jones lawyers' request for reimbursement and the
swift reaction of the president's chief personal lawyer insures
that the remnants of a case that vexed the Clinton White House for
years and ultimately led to a presidential impeachment drama will
not be put to rest soon.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Wright dismissed Mrs. Jones' lawsuit in April 1998, saying
that even if there was truth in her accusation _ that Clinton
propositioned her in a Little Rock hotel room when he was governor
of Arkansas and she a state clerical employee _ his act did not
amount to sexual harassment or a violation of her constitutional
rights.
</P>
<P>
   In their appeal of that dismissal, Mrs. Jones' lawyers argued
that Clinton had lied in denying a sexual relationship with Ms.
Lewinsky. They cited his admission of last August that in fact he
had had a relationship with her that he described as
``inappropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the appeals court could rule, the president settled the
case by giving Mrs. Jones $850,000, of which she received about
$200,000, with the rest going to her various lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   In filings Friday, the Dallas law firm of Rader, Campbell,
Fisher &AMP; Pyke, which represented Mrs. Jones, submitted fees and
expenses totaling $437,825, while the Rutherford Institute of
Charlottesville, Va., which also provided representation, said it
was owed $58,533.
</P>
<P>
   The Dallas firm said in its submission that Clinton's denial of
an intimate relationship with Ms. Lewinsky ``became one of the most
important aspects'' of its case and involved the work of six
lawyers and two paralegals over many hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton's lies at his deposition as well as the lies in his
earlier answers to written interrogatories affected our work in
every step of the case from that point forward,'' the Dallas
lawyers asserted.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   They asked for more than $97,000 in fees and expenses that
accrued even before the Jan. 17 deposition, saying the president's
dishonesty began on Dec. 23, 1997, when he answered ``none'' to a
written question asking whether there were any female employees of
the federal government with whom he had had sexual relations.
</P>
<P>
   The expense claim also appears to demand that Clinton pay the
Dallas lawyers for their time spent with Linda Tripp, Ms.
Lewinsky's onetime friend, who became an informer for both the
Jones lawyers and Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel. The claim
includes a charge of $1,500 for 10 hours of work by one of the
Dallas lawyers, T. Wesley Holmes, on Jan. 16, 1998. That appears to
be a meeting with Mrs. Tripp, who was secretly interviewed the
night before the Clinton deposition.
</P>
<P>
   On the day of the deposition, Clinton was so stunned by the
detailed knowledge implicit in the Jones lawyers' questions that he
canceled evening plans and summoned his personal secretary, Betty
Currie, to see him the next day, when he discussed with her his
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   In their filing Friday, the Dallas lawyers said the task of
selecting which of their expenses were attributable to Clinton's
false answers about Ms. Lewinsky had been extremely onerous. In
fact, included in their claim is a bill for more than $12,000 to
pay the costs of trying to figure out how much they were owed.
</P>
<P>
   The expenses range from a $12 claim, for a $60-an-hour paralegal
to read The New York Times and The Washington Post for articles
about Ms. Lewinsky, to lawyers' fees of $150 to $225 an hour for
preparation of legal documents. The Dallas lawyers said their fees
were especially reasonable in comparison with the hourly rate
charged by Bennett, which they estimated at $450.
</P>
<P>
   As for the president's decision not to challenge the contempt
order, some legal scholars had said they thought he would have
strong grounds to fight it. But White House officials said the main
reason for not doing so was to be rid of the case as quickly as
possible.
</P>
<P>
   They also said they had expected that the Jones legal fees in
connection with the contempt order would be about $100,000.

POINTING THE WAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ Tracking Derek Fisher's NBA career is a
little like watching a seismograph track earthquake aftershocks.
The lines are steady for a while, then jump wildly across the
screen before settling into a calm rhythm again. At least until the
next jolt.
</P>
<P>
   And so far, Fisher's three-year stint with the Lakers has been
less predictable than the shift of tectonic plates.
</P>
<P>
   A quick review of '98: He's the backup point guard, then he's
the starter. Then he's the starter, but he's playing less minutes
than the backup.
</P>
<P>
   New season: He's the starter again. But then he's told he won't
play in crunch time. Then he's starting games but not finishing,
again playing second-string minutes.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of weeks later, he's the backup again. Two months
later, he's the starter again. But, as always, with no guarantees
about what the next game, or even the next quarter, holds for him.
</P>
<P>
   If it's a bit dizzying, it should give you a feel for what the
24-year-old from Arkansas-Little Rock has been through in his short
pro career. Even now, after starting the last 11 games of the
season, anointed the starter for the playoffs that begin Sunday,
Fisher says it's hard to say he feels like the Lakers' starter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been too crazy. It's been way too crazy,'' he said. ``I'm
starting basically by default. It's not really a feeling of I'm
starting because I'm clearly the best guy for the position or
anything like that. I just feel like I'm starting because I'm
playing well right now, and that could change. That's what's kind
of tough. You really don't know how long it's gonna last, so you
just have to go out and just play.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's where Fisher's rough-and-tumble attitude has
benefited him and the Lakers the most. Since re-inheriting the
starting job from Derek Harper on April 13, Fisher has gradually
regained his confidence and has played at his highest level in the
last week.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers won their last four games of the regular season, and
Fisher finished with a flurry as well _ averaging 8.0 points and
7.3 assists in the last three games.
</P>
<P>
   When coach Kurt Rambis handed Fisher the reins a few weeks back,
it was because he wanted to rest the 37-year-old Harper. But by the
time the season ended, Fisher had fended off a challenge from
hyperactive rookie Tyronn Lue and won the three-way battle for the
starting job.
</P>
<P>
   His steady play bodes well for the Lakers, who figure Fisher and
Kobe Bryant should give them an edge over the Houston Rockets'
all-rookie backcourt.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way he's been distributing the basketball, Fisher's been
in control,'' Rambis said. ``He's making the right plays at the
right time, getting the ball to the right people. His defense has
always been good, his heart's always been huge, he's just been
playing with more confidence. And I think it shows in all of his
decision making.''
</P>
<P>
   That hasn't always been the case. If there's anything
predictable, in fact, about Fisher's performance, it's that his
slumps usually coincide with a blow to his confidence.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Fisher impressed everyone when he stepped in for the
injured Nick Van Exel in mid-February and played the best month of
his career. But when Van Exel returned and chose to come off the
bench, coach Del Harris eventually started giving Van Exel, an
All-Star, the majority of minutes. Fisher's confidence sagged, he
became more hesitant on the court and his play suffered.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Fisher had shown management he was capable of starting for a
championship contender, and that made the decision easier to ship
Van Exel to Denver last June.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher came to camp as the incumbent starter, with Harper
brought in as backup and tutor. But the day before the season
opener, Harris told Fisher that Harper would finish games. The
unspoken message seemed to be: We trust you, just not during crunch
time.
</P>
<P>
   That, Fisher said, was ``the low point'' of his season. Here he
was in a contract year, trying to prove himself worthy of a
long-term deal from the Lakers, and he'd just had the rug yanked
out from under him.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's really where the mentally exhausting part started,''
Fisher said. ``It put me in the hole from the beginning. Here we
are, we haven't even played a game yet, and he's telling me I
probably won't be playing in the fourth quarter. It was hard for me
to comprehend. And it affected me physically, because mentally I
was all messed up.''
</P>
<P>
   So much so that he stumbled out of the gate, playing a hesitant
and ineffective game for the first two weeks. Harper, meanwhile,
was playing like a 25-year-old again, and Harris eventually
promoted him over Fisher.
</P>
<P>
   It hurt Fisher, who probably worked as hard as anyone during the
offseason, playing daily at UCLA and coming to camp in prime shape.
</P>
<P>
   ``At times I really didn't feel like I was contributing what I
knew I could. I knew how hard I had worked for seven months during
the lockout, and I wasn't even close to playing at the good level I
was capable of playing.''
</P>
<P>
   But after days of second-guessing himself, trying to change his
playing style to fit someone else's expectations and regular calls
to Germany to seek moral support from his brother, Duane
Washington, Fisher just went back to playing without thinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been really tough mentally dealing with my own individual
situation, but I think what made it harder for me is we weren't
playing well as a team,'' he said. ``The team was struggling and
that really was hard, trying to tell myself to stay positive every
day, always having to figure out some new trick to stay positive
and stay confident.''
</P>
<P>
   No tricks are needed now. Although Fisher thought his latest
stint as starter would be temporary, he's made it easy for Rambis
to decide against tinkering again. The vote of confidence, however
soft, has made Fisher an effective starter again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm playing more relaxed and more confident, and that's
because I know I'm gonna be out on the floor,'' he said. ``Before I
tried to play not to come out, trying not to make a mistake or
feeling like I had to make every shot to stay in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I feel confident enough where if I miss two or three shots
in a row or I turn the basketball over a couple times, I still know
that I'm gonna be out there on the floor contributing in other ways
and just giving it all that I have. That's done tremendous things
for me mentally.''
</P>
<P>
   A little predictability, in other words, can be comforting.

MARTINEZ STEALS ALL THE MO-MENTUM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.1999 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Anaheim Angels pitcher Shigetoshi Hasegawa noticed the
horde of television reporters and cameramen surrounding somebody
just outside the Angels dugout before Friday's game against the
Boston Red Sox and couldn't resist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who are they talking to? Madonna? Michael Jackson?'' Hasegawa
asked.
</P>
<P>
   It was none other than Mo Vaughn, whose return to Fenway Park in
an Angels uniform ended without the drama and excitement that was
evident before the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels could blame Red Sox starter Pedro Martinez for
spoiling Vaughn's homecoming. Martinez struck out a career-high 15
while throwing eight shutout innings in the Red Sox's 6-0 victory
before a sellout crowd of 32,220.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn got a standing ovation from the crowd as he walked toward
the plate for his first-inning at-bat, but also heard a smattering
of boos. The crowd cheered even louder when Martinez struck him out
with a changeup for the second out of the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn finished the game 0-for-4, striking out twice, reaching
on a fielder's choice and flying out to center. A night that
started with Vaughn in the spotlight ended with Martinez taking
bows.
</P>
<P>
   ``Great pitchers can do that,'' Angels manager Terry Collins
said. ``A lot of times great pitchers can make a game like that
with all the hype and take the steam out of it. And it did for
us.''
</P>
<P>
   For Vaughn, the game gave him cause for reflection.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was out there looking at the guys I came up with, guys I won
games with, that was the sad part,'' he said. ``But I had to move
on. I'm glad I got through this. I'm glad it's over. It wasn't
something I marked on my calendar when the season started. I've
played a lot of games, and I just wanted to make this another
one.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez (6-1) gave up six hits and did not walk a batter in
making 126 pitches. And while he was hard on the Angels hitters, he
still has a soft spot for Vaughn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said hi to him,'' Martinez said. ``He looked at me like he
always looked at me when he used to play first base, to let me know
that he still loves me and respects me.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a strange atmosphere for the Angels before the game with
so much media attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a distraction, but it's fun,'' Collins said during all
the hoopla. ``It's part of the game. You guys have been to the
World Series, the All-Star game. It's what the game is all about.
It's still entertainment, it's still a business. And one of the
biggest entertainers came back.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins said he saw Friday's game as a test for his players. How
would they perform under such scrutiny?
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have this kind of attention you find out who can play
under this scenario,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels didn't show their manager much, although they had
chances against Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   In the first inning, Darin Erstad led off with a double and was
stranded. In the fourth, they had runners at first and second with
one out when Troy Glaus singled to center.
</P>
<P>
   However, Matt Walbeck initially broke back towards second. He
managed to beat center fielder Damon Buford's throw home, but
catcher Jason Varitek blocked the plate and forced Walbeck to slide
past the plate without touching it. Varitek then tagged him out.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the game, Walbeck was run over at the plate by Troy
O'Leary, who tried to score from first on a double by Mike Stanley.
Walbeck hung onto the ball for the out, but had to come out of the
game and had an icepack on his neck and right shoulder after the
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``He got me pretty good, he got me on the chin,'' Walbeck said.
``He could have slid, I gave him half the plate.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked why he didn't run over Varitek when he had the chance,
Walbeck said: ``I don't do that because you can (mess) yourself up.
I'm not going to knock the ball out of his hand, I'm 5-10.... I've
made that (hook slide) a thousand times. It was the right play. He
just rode my foot off the plate. It was a good play on his part.''
</P>
<P>
   Angels starter Omar Olivares didn't pitch poorly, but he was no
match for Martinez. Olivares (3-3) gave up four runs (three earned)
and seven hits in five-plus innings.

IT'S NOT GRAND NIGHT FOR DODGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ As Alan Mills disappeared down the runway of the
Los Angeles Dodgers dugout Friday night, Darren Dreifort made a
point to pat him on the behind and tell him things were OK.
</P>
<P>
   Things obviously were not OK, not after Mills allowed a
pinch-hit grand slam to Bruce Aven in the seventh inning that gave
the lowly Florida Marlins a 6-3 victory in front of a sellout crowd
of 54,009 at Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   But Mills, who replaced Dreifort with one out in the seventh,
has been the Dodgers' best setup man. He had nine consecutive
scoreless appearances and batters were 1 for 19 with runners in
scoring position.
</P>
<P>
   Against the Marlins, who were opening a nine-game trip after a
2-11 homestand, that usually would have been enough.
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort, who was eight outs from his fifth victory in six
decisions, also knew he was to blame. He did not walk a batter
until the seventh, which would have been a story in itself. He had
walked 22 in 21 innings in April, but just one in his first May
start.
</P>
<P>
   But suddenly in the seventh, Mark Kotsay singled with one out
and Derrek Lee walked. Pitching coach Charlie Hough came to the
mound and the bullpen got busy. Todd Dunwoody followed with an RBI
double to left to cut the Dodgers lead to 3-2.
</P>
<P>
   Jorge Fabregas was intentionally walked and Mills entered the
game. Aven, batting for Marlins starter Dennis Springer (1-4),
worked the count to 2-2 before driving a fastball into the
left-field bleachers.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first pinch grand slam in Marlins history. It also
led to the first save for Marlins hard-throwing closer Matt Mantei,
who had made 12 appearances this season without even a save
opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Mantei allowed a leadoff double to Todd Hundley to open the
ninth, Hundley's second double of the game. But Eric Karros struck
out. Adrian Beltre, who gave the Dodgers a 1-0 lead in the third
with his second home run, blooped a single to right that moved a
cautious Hundley to third.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Grudzielanek, who does not have a hit this season with
runners in scoring position, popped to short for the second out.
Pinch-hitter Todd Hollandsworth represented the tying run at the
plate, but he struck out on a fastball over his head.
</P>
<P>
   The loss ruined a chance for the Dodgers to keep pace with the
San Francisco Giants, who won and now lead the Dodgers by 1{ games
in the NL West.
</P>
<P>
   It is a little early for pennant talk, but the Giants have been
struggling and the Dodgers were coming off a 7-2 road trip.
</P>
<P>
   Beltre gave the Dodgers a 1-0 lead in the third and the club
added two more in the fourth on an RBI single by Raul Mondesi and
an RBI by Karros on a fielder's choice.
</P>
<P>
   But that play hurt the Dodgers, too. Mondesi took off from
second on the grounder to short and was thrown out trying to take
third. The Dodgers didn't score again.
</P>
<P>
   Springer, who spent seven seasons in the Dodgers organization,
pitched out of trouble in the second when Mondesi was cut down at
the plate on a two-out grounder to short by Karros.
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi collided with Fabregas at the plate and the two
exchanged words.
</P>
<P>
   Beltre, who batted .417 (10 for 24) on the trip, opened the
third with his second home run of the season, a drive that just
cleared the fence in right-center. It was his second of the year
and raised his average against right-handers to .409 (26 for 66).

CHINA ASSAILS `GROSS VIOLATION OF SOVEREIGNTY'

<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ The Chinese government called the attack on its
embassy in Belgrade a ``gross violation of Chinese sovereignty'' in
a statement read on television news Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The report, on the main national news program at noon Saturday,
was the first notice to the public here of the embassy bombing,
which seems certain to evoke public outrage and to damage
Chinese-American relations.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign policy experts and officials said the attack would
create intense pressures on the government to oppose forcefully the
U.S.-led air attacks in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The news program on China Central Television included images of
the burning embassy and rescue operations, with commentary by
telephone from a reporter on the scene who said the embassy had
been directly struck by two missiles and had been damaged by a
third that exploded close by.
</P>
<P>
   The program said that two Chinese had been killed in the attack,
including a journalist from the New China News Agency, Shao
Yunhuan. It said 20 had been injured and two others were still
missing .
</P>
<P>
   The Beijing announcer read an unusually harsh government
statement that condemned ``U.S.-led NATO'' for violating Chinese
sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   As news of the bombing and casualties becomes more widely known
here, it is certain to inflame the already passionate sense that
NATO's bombing raids in Yugoslavia constitute illegal aggression _
a view deeply held by much of the public as well as by officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government has already been under increasing pressure to
take stronger action against the NATO bombing,'' said a military
officer who spoke on the condition of anonymity, and did not know
about the embassy incident until he was told.
</P>
<P>
   The officer said that even before the attack, there was a
consensus among senior military officers that China should more
strongly counter the NATO raids, which China views as an illegal
intervention in a sovereign country.
</P>
<P>
   On hearing of a Yugoslav news agency report that the embassy had
been hit by more than one bomb, the officer said this would
indicate that the attack on China's embassy might have been
deliberate.
</P>
<P>
   If current diplomatic initiatives fail to stop the campaign, it
is not clear what direct measures China can take to counter NATO.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Saturday morning, Jia Qingguo, a professor of
international studies at Beijing University, said, ``This
strengthens the hand of those who have argued for closer
Chinese-Russian cooperation in aiding Serbia against NATO.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Those who have heard this news are very angry,'' Jia said.
``This is an act of aggression against China.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, China opposed the bombing but Yugoslavia was far
away,'' Jia said. ``Now the war is brought closer to home.''
</P>
<P>
   From the start, China has virulently opposed the American-led
bombing of Yugoslavia. The state-run media attacked the NATO
operations as barbarism, part of a plot to extend NATO control over
eastern Europe. It has been consistently one-sided in its coverage
of the conflict and has virtually ignored evidence of Serb
brutality in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Until Saturday, the official Chinese reaction has been
rhetorical. China has appeared eager to preserve good ties with the
United States even as it violently objects to American policy over
Kosovo.

KARL CALLINGS IN HELP FOR BUCKS PLAYOFF RUN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Now that George Karl has led the Bucks to the
playoffs, he's really getting serious.
</P>
<P>
   The former Sonics coach/leakmeister has signed Del Harris _ who
guided Milwaukee into the playoffs in '92, the last time they made
it _ to lend a hand with scouting. Karl also called Kevin Johnson
to see if the Suns' retired point guard might be available for the
postseason.
</P>
<P>
   Let's just assume that Karl's aggressive playoff preparations
have just a little to do with the ex-Sonics coach's desire to stay
alive in May while his former team is already on a long,
uncomfortable summer vacation.
</P>
<P>
   George may leak to Sonics fans, but Wally Walker is the one
``taking full responsibility and making no excuses.''
</P>
<P>
   For anyone familiar with Karl, what's the over-under on Karl
shortening his rotation to eight players against the heavily
favored Pacers and benching Ervin Johnson?
</P>
<P>
   A JET ALL THE WAY: It is sad news about Leon Hess. The oil
tycoon and owner of the Jets died Friday at the age of 85. That
means after suffering through Bruce Coslet and Rich Kotite, Hess
did not live to see his team in another Super Bowl, though Lord
knows Bill Parcells busted his Tuna gills to make it happen.
</P>
<P>
   THREE-TO-ONE: Odds that Seahawks owner Paul Allen gets a Super
Bowl ring in his lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   SUZUKI VS. IRABU: Sushi series in New York, just like the old
times.
</P>
<P>
   TRADE (DE)BAIT: Why all the ruckus about the Mariners needing to
make a blockbuster trade right now for a starter? Has anyone looked
at the AL West standings? Do you really want to give up David Segui
or Russ Davis _ or, heaven forbid, A-Rod this far before his
contract is up _ if 79 wins could swipe this under-.500 division?
Let the not-so-mighty M's muck it out.
</P>
<P>
   DROP AND GIVE US 25: Summer diet suggestions for Vin Baker, who
loves to cook. Oatmeal, not omelets, for breakfast. Rice cakes,
carrot sticks, orange roughy, cod or broiled scrod _ if you're back
in New England. No sour cream on the baked potato, no alfredo sauce
on the pasta or scampi butter on the shrimp. Water instead of fruit
juice (high carbs and calories). Lots of green, leafy vegetables
and for a rare treat, may we suggest Ben &AMP; Jerry's Cherry Garcia
low-fat frozen yogurt.
</P>
<P>
   A SIGN THAT THE APOCALYPSE IS UPON US?: The NHL has filed a
claim in federal bankruptcy court to dismantle the cash-strapped
Penguins, which could spell the end for the 1991 and '92 Stanley
Cup champs.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball is not far behind. In Kansas City, the in-limbo Royals
could be next. Or Montreal, where the Expos just finished a 2-8
homestand and the average attendance (11,489) is the lowest in
baseball, which begs the question:
</P>
<P>
   Why can't baseball adopt the socialist revenue-sharing policies
of the very healthy National Football League, which is now helping
Massachusetts pay to build a stadium to keep the Patriots?
</P>
<P>
   PAYTON'S PLACE: One thing came out of the Sonics' finale in
L.A., and that was Detlef Schrempf's level of discontent. What do
you think drove the disenchanted Schrempf to publicly question
whether the Sonics had the right ``attitude, commitment, work
ethic'' to entice him back?
</P>
<P>
   After trying for years to squelch feelings that the Sonics'
premier point guard can do as much damage to the team as good,
Schrempf's frustration with Gary Payton became obvious this bust of
a season. If Schrempf signs with another team, it will be because
he, like other Sonics, feels Payton is out of control. Payton truly
holds the keys to this franchise and needs to take care.
</P>
<P>
   THE QUESTION: What disparaging comments will Charles Barkley
have for Allen Iverson now that the Sixers star has earned his
first scoring title _ and gotten Sir Charles' old, old team into
the playoffs? For a guy who spits on fans and pushes fellow bar
patrons through windows, maybe Barkley should lay off the Philly
kid.
</P>
<P>
   DEATH WISH: Scottish soccer referee Hugh Davis needed four
stitches in his head after he was struck by a coin during last
Sunday's match between Celtic and Rangers, presumably by Celtic
fans angry over calls during their team's 3-0 loss. Davis' reward?
He gets to referee the rematch when the same teams meet in the
Scottish Cup final May 29.
</P>
<P>
   And baseball umpires think they have it bad?
</P>
<P>
   NBA UPSET SPECIALS: Or first-round playoff results we could root
for but that aren't likely. Suns shoot down Blazers. C. Webb and
White Chocolate out-run and out-gun Stockton and Malone.
</P>
<P>
   Bucks topple Pacers. Sixers (Iverson) and Magic (Penny Hardaway)
play triple-overtime in Game 5.
</P>
<P>
   JERRY SPRINGER SERIES: Knicks def. Heat by TKO.
</P>
<P>
   NOTE TO NBC: Lakers-Rockets isn't the only series we want to
see.
</P>

   BASEBALL DIPLOMACY: After seeing how poorly the Orioles play the
game, of course the Cuban baseball players decided they would
rather go home.

MISMATCH IN BRONX AS YANKS BEAT UP ON MARINER ROOKIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYLER KEPNER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ If it seems confidence must be low among Mariner
relievers after another stinging loss Friday night, consider the
confidence of their instructor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they have to start talking to me to keep my confidence
up, because it's getting a little tiresome seeing that many runs
every night,'' said pitching coach Stan Williams, after Seattle's
10-1 loss to the New York Yankees. ``We're sitting on a 6.50 ERA as
a team. That's incredible. I keep waiting for this thing to get
better, we're trying, we're really working on things, but we
haven't been getting what we're going to have to get, period.''
</P>
<P>
   All four pitchers who worked for the Mariners Friday are
rookies. Another, Freddy Garcia, starts Saturday, and a sixth,
Brett Hinchliffe, could start Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   There were strong indications Friday that Hinchliffe could join
the team Saturday, and Sunday's starter, John Halama, was forced
into mop-up duty Friday night. Halama said he didn't know if his
arm could bounce back for a start Sunday because he has so little
experience as a reliever.
</P>
<P>
   Starter Mac Suzuki shut out the Yankees for four innings Friday,
but unraveled in the fifth, allowing a three-run homer to Derek
Jeter. Suzuki and Eric Weaver allowed four runs in the sixth, and
two runs scored off Sean Spencer in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Weaver and Spencer have 14 major league games between them, and
combined with Ken Cloude to allow four runs in a loss to Cleveland
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Believe me, if we can get some experienced (relief) pitching
in here, we're going to have to, if we can,'' said manager Lou
Piniella. ``(The media) and the fans are going to lose their
patience before I do, I can tell you that.''
</P>
<P>
   Suzuki appeared in control with two outs and a runner on first
in the fifth. But he hit Chad Curtis, who was batting .163, to
bring up Jeter, the American League's leading hitter. Suzuki had
his mind on the hit-by-pitch when he hung a split-finger that Jeter
crushed over the center field wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I was disappointed before, when I hit Curtis,'' Suzuki
said. ``That (pitch) was hanging, but still, I was thinking about
Curtis.''
</P>
<P>
   Suzuki left trailing 4-0 with one out and the bases loaded.
Weaver induced a soft chopper by Luis Sojo, picked it up, whirled
and threw off-balance to home for the force. The throw bounced wide
of the plate, and by the time catcher Dan Wilson recovered it and
lunged back toward home, two Yankees had scored.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm ready for it to start turning my way,'' said Weaver, who
lost Thursday's game. ``It's a tough situation I'm in, but that's
what I want, and obviously that's the way they're using me. I'll
take a line drive right at somebody right now, just for something
positive.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees' biggest positive Friday was the pitching of Hideki
Irabu (1-0), who held the M's to a Russ Davis solo homer and three
other hits over seven innings as New York improved to 11-1 at home.
</P>
<P>
   The matchup of Irabu and Suzuki was the first in major league
history of two Japanese starters. But it was more coincidence than
a sign of any increasing influence of Japanese pitchers on the
majors. The trailblazer, 1995 National League Rookie of the Year
Hideo Nomo, recently signed with his third team this season, and
neither Irabu nor Suzuki had a decision before Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   The game did not attract the widespread Japanese media attention
some had predicted. Although the game was televised in Japan, only
about 15 Japanese media members attended, which the Yankees said
was no greater than the turnout for an average Irabu start.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not such a big deal,'' Shoko Mizutsugi, of Japan's
Baseball Magazine, said of Friday's game. ``People are used to
Japanese pitchers in the major leagues. A lot of people were crazy
about Nomo a few years ago, but now a lot of Japanese are settled
down about watching pitchers pitch for major league teams. ... This
season, (Masato) Yoshii of the Mets is the only Japanese starter
pitching well. So this (matchup) is a rare case this season.''
</P>
<P>
   Suzuki, who was making just his seventh career start, is largely
a curiosity in Japan. Not much is known about him, Mizutsugi said,
because he signed with the Mariners at age 18 and never played
professionally in Japan.
</P>

   ``Everybody knows him, but he is not as popular (as others),''
Mizutsugi said. ``He hasn't proved himself yet in baseball, so
people don't know how good he is.''

   Piniella said he will keep Suzuki in the rotation, though he was
hoping his pitcher would last longer than 107 pitches Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a big, strong kid,'' Piniella said. ``He should be able
to give us seven innings. This is his second start. There's no
reason why after a couple of starts, he can't throw 115-120 pitches
a game.''

   Only once in the past 10 games has a Mariner starter worked
seven innings, and that was in a loss. Only three times this year
has a Mariners starter worked seven innings in a game the M's won.

<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ The U.N. Security Council met in an emergency
session early Saturday morning to consider the NATO bombing of the
Chinese Embassy in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese mission led by Qin Huasun issued a statement
condemning the bombing. ``NATO's barbarian act is a gross violation
of the U.N. Charter, international law and norms covering
international relations,'' the statement said. ``It is also a
violation of the Geneva Convention. NATO should be responsible for
all the consequences. We call on NATO to stop immediately its
military actions.''
</P>
<P>
   The Russian representative, Sergei V. Lavrov, said early on
Saturday: ``I don't think it's a proper time for comment on the
diplomatic process. It means a lot for the Chinese Embassy.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As delegates filed into the Security Council chamber near
midnight, Peter Burleigh, the acting U.S. representative at the
United Nations, struck a tone that was both cautious and resolute.
``In case it was a NATO bomb, it is obviously something we deeply
regret, and we apologize for it. We never target civilians and we
would never target an embassy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Burleigh added: ``I also feel, and will say to the council, that
it's very important, despite this, to keep our eye on the big
picture, and the big picture is that Slobodan Milosevic is
responsible for what's going on in Yugoslavia now.''
</P>
<P>
   China, a permanent member of the Security Council, with veto
rights, has strongly opposed the NATO bombing, saying the entire
operation violated the ``territorial integrity'' of a sovereign
country.
</P>
<P>
   Beijing has represented Yugoslav interests in the United States
since Belgrade broke diplomatic ties with Washington after the air
strikes began March 24.
</P>
<P>
   In Belgrade, the Chinese ambassador, Pan Zhanlien, standing
before the shattered embassy in the capital's New Belgrade
district, said, ``the People's Republic has been attacked.'' Fire
trucks converged on the building, which was engulfed in smoke.

</P>
<P>

people of southern Africa, practive Judaic rites and claim that
they were led out of Judea by a man named Buba. Although there is
no Buba in the records of Jewish history, the remarkable thing

cohanim, the Jewish priests believed to be the descendants of
Aaron. By Nicholas Wade.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   SYRIA-ASSAD (Damascus) _ With the Clinton administration having
vowed to try again in the months ahead to promote peace between
Syria and Israel, President Assad's fixation on succession has left
some diplomats here concerned. They say they worry that he might be
less willing to make concessions out of concern that any domestic
criticism would rebound against his son. By Douglas Jehl.
</P>
<P>
   AFRICA-REFUGEES (Kaputa, Zambia) _ International aid officials
say all refugees are treated equally, but there is no doubt that
the world's attention is on the hundreds of thousands of people
displaced in the Balkans, and refugees and aid workers in Africa
worry that attention to the plight of refugees here may fade even
further. By Ian Fisher.
</P>
<P>
   INDONESIA-U.S.-POLICE (Washington) _ The Clinton administration
has decided to offer riot-control training to the Indonesian police

   UNINSURED-CHILDREN (Washington) _ States are using less than 20
percent of the money that Congress made available, with much
fanfare, for a big new program to subsidize health insurance for
children in low-income families. Some states say they can't find
enough eligible uninsured kids to use their full allotments of
federal money. The accumulation of unspent cash is tempting
Republicans in Congress to take some back and use it for other
purposes. By Robert Pear.
</P>
<P>
   UTAH-JUDGE (Washington) _ Ted Stewart, chief of staff to Utah's
Republican governor, would not seem a likely candidate for
President Clinton to nominate as a federal judge. Stewart, a GOP
political operative, is widely disliked by environmental groups.
But Clinton is about to name Stewart, who is being pushed by Sen.
Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee who

Rosenbaum.

<P>
   ASSISTED-LIVING (Framingham, Mass.) _ A look at one of the most
dramatic changes in the way the old live, the assisted living
movement. Ten years ago, assisted living facilities, which provide
private apartments plus daily assistance, were barely known. There
was no step between independence and helplessness. Today, some 1.2
million people live in assisted living facilities, and towns across
the country are asking developers to build more so that their aging
residents can stay close to home. By Sarah Rimer.
</P>
<P>
   MEDIA-YOUTH-VIOLENCE (Undated) _ As the White House prepares to
talk to education and entertainment industry officials about the

say, studies have shown that there is a connection. By Lawrie

COMMENTARY: LONG SHOTS AND SHADOWS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By BOB HERBERT    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   I keep running into people who tell me that Al Gore can't or
won't win the presidency. These are ordinary voters, not
politicians or people in the media. Most are right in step with
Gore philosophically. But they are saying the same things everybody
seems to be saying about the vice president. He's a cardboard
figure. Doesn't connect with people. Gives lousy speeches. Al Bore.
</P>
<P>
   So I ask who they think will be the next president, and they say
Bush. I ask why and I get silence. I ask if they know Bush's full
name and most say George Bush Jr. I ask if they know what he's done
as governor of Texas and they haven't a clue. I ask if they know
what his position is on guns, or abortion, or the war in the
Balkans, and the reply is usually something like: ``Hey, I'm not
saying I'm for him or anything. I'm just saying Gore can't win and
Bush probably can.''
</P>
<P>
   A number have also said Bill Bradley is looking pretty good.
</P>
<P>
   Listen up. We know that anything can happen between now and
November of next year. The economy could fall into a sinkhole. We
could find out that George W. Bush, in his first crack at national
office, has campaign skills that a Ronald Reagan or a John Kennedy
would envy. Bill Bradley, somewhat vague to date, may turn his big
themes into specific policies so irresistible he steals the
Democratic nomination from Gore, demolishes whatever candidate the
Republicans run against him, and becomes our tallest president.
</P>
<P>
   Any of those things could happen. But don't bet a lot of money
on it. Bush, for example, has already stumbled a couple of times in
his early attempts to master the finer points of foreign policy. He
recently referred to the Greeks as Grecians and the Kosovars as
Kosovoians.
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore may be a little stiff in front of the cameras, but he's
smart, he's got tons of campaign cash and, most significantly, he's
got an incredibly strong economy going for him.
</P>
<P>
   The early polls? Return with us for a moment to that thrilling
year, 1987. Vice President George Bush was gearing up for his run
for the presidency. E.J. Dionne Jr., then a reporter for The New
York Times (he's now a columnist for The Washington Post), did a
story about a Times poll and interviews with Republican Party
leaders. He wrote:
</P>
<P>
   ``The poll and the party leaders suggested that Bush was seen by
many Americans, even Republicans who like him, as somewhat boring,
too loyal to President Reagan to be true to himself. He is
respected for honesty but not for strength. He is viewed as a man
who stirs feelings of trust but not passion.''
</P>
<P>
   That summer Bush trailed Michael Dukakis by some 18 points. That
fall, John Harwood of The St. Petersburg Times wrote: ``Bush's
much-discussed image problem had gotten around. Several
participants observed that Bush is `weak' or `doesn't have the
charisma' that Reagan had displayed.'''
</P>
<P>
   It's the price you pay for standing in the shadow of the
presidency. The price is even higher if the president is
particularly popular or possesses extraordinary political skills.
Emerging from the shadow can be tough.
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore is not a charismatic or entertaining figure, and he has
been hurt by Bill Clinton's reckless behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``He seems tarnished somehow, I guess because he's been so loyal
to Clinton,'' a woman told me last week. ``It may not be fair, but
that's the way I feel.''
</P>
<P>
   That same woman added, however, ``I think he would be a good
president.''
</P>
<P>
   The voters who are ambivalent about Al Gore are concerned
largely with superficial matters, about whether he is stiff or
boring or comforting or entertaining. Working in the vice
president's favor is the fact that most of those voters already
believe he is capable of being a decent president, of leading the
country in an era of breathtaking economic and technological
change. And very few of those voters will be anxious to tinker with
the economic escalator the country has been riding the last few
years.
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore is hardly a sure thing. But he's a sitting vice
president in exceptionally good economic times. Whatever the early
polls are saying, the presidency is his to lose. Bill Bradley,
George W. Bush, Elizabeth Dole and all the rest are long shots by
comparison.  &QL;

COMMENTARY: GUNS AND POSES 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By MAUREEN DOWD    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When I went out to buy a gun one night, I had no
idea it would be easier and less expensive than buying a pink
cashmere sweater set.
</P>
<P>
   My friend Jill and I drove to a Sports Authority in a bland
strip mall in Virginia, near the Pentagon. Past fishing lures and
boogie boards we found the gun department.
</P>
<P>
   Beneath a plastic 175-pound deer target was a row of rifles _ a
Remington 12-gauge shotgun for $219, a Mossberg 12-gauge shotgun
for $239.99, a Browning 20-gauge deer rifle for $599.99.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would you like to try one?'' the young clerk asked pleasantly.
Jill opted for a basic black Mossberg. ``Nice pin,'' he said,
admiring her brooch, as she puzzled over whether the butt went
above or below the shoulder. It was as easy as Thelma and Louise: a
driver's license, half an hour for a computerized background check,
and the gun would have been ours.
</P>
<P>
   Trust me on this. I am not the sort of person who should be able
to walk out of a store with a really big gun in half an hour.
</P>
<P>
   It was a shopping trip that left me even more dubious about the
president's stressing the culture of violence as much as the
machines of violence.
</P>
<P>
   He called a White House summit on youth and media violence. But
none of his pals from Hollywood were willing to be publicly spanked
by the Clintons and Gores.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't want to be pilloried in public and put in a metal
stockade,'' said one industry executive.
</P>
<P>
   It galled the movie big shots to be summoned to the principal's
office by a president and vice president who have nurtured so many
close and lucrative ties in Hollywood. Next weekend, Clinton and
other Democratic leaders will attend a $1.5 million fund-raiser in
Beverly Hills hosted by the Dreamworks trio.
</P>
<P>
   So the Hollywood chieftains stiffed Washington, saying that only
their lobbyists would attend, and pointedly reminded the White
House of their lavish past support. They felt the president should
not be aping the Republicans and scapegoating the entertainment
industry.
</P>
<P>
   At first the Clintonites huffed that the Hollywood crowd was
wimping out. One took catty note that Edgar Bronfman Jr. of
Seagram's, which owns Universal, turned down the summit invitation
to open a roller coaster at Universal's new theme park in Orlando,
Fla. As if the Clinton White House is not enough of a roller
coaster.
</P>
<P>
   But Hollywood was right to boycott another politically
opportunistic gabfest. As Sean Daniel, a Hollywood producer, puts
it: ``The heads of movie, television and recording industries have
their share of responsibility. But they are being made to stand up
as symbols of much more complex behavior, a mix of evil, DNA,
parenting, isolation, the singleminded alienation of being in front
of a computer screen in your room six hours a day. People invoke
Hollywood as a catchall for all the influences that come off any
screen, including the Internet and video games.''
</P>
<P>
   Faced with all the no-shows, the White House had to recast
Monday's summit into a fuzzy hodgepodge on ``Children, Violence and
Responsibility,'' with no one famous taking part except Maya
Angelou. Besides soothing Hollywood, the president reached out to
the NRA, saying ``Let's bury the hatchet.'' (The NRA will gladly
bury the hatchet. It's the gun they won't bury.)
</P>
<P>
   Rob Reiner, the director, rearranged his schedule to come. But
then the White House, inexplicably, told him not to bother.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying we don't need some self-regulation,'' Reiner
told me. ``I hate those movies where hundreds of people get blown
up and there are jokes afterward. They poison the soul. Sure, kids
are affected, but not enough to turn a loved, securely attached
child into a violent killer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to figure out why our society is so angry, why our
technology is making us more disengaged from human interaction. And
we have to stop the easy access to guns. Canada, Germany, Japan,
England _ every country gets our movies, but they don't kill
anybody afterward.''
</P>
<P>
   The president deserves credit for his push on gun control. But
this is the moment to be brazen. He's wandering the White House
halls looking for a legacy. How about a take-no-prisoners,
give-no-quarter campaign against the NRA and a ban on handguns?

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Inside the visitors' locker room at Madison Square
Garden on Wednesday, some Miami Heat players were watching a
videotape of their horrendous loss to the Knicks on April 25.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most striking image during the Knicks' improbable
20-point comeback victory was the imposing figure walking upcourt,
biceps bulging, face contorted in a scowl.
</P>
<P>
   Alonzo Mourning looked ornery, as if his 6-foot-10-inch,
265-pound frame would erupt at the slightest sound of a referee's
whistle. But it did not. Instead, he continued walking.
</P>
<P>
   ``That box over there, you know, people pass judgment on
players, athletes and people in general by what they see on TV,''
Mourning said, sitting in front of his cubicle and pointing at the
television. ``That's my job right there. That's what I do.''
</P>
<P>
   This season Mourning is doing his job better than he has done in
his seven years in the National Basketball Association. Once an
ejection-prone center, Mourning is a candidate for most valuable
player. He led the league in blocked shots (3.9), ranked fourth in
shooting percentage (.511), sixth in rebounding (11.0) and 14th in
scoring (20.1). And Miami is the No. 1-seeded team in the Eastern
Conference playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The image of ``Zo Ready to Blow'' is unavoidable. Who can forget
his last-second altercation with Larry Johnson in the playoffs last
season that led to his suspension for Game 5, a Heat loss. This
season his technical fouls are down, his tolerance is up and no one
is crawling under his skin and planting fiendish ideas in his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a human being,'' Mourning said. ``People don't look at me
like that when they sit in front of the TV and watch me. So they
pass judgment on a person they don't even know. And they think I'm
some psycho, maniac, hard-to-get-along-with emotional guy. But
again, that's my job.''
</P>
<P>
   It remains to be seen whether he can maintain his equilibrium in
the crucible of Knicks-Heat III, a first-round, three-of-five
series that begins Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   This time, Mourning said, he will not blow. ``It was an
unfortunate situation and I regret that even happening,'' Mourning
said. ``Bottom line is, I made a bad decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Emotion is something that is part of my game. But in some
cases, it has affected me in a negative way. That's part of going
through the maturity process. Every player goes through a
maturation period where they develop and improve.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the aftermath of last year's fight changed his outlook.
</P>
<P>
   ``Competition is going to bring out the very best and the worst
in everybody over their careers,'' Heat Coach Pat Riley said. ``And
I think Zo has already had his worst times there. He's had a great,
great year. And I think a lot of it is born out of the fact that he
was very disappointed last year. He came back strong.''
</P>
<P>
   Mourning's wife, Tracy Wilson-Mourning, said: ``He thought about
the incident with Larry all summer, and how much it cost the team.
I think, more than anything, he made it a learning experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Tim Hardaway was approached by Mourning soon after the fight.
The two have been good friends and teammates the past three
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``He asked me if he was right,'' Hardaway said of exchanging
punches with Johnson. ``I said: `Yeah, you right. You did the right
thing.' I would have done the same thing, too. If the referee's not
going to take care of it, you got to take care of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Jack Ramsay, the Heat broadcaster and ESPN analyst, said: ``He's
no longer predictable. He would always drive to his right. Even if
all five defenders were there, he would say, `You're not going to
stop me.' He would try and bull his way in there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, the range of his offensive game _ the jump shot, driving
in either direction, the jump hook with either hand _ they all make
him better.''
</P>
<P>
   Mourning said: ``I've diversified, but the only statistical
difference is that my techs are lower. I'm staying in ball games.
It's extremely important for me to be on the court. That's my main
concern.''
</P>
<P>
   His agent, David Falk, said: ``It's not a kinder, gentler Alonzo
on the court. He's just more cerebral.''
</P>
<P>
   The transformation comes seven years after NBA scouts wondered
what position Mourning would play coming out of Georgetown: center
or power forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he interviewed with us, he asked us who the highest-paid
forward and center in the league were,'' Falk said. ``At the time,
I think Danny Ferry was the highest-paid forward at about $4
million a season and Patrick Ewing was making $11 million as the
highest-paid center. After that, I told him, `I never again want to
hear you say you're a power forward.'''
</P>
<P>
   Mourning signed a $100 million deal with the Heat in 1996, but
his playoff misadventures have given rise to criticism at home and
on the road, where he is a 6-10 villain.
</P>
<P>
   The intimidating presence who leads the league in death stares
is a private man who speaks in a raspy baritone, the kind you would
hear in a blues club at four in the morning.
</P>
<P>
   The scowling persona may not play well in visiting arenas _ he
is one of the most despised players by opposing fans _ but he has
another side: as the doting father of 2-year-old Alonzo 3d.
Mourning gave his wife a surprise birthday party last spring,
arranging for her close friends to fly into Miami. He also hates to
lose to her at Scrabble, and his generosity has few bounds.
</P>
<P>
   Last February he donated an estimated $70,000 worth of expensive
clothing and shoes to a 6-10 man who lost all his possessions in a
house fire. A friend of the man, Martin Williams, e-mailed Tim
Donovan, the Heat's director for sports media relations, asking for
Mourning's help.
</P>
<P>
   Donovan showed up at Mourning's house with three boxes and
stuffed them. Williams, a former college player at Hawaii Loa, had
played against Mourning in the two players' first collegiate game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know how hard it was for my parents to find clothes for me
growing up,'' Mourning said. ``Fortunately enough, he still had his
little girls and his family. I just cleaned out my closet and took
care of him.''
</P>
<P>
   During the lockout, Mourning let his teammate Mark Strickland
borrow his Mercedes-Benz convertible.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was waiting to sign his new deal and he needed something to
drive, so I took care of him,'' Mourning said. Laughing, he added,
``I told him before he brought it back to clean and service it.''
</P>
<P>
   For the last three years, Mourning, a foster child, has also
been host of a charity banquet, concert and celebrity game to
benefit the Children's Home Society and 100 Black Men of South
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``People sort of take his on-court demeanor and they transfer it
to his personal life,'' Riley said. ``It's easy to put a label on
him because he's a ferocious competitor. But he's an open, caring,
affable person.''
</P>
<P>
   Mourning often gives away several inches to his big-man
counterparts. Through will and the weight room, he has made himself
an elite center. Out of respect for Patrick Ewing, his good friend,
he will not compare their talents. But this season Mourning has
unofficially surpassed his former Georgetown mentor as one of the
game's dominant pivots.
</P>
<P>
   ``To so many players, practice to them is like a pause between
their cell-phone conversations,'' Marty Conlon, the Heat's reserve
forward, said. ``But Alonzo stays late working on his body, lifting
and shooting. It's refreshing to see.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes he takes the game so seriously and takes himself so
seriously. Well, I don't know if it's detrimental. But I think this
year he's a little more level-headed and grounded.''
</P>
<P>
   Mourning was thrown out of one game this season, on March 20 at
Indiana. The Heat lost that game and five of the next six. The
blow-up was another parable for what happens when the franchise
center does not have the mental discipline to stay on the court.
</P>
<P>
   It could be said that Mourning already learned his lesson by the
next game. Addressing his teammates in the locker room, he said,
``OK, guys, we got to keep our cool tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody looked at him like, `Oh, you're telling us to keep
our cool?' '' Terry Porter, the veteran Heat guard, said.
``Everybody just busted up laughing. We were like: `We're fine. You
have to deal with that issue by yourself.'''

SPORTS COLUMN: HESS EXPLORED THE JETS' RETURN TO NEW YORK 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By DAVE ANDERSON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In early January, Leon Hess attended a National
Football League owners meeting in Commissioner Paul Tagliabue's
office. The subject: how the NFL should coexist with the Internet
in the 21st century. But when the owners broke for lunch, Hess put
on his overcoat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sorry I can't stay,'' the Jets' owner told the
commissioner, ``but I've got a meeting with the mayor.''
</P>
<P>
   At that meeting, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani informed Hess of a
proposed West Side football stadium with a retractable dome. The
mayor hoped such a stadium would lure the Jets, after their Giants
Stadium lease expires in 2008, to a proposed complex that would
include a relocated Madison Square Garden and the Javits Convention
Center.
</P>
<P>
   Several days later, the mayor disclosed plans for the proposed
football stadium in his ``State of the City'' address.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the meeting with the mayor,'' Tagliabue was saying
Friday, ``Leon called to tell me this will take some serious
discussion, that the mayor and his staff had done a lot of work on
this. But here was a man almost 85 years old at the end of a
century who was looking ahead to the NFL being on the Internet and
to the possibility of a new football stadium in New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Leon Hess, who died Friday from complications of a blood
disease, always looked ahead, never back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leon was not what he liked to call a `dweller,' '' Steve
Gutman, the Jets' president, recalled. ``He would tell me `Don't
dwell on mistakes. Just think about how to do things better the
next time. Don't be a dweller.' ''
</P>
<P>
   And if a West Side football stadium materializes, part of Hess'
legacy will be having initially explored the possibility of the
Jets' return to New York more than two decades after leaving Shea
Stadium following the 1983 season.
</P>
<P>
   Hess, according to league sources, has mandated that the Jets be
sold after his death, so a new owner would be even more involved in
a West Side football-only stadium that presumably would mean that
the Yankees will stay in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   And if the mayor's plan for that West Side stadium progresses,
it surely would enhance the franchise's price beyond the estimates
of $500 million. That new Jets' owner will need to prove deep, deep
pockets.
</P>
<P>
   Although Leon Hess' only son, John, has often attended Jets
games with his father, he has never indicated any interest in
operating the team.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1995 John Hess, who has never been part of the Jets'
hierarchy, has been the chairman of the Amerada Hess oil company
that his father built into worldwide stature from one $24
oil-delivery truck in the Depression years of the 1930s. According
to Forbes magazine, Leon Hess' worth is listed at $730 million.
</P>
<P>
   According to other NFL owners, Hess had been approached over the
years by several prospective buyers who coveted the Jets, but he
never acknowledged it publicly. He didn't want to endure any
disruptive speculation. Even with all the Jets' frustrating
seasons, he enjoyed being a clubowner too much to consider selling.
</P>
<P>
   He particularly enjoyed hiring Bill Parcells, whose nickname is
Tuna, as the Jets' major domo in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was born and brought up in Asbury Park, N.J.,'' Hess said
that day in a rare appearance at a news conference. ``Bill Parcells
is in love with Sea Girt, N.J. They're eight miles apart. Seventy
years ago, as kids in the Summertime, at low tide we used to have a
little shovel and we'd go and dig up clams and sell them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big ones would go for clam chowder at the restaurants, the
little ones went to clam bars. We were lucky to make 50 or 75 cents
a day. Little did I think that 70 years later, eight miles away in
Sean Girt would be a Tuna. It's all the same ocean. Little did I
think the good Lord would favor me and I could marry that Tuna.''
</P>
<P>
   But when discussing the Jets, Leon Hess seldom laughed.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991 the Jets' game in Chicago coincided with that year's
Monday night opening of the Metropolitan Opera at Lincoln Center,
which Hess always attended with his wife Norma and several friends,
including Tagliabue and his wife Chan.
</P>
<P>
   While one of Hess' ears listened to Luciano Pavarotti, his other
ear was plugged to a portable radio describing the Jets game. After
the performance ended, Hess moved to a reception, but one ear was
still plugged to the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``There he was,'' Tagliabue recalled, ``sitting at a table in
his tuxedo with Pavarotti, Beverly Sills and several others
standing around listening to Leon give them a play-by-play of this
Monday night game that went into overtime.''
</P>
<P>
   That night the Jets lost, of course _ 19-13, in overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, when Hess was the Jets' owner, they lost more often
than not, but he never dwelled on those losses. Rather, he kept
trying to make the Jets better. By hiring Bill Parcells, he finally
did.
</P>
<P>
   And even as Leon Hess approached his 85th birthday, he was
exploring the idea of a new stadium that, if it materializes, would
bring the Jets back to New York.

SPORTS COLUMN: ROOTING AGAINST RICH EGOMANIACS IS BECOMING A
BASEBALL PASTIME 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By GEORGE VECSEY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bernie Williams thought he was back in the '60s. That's what the
Yankee center fielder said in Kansas City on April 30 when 2,000
fans staged a polite little protest at the ball park.
</P>
<P>
   Big deal. Nobody occupied the infield, trying to turn it into a
People's Park. No fans chained themselves to first base. No tear
gas. No billy clubs. No arrests. Call that a protest? Call that the
'60s?
</P>
<P>
   Still, the fans chanted and carried banners and even walked out
during the game to draw attention to the staggering salary gap in
baseball _ the Yankees' payroll being around $85 million and the
Royals' being around $23 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Royals promptly won two of four from the Yankees, one of the
moral victories of this young season. Another sweet little moment
was the Cuban state-supported amateurs scampering around the bases
Monday night in a 12-6 victory in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   Politics aside, the Cuban victory was one for the underdogs _
guys who get paid a few pesos a month, plus living benefits, to
play this game with panache. They don't drive fancy cars, wear
designer clothing or display valuable jewelry, but they sure as
heck humiliated a team with a current payroll of $78 million.
</P>
<P>
   Showing he was paying attention, Ray Miller, the manager of the
Orioles, suggested his players had dogged it against the Cubans.
The ugly loss probably delayed Miller's firing by a week or two,
since the owner, Peter Angelos, probably realized he had done his
team a disservice.
</P>
<P>
   Angelos should have known that satiated major leaguers drawing
seven-digit salaries would not have enough imagination to want to
hustle against the Cubans on what could have been a rare night off.
</P>
<P>
   By a delightful coincidence, it was also the week in which the
Orioles got their luxury-tax bill for the year _ $4,067,305 for
having one of the top five payrolls in the sport.
</P>
<P>
   That's right. It will cost Angelos a mere $4 million extra to
pay his leaden mix of weary Cal Ripken, sullen Albert Belle,
over-the-hill Will Clark and a pitching staff that produces rockets
that evoke visions of that fabled night at Fort McHenry.
</P>
<P>
   For a huge swath of fans in downscale television markets, that
is going to be the rooting interest for the foreseeable future.
Since only two teams can reach the World Series every year, most
fans must learn to love watching rich egomaniacs fail.
</P>
<P>
   It will have to suffice for fans in Montreal or Pittsburgh to
watch the Dodgers ($5.1 million), Yankees ($4.2 million), Orioles
($4 million), Braves ($772,506) and Mets ($525,156) settle their
tabs, like rich drunks paying for the champagne that made some of
them sick.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here, my good man, keep the change,'' the rich teams tell the
poor teams.
</P>
<P>
   Even that luxury-tax system runs out after this season, to be
replaced by _ well, nothing. The new commissioner of baseball, Bud
Selig, has lamented the disparity between the haves and the
have-nots, and he should know because his family owns the Milwaukee
Brewers, a distinctly small-market franchise that cannot keep up
with those in the richest cable markets.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball leaders show no capacity for approaching the problem
with any serious revenue-sharing. The National Football League, on
the other hand, practices the kind of collectivism that might even
put a smile on the face of the West's last Communist, Fidel Castro.
</P>
<P>
   The socialist owners of the NFL have long since pooled their
television revenue _ $58 million per team last year _ which means a
franchise can still exist in that anachronistic Wisconsin burg of
Green Bay. And after a decade of watching franchises depart the
biggest television markets for ambitious smaller markets, the NFL
acted on that, too.
</P>
<P>
   When the New England Patriots toyed with an irresponsibly
generous offer from shabby Hartford, the league averted the double
disaster of leaving a major TV market and saddling a lesser one
with a monumental debt. Its idea was to finance an interest-free
loan to help pay for a new stadium in Massachusetts (and also keep
Hartford from further deficits).
</P>
<P>
   All sports owners and leagues mooch on communities for gigantic
tax breaks and new facilities, but baseball seems committed to
leaving its small-market teams out there to suffer.
</P>
<P>
   There always were bad teams, but they often were the product of
bad ownership. Nowadays you could have the best management in
baseball, and if you're in a small market, tough.
</P>
<P>
   Those sad fans in Kansas City can remember an enlightened owner
like Ewing Kauffman competing with the Yankees, but he is long
gone, and so is the concept.
</P>
<P>
   Fans are now reduced to heckling the Yankees as the symbol of a
rotten system. Plus, rooting for the Cubans to show up the bland,
wealthy Orioles. It's a cheap thrill, but it's all they have.  &QL;

AS FAMILY RITUALS FADE, SPORTING EVENTS BECOME OUR NATIONAL
CAMPFIRES 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By ROBERT LIPSYTE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Yelling, ``Sports, sports, don't you get it, everything in Glen
Ridge is sports,'' a teen-age Jeremiah runs through a forgettable
television movie Monday night with an inescapable message: Love it,
hate it or try to ignore it, jock culture haunts our national
daydreams.
</P>
<P>
   It may be as seemingly benign as renaming a New York highway
after Joe DiMaggio, who last played here almost 50 years ago and
afterward contributed little to the life of the city. It may be as
threatening and damaging as some Little League parents, the
corruption of higher education by ``revenue-producing''
intercollegiate sports or the patterns of violence by individual
athletes and by teams.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, in the frantic attempts to box and examine the
high school massacre in Littleton, Colo., jockcult became a hot
topic again. The teen-age killers were quoted as shouting: ``All
jocks stand up. We're going to kill every one of you.'' To some,
this marked the two former Little Leaguers as bitter athletic
failures, which is probably not accurate. (Alternately, a hero of
the massacre, Dave Sanders, who saved lives at the sacrifice of his
own, has tended to be characterized by his after-school job as a
girls' sports coach rather than his full-time job as a business
teacher.)
</P>
<P>
   Some commentators saw in the murders-suicides the ultimate
pathological response of outsiders to a world from which they had
been excluded. Within these theories were other assumptions: that
jockhood was a golden goal, or at least an expression of mainstream
values, and that perhaps the athletes had brought this upon
themselves with their postures of entitlement and their drive to
domination inside and outside the white lines.
</P>
<P>
   The worship of high school athletes is hardly a new story and
certainly never surprising. Why wouldn't you idolize _ or resent _
peers who are bigger, better and more confident at the time of life
when it seems to matter most, adolescence. Furthermore, the school
and the community often afford athletes special privileges,
including relief from many rules.
</P>
<P>
   This, of course, goes beyond high school. The greatest defensive
football player of the century, the troubled Lawrence Taylor,
caused havoc in the hallways of his high school and college and
then went on to up the ante on the streets as a pro or, more
recently, as a jock out of water. Felony arrests among pro and
college athletes may or may not be rising, but better reporting
makes it clear that many of them cannot turn off their aggressive
behavior at the buzzer.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the nice jocks, the ones we assume never trashed
bars, raped dates or even made fun of fat boys _ Michael Jordan,
Wayne Gretzky, John Elway _ were justifiably eulogized at
retirement. In this time of fading family and community rituals,
when major sports events have become our national campfires, who
wants to cheer for clay feet?
</P>
<P>
   Local campfires tend to afford more warmth, which is why the
Glen Ridge rape story of 1989 was such a sensation. High school
football players were accused of sexually molesting a mildly
retarded female classmate while teammates watched. Glen Ridge,
N.J., was seen as a bland, self-satisfied, mainly white Protestant
suburb. Picture-book America. The football team was not
particularly good, but the young athletes were regarded as the
pride and extension of the community. Covering the story at the
time, I was surprised at the fury of some residents toward the news
media for ``bothering'' them, the annoyance of others that for so
long we had bought into the myth of the Glen Ridges as exempt from
class, race and gender problems. As with Littleton, Glen Ridge
became a long-lasting symbol, somewhat unfairly, of the American
dream come apart at the seams.
</P>
<P>
   In his fine, absorbing 1997 book, ``Our Boys,'' Bernard
Lefkowitz raised the level of discourse. He suggested that as
individuals, the pack of Glen Ridge football players and wrestlers
were not as confident as they seemed. He wrote: ``A compelling
argument can be made that the hyper-masculine style they were asked
to assume by parents and brothers and sports enthusiasts was a
heavy burden for a kid to carry through adolescence.''
</P>
<P>
   Lefkowitz added: ``The swagger they affected _ the jock swagger
_ was a handy way to camouflage their doubts.''
</P>
<P>
   It would be a long time, if ever, before the nerds, blacks,
greasers, geeks, burnouts and non-``Jockette'' girls that the
``Ridgers'' terrorized would figure that out.
</P>
<P>
   The book has been made into a flat, disappointing movie that
airs Monday night on ABC. But it will hopefully reinvigorate
explorations of sports' role in American society. And by focusing
on Glen Ridge and Littleton, where most of the athletes were white,
it may be possible to discuss some of the bio-anthropological
theories of violence.
</P>
<P>
   In their 1996 book, ``Demonic Males: Apes and the Origins of
Human Violence,'' Richard Wrangham and Dale Peterson trace patterns
of imperialistic behavior in male gorilla and chimpanzee groups
that are recapitulated in prestate warrior societies and urban
gangs.
</P>
<P>
   They write: ``The psychology engaged may be hardly different
from that expressed in predominantly male team sports _ American
football and hockey, for example. Demonic males gather in small,
self-perpetuating, self-aggrandizing bands.
</P>
<P>
   ``What matters is the opportunity to engage in the vast and
compelling drama of belonging to the gang, identifying the enemy,
going on the patrol, participating in the attack.''
</P>
<P>
   And we, of course, are caught up in that compelling,
relentlessly promoted drama. The noted Rutgers anthropologist
Lionel Tiger offers his own jeremiad. In his new book, ``The
Decline of Males'' (Golden Books), he writes: ``Television sport is
to male personal achievement as videocassette pornography is to
love.''
</P>
<P>
   Tiger, best known for his exploration of male bonding in his
famous ``Men in Groups,'' has taken a controversial tack in his
current work. He asserts that the power given to women through
effective contraception has made men feel ``obsolete and out of
control.'' Men have turned to drugs, porn and obsessive sports
fandom which ``may reveal a turbulent male preoccupation with
competition and physical assertiveness that is no longer available
to ordinary men.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of these issues deserve national forums, although such
airings-out seem less and less likely as media conglomerates invest
in sports programming that promotes athletes as soap opera stars,
if not icons. Their excuse _ the fans want it! _ is true. A mildly
critical look at Joe DiMaggio here several weeks ago brought a
flood of negative mail, some of it abusive. The angriest were those
who felt that sympathy toward a supposedly treacherous ingrate like
Darryl Strawberry was somehow an oil spill on the Clipper's memory.
</P>
<P>
   All the more reason to press on. In future columns, perhaps with
the help of forward-thinking psychiatrists, psychologists,
anthropologists, sociologists, historians, philosophers and, yes,
even fans, we will try to open our own jockcult forum.
</P>
<P>
   Some early, first-draft questions:
</P>
<P>
   _What is the role of sports beyond health and entertainment, as
moral crucible, as national campfire?
</P>
<P>
   _Is there a thread of pathology among certain athletes that
fuels their achievement? Do the psycho-scouts know and look for it?
</P>
<P>
   _Is the emotional neediness of some fans a pathology, and, if
so, is it satisfied or exacerbated by their fandom?
</P>
<P>
   _How has the national struggle with matters of race, class and
gender been affected by sports?
</P>
<P>
   _Has the media's promotion of violent, abusive sports heroes
affected our definitions of masculinity?
</P>
<P>
   _Will female athletes change the game, or be changed?
</P>
<P>
   Your thoughts are welcomed. Requested.  &QL;

   PODGORICA, Montenegro _ As soon as foreign reporters enter
Yugoslavia by one of the only routes still open _ into the
country's junior republic, Montenegro, by way of Albania _ a small
squad of heavily armed police officers is there waiting for them.
</P>
<P>
   The police immediately take the reporters into custody, but not
to kick them out of Yugoslavia. Rather they are there to escort
them safely into Montenegro's capital, Podgorica, where they are
invited to work in a modern press center complete with
long-distance telephone lines, fax machines, Internet connections
and access to top government officials.
</P>
<P>
   That special treatment is a far cry from the way most Western
correspondents were rounded up and forced out of Belgrade early in
the NATO bombing campaign. The reason for this hospitality is
simple: The tiny republic of Montenegro, only the size of
Connecticut, is in big trouble. Its new Western-leaning government
has pulled out of the federation with Serbia in all but name and
has refused to accept the declaration of war passed in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   ``The independent foreign press is the last bastion in the
defense of Montenegro, along with our police units,'' said Abaz
Beli Dzafic, deputy secretary of Montenegro's Ministry of
Information. The ministry runs the press center in Podgorica and
coordinates a police team that provides escorts and occasionally
rescues journalists caught in roadblocks set up by the Yugoslav
Army, which has confiscated equipment from foreign reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslav army positions in Montenegro have been bombed anyway.
NATO jets have damaged the airport in Podgorica as well as a bridge
on the border, causing a number of civilian deaths. The mayhem gave
the army and a segment of the political opposition _ which is
aligned with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic _ fuel with
which to attack the government of Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   The government says it is helping foreign journalists (more than
500 have received press credentials from the Ministry of
Information since the conflict began) to prevent the
state-controlled Serbian media from presenting the only images of
what is actually happening here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you imagine what would happen if NATO had no information
from Montenegro and it notices some anti-aircraft fire coming from
the ground,'' said Deputy Prime Minister Dragisa Burzen. ``Instead
of understanding it was just an attempt by the army to incite
trouble, NATO might believe that the government is no longer in
control.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps uniquely in the Balkans, Montenegro has a tradition of
independent journalism.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pressure is horrible because we've got that constant
feeling that the army can grab you any time you go out on the
street,'' said Milka Tadic, the managing editor of The Monitor, a
weekly newspaper with a circulation of 10,000. The government has
provided protection for Monitor employees and has pledged to
support their efforts to continue publishing, even though many of
the paper's articles are also critical of the current government.
</P>
<P>
   ``But they have a reason to protect us,'' Ms. Tadic said. ``We
can say much more about what is going on in Serbia than the
state-owned media. We are openly writing about ethnic cleansing in
Kosovo and about the moves by the army of occupation here.''

   Along the blood-spattered timeline of Slobodan Milosevic's
Yugoslavia, Kosovo is merely the hideous Now. There was a Before _
in Croatia and Bosnia. Assuming that Milosevic retreats from Kosovo
with his dictatorship intact, as now seems likely, Balkans experts
foresee an unspeakable After.
</P>
<P>
   It may feature: Fratricidal civil war in Montenegro. Ethnic
cleansing of Hungarians in the Serbian province of Vojvodina. Mass
murder of Muslims in the Sandzak region of Serbia. No need, for the
moment, to bother about the location or correct pronunciation of
these obscure places. The world will likely learn. Just as it
learned where Kosovo is _ or was _ before more than 700,000 human
beings were chased from their homes in a systematic military
campaign of burning and intimidation, theft and murder.
</P>
<P>
   If the pattern holds, Milosevic will soldier on, using Big Lie
manipulation of television to tap into a collective soft spot in
the Serbian psyche. Even as legions of non-Serbs are dispossessed
or killed, he will continue to inflame the Serbs and preserve his
power by reassuring them that, yes,  &UR; they &LR;  are the victims.
</P>
<P>
   Given the character of Milosevic's regime and knowing that there
is almost certainly more horror to come, a bold, if impractical,
question is just now beginning to be formulated. Is it finally time
for outside powers to make the effort necessary to cure a national
psychosis inside Serbia that has been destabilizing a corner of
Europe for a decade?
</P>
<P>
   Put another way, has the time come for NATO to do in Serbia what
the Allies did in Germany and Japan after World II?
</P>
<P>
   To follow that model, Serbia's military would have to be
destroyed, and Milosevic crushed, by an invasion that almost
certainly would cost the lives of hundreds of U.S. soldiers. After
unconditional surrender, the political, social and economic fabric
of Serbia would be remade under outside supervision so that the
Serbs could take their place in a prosperous and democratic world.
</P>
<P>
   The question cuts three ways. Will it happen? Should it happen?
Could it possibly work?
</P>
<P>
   The answer to the first part of this question, at least for the
foreseeable future, is a resounding No Way. The other answers,
however, are provocative enough to make it worthwhile to suspend
disbelief and indulge the fantasy of a post-Milosevic Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   Let's start, though, with the real world. Policy-makers and
long-time students of the West's slow-motion intervention in
Yugoslavia during the 1990's see no possibility of Milosevic's
military defeat or of Serbia's occupation.
</P>
<P>
   An agreement last week between the West and Russia outlined the
kind of solution the outside powers would seek instead _ a
withdrawal from Kosovo of the Yugoslav army, police and
paramilitary fighters, with an international security force to
replace them. Details of the deal are still being argued over, but
one thing was clear: If the outside powers can get him to sign on,
Milosevic would remain in power in his shrinking Yugoslavia. Thus,
he would have the opportunity to ``cleanse'' another day. The
West's calculation seems to be that avoiding a land war, keeping
NATO together and cementing relations with Russia outweigh the
long-term costs of letting Milosevic off the hook.
</P>
<P>
   That, then, is the real world.
</P>
<P>
   Such a course does nothing, of course, to eradicate extreme Serb
nationalism.
</P>
<P>
   The only way to stamp out the disease, protect Serbia's
minorities and bring lasting peace to the Balkans is a Japan- or
Germany-style occupation of Serbia, according to Daniel Serwer, who
until two years ago was the director of European intelligence and
research for the State Department. Serwer concedes that occupation
has never been on the West's list of serious options, but he echoes
many experts on the Balkans when he argues that it should be.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very hard to see how Serbia undergoes this process all
on its own,'' said Serwer, now a fellow at the U.S. Institute of
Peace, a research group in Washington. ``This regime is deeply
rooted. It is not like some dictatorship that you take off its head
and it will die. It is so corrupt and the corruption is not
superficial.''
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Jonah Goldhagen, a Harvard historian who wrote ``Hitler's
Willing Executioners: Ordinary Germans and the Holocaust,''
published a kind of manifesto last week that demands Serbia ``be
placed in receivership.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Serbia's deeds are, in their essence, different from those of
Nazi Germany only in scale,'' Goldhagen wrote in The New Republic.
``Milosevic is not Hitler, but he is a genocidal killer who has
caused the murders of many tens of thousands of people.''
</P>
<P>
   It is worth remembering, though, that Milosevic is an elected
leader, having won three elections that were more or less fair.
That, along with the Serb leader's soaring popularity in the wake
of NATO bombing, support an argument that what ails Serbia goes far
deeper than one man.
</P>
<P>
   No one makes this argument more powerfully than Sonja Biserko,
director of the Helsinki Committee for Human Rights in Serbia and a
former senior advisor in the European department of the Yugoslav
Foreign Ministry. Ms. Biserko, who fled Belgrade a week after the
NATO bombings began, said in New York last week that Serbia's
fundamental problem is not Milosevic, but a ``moral devastation''
that has infected her nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``People in Serbia are undergoing a mass denial of the barbarity
of the ethnic cleansing in Kosovo,'' Ms. Biserko said. ``This
denial is itself commensurate to the crime taking place before the
eyes of the world.''

</P>
<P>
   Ms. Biserko, who met 10 days ago with Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright and urged her to consider occupation, believes
that Serbia's opposition politicians are incapable now of coming to
grips with a culture of victimhood. ``Serbs have managed now with
the NATO bombing to convince themselves they are victims and as
victims they cannot be responsible for what happened in Kosovo,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   A surreal sense of victimhood in Serbia is nothing new. During
the siege of Sarajevo, when Serb forces ringed that city with
artillery and routinely killed its civilians, Belgrade television
reported that Bosnian Muslims were laying siege to themselves.
``The Serbs continue to defend their centuries-old hills around
Sarajevo,'' said Radio-Television Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   To shatter this Looking Glass victimhood, Ms. Biserko offers a
prescription: Indictment of Milosevic by the War Crimes Tribunal. A
military defeat of Serbia and demilitarization of the country.
Highly publicized trials that will force Serbs to confront the
savagery committed in their name. A Western takeover of the mass
media, with strict prohibitions against the dissemination of
extreme Serb nationalism. A Marshall Plan for the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why the West should be willing to undertake an occupation
that would risk many lives, cost billions and take years, Ms.
Biserko shrugged: ``What other choice is there?''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Western world has lost its political instinct,'' she said.
``To bring substance to the ideals of human rights, at some point
you must be willing to commit troops.''
</P>
<P>
   But could the occupation of Serbia work? Could it break the
cycle of violence? Two prominent historians believe it could, if
done properly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key in Japan was unconditional surrender,'' said John W.
Dower, a professor of history at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology and author of ``Embracing Defeat: Japan in the Wake of
World War II.'' ``The Americans went in and they did everything.
They had a major land reform. They abolished the military, simply
got rid of it. They drafted a new constitution. This is what you
can do when you have unconditional surrender.''
</P>
<P>
   Dower was struck by the eagerness with which a defeated people
welcomed reform. ``In Japan, the average person was really sick of
war, and I think that would be the case in Yugoslavia,'' he said.
``The Americans cracked open a repressive military system and the
people filled the space.''
</P>
<P>
   The occupation of Germany also suggests ways of dealing with
Yugoslavia, according to Thomas Alan Schwartz, a historian at
Vanderbilt and author of ``America's Germany.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When Germany was totally defeated, it provided opportunity,''
he said. ``You could be physically there, controlling the flow of
information and using war-crime trials to show the Germans that
atrocities were done in their name.''
</P>
<P>
   Without something similar in Serbia, Schwartz said, ``We can
look forward to more trouble in Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   ``What reminds me of Germany is the comparison to the end of
World War I,'' he added. ``Then, the Germans had this powerful
sense of being victims. There was a deep resentment that Hitler was
able to exploit. It will be the same in Serbia when NATO bombing
stops.''
</P>
<P>
   The Japan and Germany analogies, of course, are flawed. Those
major-league powers ravaged parts of the world that America cared
about. Occupation was nothing less than emergency triage for the
worst violence in history.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic, by comparison, is small potatoes. He leads a
minor-league country that periodically lays waste to poor,
unpronounceable, strategically irrelevant places. Pristina is not
Paris.
</P>
<P>
   There is, though, an inkling that the West has begun to try for
a solution. In Bosnia, 32,000 NATO-led troops and High Commissioner
Carlos Westendorp are even now doing the hard, slow, complex work
of healing that country.
</P>
<P>
   Westendorp has not attempted a Japan-style remake of the
Serb-populated half of Bosnia (just as nobody has tried to do that
in neighboring Croatia, with its own accomplishments in ethnic
cleansing). The indicted war criminals Radovan Karadzic and Ratko
Mladic have not been hunted down. Radical Serb parties have not
been banned. But tough action is being taken. Westendorp ordered
radical Serb nationalists out of state television. He has fired the
nationalist zealot who was elected the Bosnian Serbs' president. If
Serbs violently object to what the peacekeepers do, NATO-led forces
shoot to kill.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview in Sarajevo, Westendorp said most Bosnian
Serbs are cooperating because they are sick of war. It will take
time, he said, but the West has enough money and muscle in Bosnia
to extinguish the will to war. The one insoluble problem, he said,
was the leader in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   ``If getting rid of Milosevic fails,'' he said, ``then
everything fails.''

   No Joy in Baltimore &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If there is any stage on which Fidel Castro has always delighted
in mixing competition with politics, it is sports. And if there is
any sport that Cubans, including Castro, love, it is baseball.
</P>
<P>
   So Cuba's humiliation of a U.S. major league team last week _ a
12-6 romp over the Baltimore Orioles in a rain-swept Camden Yards _
felt doubly sweet for the visiting Cubans. On March 28, in Havana,
the Orioles had barely eked out a victory over the Cuban national
team in 11 innings, and this time they appeared to be no
competition at all for the Cubans. The Orioles pitched poorly,
fielded sloppily and hit badly, getting 6 hits to the Cubans' 18.
</P>
<P>
   In Cuba, according to third baseman Omar Linares, the victory
was occasion for ``a national party.''
</P>
<P>
   Mercifully for the Orioles, no third game was planned. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One Less TV Home to Improve &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here are a few of the things the mirror of television has shown
Americans about the American family: Dad is the master and always
wears a comforting cardigan (``Father Knows Best''); Dad is full of
right-wing bluster and hates his son-in-law (``All in the
Family''); Dad is a clueless shoe salesman with an oversexed wife
and daughter and he bickers constantly (``Married . . . With
Children'').
</P>
<P>
   The most enduring situation around which television comedies
have been built is the family unit, in one form or another. That's
what the families sitting in front of their tubes identified with
for decades.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, it seems. With the demise of the long-running ABC
series, ``Home Improvement,'' America is all but losing its last
network sitcom built around a thriving family unit. Shows now
either take place in the workplace or focus on the self-absorbed
lives of singles _ searching, it often happens, for the family life
they grew up watching on television, but find out of reach.

   A Deadline Passes With No Palestinian State
</P>
<P>
   In the West Bank and Gaza, May 4, which was to have been a
triumphal date, came and went without a declaration of Palestinian
statehood. It also came and went without much notice, aside from a
handful of small protests.
</P>
<P>
   In Israel, however, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is
running behind in the polls as the May 17 elections approach, tried
to turn the day into a moment: his moment.
</P>
<P>
   He proclaimed a victory for standing so tough that Yasser
Arafat, the Palestinian leader, had been forced to defer a
statehood declaration for fear of Israel's retaliation.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat, however, faced nearly universal pressure, including from
Arab states, to recommit himself to the peace effort.
</P>
<P>
   While May 4 was the day the interim period set up by the Oslo
peace accord expired, both Israel and the Palestinians have agreed
to extend the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Arafat awaits the outcome of the Israeli elections to see
who will be his new partner _ or adversary _ at the negotiating
table.

   Beware the Scarf in Parliament  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At its first meeting, Turkey's newly elected Parliament turned
not to pressing problems like inflation, human rights or
educational reform, but to the question of the Muslim head scarf.
The chamber erupted in pandemonium as Merve Kavakci, an
American-educated deputy from Istanbul, sought unsuccessfully to
take her oath of office while wearing a scarf.
</P>
<P>
   She was harshly denounced by the president, the prime minister
and many others, and the press began a campaign portraying her as a
militant fundamentalist bent on subverting the secular Republic.
</P>
<P>
   The debate reflected conflict between Turkey's desire for fuller
democracy and its fear of religious influence in politics.

   Another Record For the Dow. (Ho Hum).
</P>
<P>

   No Joy in Baltimore &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If there is any stage on which Fidel Castro has always delighted
in mixing competition with politics, it is sports. And if there is
any sport that Cubans, including Castro, love, it is baseball.
</P>
<P>
   So Cuba's humiliation of a U.S. major league team last week _ a
12-6 romp over the Baltimore Orioles in a rain-swept Camden Yards _
felt doubly sweet for the visiting Cubans. On March 28, in Havana,
the Orioles had barely eked out a victory over the Cuban national
team in 11 innings, and this time they appeared to be no
competition at all for the Cubans. The Orioles pitched poorly,
fielded sloppily and hit badly, getting 6 hits to the Cubans' 18.
</P>
<P>
   In Cuba, according to third baseman Omar Linares, the victory
was occasion for ``a national party.''
</P>
<P>
   Mercifully for the Orioles, no third game was planned. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One Less TV Home to Improve &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here are a few of the things the mirror of television has shown
Americans about the American family: Dad is the master and always
wears a comforting cardigan (``Father Knows Best''); Dad is full of
right-wing bluster and hates his son-in-law (``All in the
Family''); Dad is a clueless shoe salesman with an oversexed wife
and daughter and he bickers constantly (``Married . . . With
Children'').
</P>
<P>
   The most enduring situation around which television comedies
have been built is the family unit, in one form or another. That's
what the families sitting in front of their tubes identified with
for decades.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, it seems. With the demise of the long-running ABC
series, ``Home Improvement,'' America is all but losing its last
network sitcom built around a thriving family unit. Shows now
either take place in the workplace or focus on the self-absorbed
lives of singles _ searching, it often happens, for the family life
they grew up watching on television, but find out of reach.

   A Deadline Passes With No Palestinian State
</P>
<P>
   In the West Bank and Gaza, May 4, which was to have been a
triumphal date, came and went without a declaration of Palestinian
statehood. It also came and went without much notice, aside from a
handful of small protests.
</P>
<P>
   In Israel, however, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is
running behind in the polls as the May 17 elections approach, tried
to turn the day into a moment: his moment.
</P>
<P>
   He proclaimed a victory for standing so tough that Yasser
Arafat, the Palestinian leader, had been forced to defer a
statehood declaration for fear of Israel's retaliation.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat, however, faced nearly universal pressure, including from
Arab states, to recommit himself to the peace effort.
</P>
<P>
   While May 4 was the day the interim period set up by the Oslo
peace accord expired, both Israel and the Palestinians have agreed
to extend the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Arafat awaits the outcome of the Israeli elections to see
who will be his new partner _ or adversary _ at the negotiating
table.

   Beware the Scarf in Parliament  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At its first meeting, Turkey's newly elected Parliament turned
not to pressing problems like inflation, human rights or
educational reform, but to the question of the Muslim head scarf.
The chamber erupted in pandemonium as Merve Kavakci, an
American-educated deputy from Istanbul, sought unsuccessfully to
take her oath of office while wearing a scarf.
</P>
<P>
   She was harshly denounced by the president, the prime minister
and many others, and the press began a campaign portraying her as a
militant fundamentalist bent on subverting the secular Republic.
</P>
<P>
   The debate reflected conflict between Turkey's desire for fuller
democracy and its fear of religious influence in politics.

   European Insurers Agree To Settle Holocaust Claims  &QL;

<P>
   More than a half-century after the Holocaust, a group of
European insurance companies has reached an agreement to pay claims
on prewar policies under a formula that reflects present-day
values.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement was reached after two days of negotiations in
London and its terms were not released. But the broad outlines were
made public by the World Jewish Congress, which took part in the
talks, and former U.S. Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger, who
led a committee conducting the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement is the latest in a series of efforts to secure
compensation from Swiss banks, multinational corporations and other
institutions that advocates for Holocaust victims say were unjustly
enriched during Nazi Germany's persecution of Jews.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, the agreement is different because it takes into
account a half-century of interest, inflation and currency
devaluations, and thus could lead to payments totaling billions of
dollars.

   When Olivier Blanchard, a liberal economist at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, is asked why unemployment rates are higher
in Europe than in the United States, he likes to tell audiences
about a pamphlet he saw in a British library: ``Leaving School:
What You Need to Know About Social Security.''
</P>
<P>
   His point: Europe's cradle-to-grave safety net means not only
that being out of work has become a viable way of making a living,
but that there is no longer much stigma attached to joblessness.
That goes a long way in explaining the contrast between America's
current jobs boom and the contrasting jobs bust in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Not that long ago, the best and brightest young American
economists were churning out papers with titles like, ``Why Is U.S.
Unemployment So High at Full Employment?'' As recently as five
years ago, slow job growth, downsizing and shrinking paychecks
loomed large in America's psyche, and in 1992 Lester C. Thurow's
book ``Head to Head: The Coming Economic Battle Among Japan,
America and Europe,'' hailing the superiority of the European and
Japanese economic models, was atop the best-seller lists.
</P>
<P>
   Not any more. Today, American blacks, long afflicted by
double-digit unemployment rates, are less likely to be out of work
than Europeans. For the first time in memory, the U.S. jobless rate
has dipped below that of Japan, where until recently lifetime
employment was taken for granted. What's more, U.S. pay and
productivity are rising handily.
</P>
<P>
   What's behind America's jobs miracle? And why have long-time
world beaters suddenly turned into apparent deadbeats?
</P>
<P>
   Part of the answer is that America's economy is booming. A
surprisingly tame inflation rate has allowed the Federal Reserve,
which controls the amount of money in circulation and thus the
spending power of companies that create jobs, to avoid raising
interest rates _ even as joblessness has dropped to the lowest
level in 30 years. The rate for April, released last week, barely
inched up, from 4.2 percent to 4.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the economies of Japan and Europe are stagnating.
Japan has been mired in a recession that's lasted about as long as
America's eight-year expansion. While the stagnation was initially
caused by a financial meltdown, says the economist Paul Krugman in
his new book, ``The Return of Depression Economics,'' the main
problem now is that Japan's central bank, fearing inflation, is
unwilling to pump enough money into the economy to lift spending _
and create jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Tight monetary policy is also holding back job growth in Europe.
``Alan Greenspan is willing to push the economy along until he sees
inflation actually picking up,'' says Krugman, referring to the
Federal Reserve chairman, ``but the European Central Bank isn't
giving unemployment a chance to get down.''
</P>
<P>
   But tight monetary policy isn't the main culprit in Europe.
Rather, it's that various safety-net programs over the years have
made not working a viable way of life, especially for young workers
and those who are approaching retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Blanchard and Justin Wolfers of Harvard University, co-authors
of several studies of European labor markets, point to two
especially pernicious institutions. One is the web of restrictions
on layoffs. Even though these rules and regulations are no longer
as numerous or effective as they were a decade ago _ Europe, like
America, has discovered temps _ they are still powerful enough to
have a chilling effect on companies' willingness to hire. As a
result, workers who lose jobs find it very difficult to get new
ones, and rising unemployment doesn't have the normal, healthy
effect of reining in labor costs.
</P>
<P>
   A bigger problem is the nature of unemployment benefits. Partly,
it's their generosity. In Sweden, where the unemployment rate has
jumped from a minuscule 1.4 percent to 5.6 percent in the last
decade, unemployed workers can collect nearly 80 percent as much as
if they were working, compared with about 50 percent in the United
States and Japan. In Spain, it's 70 percent (until recently it was
90 percent) and in France it's nearly 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The extent to which generous unemployment benefits inhibit job
growth depends partly on the proportion of workers who are
eligible: Only about one-third of workers who are out of work
qualify for benefits in the United States and Japan, where newer
members of the labor force and temporary workers are ineligible.
Compare that with 89 percent of unemployed workers in Germany and
98 percent in France.
</P>
<P>
   What matters even more is how long benefits can be collected.
Unemployment benefits in Germany are equal to only 36 percent of a
prior paycheck but an ex-worker can collect for at least five
years. In Britain, unemployed people can collect practically
forever. In the United States and Japan, by contrast, the limit is
26 weeks.
</P>
<P>
   But if Europe's generous safety net is the key problem, how come
it has taken so long for the chickens to come home to roost? After
all, the welfare state has been in place since the 1950s and '60s,
when full employment was the norm. One explanation, say Blanchard
and Wolfers, is that until the '70s there were few economic jolts
like oil shocks that buffeted rich countries in 1973, 1979 and
1990. ``Shocks displace people, but institutions like
unemployment-benefit programs determine how many people get
displaced and for how long,'' Wolfers said.

America's eight-year expansion. While the stagnation was initially
caused by a financial meltdown, says the economist Paul Krugman in
his new book, ``The Return of Depression Economics,'' the main
problem now is that Japan's central bank, fearing inflation, is
unwilling to pump enough money into the economy to lift spending _
and create jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Tight monetary policy is also holding back job growth in Europe.
``Alan Greenspan is willing to push the economy along until he sees
inflation actually picking up,'' says Krugman, referring to the
Federal Reserve chairman, ``but the European Central Bank isn't
giving unemployment a chance to get down.''
</P>
<P>
   But tight monetary policy isn't the main culprit in Europe.
Rather, it's that various safety-net programs over the years have
made not working a viable way of life, especially for young workers
and those who are approaching retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Blanchard and Justin Wolfers of Harvard University, co-authors
of several studies of European labor markets, point to two
especially pernicious institutions. One is the web of restrictions
on layoffs. Even though these rules and regulations are no longer
as numerous or effective as they were a decade ago _ Europe, like
America, has discovered temps _ they are still powerful enough to
have a chilling effect on companies' willingness to hire. As a
result, workers who lose jobs find it very difficult to get new
ones, and rising unemployment doesn't have the normal, healthy
effect of reining in labor costs.
</P>
<P>
   A bigger problem is the nature of unemployment benefits. Partly,
it's their generosity. In Sweden, where the unemployment rate has
jumped from a minuscule 1.4 percent to 5.6 percent in the last
decade, unemployed workers can collect nearly 80 percent as much as
if they were working, compared with about 50 percent in the United
States and Japan. In Spain, it's 70 percent (until recently it was
90 percent) and in France it's nearly 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The extent to which generous unemployment benefits inhibit job
growth depends partly on the proportion of workers who are
eligible: Only about one-third of workers who are out of work
qualify for benefits in the United States and Japan, where newer
members of the labor force and temporary workers are ineligible.
Compare that with 89 percent of unemployed workers in Germany and
98 percent in France.
</P>
<P>
   What matters even more is how long benefits can be collected.
Unemployment benefits in Germany are equal to only 36 percent of a
prior paycheck but an ex-worker can collect for at least five
years. In Britain, unemployed people can collect practically
forever. In the United States and Japan, by contrast, the limit is
26 weeks.
</P>
<P>
   But if Europe's generous safety net is the key problem, how come
it has taken so long for the chickens to come home to roost? After
all, the welfare state has been in place since the 1950s and '60s,
when full employment was the norm. One explanation, say Blanchard
and Wolfers, is that until the '70s there were few economic jolts
like oil shocks that buffeted rich countries in 1973, 1979 and
1990. ``Shocks displace people, but institutions like
unemployment-benefit programs determine how many people get
displaced and for how long,'' Wolfers said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, many displaced workers stay out of work longer, and
bad things happen when a large group of people stay out of the work
force for a long time. Lawrence Katz, a labor economist at Harvard,
says that reducing the stigma attached to joblessness has profound
effects on the labor market. In Sweden, which combined extremely
low joblessness with extremely generous welfare programs, someone
who got laid off used to be ashamed to admit it to his or her
neighbors. Now, with a new generation of workers less imbued with
that work ethic, much of that shame has evaporated.
</P>
<P>
   There are other negative effects as well. Workers who don't get
rehired fast also lose skills and, more importantly, connections.
Since most hiring is by word of mouth, people who don't know others
with jobs find it hard to get one themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The flaws of the welfare state are compounded by other forms of
government intervention, says Alan B. Krueger, an economist at
Princeton University. One important reason American workers get
hired at such surprising rates is that it's much easier to start
new businesses in the United States. In Austria, Krueger says,
someone who wants to open a pharmacy must get permission from the
other drugstores in town.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the day, it boils down to social choices. ``One
can say the Europeans have made a political decision that they are
unwilling to tolerate as much income inequality as in the United
States,'' Katz said. ``But equity comes at the cost of job
creation.''
</P>
<P>
   Even today, men in their prime working years are not faring much
worse in Europe or Japan than in the United States. But in America,
which excels at absorbing new workers, other groups like the young,
immigrants and women are faring much better. Now the U.S. economy
is absorbing workers with the least education and the fewest
skills, including ones who have been out of the work force for
years and written off as lost causes.
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, choices made decades ago are preventing a similar
expansion in the work force. &QL;

   WASHINGTON _ The bullets were still ricocheting off the lockers
at Columbine High School when the accusations began to fly. Clues
were ignored: Gothic music, black trench coats, video games
spelling combat with a K. The sheriffs missed the Web site ravings.
The psychiatrist missed the hidden rage. The parents missed the
pipe bombs. If only somebody had spotted the warning signs, a
terrible tragedy might have been averted.
</P>
<P>
   That is a comforting thought for a nation scarred and grieving.
But viewed through the prism of science, it isn't necessarily true.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, if there is anything left to be said about the recent
tragedy in Littleton, Colo., it may be this: the cold, hard reality
of the deadliest school massacre in American history is that it was
the statistical equivalent of a needle in a haystack.
</P>
<P>
   Because such events are so rare, and because it is impossible to
eliminate risk from life, there may be no larger lessons to draw,
and no way to prevent another one.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the numbers. Homicide is the second-leading cause of
death among youngsters. But according to the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention, fewer than 1 percent of child homicides
occur in or around schools. While the number of school shootings
with multiple victims _ the kind that attract intense media
attention _ has risen recently, from an average of 2 to an average
of 5 a year, the annual total has declined.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality is that schools are very safe environments for our
kids,'' said Dr. Jim Mercy, associate director for science in the
division of violence prevention at the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be very hard to predict or identify ahead of time the
kinds of kids and the constellation of factors that are likely to
lead to this kind of event,'' he added. ``They are so rare, and
there are so many school kids, and our understanding of what
motivates people to be violent is so imprecise, that this would be
a very difficult task.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, there is the impulse to analyze, to understand, to
prevent. In the wake of disasters like Littleton, where two
teen-age gunmen killed 13 people and then themselves, sociologists,
psychologists and criminal justice experts are interrogated by the
media in a collective search for societal failures, in much the
same way that aviation investigators look for jammed rudders or
ruptured fuel lines after an airplane crash.
</P>
<P>
   But risk cannot be eliminated. Fine surgeons still kill
patients. Tornados still wipe out towns. ``There is a lot of
randomness in the world,'' said Dr. John D. Graham, director of the
Center for Risk Analysis at the Harvard University School of Public
Health. ``Part of understanding risk is understanding that things
are not fully explainable and not reducible to zero.''
</P>
<P>
   That is true of air crashes, and it is true of school shootings.
Last week, when state attorneys general gathered in Jackson, Miss.,
for a two-day conference on youth violence, officials from
Littleton delivered a sobering message: They had long been in a
good position to prevent the Columbine massacre. Their county
already had one of the few juvenile assessment centers in the
country. Its population is affluent and well educated. Children get
a good education and health care. And one of the gunmen, Eric
Harris, was already seeing a psychiatrist.
</P>
<P>
   Still, 15 people died. Most took that as disturbing evidence
that a good system had failed. Dr. Arnold Barnett, professor of
statistics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, says it
may mean the opposite: a good system worked.
</P>
<P>
   ``This might represent one aberrant case,'' Barnett said. ``Even
measures that are highly successful, that 99.9 percent of the time
will defuse potential tragedies, will every now and then break
down. People seek higher meanings and seek major failures to
produce major tragedies like this. But it doesn't always work that
way.''
</P>
<P>
   Given the vast number of schoolchildren who report carrying
guns, it is surprising that such shootings do not occur more often.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 5.9
percent of the 15 million high school students said they carried a
gun in the 30 days prior to a recent survey. ``And yet,'' said Dr.
Jeffrey Fagan, director of the Center for Violence Research and
Prevention at Columbia University in New York, ``they don't
shoot.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When you start thinking about risk,'' Fagan said, ``it changes
the conversation from the culture war that is going on now about
video games, parental supervision and the alienation of the
suburbs. It changes it to a much more hard-headed approach that
says, `Sometimes bad things happen and we can't always explain
it.'''
</P>
<P>
   When public health experts look at risks to young people,
homicides, which account for 14 percent of all deaths among
children, come in second. The biggest threat is accidents,
primarily car crashes, which are responsible for 42 percent of
childhood deaths. Graham says there is a danger to the ``emotional
gush'' over Littleton: ``It diverts energies from the big risks
that adolescents face, which are binge drinking, traffic crashes,
unprotected sex.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet people yearn for explanations, and it is disturbing to
entertain the possibility that not everything is within their
control.

states, in communities of all sizes. But fewer than one-third of

   There is a well-known story about the London doctor John Snow,

Blumstein, director of the National Consortium on Violence Research

to address school shootings: eliminate access to guns. ``Guns,'' he
said, ``transform what is widespread teen-age behavior into
disasters.''

   One might also eliminate video games, or the Internet, or shut
down schools or institutionalize troubled children. But that would
simply create other risks, Graham said, like unsupervised or truant
children. Yet even in the absence of solutions, said Lerner, the
search may still be useful. ``One could make a good case,'' he
said, ``that it is the only rational response.''

   ATLANTA _ Between the roar of an Amtrak train crash in March and
the rampage of tornadoes last Monday, there was a terribly quiet
moment in Arkansas last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   An amphibious boat filled with 21 tourists began taking on water
on Lake Hamilton, just outside Hot Springs. Thirty seconds later it
disappeared below the surface.
</P>
<P>
   The accident killed 13 people, two more than died in the Amtrak
crash outside of Chicago on March 15. But unlike those victims, or
the 15 who died in the massacre at Columbine High School in
Littleton, Colo., or the more than 40 who died in the tornadoes in
Oklahoma and Kansas, the people who drowned spent only an instant
in a national consciousness ever restless for greater grief and
higher drama. Like the boat itself, news of the accident sank
without a trace.

<P>
   The national television networks, including CNN and MSNBC, ran
reports of only a few minutes, deep into their broadcasts. Regional
newspapers in Dallas, Memphis, ran front-page articles, but none of
the national newspapers did. Although The New York Times ran the
train accident on its front page, the boat accident ran inside.
</P>
<P>
   There were, of course, a few other things going on in the world
that Saturday afternoon. The Rev. Jesse Jackson was leading three
U.S. prisoners of war out of Yugoslavia. The bombing was continuing
in Kosovo, and the national meditation over Littleton went on.
</P>
<P>
   But the Arkansas boating accident serves as a reminder that
while people may be created equal, they do not necessarily die that
way. On the swiftly calculated sliding scale of death, accidents
are assigned a news value based not on how many lives were lost,
but on how and where they happened to die.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of us make any bones about this _ pictures really
matter,'' said Erik Sorenson, vice president and general manager of
MSNBC. ``In this case, the boat vanished. And we had a rather
tranquil-looking water top. In the train wreck, we had a very
large, quite mangled Amtrak train lying on its side, and that's a
much more compelling photograph, whether for a newspaper or an
Internet site or a television program.''
</P>
<P>
   But visuals aren't everything. For journalists, a disaster is
more interesting if people can imagine themselves within it. Just
as a school-bus crash in Kentucky will get far more U.S. coverage
than a deadly monsoon in Bangladesh that kills hundreds, so too
will a death during a commonplace activity take precedence over a
more obscure one, like boating.
</P>
<P>
   ``To a large degree, coverage is determined by editors asking
themselves, how likely is it that this accident could happen to me
or my readers?'' said James Kelly, the deputy managing editor of
Time, which did not cover the boating accident. ``And there are a
lot of people who take trains, and not that many who take tour
boats.''
</P>
<P>
   The news media have never pretended to a mathematical
consistency in what they cover. The longest-lasting stories require
a mystery or a forceful narrative, which is why the Littleton
shootings have prompted so much examination than any of the 12
deaths attributed to youth violence that occur, on average, every
day. But even by that standard, the silence in Arkansas seemed
eerie. None of the amphibious boats has ever had a fatality in
nearly 40 years of use. When death did occur _ possibly because of
a leaky rubber seal on the hull _ it seemed as if the victims were
cheated of their rightful national ritual in which their families'
grief would be displayed.
</P>
<P>
   As it happened, James Patton, whose parents and sister died on
the boat, paid tribute to them in a very personal way at their
funeral Wednesday in Ames, Okla. Accompanying a recording of Lynyrd
Skynyrd's ``Free Bird,'' the 15-year-old boy played his drum set at
the gravesite. The Associated Press was the only national news
organization to send a reporter. The cameras were 50 miles away,
filming storm rubble.

   ATLANTA _ Between the roar of an Amtrak train crash in March and
the rampage of tornadoes last Monday, there was a terribly quiet
moment in Arkansas last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   An amphibious boat filled with 21 tourists began taking on water
on Lake Hamilton, just outside Hot Springs. Thirty seconds later it
disappeared below the surface.
</P>
<P>
   The accident killed 13 people, two more than died in the Amtrak
crash outside of Chicago on March 15. But unlike those victims, or
the 15 who died in the massacre at Columbine High School in
Littleton, Colo., or the more than 40 who died in the tornadoes in
Oklahoma and Kansas, the people who drowned spent only an instant
in a national consciousness ever restless for greater grief and
higher drama. Like the boat itself, news of the accident sank
without a trace.
</P>
<P>
   The national television networks, including CNN and MSNBC, ran
reports of only a few minutes, deep into their broadcasts. Regional
newspapers in Dallas, Memphis, ran front-page articles, but none of
the national newspapers did. Although The New York Times ran the

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Lemba, a Bantu-speaking people of southern Africa, have a
tradition that they were led out of Judea by a man named Buba. They
practice circumcision, keep one day a week holy and avoid eating
pork or piglike animals, such as the hippopotamus.
</P>
<P>
   Several groups around the world practice Judaic rites or claim
to be descended from Biblical tribes without having any ancestral
Jewish connection. And there is no Buba in the records of Jewish
history.
</P>
<P>
   But the remarkable thing about the Lemba tradition is that it
may be exactly right. A team of geneticists has found that many
Lemba men carry in their male chromosome a set of DNA sequences
that is distinctive of the cohanim, the Jewish priests believed to
be the descendants of Aaron. The priestly genetic signature is
particularly common among Lemba men who belong to the senior of
their 12 groups, known as the Buba clan.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery of the Lemba's Jewish ancestry has come about
through the intertwining of two unusual strands of inquiry. One was
developed by geneticists in the United States, Israel and England
who wondered what truth there might be to the Jewish tradition that
priests are the descendants of Aaron, the elder brother of Moses.
</P>
<P>
   The other strand was provided by Dr. Tudor Parfitt, director of
the Center for Jewish Studies at the School of Oriental and African
Studies in London. Parfitt, who has done research among the Lemba
for 10 years, believes that he has discovered Senna, the mysterious
northern city from which Lemba tradition maintains they came, and
that he can retrace their steps from Senna to Africa, maybe a
thousand years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The genetic side of the story began when Dr. Karl Skorecki, a
kidney expert at the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, was
sitting in a synagogue in Toronto. Skorecki, who is a priest,
wondered if a fellow cohen who was being called to attend the first
Torah reading might be distantly related to him, as the tradition
of priestly descent from Aaron implied.
</P>
<P>
   He called Dr. Michael F. Hammer of the University of Arizona, an
expert who studies the genetics of human populations through the
male or Y chromosome. Unlike the other chromosomes, the genetic
material on the Y chromosome is not shuffled every generation,
obscuring the lines of individual descent. Y chromosomes are
bequeathed from father to son, more or less unchanged apart from
the occasional mutation.
</P>
<P>
   The mutations are particularly helpful for reconstructing
population history because each lineage of men has its own
distinctive pattern of mutations. It was a Y chromosome study last
year that confirmed the oral tradition among the descendants of the
slave Sally Hemings that their ancestor was Thomas Jefferson, the
nation's third President.
</P>
<P>
   Hammer, Skorecki and their colleagues reported in 1997 that they
had analyzed the Y chromosomes of priests and lay Jews (priests, a
hereditary caste, are different from rabbis and also from Levites).
They found that a particular pattern of DNA changes was much more
common among the priests than among laymen. The pattern was equally
recognizable in Ashkenazic and Sephardic priests, even though these
two branches of the Jewish population have long been geographically
separated.
</P>
<P>
   A colleague in Hammer's and Skorecki's research was Neil
Bradman, a businessman who is now chairman of the Center for
Genetic Anthropology at University College, London. Bradman set
about making a wider study of Jewish populations around the world
through the lens of the Y chromosome technique.
</P>
<P>
   One recruit to Bradman's project is David B. Goldstein, a
population geneticist at Oxford University in England. Goldstein
set about refining Hammer's work so as to develop a better genetic
signature of Jewish populations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is there has been intermingling with host
populations, and that has obscured their common ancestry,''
Goldstein said.
</P>
<P>
   He looked at a set of three Y chromosome sites with stable
genetic mutations and six sites at which mutations occur quite
often, a mix designed to give good resolution between similar Y
chromosomes during historical times. The mutations are all at sites
that lie outside the genes, and thus do not contribute in any way
to the individual's physical makeup.
</P>
<P>
   He found a particular set of genetic mutations at these nine
sites that was strongly associated with the priestly caste, not so
common among lay Jews, and very rare among non-Jewish populations.
Unlike forensic DNA markers, which are chosen to be almost wholly
specific to individuals, this cohen-associated genetic signature
cannot be used to say who is or who is not a priest. But it is
highly diagnostic of whether a population has Jewish ancestry,
Goldstein said.
</P>
<P>
   He finds that 45 percent of Ashkenazi priests and 56 percent of
Sephardic priests have the cohen genetic signature, while in Jewish
populations in general the frequency is 3 to 5 percent.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Some of his subjects had the cohen genetic signature but with
slight variations caused by mutations. From the pattern and number
of mutations, Goldstein was able to calculate when the present day
bearers of the cohen genetic signature and its variations last
shared a common ancestor. This date, when all the branches of the
family tree coalesce into a single trunk, has a wide range of
uncertainty and depends on several assumptions, like the number of
years in a human generation and the rate of mutation. But assuming
25 years to a generation on average, Goldstein calculated the
coalescence time as 2,650 years ago, or 3,180 years with a 30-year
generation time.
</P>
<P>
   Though they are only rough, these dates make an evocative match
with the Jewish tradition that Moses assigned the priesthood to the
male descendants of his brother Aaron after the Exodus from Egypt,
believed to have occurred some 3,000 years ago. Goldstein and
colleagues published this conclusion last July.
</P>
<P>
   ``In studying the priesthood, we happened into this tool for
distinguishing Jewish from non-Jewish populations,'' Goldstein
said. As part of Bradman's project on the relationship of Jewish
populations, he then tested DNA samples collected from the Lemba.
And last month, at a conference on human evolution held at the Cold
Spring Harbor Laboratory in Long Island, Goldstein reported that 9
percent of Lemba men carried the cohen genetic signature, and of
those who said they belonged to the Buba clan, 53 percent had the
distinctive sequences. These proportions are similar to those found
among the major Jewish populations.
</P>
<P>
   Because the cohen genetic signature is rare or absent in all
non-Jewish populations tested so far, the findings support the
Lemba tradition of Jewish ancestry. Goldstein said his findings
would be published in the American Journal of Human Genetics.
</P>
<P>
   How did a Jewish priestly male chromosome come to be found in a
black, Bantu-speaking people that looks very much like its southern
African neighbors? Parfitt, who believes he has found the answer,
first came across the Lemba while giving a lecture in Johannesburg
about Ethiopian Jews. Some people in the audience wearing yarmulkes
told him they, too, were Jewish.
</P>
<P>
   Parfitt visited their homes, which are in northern South Africa
and Zimbabwe. Many of the Lemba, who number more than 50,000
people, are Christians, but they see no contradiction in professing
Judaism, too. He learned that they had an enigmatic tradition about
their origin: ``We came from the north, from a place called Senna.
We left Senna, we crossed Pusela, we came to Africa and there we
rebuilt Senna.''
</P>
<P>
   Parfitt said that he was later traveling in the Hadramawt
region, a former site of Jewish communities in Yemen, and mentioned
the Lemba tradition of Senna to the religious leader of the holy
city of Tarim. The leader was surprised to hear it because, he told
Parfitt, there was a nearby village called Senna.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I went off to find Senna,'' Parfitt said. ``It's very
remote and had never been visited by anyone before. The local
tradition is that centuries ago the valley had been very fertile,
irrigated by a dam, the ruins of which are still there. And then
the dam burst, they think about a thousand years ago, and the
people fled.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a valley that leads from Senna to a port on the Yemeni
coast called Sayhut. If the winds are right, a ship from Sayhut
could reach southern Africa in nine days, Parfitt said. And the
valley that leads from Senna to Sayhut is called the Wadi
al-Masilah. Parfitt believes that Masilah may be the ``Pusela'' of
the Lemba oral tradition.
</P>
<P>
   The Lemba have clan names like Sadiqui and Hamisi that are
``clearly Semitic'' and that are also found in the eastern
Hadramawt, Parfitt said.
</P>
<P>
   Parfitt, who has described his work on the Lemba in a recent
book, ``Journey to the Vanished City'' (Phoenix, London), said he
had been excited to hear of Goldstein's genetic results confirming
the Lemba tradition.

MANY STATES SLOW TO USE CHILD HEALTH PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (Attn: Va., W.Va, N.Y., Vt., Mn., Wash., Colo.)  
(jt) 
 By ROBERT PEAR    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, May 8 _ States are using less than 20 percent of the
federal money that Congress made available, with much fanfare, for
a big new program to subsidize health insurance for children in
low-income families.
</P>
<P>
   Some states say they cannot find enough eligible uninsured
children to use all the money they are entitled to receive. Critics
say many states have been slow to reach out to eligible children
and sign them up.
</P>
<P>
   The program's slow start and the accumulation of unspent money
are tempting Republicans in Congress to take back some of the money
and use it for other purposes _ an idea vehemently opposed by
Democrats, by advocates for children and by governors of both
parties.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John D. Rockefeller IV, the West Virginia Democrat who
helped create the Children's Health Insurance Program in 1997,
said, ``The Appropriations Committee is looking at the unused money
for other projects.'' He objects to such a shift.
</P>
<P>
   Elaina J. Fox, a spokeswoman for West Virginia's new child
health program, said, ``A majority of states will probably not be
able to utilize their full allotments'' of federal money.
</P>
<P>
   Governors are enthusiastic about the program, and tens of
thousands of children have clearly benefited. But Rep. Diana
DeGette, D-Colo., said some states, including her own, had ``an
abysmal record'' of finding uninsured children and enrolling them
in the new program.
</P>
<P>
   Congress provided $39 billion for the program over 10 years,
including $4.2 billion a year in 1998 and 1999. Federal officials
said states had used $260 million through December 1998 and $115
million in the first three months of this year. The Congressional
Budget Office estimates that states will use a total of $800
million this year.
</P>
<P>
   States say they have enrolled one million youngsters in the new
program. But federal officials and health policy experts say the
numbers are somewhat misleading.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 30 percent of the million children are in New York State,
and 176,000 of the New York children were already in a
state-financed program, Child Health Plus, often described by
federal officials as a model for the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Frank C. Ullman, a health policy expert at the Urban
Institute here, said, ``The decrease in Medicaid enrollment in many
states is greater than the increase in coverage through the new
Children's Health Insurance Program.'' So it is unclear, he added,
whether there has been a net reduction in the number of uninsured
children _ one of the main goals for President Clinton and
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The number of children without health insurance has been
creeping up in recent years and is now at least 10.7 million, the
Census Bureau says.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Under federal law, children eligible for Medicaid may not be
enrolled in the new Children's Health Insurance Program. Medicaid
is intended for families with somewhat lower incomes. States are
supposed to screen children and enroll them in Medicaid if they
qualify for it.
</P>
<P>
   But states have a strong financial incentive to put children
into the new program, rather than in Medicaid, because the federal
government pays a larger share of the costs _ 65 percent, rather
than 50 percent, in high-income states like New York, New Jersey
and Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   The children's health plan was forged in a bipartisan agreement
between the president and Congress. When he signed the legislation
in August 1997, Clinton said it would extend insurance coverage
``to up to five million children.'' He called it ``the largest
expansion in health care for children'' in three decades.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce D. Lesley, director of congressional relations at the
National Association of Children's Hospitals, said: ``The results
to date have been mixed. Some states like South Carolina have done
an unbelievably good job of enrolling children in the new health
insurance program. Other states like Virginia are not doing so
well. In these states, parents who need to know about the new
program have no idea that it exists.''
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina simplified its enrollment process, disseminated
applications at drug stores, day care centers, schools, churches
and Indian reservations and signed up 40,400 children for the new
program. By reaching out to low-income families, the state also
found 46,000 other children who were eligible for its pre-existing
Medicaid program.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Amy M. Atkinson, a spokeswoman for the Virginia
Department of Medical Assistance Services, said her state had
enrolled 8,599 children in the new insurance program, including
only 71 in Richmond, through May 3.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Charles S. Robb, D-Va., said, ``My state has not been as
quick off the mark as others have.''
</P>
<P>
   Edward J. Rogan, a spokesman for the New Jersey Department of
Human Services, said the state had enrolled 30,232 children in its
new health program, known as Kid Care, and expected to spend $19
million of its $88 million federal allotment this year.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut has enrolled 8,000 children and expects to spend
$5.4 million of its $35 million federal allotment this year, said
David Dearborn, a spokesman for the Connecticut Department of
Social Services. As a side benefit, he said, in reaching out to
low-income families, the state has found several thousand children
eligible for its Medicaid program.
</P>
<P>
   Auditors in some states said some children enrolled in the new
program were probably ineligible and should have been enrolled
instead in the regular Medicaid program.
</P>
<P>
   In welfare, a separate program, states have also allowed
substantial amounts of federal money to go unspent. They say they
are keeping it for a rainy day, in case the economy sputters.
</P>
<P>
   But that concern does not explain delays in spending money on
health insurance for children. Officials in many states said they
had only recently begun to enroll children because they first had
to design new health programs, get federal approval, prepare
application forms, set up toll-free telephone lines, print posters
and run advertising to publicize the availability of the new
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Judith A. Arnold, deputy commissioner of the New York Health
Department, said, ``Congress should be patient with states that
seem to be moving slowly.''
</P>
<P>
   The federal government has approved children's health plans for
every state except Tennessee, Washington and Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
   State officials told Congress in 1997 that they needed the
maximum latitude to design their own programs because they knew
best how to meet the health needs of uninsured children.
</P>
<P>
   But in a curious way, the law penalized states that had already
expanded Medicaid eligibility by increasing the permissible income
for families seeking coverage. Such states included Minnesota,
Vermont and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington State, for example, Medicaid covers children whose
family incomes are up to twice the official poverty level (up to
$27,760 a year for a family of three). Since those children are
eligible for Medicaid, they may not enroll in the new Children's
Health Insurance Program.
</P>
<P>
   Under federal law, Washington may use its share of the new
federal money _ $46 million a year _ for children of families with
incomes up to 2.5 times the poverty level.
</P>
<P>
   But Thomas W. Bedell, acting director of the Medicaid program in
Washington State, said: ``We won't be able to spend our full
allotment of federal money. We have only 10,000 uninsured children
with family incomes from 200 to 250 percent of the poverty level.
We estimate that we can spend only $7.5 million of our federal
money in the next year and a half.''
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Gov. Howard Dean of Vermont, a Democrat, said the law
penalized ``states like Vermont that have served as national
leaders in expanding health care coverage.''
</P>
<P>
   Ullman of the Urban Institute said: ``In theory, there's enough
money to cover five million children a year in the initial years of
the new Children's Health Insurance Program. But only 3.2 million
uninsured children live in families with the proper income to
qualify.''

   SAN FRANCISCO _ It is a bad time to be on death row.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians win points _ and votes _ by wearing the
tough-on-crime banner. In this environment, granting clemency has
become an act of courage that requires an outlay of political
capital few governors are willing to spend.
</P>
<P>
   Not that clemency has ever been a good bet: 544 inmates have
been executed and 39 granted clemency in the 23 years since the
U.S. Supreme Court reinstated the death penalty. But given the
current political climate, clemency is nearly impossible. It is no
accident, political experts say, that 14 of the 39 prisoners spared
death (including one in Alabama this year) were awarded clemency by
three governors leaving office.
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, the inmate who faces a clemency decision from a
governor in the heat of political battle, or from one who is new
and trying to prove himself, is as good as dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a governor new in office, especially a Democrat trying to
establish law-and-order credentials, clemency is not an option,''
said Franklin Zimring, a professor of law at the University of
California at Berkeley. ``The political pressure to deny clemency
is overwhelming.''
</P>
<P>
   Take the case of Manuel Babbitt, a Vietnam veteran with a Purple
Heart and a history of mental illness. Thousands of veterans asked
California Gov. Gray Davis to spare him, but he was executed last
week for the 1980 murder of an elderly woman.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, California's first Democratic governor in 16 years,
promised to give his fellow Vietnam veterans due respect when he
took office in January, but he also had campaigned as a supporter
of the death penalty. Babbitt was only his second clemency case.
</P>
<P>
   In his 14-page explanation denying clemency, Davis discounted or
ignored the strongest reasons for mercy, including affidavits from
two jurors who said they would have voted against the death penalty
if evidence omitted from the trial had been included. While Davis
had already rejected the first clemency plea to cross his desk,
that of a Thai Buddhist priest convicted of two murders, a single
execution was not enough for a new governor trying to establish his
law-and-order reputation.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has to have several executions under his belt to establish
his credentials,'' Zimring said. ``He could write a lengthy paper
describing why he made his decision, but in the end, the truth is
he was not going to grant clemency.''
</P>
<P>
   Recent events in Missouri underscore how even a well-timed
clemency can backfire. In January, in a much-publicized case, Gov.
Mel Carnahan commuted the sentence of an admitted triple murderer
after Pope John Paul II, who was visiting St. Louis, asked him to
do so. The governor, a moderate Democrat who is hoping to unseat
Republican incumbent Sen. John Ashcroft in 2000, had allowed more
than two dozen executions to go forward, and announced that his act
of mercy was a ``one-time event.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the governor's opponents promptly began making political
hay. Senator Ashcroft held a victims' rights hearing in St. Louis,
inviting as star witnesses the members of the family killed by the
man Carnahan spared. Polls showed that the governor's clemency
would cost him four times as many votes for the Senate as he would
gain. All four of the clemency appeals to pass his desk since then
have been denied.
</P>
<P>
   Governors in the 38 states with a death penalty are not likely
to grant clemency except in cases of ``actual innocence,'' said
Daniel Kobil, a law professor at Capital University in Columbus,
Ohio. Clemency enables governors to commute a death sentence for
many reasons, legal experts say, including the rehabilitation of a
prisoner or extenuating circumstances that were not brought out in
trial.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, governors often deny clemency by saying they will not
second-guess the wisdom of courts and juries, Kobil said. ``I think
it's a perversion of the governor's clemency power to say this,''
he said. ``It makes clemency just another appeal, when the
executive is supposed to consider whether this punishment is fair
given all the circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   Only when the public begins to punish politicians for not
exercising their clemency power will the pattern change, Kobil
said. In 1960, for example, when polls showed that only 50 percent
of the public favored executions, one in four cases was commuted.
But by the mid-1960s, support for the death penalty was growing.
</P>
<P>
   California Gov. Edmund G. Brown Sr. was unseated by Ronald
Reagan largely for commuting 23 death sentences from 1958 to 1966,
although he had allowed 36 executions at the same time. Brown's
son, Jerry, suffered his worst political defeat as governor in the
early 1980s after appointing three anti-death-penalty justices to
the Supreme Court. They were later ousted in an unprecedented
ballot initiative. His sister, Kathleen, lost her 1994 challenge to
then-incumbent Gov. Pete Wilson over her opposition to the death
penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Davis is likely to face more clemency pleas than any other
governor before him, or any other governor in the country.
California has more than 500 inmates on death row. At some point,
he will probably grant clemency, said Zimring. But not soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the pope had been in California in January,'' he said,
``his plea for mercy would have been denied.''

SLAPSTICK ABUSE OF ANIMALS IN MOVIES: WHY IS IT ON THE RISE? 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Week in Review)  
 (NOTE TO INTERNATIONAL CLIENTS: For international clients' use by
special arrangement only. Asian and European points: contact Karl
Horwitz in Paris for details and prices (Phone: 47 42 17 11; FAX:

<P>
   In the film ``There's Something About Mary,'' a small dog flies
out a window. In ``As Good as It Gets,'' a pooch is crammed down a
trash chute. In ``EdTV,'' a love scene culminates in Matthew
McConaughey falling on a cat. In ``Men in Black,'' an alien pug
confesses after it is mercilessly shaken. Even the preview for
``Idle Hands'' shows a cat being swung around by its tail.
</P>
<P>
   For cats, dogs and other animals, life in the movies is
beginning to appear less than glamorous. Indeed, at this historical
juncture of political correctness and feeling the pain of others,
pretending to hurt animals has become an intentional laugh-getter
in movies, television and advertising.
</P>
<P>
   The ad campaign of Cyberian Outpost, an online shopping site,
features gerbils being fired from an artillery cannon into a wall.
(They were actually plastic.)
</P>
<P>
   The question arises, as President Clinton prepares to meet
Monday with experts on youth violence in the wake of the Colorado
killings, how positive an influence is all this animal abuse?
</P>
<P>
   Not very, worries Dr. Pamela Sicher, president of the Children's
Mental Health Alliance Foundation. ``Is this something that
desensitizes us to the meaning of hurting living things?'' she
said. ``At what point in children's lives can they actually discern
the meaning in this?''
</P>
<P>
   The animal bashing comes at a time when other movies like
``Babe'' depict other fauna in a sympathetic, if not adorable
manner that even the most ardent animal-rights activists applaud.
Virtually all the cinematic atrocities are, of course, staged.
Animal abuse is now a felony in 23 states. Advances in robotics and
computer imaging have made it possible to simulate just about
anything. Since 1980, after a horse was killed by a dynamite
explosion in ``Heaven's Gate,'' the Screen Actors Guild contract
has required that the American Humane Association vet any scripts
involving animals. Representatives visit film sets to insure that
even rats and spiders are not mistreated. A recent New Yorker
cartoon was on the mark: It showed a studio honcho proclaiming,
``OK. Just make sure no animals are harmed in the exploding-donkey
scene.''
</P>
<P>
   But why are there exploding donkey scenes? Mainly, it seems,
because people laugh at silly humor, and animal predicaments,
particularly painful ones, are part of that time-honored genre. Dr.
Alan Manevitz, a family psychiatrist at New York Presbyterian
Hospital, suggests that the apparent abuse represents a regression
to cartoon humor of yore. Three Stooges-style slapstick, which
relies on a dose of sadism, is no longer ``politically correct with
people,'' he says. Since people know the animals are not being hurt
_ and most filmmakers run an official disclaimer from the American
Humane Association in their credits _ animal slapstick is in.
</P>
<P>
   While the humane association ignores the film content, other
groups have focused on the message. The Ark Trust, which monitors
entertainment and media for their depictions of animals, will today
televise its Genesis Awards. Among the honorees is an episode of
``Spin City,'' in which Michael J. Fox's character refuses to kill
a fawn. It is also handing out less laudatory ``Foe-Paw'' awards,
one of which will go to Outpost for its glib depiction of gerbils.
</P>
<P>
   Gretchen Wyler, president of the trust, said such scenes are no
laughing matter. ``They sort of give legitimacy to the acts,'' Ms.
Wyler said. ``It's a potential source of destructive ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   Animal rights activists are fond of pointing to a study by the
Federal Bureau of Investigation that links many serial killers to
animal abuse. As a youth, Jeffrey L. Dahmer stole his neighbor's
pets and practiced taxidermy on them, keeping skulls in his yard.
Albert DeSalvo, the ``Boston Strangler,'' trapped dogs and cats in
orange crates and shot arrows through the boxes. Before Russell
Eugene Weston Jr. was charged with killing two policemen in the
U.S. Capitol last year, he reportedly shot 16 of his grandmother's
cats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Virtually every one of these kids who ends up shooting up the
school yard has a history of animal abuse,'' said Kenneth Shapiro,
executive director of Psychologists for the Ethical Treatment of
Animals.
</P>
<P>
   The link between pretend violence on the screen and real
behavior is fuzzier. But if Manevitz is right that the appeal of
the humor is a throwback to cartoons, there seem to be grounds for
worry: A study by George Gerbner at the University of
Pennsylvania's Annenberg School for Communication found that cruel
images of animals outnumbered positive ones 12 to 1 in Saturday
morning cartoons. As to the question whether watching a violent act
has a cathartic effect on viewers _ or is more likely to spur them
to imitate it _ research has pointed toward imitation, Shapiro
said.
</P>
<P>
   And younger children surely see the famous scene in Mel Brooks'
``Blazing Saddles,'' where Alex Karras knocks out a horse with a
single punch, differently than most adults.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you trivialize the meaning of hurting living things, you're
doing something to the pathways by which children develop
appropriate restraints and constraints on their behavior,'' said
Sicher. ``You want them to be horrified by cruelty.''

   Among the problems to be addressed or evaded in a coming report
by the National Gambling Impact Study Commission, set up by
Congress to look into the flourishing pastime, is the problem
gambler. Since any such study requires that the panelists get a
grip on the nature of the ailment, one hopes they have been
introduced to the most vivid accounts of gambling addiction in
world literature.
</P>
<P>
   They come from Fyodor Mikhailovich Dostoyevsky, who for
miserable years was an unregenerate roulette punter in the casinos
of Germany. ``Oh, the way they played yesterday,'' he wrote. ``The
excitement was tremendous! If only I had some money.''
</P>
<P>
   The reason Dostoyevsky had no money for gambling at the moment,
as every member of Gamblers Anonymous can appreciate, is that as
soon as he laid hold of a few guldens, he gambled them away. Like
so many casino clients, he had a system. ``For four days, he
studied the game and the players and very quickly he came to the
conclusion that only  &UR; he  &LR;  could master this game,'' explained Geir
Kjetsaa, a biographer. ``It was so pathetically simple: All that
was required was that one play  &UR; systematically &LR;  and keep a cool
head.'' In Dostoyevsky's novel ``The Gambler,'' the
roulette-infatuated narrator detects ``a sort of order'' in the
turn of the wheel.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who has observed roulette players in the throes has seen
the specimens who keep track of winning numbers on little cards
(sometimes supplied by the casino), a project that may be enough to
qualify them as casino compulsives. There are at least two
difficulties with the Dostoyevskyan analysis, which has confounded
gamblers down the years: a system for playing roulette is a wishful
enterprise to begin with, and keeping a cool head is a rare talent
in the heat of play. Certainly it defied the hysteria-prone
Dostoyevsky, even as he bought books on fail-proof systems to break
the bank. In a time when even slot-machine feeders think they have
a system, the gambling panel might consider outlawing all systems
as a form of deceptive advertising.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to his prodigiously forgiving wife, Anna,
Dostoyevsky described a progression that gamblers everywhere and in
all periods can identify with: ``To begin with I lost a little, and
then I really began to lose in earnest. I wanted to win back what I
had lost, but then I lost even more. And then I simply had to go on
playing, in order at least to get money for my homeward journey.
And then I lost everything, everything!''
</P>
<P>
   Periodically, he would assure the loyal Anna that he had
overcome a decade's passion: ``But now it is all over! This was the
 &UR; last &LR;  time!'' By the next letter, he was back at the tables.
</P>
<P>
   There, for the commission member who pays attention, is a model
of the compulsive's chronic condition.
</P>
<P>
   Kjetsaa credits Dostoyevsky's eventual ``recovery'' not to will
power but to the closing of Germany's casinos in 1872 and 1873, a
remedy that the commission, made up in part by friends of the
casino industry, is in no position to recommend. And since casinos
are not in business to produce winners, gamblers will continue,
like Dostoyevsky, to whine about losing. If the commission seeks to
stop compulsive gambling, all it need do is declare an end to
losing; winning is the cure for all gambling ailments.
</P>
<P>
   Anna saw her husband's gambling as ``an illness for which there
was no cure.'' Kjetsaa offers a more modern explanation for what he
calls a ``pathological obsession.'' He writes, ``Dostoyevsky was
possessed by an unconscious desire to lose and punish himself by
losing.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps. Anyway, the commission, under the influence of the
therapeutic community, can be counted on to treat hard-case
gambling, along with alcoholism, drug addiction and other
unwholesome habits, as an illness. But whatever the preferred
diagnosis, the difference between Dostoyevsky and an ordinary loser
is that the writer seemed to gain creative energy from every
defeat. Kjetsaa reports that ``He never worked better than when he
had lost everything and had relieved his guilt through the
merciless punishment of the roulette wheel.'' It was after a
session of torture by the wheel in Wiesbaden that Dostoyevsky
started ``Crime and Punishment.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many gamblers who cannot stop when they are ahead (too
common to be a pathology), Dostoyevsky was on intimate acquaintance
with the powerful lure of the sport and his own weakness. Even
watching someone else rake in a small fortune on improbable bets,
the narrator of ``The Gambler,'' set in the town of Roulettenberg,
becomes acutely conscious of his hands and knees shaking and the
blood beating in his brain. Unlike others of his sizable fraternity
of losers, however, Dostoyevsky was able to transmute his symptoms
into his writings. The gambling commission has to deal somehow with
all those driven players who can't count on that payback.

   Among the problems to be addressed or evaded in a coming report
by the National Gambling Impact Study Commission, set up by
Congress to look into the flourishing pastime, is the problem
gambler. Since any such study requires that the panelists get a
grip on the nature of the ailment, one hopes they have been
introduced to the most vivid accounts of gambling addiction in
world literature.
</P>
<P>
   They come from Fyodor Mikhailovich Dostoyevsky, who for
miserable years was an unregenerate roulette punter in the casinos
of Germany. ``Oh, the way they played yesterday,'' he wrote. ``The
excitement was tremendous! If only I had some money.''
</P>
<P>
   The reason Dostoyevsky had no money for gambling at the moment,
as every member of Gamblers Anonymous can appreciate, is that as
soon as he laid hold of a few guldens, he gambled them away. Like
so many casino clients, he had a system. ``For four days, he
studied the game and the players and very quickly he came to the
conclusion that only  &UR; he  &LR;  could master this game,'' explained Geir
Kjetsaa, a biographer. ``It was so pathetically simple: All that
was required was that one play  &UR; systematically &LR;  and keep a cool
head.'' In Dostoyevsky's novel ``The Gambler,'' the
roulette-infatuated narrator detects ``a sort of order'' in the
turn of the wheel.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who has observed roulette players in the throes has seen
the specimens who keep track of winning numbers on little cards
(sometimes supplied by the casino), a project that may be enough to
qualify them as casino compulsives. There are at least two
difficulties with the Dostoyevskyan analysis, which has confounded
gamblers down the years: a system for playing roulette is a wishful
enterprise to begin with, and keeping a cool head is a rare talent
in the heat of play. Certainly it defied the hysteria-prone
Dostoyevsky, even as he bought books on fail-proof systems to break
the bank. In a time when even slot-machine feeders think they have
a system, the gambling panel might consider outlawing all systems
as a form of deceptive advertising.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to his prodigiously forgiving wife, Anna,
Dostoyevsky described a progression that gamblers everywhere and in
all periods can identify with: ``To begin with I lost a little, and
then I really began to lose in earnest. I wanted to win back what I
had lost, but then I lost even more. And then I simply had to go on

MANY STATES SLOW TO USE CHILD HEALTH PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
  
repeating to remove date from dateline  (Attn: Va., W.Va, N.Y., Vt., Mn., Wash., Colo.)  
(jt) 
 By ROBERT PEAR    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ States are using less than 20 percent of the
federal money that Congress made available, with much fanfare, for
a big new program to subsidize health insurance for children in
low-income families.
</P>
<P>
   Some states say they cannot find enough eligible uninsured
children to use all the money they are entitled to receive. Critics
say many states have been slow to reach out to eligible children
and sign them up.
</P>
<P>
   The program's slow start and the accumulation of unspent money
are tempting Republicans in Congress to take back some of the money
and use it for other purposes _ an idea vehemently opposed by
Democrats, by advocates for children and by governors of both
parties.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John D. Rockefeller IV, the West Virginia Democrat who
helped create the Children's Health Insurance Program in 1997,
said, ``The Appropriations Committee is looking at the unused money
for other projects.'' He objects to such a shift.
</P>
<P>
   Elaina J. Fox, a spokeswoman for West Virginia's new child
health program, said, ``A majority of states will probably not be
able to utilize their full allotments'' of federal money.
</P>
<P>
   Governors are enthusiastic about the program, and tens of
thousands of children have clearly benefited. But Rep. Diana
DeGette, D-Colo., said some states, including her own, had ``an
abysmal record'' of finding uninsured children and enrolling them
in the new program.
</P>
<P>
   Congress provided $39 billion for the program over 10 years,
including $4.2 billion a year in 1998 and 1999. Federal officials
said states had used $260 million through December 1998 and $115
million in the first three months of this year. The Congressional
Budget Office estimates that states will use a total of $800
million this year.
</P>
<P>
   States say they have enrolled one million youngsters in the new
program. But federal officials and health policy experts say the
numbers are somewhat misleading.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 30 percent of the million children are in New York State,
and 176,000 of the New York children were already in a
state-financed program, Child Health Plus, often described by
federal officials as a model for the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Frank C. Ullman, a health policy expert at the Urban
Institute here, said, ``The decrease in Medicaid enrollment in many
states is greater than the increase in coverage through the new
Children's Health Insurance Program.'' So it is unclear, he added,
whether there has been a net reduction in the number of uninsured
children _ one of the main goals for President Clinton and
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The number of children without health insurance has been
creeping up in recent years and is now at least 10.7 million, the
Census Bureau says.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Under federal law, children eligible for Medicaid may not be
enrolled in the new Children's Health Insurance Program. Medicaid
is intended for families with somewhat lower incomes. States are
supposed to screen children and enroll them in Medicaid if they
qualify for it.
</P>
<P>
   But states have a strong financial incentive to put children
into the new program, rather than in Medicaid, because the federal
government pays a larger share of the costs _ 65 percent, rather
than 50 percent, in high-income states like New York, New Jersey
and Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   The children's health plan was forged in a bipartisan agreement
between the president and Congress. When he signed the legislation
in August 1997, Clinton said it would extend insurance coverage
``to up to five million children.'' He called it ``the largest
expansion in health care for children'' in three decades.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce D. Lesley, director of congressional relations at the
National Association of Children's Hospitals, said: ``The results
to date have been mixed. Some states like South Carolina have done
an unbelievably good job of enrolling children in the new health
insurance program. Other states like Virginia are not doing so
well. In these states, parents who need to know about the new
program have no idea that it exists.''
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina simplified its enrollment process, disseminated
applications at drug stores, day care centers, schools, churches
and Indian reservations and signed up 40,400 children for the new
program. By reaching out to low-income families, the state also
found 46,000 other children who were eligible for its pre-existing
Medicaid program.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Amy M. Atkinson, a spokeswoman for the Virginia
Department of Medical Assistance Services, said her state had
enrolled 8,599 children in the new insurance program, including
only 71 in Richmond, through May 3.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Charles S. Robb, D-Va., said, ``My state has not been as
quick off the mark as others have.''
</P>
<P>
   Edward J. Rogan, a spokesman for the New Jersey Department of
Human Services, said the state had enrolled 30,232 children in its
new health program, known as Kid Care, and expected to spend $19
million of its $88 million federal allotment this year.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut has enrolled 8,000 children and expects to spend
$5.4 million of its $35 million federal allotment this year, said
David Dearborn, a spokesman for the Connecticut Department of
Social Services. As a side benefit, he said, in reaching out to
low-income families, the state has found several thousand children
eligible for its Medicaid program.
</P>
<P>
   Auditors in some states said some children enrolled in the new
program were probably ineligible and should have been enrolled
instead in the regular Medicaid program.
</P>
<P>
   In welfare, a separate program, states have also allowed
substantial amounts of federal money to go unspent. They say they
are keeping it for a rainy day, in case the economy sputters.
</P>
<P>
   But that concern does not explain delays in spending money on
health insurance for children. Officials in many states said they
had only recently begun to enroll children because they first had
to design new health programs, get federal approval, prepare
application forms, set up toll-free telephone lines, print posters
and run advertising to publicize the availability of the new
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Judith A. Arnold, deputy commissioner of the New York Health
Department, said, ``Congress should be patient with states that
seem to be moving slowly.''
</P>
<P>
   The federal government has approved children's health plans for
every state except Tennessee, Washington and Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
   State officials told Congress in 1997 that they needed the
maximum latitude to design their own programs because they knew
best how to meet the health needs of uninsured children.
</P>
<P>
   But in a curious way, the law penalized states that had already
expanded Medicaid eligibility by increasing the permissible income
for families seeking coverage. Such states included Minnesota,
Vermont and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington State, for example, Medicaid covers children whose
family incomes are up to twice the official poverty level (up to
$27,760 a year for a family of three). Since those children are
eligible for Medicaid, they may not enroll in the new Children's
Health Insurance Program.
</P>
<P>
   Under federal law, Washington may use its share of the new
federal money _ $46 million a year _ for children of families with
incomes up to 2.5 times the poverty level.
</P>
<P>
   But Thomas W. Bedell, acting director of the Medicaid program in
Washington State, said: ``We won't be able to spend our full
allotment of federal money. We have only 10,000 uninsured children
with family incomes from 200 to 250 percent of the poverty level.
We estimate that we can spend only $7.5 million of our federal
money in the next year and a half.''
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Gov. Howard Dean of Vermont, a Democrat, said the law
penalized ``states like Vermont that have served as national
leaders in expanding health care coverage.''
</P>
<P>
   Ullman of the Urban Institute said: ``In theory, there's enough
money to cover five million children a year in the initial years of
the new Children's Health Insurance Program. But only 3.2 million
uninsured children live in families with the proper income to
qualify.''

   FRAMINGHAM, Mass. _ Susan Faessler was recently helping her
mother-in-law move into an apartment at an assisted-living center
here, Heritage at Framingham, when her cell phone rang. ``It's
Tom,'' Mrs. Faessler said, referring to her husband. ``He wants to
know how you like it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Tell him I'm getting used to it,'' said her mother-in-law,
87-year-old Trudy Faessler.
</P>
<P>
   True, she had just been commenting on how small the studio
apartment was, after her retirement house in Sun City Center, Fla.
But Trudy Faessler knew that Tom and Susan, who live a short drive
from Heritage, were right: Now that she was a widow _ her husband,
Alfred, died recently _ she could not live on her own.
</P>
<P>
   Osteoporosis has left her too weak even to lift a tea kettle.
She needs the services available at Heritage, where her
$2,750-a-month rent includes three meals a day, housekeeping and
help with bathing and dressing.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago, Mrs. Faessler might have ended up spending much
more money, only to be in a nursing home. Assisted-living centers,
which provide private apartments plus daily assistance for a
monthly rent, were then barely known. There was no step between
independence and helplessness.
</P>
<P>
   Today, in one of the most sweeping changes in the way the old
live, assisted living is the focus of the industry that has grown
out of caring for the aging. About 1.2 million people live in
assisted-living facilities, and communities across the country are
asking developers to build more so that their aging residents can
stay close to home.
</P>
<P>
   But for the Faesslers and other families, as well as experts on
aging and government officials, just what ``assisted living'' is
can be confusing and even a concern. Among the nation's 30,000
assisted-living centers, the definition varies from state to state,
town to town, facility to facility, and so do the services they
provide and the fees they charge.
</P>
<P>
   Experts ask whether assisted living is a real solution for a new
stage of life or a marketing opportunity directed at two
fast-growing groups that are fearful about aging: the affluent
elderly and their adult children.
</P>
<P>
   Recalling the scandals of the nursing-home boom of the 1970s,
the experts ask what will happen to assisted-living residents who
run out of money or grow more disabled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm concerned that they will cater to the worried rich _
`we'll cater to you in a nice setting, then when you get really
sick, you're out,''' said Rosalie A. Kane, gerontologist at the
University of Minnesota who applauds the philosophy behind assisted
living. ``I'm worried about their not being committed.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom and Susan Faessler live in a hotbed of assisted-living
competition, the suburbs of Boston. How they and Trudy Faessler
came to Heritage, and what they found there, illustrates both the
benefits and the complications of assisted living today.
</P>
<P>
   The Growth: More Older People With More Money
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, Massachusetts had fewer than a dozen
assisted-living centers. Today it has 115 and more on the way as
national chains and local hospitals compete for a piece of the
market.
</P>
<P>
   The brief history of Heritage at Framingham suggests the ferment
within the industry, one that promises its customers stability and
support at a critical stage in their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Heritage was built in 1995 by a developer, ADS Senior Housing,
in conjunction with a local nonprofit hospital, Metrowest Medical
Center. Hospitals increasingly see assisted- living centers as
sources of patients.
</P>
<P>
   The Metrowest Medical Center then spun off a nonprofit
corporation that included Heritage. ADS Senior Housing, meanwhile,
which was managing Heritage, was bought by the Multicare Companies
Corp., which owned and managed nursing homes. Multicare was then
bought by the larger Genesis Health Ventures of Kennett Square, Pa.
A division, Genesis Elder Care, now manages Heritage.
</P>
<P>
   The founder of ADS Senior Housing, Thomas H. Grape, left to
start a new company, Benchmark Assisted Living, which has since
opened two centers, one in Massachusetts and one in Connecticut,
and has eight more being built or on which construction will start
soon in New England.
</P>
<P>
   Grape said he got into the assisted-living business in the early
1990s based on demographics.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of old folks everywhere, and the numbers are
growing,'' he said. ``It was self evident that it was just going to
become a big thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Framingham had the specific demographics he wanted: lots of
people over 75 with incomes of more than $25,000 a year, and just
as important, many people with incomes of more than $75,000, to
help pay for assisted living for their parents. Indeed, one
criticism of assisted living is that Medicaid and Medicare, the
federal insurance programs, do not cover it, so it is limited to
the affluent.
</P>
<P>
   There is plenty of market research behind the design of Heritage
and other assisted-living centers.
</P>
<P>
   A three-story building with a wide front porch, Heritage, with
room for about 95 residents, was built next to an elementary
school, across from a small shopping center and near a busy
intersection.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a misperception that older people want to live off in
a serene setting by a pond,'' Grape said. ``They want to be right
smack in the middle of the action. They want to feel connected.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside, Heritage is modeled after a country inn. A grandfather
clock stands inside the entrance. The living room has a grand
piano, lace curtains and oriental rugs. There are fresh flowers in
vases and plenty of common spaces with faux antiques and
comfortable chairs.
</P>
<P>
   There are 48 apartments with kitchenettes, a feature important
to older people, who want to feel independent. There are 40 other
apartments for people with memory loss, and these do not have
kitchenettes.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the center of activity at Heritage is the dining room,
where residents gather three times a day for meals served on china
and linens. A cafeteria, Grape said, would be too institutional.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of fluorescent lights, there are lamps. And while there
are plenty of staff members, including a nurse, no one is in
uniform.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't look like a nursing home,'' said Rose Leverone, 94,
a retired Framingham tax clerk. ``Anyone can walk through and think
it's a beautiful retirement home.''
</P>
<P>
   That is a chief selling point. Americans have such a dread of
nursing homes that a recent survey found that 30 percent of people
65 and older would rather die than live in one.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Market research tells developers like Grape that they have two
customers: the older people who need a home that includes help, and
their affluent children.
</P>
<P>
   At Heritage, it is telling that the residents' rooms, which they
furnish themselves, are far simpler than the public rooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are people who were raised during the Depression,'' said
Ben Pearce, senior vice president for assisted living with Genesis
Elder Care. ``If it were up to them, they'd stay in their homes for
the rest of their lives, and turn all their savings over to their
kids.''
</P>
<P>
   In most cases, it is the children who make the initial contact,
and often they choose the facility.
</P>
<P>
   ``The glitz is for the kids,'' said Carol Seager, a consultant.
``They feel less guilty. They say, `Look at this beautiful place,
Mom.'''
</P>
<P>
   The cozy luxury of Heritage appealed to Tom Faessler, a dentist
who had paid for his parents' retirement house in Sun City Center,
Fla., and who was prepared to pay, after his father's death, for
assisted living for his thrifty mother if she decided that it was
too expensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up in an apartment in Kew Gardens, Queens,'' Faessler
said. ``I want the best for my parents, maybe better than they ever
had. I wanted it to be the perfect assisted-living place, with the
perfect people.''
</P>
<P>
   Alfred and Trudy Faessler had been married nearly 64 years when
he died in March, at 91, four days after a heart attack. After
retiring to Florida, they had negotiated old age as a team, without
help.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a husband I had,'' Mrs. Faessler said . ``He was well
known for how he took care of me.''
</P>
<P>
   Sun City Center, however, was built for active retirees, not the
frail elderly. It has golf courses and swimming pools, but, ``they
don't even have a taxicab, or home delivery of groceries,'' Susan
Faessler said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew right away she couldn't live there alone,'' Susan
Faessler said. ``The only thing we could do was bring her up
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom and Susan Faessler and their three daughters live in
Medfield, 15 miles from Boston. Faessler's sister, Ingrid, also
lives in Medfield. The Faesslers are typical of a growing number of
families that bring a parent back from a retirement community. They
are also typical in having the parent live near them, not with
them.
</P>
<P>
   Trudy Faessler herself says moving in with her son's family was
never an option. ``That's the last and stupidest thing anyone can
do,'' she said. ``They have a life, too. My mother didn't move in
with us when my father died, and we had a fantastic relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   The Faesslers were also typical in that most families start
thinking about assisted living only after a crisis: an aging parent
has a stroke, or has to stop driving, or suddenly cannot remember
whether she took her medication. All of a sudden they had to become
experts in the arcane world of long-term care.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Faessler, a part-time flight attendant, started looking
for a new home for her mother-in-law as soon as she returned from
her father-in-law's funeral. The fact that daughters and
daughters-in-law take on most of the responsibility is no secret to
marketers: brochures for assisted living are filled with
photographs of white-haired men and women with younger women.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Klaassen, the founder of a national chain of
assisted-living centers, Sunrise, describes the care-taking as
``doing what your daughter or daughter-in-law used to do.''
</P>
<P>
   A complication arose when Trudy Faessler, on arriving in Boston,
developed pneumonia and had to be hospitalized. The Faesslers had
already been thinking about assisted living, thanks to one of
Faessler's patients who works with the elderly. But with his mother
in a hospital, he visited a nursing home.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband learned that the nursing home would be appropriate
only if his mother needed 24-hour care. And it would be expensive:
nursing homes in Massachusetts cost, on average, $60,000 to $70,000
a year.
</P>
<P>
   With Trudy Faessler in the hospital for three weeks, her son and
daughter-in-law considered seven different assisted-living
facilities, all with studio apartments, at about $2,700 a month.
</P>
<P>
   The couple wanted a place near Medfield so everyone could visit
easily. They rejected one place because the hallways were too long,
and another because it was too far away. They put down a $500
deposit on one place but changed their minds. One place the
Faesslers liked was Sunrise at Wayland, which opened in 1997 about
seven miles from Heritage.
</P>
<P>
   The Choice: Matching Residents For Compatibility
</P>
<P>
   Sunrise is a national chain that markets its facilities as
alternatives to nursing homes, and so its residents tend to be
frailer than those at other assisted-living centers. While many
residents at the centers use walkers or wheelchairs, a Sunrise
trademark is a grand staircase in the lobby leading to the second
floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Residents have a choice to use the staircase,'' said Cindy
Peterson, the Wayland facility's executive director, and Sunrise's
philosophy is to give residents choices.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent tour, Ms. Peterson stopped to pet Bradley, a cocker
spaniel that was tied to the concierge desk. Dogs are another
Sunrise signature. So are the ``preview windows'' just inside the
entrance, offering views into the public living room on one side,
and a cafe on the other where residents can get snacks.
</P>
<P>
   The residents, Ms. Peterson said, are of a generation not
accustomed to living communally with strangers; most, for example,
never lived in college dormitories. Preview windows allow them to
see who is in the next room _ and whether it is someone they want
to talk to.
</P>
<P>
   Another Sunrise trademark, Victorian-style architecture, is
aimed at the baby boomers, who may be familiar with the design from
trips to San Francisco, Cape May, Nantucket and Disney World, said
Paul Klaassen, the founder of Sunrise.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Heritage just felt right. Susan Faessler clocked it
as a 26-minute drive from Medfield. It had been recommended by one
of Trudy Faessler's doctors at the hospital, who happened to be on
Heritage's board. And Faessler liked the fact that he did not see
many residents with walkers or wheelchairs. Nor did many seemed
memory impaired.
</P>
<P>
   ``At Sun City Center, all the neighbors were 15, 25 years
younger than my parents,'' he said. ``That's nice. You feel
younger. It's like when you play tennis. You play with a better
player, it brings up your game.''
</P>
<P>
   With meals served in the dining room, and his mother not needing
much more in the way of help than someone to pull on her stockings,
Faessler signed her up for the ``basic package,'' 315 minutes of
assistance a week (less than an hour a day). The next level, 840
minutes a week (two hours a day), is $500 a month more.
</P>
<P>
   One issue surrounding assisted living, according to a recent
report by the General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of
Congress, is whether families get enough information about a
facility and its services to judge whether it meets their needs _
and whether it will continue to meet their needs as a resident
declines in health.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Sunrise, for example, purposely appeals to frailer
people who might otherwise look at nursing homes, some facilities
try to attract the healthiest people they can, in part because they
cost less to care for. Extra services may be available as they are
needed, but perhaps at a cost some residents can not afford.
</P>
<P>
   If a person requires long-term nursing care around the clock,
many states prohibit them from being in an assisted living
facilities.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   At Heritage, Terese McElhaney, director of marketing, told the
Faesslers that its residents must be able to get around their
apartments without help and be able to communicate their needs. Ms.
McElhaney said many families wanted to discuss the future: How long
can their father or mother stay in assisted living? What happens if
they have to move to a nursing home? What if they run out of money?
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell them, `This is not a good answer, but this is the
answer,''' Ms. McElhaney said. `` `It's private pay. Someone has to
come up with the money. It's all a gamble. Old age is a gamble.'''
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the first week, Trudy Faessler had only praise for
Heritage: ``I must say, it's like a good hotel. The food is
absolutely delicious. I'm very lucky.''
</P>
<P>
   She was pleased, she said, to be near her family, especially her
grandchildren, who had already visited several times.
</P>
<P>
   Still, in Sun City Center, she had been surrounded by people in
their 60s and 70s. At Heritage, the average age is 83. ``I was
never in that much contact with that many old people,'' she said.
``I never realized I was old before.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McElhaney said she had seen many old people, who had been
isolated at home, form friendships and lead richer lives in
assisted living. Still, she sympathizes with what the residents are
confronting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like it when adult children come in and say to me,
`Oh, I'd love to live here,''' she said. ``I say, `Oh, really,
you'd give up your spouse? You'd give up driving, and your house?'
People want to have all their independence. It's the best of a
difficult situation.''

   KOSOVO-SERBIA-REVIEW (Undated) _ A bold, if impractical,
question is just now beginning to be formulated: Is it finally time
for outside powers to crush Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic,
to make the effort necessary to cure a national psychosis inside

   NEWSMEDIA-DEATHS-REVIEW (Atlanta) _ The news media's philosophy
appears to be that while people may be created equal, they do not
necessarily die that way. On the swiftly calculated sliding scale
of death, disasters are assigned a news value based not on how many
lives were lost, but on how and where they happened to die. A
recent Arkansas boating accident that killed 13 people received far
less coverage than events that claimed a comparable number of
lives, such as an Amtrak crash or Colorado school shooting. By
David Firestone.
</P>
<P>
   CLEMENCY-POLITICS-REVIEW (San Francisco) _ It's a bad time to be
on death row. Politicians win points _ and votes _ by wearing the
tough-on-crime banner. In this environment, granting clemency has
become an act of courage that requires an outlay of political
capital few governors are willing to spend. In the current
political climate, clemency is nearly impossible. By Evelyn Nieves.
</P>
<P>
   GAMBLING-DOSTOYEVSKY-REVIEW (Undated) _ Among the problems to be
addressed or evaded in the coming report by the National Gambling
Impact Study Commission is the problem gambler. Some of the most
vivid accounts of gambling addiction in world literature come from
Fyodor Mikhailovich Dostoyevsky, who for miserable years was an
unregenerate roulette punter in the casinos of Germany. By Walter
Goodman.

<P>
   ANIMAL-CRUELTY-REVIEW (Undated) _ For cats, dogs and other
animals, life in the movies is beginning to appear less than
glamorous. At this historical juncture of political correctness and
feeling the pain of others, pretending to hurt animals has become
an intentional laugh-getter in movies, TV and advertising. By
Douglas Martin.

   MILITARY-BOOKS-REVIEW (Undated) _ The U.S.
military-literary-industrial complex is gathering might with the
surprising success of new books that portray modern warriors as
complex heroes who confront enemies and their own mistakes with a
mixture of courage and fear. By Doreen Carvajal.

safety net means not only that being out of work has become a

stigma attached to joblessness. That goes a long way in explaining
the contrast between America's current jobs boom and the
contrasting jobs bust in Europe. By Sylvia Nasar. WITH GRAPHIC.

   ISRAEL-DIVISIONS-REVIEW (Jerusalem) _ Such depictions of Israeli
society as an aggregate of groups, not individuals, reflect the

Israelis view each other as members of ideological, religious or
ethnic sub-units, rather than as one society with shared values. By
Joel Greenberg.

hospitable to foreign journalists because the tiny republic is in
big trouble. Its new, Western-leaning government has all but pulled

NATO SAYS OUTDATED MAP A POSSIBILITY IN BOMBING OF CHINESE EMBASSY
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By MICHAEL R. GORDON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ A NATO aircraft bombed the Chinese Embassy
in Belgrade because the military command mistakenly believed it was
a Serbian weapons depot, NATO officials said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Allied officials said the aircraft had carried out its mission
correctly and struck the assigned building but had received faulty
target information.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear who was responsible for the mistake. NATO
officials said the Central Intelligence Agency had picked the
target, but said that the episode was still under investigation.
One possibility, a NATO official said, is that the target was
picked using an outdated map of Belgrade, although the site of the
embassy building was well known in the Yugoslav capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hit what we were aiming for,'' a NATO official said. ``But
we did not mean to hit the Chinese Embassy.''
</P>
<P>
   While the alliance acknowledged its mistake, it declined to say
which aircraft was involved and what munitions were used.
</P>
<P>
   The bombing raid, which took place midnight Friday, has stirred
up a political storm for the Western alliance. But NATO officials
gave no hint of easing off their air campaign.
</P>
<P>
   NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana insisted that air strikes
would continue until Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic stopped
his attacks on ethnic Albanians and agreed to NATO's terms. ``The
attacks will continue,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Solana met with the Chinese ambassador to
Brussels to apologize for the accident. ``NATO never has and never
will intentionally target civilians,'' he said. ``The bombing of
the Chinese Embassy was a deeply regrettable mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   The errant attack on the Chinese Embassy also revealed a glaring
limitation of high-technology warfare. Even in an age of
precision-guided bombs, an air campaign can be no better than the
intelligence it is based on.
</P>
<P>
   The incident, which killed at least three and wounded more than
20, recalled the American strike on the Al Firdos bunker in Baghdad
during the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   In that case, the pilot also accurately carried out his
instructions. He bombed an underground bunker used by Iraqi
intelligence officers. But as a result of an intelligence failure,
the CIA had overlooked indications that civilians were also using
the shelter.
</P>
<P>
   The uproar over the Al Firdos attack prompted Gen. Colin L.
Powell, then chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, to restrict
attacks against targets in downtown Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   The allied strike against the Chinese Embassy raised the
question of whether there would be a similar letup in strikes
against the Yugoslav capital. But at the Pentagon, spokesman
Kenneth Bacon seemed to dismiss that possibility Saturday. ``I see
that there will be broadening attacks,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Since NATO's air strikes began 46 days ago, allied officials
have made extensive use of laser-guided bombs and satellite-guided
munitions.
</P>
<P>
   A major aim has been to take the war home to the Yugoslav
leadership in Belgrade while avoiding civilian casualties.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The strike against the Chinese Embassy was part of a broader
series of attacks against the Yugoslav capital. Friday's strikes in
Belgrade were the heaviest so far.
</P>
<P>
   They included strikes against the Dobanovci Command Complex, a
residence of Milosevic, which includes a bunker for his high
command.
</P>
<P>
   The Hotel Jugoslavia was also pounded. Allied officials say it
houses a barracks and command center for Zeljko Raznjatovic, the
paramilitary leader knows as Arkan who has been charged with war
crimes for his attacks in Bosnia. His gang, ``Arkan's Tigers,'' has
been accused of attacking ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Other targets struck in Belgrade include various Defense
Ministry buildings, an Interior Ministry headquarters and a
building used by Yugoslav's general staff, which has a satellite
antennas for military communications.
</P>
<P>
   Electrical transformers in Belgrade and Obrenovac were also
attacked. Along with additional attacks Saturday, the strikes
disrupted the Serbs' command and control, NATO spokesman insisted.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Still, the embassy bombing was a major political setback,
particularly since China has been a sharp critic of the bombing
attacks and holds a veto on the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance has agreed to seek the Security Council's approval
for a settlement in Kosovo and the dispatch of a security force
there to protect returning refugees.
</P>
<P>
   The attack on the embassy also comes shortly after other
mistakes, including the accidental bombing of a marketplace and a
medical clinic in Nis.
</P>
<P>
   Since NATO's air strikes began 46 days ago, NATO's air
commanders have sought not just to pummel Serbian troops. By
targeting military ministries, command posts and communications
center in and around Belgrade, they have also sought to compel the
Yugoslav president to withdraw his troops from Kosovo and meet
other allied demands.
</P>
<P>
   A key condition, however, has been that civilian casualties be
limited. It is not just a moral concern. Allied officials have been
concerned that public support in the West would be undermined if
too many civilians are killed or hurt.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials have documented eight mistaken bombings. Until
the strike against the Chinese Embassy, the accidents stemmed from
mistakes by the pilots, technical problems with the bombs and,
sometimes, plain bad luck.
</P>
<P>
   In the recent attack on the hospital, for example, an F-16, was
trying to drop an unguided cluster bomb on an airfield a mile away.
A NATO official said it is not clear whether the pilot dropped the
bomb too soon or wind was a factor.
</P>
<P>
   The embassy case was different. In this case the pilot
successfully hit the target he was told to strike.
</P>
<P>
   Even Saturday, there was substantial confusion about the
episode. Initially, NATO spokesman Jamie P. Shea said that the
aircraft had intended to strike a nearby weapons depot, known as
the Federal Directorate for Supply and Procurement.
</P>
<P>
   ``NATO did not intentionally target the Chinese Embassy in
Belgrade last night,'' Shea said. ``The wrong building was
attacked. This was a terrible accident. NATO deeply regrets the
loss of life, and injuries to Chinese diplomatic personnel or to
any other civilians in the embassy at the time.''

   MOORE, Okla. _ Like many residents of Sunrise Drive and
Northwest 21st Street, a quiet neighborhood that no longer exists,
Jody Alexander is sifting through debris where his house once
stood, searching for any personal belongings that would help his
family to start life over again.
</P>
<P>
   His working-class neighborhood was leveled by a tornado Monday
evening. By midweek, homeowners were marking their turf,
spray-painting their addresses and the names of their insurance
companies on their driveways or the walls of their homes, if any
remained. A few planted American flags in the rubble, giving the
quiet streets the look of a battlefield.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander, who is 28 and delivers vending machines for
Coca-Cola, is less fortunate than many of his neighbors. He has no
homeowner's insurance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I let my homeowner's lapse, and I don't really know why,''
Alexander said. ``We were saving money to go on vacation, and I was
thinking that when we got back, I'd get insurance again.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been six days since the killer tornadoes struck, and for
those left homeless, everyday life is temporarily on hold. As the
massive cleanup begins, even those with insurance may find that
going home will take longer than they expect.
</P>
<P>
   Moore's mayor, Glenn Lewis, estimated that rebuilding could take
from six months to a year. Almost a quarter of the 15,000 houses in
the town were destroyed. Hundreds more were damaged but are
habitable, according to local police.
</P>
<P>
   But the mayor's prediction may be optimistic. A strong economy
and a construction boom have created a nationwide shortage of
building materials and construction crews. Supply cannot meet
demand, and that is driving up prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a sheetrock shortage and brick shortage,'' said L.O.
Harrington, a home builder and insurance agent in Moore. ``It's
frustrating to say the least.
</P>
<P>
   ``The shock is just hitting. Builders won't be able to get
subcontractors to rebuild homes, because these people can make more
money repairing homes than working on new ones. I'm not sure what
the bigger problem is,'' Harrington said, ``a lack of materials or
workers.''
</P>
<P>
   Hap Lowry of Trinity Brick, an Oklahoma City distributor, said
the tunnel kilns that produce brick are running at full capacity 24
hours a day, 365 days a year. ``They can produce only so many
bricks a day,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm also wondering whether they're going to make it a priority
for people who lost their homes to get brick first or for those who
are having homes built and have been waiting for two or three
months,'' Lowry said.
</P>
<P>
   Raymond Feuerborn, co-owner of Blanchard Building Supplies in
Blanchard, said he had used his allocation of drywall by November.
</P>
<P>
   He said insulation, lumber and roofing material are also scarce.
Also, spring is the builders' busiest season, when most housing
construction starts.
</P>
<P>
   Some tornado victims may purchase new homes that were built on
speculation in the greater Oklahoma City area. But that may require
moving to another area, which some may be unwilling to do.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Farney, a spokeswoman for the Oklahoma City mayor's
office, said there is concern that a shortage of materials and
workers will enable unscrupulous contractors to victimize impatient
homeowners.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why we are handing out packets to people at our
shelters and command centers,'' Farney said. ``We're telling them
to get three estimates and references, even from builders or
subcontractors from out of town.''
</P>
<P>
   She said that homeowners must be particularly about roofing
repairs, because Oklahoma doesn't license roofers.
</P>
<P>
   In Moore, a bedroom community of 50,000 south of Oklahoma City,
many tornado survivors are still too busy salvaging keepsakes and
remnants of their belongings to pay attention to such issues.
</P>
<P>
   Pamela Hester, who is 26 and has three young children, is more
concerned about safety. She told her husband, Shelby, that she will
no longer live in Oklahoma without a storm shelter. All that
remains of their rented home is a 4-by-5-foot closet in the master
bedroom, where the family hid as the tornado roared over them.
</P>
<P>
   In October, a much smaller twister cut a swath a mile south of
Monday's trail of destruction. That storm damaged 150 homes.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Watson, 74, has no intention of leaving. ``I've lived all
my life in Oklahoma, and we learn to get along with this,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   After a 15-year absence, his neighbor Sheila Meadows was
welcomed home to her native Oklahoma by October's tornado. Her
husband is in the Army, stationed in Kansas. She and her three
children survived Monday's tornado in their storm shelter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have my three children and my dog,'' she said. ``I'll
rebuild.''
</P>
<P>
   Down the street from where Jody Alexander lived, Shelly Haygood
and her teen-age daughter LaShell are sifting through the ruins of
their home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eight years ago, I had a house burn to the ground and lost
everything,'' said Haygood, 37 and a single mother. ``I learned
that things can be replaced.''
</P>
<P>
   She hasn't thought about whether she will risk losing a third
home.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is so much to do. I've got to hold the mail; I've got to
look to rent something,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it will be fine. Things will work out. And I imagine that
when all is said and done, I'll have a good cry.''
</P>
<P>
   Schools in Moore will open again tomorrow. Some tornado
survivors have already returned to work. But employers are flexible
and are giving their workers an opportunity to recover from the
trauma.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander has been given a month off with pay by Coca-Cola,
which has also offered free counseling for his family. South Winds,
a nearby apartment complex, has given him an apartment rent-free
for the first three months.
</P>
<P>
   He is married and has three stepchildren. They were looking
forward to the vacation planned for June in Red River, N.M.,
celebrating his first wedding anniversary. He said it would
probably have been the last he and his wife, Donette, could afford
for a while.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Alexander tried to be optimistic. One of his relatives is
a bricklayer who promised to help him rebuild if stays at 2200
Sunrise Drive. He is counting on assistance from the Federal
Emergency Management Agency.
</P>
<P>
   His mom drove 100 miles to bring a new set of dishes.
</P>
<P>
   ``And look at this,'' Alexander said, holding up a small plastic
bag filled with loose change that was buried in the debris. ``I've
got it made.''
</P>
<P>
   At a command center at First Baptist Church in Moore, insurance
companies such as Allstate, Farmers and State Farm had catastrophe
crews on site, parked in huge trailers. They sent claims adjusters
into the tornado-ravaged neighborhoods like commando units.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're already writing checks for $5,000 for living expenses,''
said Raleigh Floyd, a spokesman for Allstate.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is where we earn our keep,'' said Kitty Miller of
Farmers.
</P>
<P>
   Bulldozers cleared some debris, although the real cleanup will
begin within three weeks under the direction of FEMA.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Moore Police Department said that some
debris will be sent to a landfill in Oklahoma City. Some will be
burned, because the Moore landfill has too little room.
</P>
<P>
   As the rebuilding process begins, models are available for
Oklahoma communities to study. This year marked the 20th
anniversary of a tornado that swept through Wichita Falls, killing
45 and causing $800 million in damage.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Harper, an architect considered an expert on disaster
recovery, helped formulate the rebuilding plans in Wichita Falls. A
year after ``Terrible Tuesday,'' 85 percent of residential
dwellings had been rebuilt or were being rebuilt.
</P>
<P>
   Harper also worked hand-in-hand with his alma mater, Texas Tech,
to create in-house storm shelters, steel-reinforced rooms or
closets that are likely to become increasingly popular.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Pamela Hester will live in a house with one. Communities
can be rebuilt, but memories of last Monday will last a lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was born here and raised here,'' Hester said, ``but now I'll
be horrified whenever I hear storms come.''

   TOXIC-PORTABLES (Sacramento) _ The Department of Health Services
has taken no action on an 8-month-old report that warns ``there is
evidence that many schools in California have serious indoor
environmental quality problems, which are causing health concerns
in students and staff, reducing teaching and learning
effectiveness, and draining resources away from the schools' core
functions.'' The team of scientists and experts said portable
classrooms _ the fastest growing type of classroom in the state _
present a particular concern because they are constructed with
toxic chemicals and are air tight. By Terri Hardy. (Will move in

<P>
   PERSONNEL-PORTABLES (Sacramento) _ Only a smattering of school
personnel in Los Angeles County have been trained through a federal
program on how to keep the bungalows safe, despite growing concerns
that toxins used in their construction pose air safety problems,
the Daily News has learned. In the county's 80 school districts,
only 260 employees have gone through a program that advises how to
keep portables free of pollutants that can sicken children and
teachers, health officials said. By Terri Hardy. (Will move in the

THOUSANDS GATHER IN BEIJING IN ANGRY PROTEST TO AMERICA
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Thousands of people massed in angry and sometimes
violent protests on the streets surrounding the American Embassy
here Saturday after Chinese learned on the noon news that NATO
bombs had hit their embassy in Belgrade, reportedly killing at
least three Chinese sleeping inside.
</P>
<P>
   University students aided by ordinary Beijingers took part in
large, orderly protests as well as feverish acts of violence,
throwing rocks through the American Embassy windows, pummeling cars
belonging to embassy employees and burning American flags.
</P>
<P>
   It was the largest anti-American demonstration in Beijing since
President Nixon's groundbreaking visit to China in 1972 and the
largest political protest since the student gathering in Tiananmen
Square 10 years ago. The protests in Beijing, and smaller ones
reported in Shanghai and Guangzhou, marked an extraordinary moment
in a controlled country where such demonstrations are illegal, and
almost never occur. At least early in the day, the Beijing
demonstrations clearly had some measure of government approval.
</P>
<P>
   Late Saturday afternoon, the American Embassy ``strongly
protested'' inadequate police protection, after student
demonstrators were allowed to press up against the embassy's
street-side gates and hurl rocks through windows of an office
building still holding 15 to 20 embassy staff members, including
James Sasser, the American ambassador.
</P>
<P>
   Police reinforcements arrived, but late this evening, about
1,000 protesters, some holding candles, burst through an arm-in-arm
cordon of unarmed police that had been created two blocks from the
embassy for protection. Pushing, chanting protesters shouting
``Don't protect the Americans!'' were rebuffed at the corner of the
embassy compound by five rows of armed police, but continued to try
to push past.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we hate America,'' said Ma Zhang Lu, a 20-year-old male
student with shoulder-length dyed hair, who had just hurled a rock
at the embassy. ``China has been especially friendly to the
American people. But we have been rebuffed and now the Americans
have broken international law.''
</P>
<P>
   Virtually all protesters said they thought the bombing was
intentional.
</P>
<P>
   The protests began in the early afternoon when angry Beijingers
started gathering on the tree-lined streets in front of the
embassy. Around 4 p.m., they were joined by thousands of angry,
chanting students, mostly Westernized youths, wearing baseball caps
and Nike sweat pants.
</P>
<P>
   The Beijing students marched in groups of several hundred behind
their university banners carrying hand-painted signs, some in
English, like ``U.S.A. Nazi Killers'' and chanting slogans like
``The blood of Chinese must be repaid.'' Each group paused in front
of the iron gate at the embassy, just 15 feet from the embassy's
front door, to chant, sing patriotic songs and deliver a variety of
petitions.
</P>
<P>
   At first, an officer from the political section came out
solemnly to accept the petitions. But the protests quickly turned
violent, as students from several universities pelted the embassy
with rocks and water bottles. Each broken light and window was
greeted with thunderous cheers.
</P>
<P>
   Although most students returned to their campuses around
nightfall, many remained in the embassy district and by 9 p.m.
raucous students and ordinary Beijingers had regrouped near the
embassy, smashing cars with American Embassy plates, identifiable
by the red character for embassy, followed by the number 224. An
American flag was burned outside Sasser's residence.
</P>
<P>
   Although police presence was heavy, the officers, generally
equipped only with cell phones, at first did little to stop the
rock throwing, even allowing furious crowds to press up ominously
against the gates. As the fever pitch increased, reinforcements
were brought in and made some serious efforts, though often with
little effect. Police stood by as hundreds of protesters burned an
American flag.
</P>
<P>
   In the afternoon march, student organizations from about a dozen
universities arranged for buses, and students said that the Beijing
Municipal government had approved the protest.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign reporters, who are generally shooed away by public
security officers from even minor car accidents, were Saturday
given freedom to interview and photograph protesters. But the anger
was deep and genuine both from the students and the thousands of
Beijingers who apparently gathered spontaneously, many with
children, after they had heard about the protest from friends or on
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a young Chinese I've always felt a very friendly attitude
towards the U.S. and its people,'' said Wang Bin, an interpreter,
who decided in the early afternoon to stand peacefully outside the
embassy in protest. ``But now I feel a deep internal disgust and
anger.''
</P>
<P>
   Chinese public opinion has been violently opposed to the NATO
war over Kosovo since the start of the bombing, in some part
because the government-controlled press did not report on the
Serbian purge of Kosovo Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   But most also agree with their government that Kosovo's internal
ethnic conflicts should not be solved by ``a foreign bully''
wielding bombs. Thanks to the bombing, they now regard Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic as a hero for standing up to NATO and
the Serbs as an oppressed people.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, the quiet head-shaking over the bombing gave way to
violent threats and anti-American outbursts. The American Embassy
warned Americans living in Beijing to increase personal security
and to avoid any student protests.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd always thought that Kosovo should be considered an
internal affair and that NATO shouldn't be there,'' said Guo
Qionghu, a student at the National Minorities University. ``But
today this issue has fallen directly on the heads of the Chinese
people, and that's why our emotions are so aroused.''
</P>
<P>
   The evening television news carried China's official
condemnations of the attack as ``barbarian'' and a ``gross
violation of China's sovereignty'' and featured the students'
demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   The three known Chinese killed in the Belgrade attack were
identified as Shao Yunhuan, a 40-year-old woman and reporter for
the New China News Agency; Xu Xing hu, the resident correspondent
in Belgrade for the newspaper Guangming Daily; and Xu's wife, Zhu
Yin, an employee in the advertising section of the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   In a bitter interview on national television, the chief of the
New China News Agency praised Shao as a ``good comrade and
outstanding reporter.'' The editor of the Guangming Daily said the
dead couple had only been married a year and that Xu's final report
had appeared in Saturday's newspaper.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>

</P>
<P>
   Before being trapped in the embassy compound, Sasser had been
called in to the Chinese Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
   In a country where there is often a huge divide between official
pronouncements and public opinion, China Saturday appeared to react
as one. Even before the protests, a Chinese Internet chat room
about Kosovo that has been popular in recent weeks was deluged with
vituperative messages, including ``Tonight, let's lay siege to the
U.S. Embassy.''
</P>
<P>
   Liberal Chinese who have supported engagement with the United
States called reporters with a deep sense of disbelief and
betrayal, looking for explanations.
</P>
<P>
   The student protest, which appeared highly organized, was at
first mostly nonviolent. Student delegations from China's most
prominent universities _ Beijing University, Qinghua University and
People's University _ marched in lines, waving red flags and
banners, chanting slogans like ``Down with Imperialism'' and
singing patriotic songs.
</P>
<P>
   Some students carried hand-painted signs condemning NATO or the
United States and wore targets like those worn in protest by
civilians in Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd turned violent when the group of 200 students from
Beijing Polytechnic turned onto the road that bisects the two
grassy office compounds of the American Embassy. Piles of rocks and
cement squares lined the sidewalks, which are being re-laid as part
of the campaign to dress up Beijing for the 50th anniversary this
fall.
</P>
<P>
   The building material along the narrow street provided ample
weaponry for the students in the dense crowd, who hurled the rocks
through the windows of the American Embassy's visa office and
administrative building just behind the fence.
</P>
<P>
   The embassy is a hodgepodge of older buildings in three
different sites, all within 15 to 20 feet of the road. The street
that divides the two main office sites, home to Saturday's
protests, has been closed to nonembassy automotive traffic since
the bombings in Africa last summer.
</P>
<P>
   But the diplomatic community has long regarded the compounds as
insecure and a task force empowered to review worldwide security
has regarded the embassy here as one of its top priorities.
</P>
<P>
   Police had clearly been girding since early in the day, when
they closed a nearby popular outdoor market, Silk Alley, where
tourists flock to buy Beanie Babies, Chinese qipao dresses and fake
Prada bags.
</P>
<P>
   But they were certainly unprepared for the outpouring of anger
that gathered throughout the day and into the late evening, when
thousands of angry protesters moved from the American Embassy to
the nearby British Embassy and on to the American ambassador's
house.

   ASSISTED-LIVING (Framingham, Mass.) _ A look at one of the most
dramatic changes in the way the old live, the assisted living
movement. Ten years ago, assisted living facilities, which provide
private apartments plus daily assistance, were barely known. There
was no step between independence and helplessness. Today, some 1.2
million people live in assisted living facilities, and towns across
the country are asking developers to build more so that their aging
residents can stay close to home. By Sarah Rimer.

people of southern Africa, practive Judaic rites and claim that
they were led out of Judea by a man named Buba. Although there is
no Buba in the records of Jewish history, the remarkable thing
about the Lemba tradition is that it may be exactly right. A team
of geneticists has found that many Lemba men carry in their male
chromosome a set of DNA sequences that is distinctive of the

   Spring is the beginning of the baseball season for 750 major
leaguers, but for the scouts who scour the nation trying to locate
the next generation of players, this is their pennant race.
</P>
<P>
   The Mark McGwires and Ken Griffeys of tomorrow are dotted across
America waiting to be picked in the June 2 amateur draft.
Identifying them is the hard part. Picking future superstars is far
trickier in baseball than in football or basketball because the
players are younger (half of them are 18 and under), and even the
most seasoned collegians must spend several years in the minor
leagues learning the esoteric skills of the professional game.
Prospects turn to suspects with alarming frequency.
</P>
<P>
   Many of today's major league standouts were tabbed for stardom
in high school and college. Others overcame the scouts' doubts.
Following are excerpts from scouting reports filed on players while
they were unknown amateurs.
</P>
<P>
   _ By ALAN SCHWARZ
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) Ken Griffey Jr. had been the talk of
Cincinnati's Moeller High School for two years when Roger
Jongewaard, the Seattle Mariners' scouting director, watched him
play in 1987. The Mariners held the No. 1 pick in the draft and
Jongewaard had to persuade his bosses that Griffey, a raw
17-year-old senior, was more attractive than a polished college
pitcher who could help the team more quickly. He did so in part
with this report, which rated Griffey a 72 on baseball's standard
20-to-80 scouting scale:(END ITALICS HERE)
</P>

play. Doesn't utilize outstanding natural ability all of the time.
...
</P>
<P>
   Similar style but much better than Barry Bonds at same stage.
Superstar potential.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) Greg Maddux, an uninspiring 5 feet 10 and
155 pounds as a senior at Valley High in Las Vegas, had been rated
by many organizations as a fourth- or fifth-round pick for the 1984
draft. One Chicago Cubs scout wrote that he ``lacks overall control
on all pitches,'' which seems unfathomable today considering that
Maddux, now an Atlanta Brave, controls his pitches like a
marionette. Doug Mapson, another Cubs scout, convinced the Cubs to
gamble on Maddux in the second round:(END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   I really believe that this boy would possibly be the No. 1
player taken in the country if only he looked a bit more physical.
He throws 86-89 [m.p.h.) consistently with very good movement.
</P>
<P>
   His movement isn't a gradual tailing type but a quick explosive
bat-breaking kink. He has a big league curveball right now although
he needs to be a little more consistent with it.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)Randy Johnson was an enigma to scouts who
watched the left-hander pitch at Livermore High School in
California in 1982. Already 6-foot-10 but just 185 pounds, the
future fireballer threw 92 mph yet was all arms and legs with
little control of his body, much less his pitches. Joe McIlvaine,
the New York Mets' scouting director, watched Johnson, now with the
Arizona Diamondbacks, and came away intrigued but hardly
raving:(END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Timid due to awkwardness and plenty of room to fill out. ...
</P>
<P>
   No concept yet, just a thrower. Johnson is like a box of Cracker
Jacks, there's a surprise inside. Our only problem is whether or
not we will like the surprise. He's a boom or bust. Long way to go
yet. Has no pitching mechanics. ...
</P>
<P>
   With his long arms could eventually bury all left-handed
hitters. A real gamble.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)It's hard to find anyone who thought Mark
McGwire was a gamble coming out of the University of Southern
California in 1984. The current St. Louis Cardinals home run king
led major colleges with 32 homers and left scouts drooling. One was
Chuck McMichael of the Kansas City Royals, who after filing this
report watched helplessly while the Oakland A's grabbed McGwire at
No. 10:(END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Very large frame, very strong. ... Consistent average to
above-average bat speed. Dominant top hand. ...
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally takes some pretty good-looking fastballs; may be
guessing a little much. Long swing, contact ability may drop the
further he goes. Breaking pitch away hurts him. ... Chance to hit
40 HR's + .275 for me.

<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) The Yankees took Jeter at No. 6,

</P>
<P>
   Slender, agile body with long arms and legs. Large feet. . . .
Outstanding infield instincts. Soft hands and strong, accurate arm.
Bat has quickness. . . . Makes contact with gap power. Will hit
occasional long ball. Comes to play.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)Because the Cubs slugger Sammy Sosa grew up
in the Dominican Republic, he wasn't subject to the draft and could
be signed by any organization when he turned 16 years old. Omar
Minaya, a Texas Rangers scout, signed him in 1985 for just $3,500
and one year later worked with him in the rookie-level Gulf Coast
League. His report foresaw deficiencies Sosa would retain until
last year's 66-home run barrage made him the National League's Most
Valuable Player:(END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Strong arm, above-average power potential, plays very hard and
aggressively, ball jumps off bat. ... Swings at anything and flies
open, does not have a strike zone. ... Discipline at plate must be
stressed. ...

<P>
   Samuel is a kid that possesses a lot of potential. He is very
aggressive and wishes to play in the major leagues very badly. ...
Most people love his personality and he is a pleasure to watch
playing.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)Alex Rodriguez of Miami's Westminster
Christian Academy was so advanced in 1993 that scouts judged his
potential as a celebrity as well as a ballplayer. Jongewaard, who
later drafted Rodriguez as the Mariners' top overall pick just as
he had with Griffey six years before, said he was ``better at 17
now than all the superstars in baseball were when they were seniors
in HS.'' A Braves scout, Scott Littlefield, went further:(END
ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Juan Gonzalez-type body w/o as broad of shoulders. ... Can
field, throw, hit, hit for power, and steal an occasional base.
Pluses across the board. Outstanding kid who loves to play and is
handling all of the attention w/ no problem. Outstanding! Dominate
player! ... Should be a franchise player and play in many all-star
games.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)Not every future all-star received such
accolades. When McIlvaine saw the future Cy Young Award winner Orel
Hershiser get bombed as a Bowling Green University junior on a cold
and rainy afternoon in 1979, the scout wrote off one of the best
clutch pitchers of this generation:(END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   No command or control. Fastball lacking velocity for big man.
Doesn't throw curveball properly but has possibilities. Didn't like
arm action as he labors through the throwing zone. ... Delivery
inconsistent, threw several wild pitches. Looks like he rattles
easily. Questionable makeup with physical question marks in a
21-year-old leaves me with an empty feeling about him.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)Hershiser's future manager in Los Angeles,
Tommy Lasorda, was scouting for the Dodgers in 1965 when he watched
a 20-year-old right-hander pitch for Southern Cal. Lasorda's report
on Tom Seaver now resides in Cooperstown among those for several
other Hall of Famers:(END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   This boy showed a real good fast ball with good life, has real
good command of point of release. Boy has slider type of curve but
could improve as he has good arm action and should be able to come
up with good curve. Boy has plenty of desire to pitch and wants to
beat you.

ISRAEL: A LAND OF TRIBES, AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Week in Review)  
 (NOTE TO INTERNATIONAL CLIENTS: For international clients' use by

Horwitz in Paris for details and prices (Phone: 47 42 17 11; FAX:

 By JOEL GREENBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ In the nightly avalanche of television ads
punctuating the Israeli election campaign, a commercial by a small
Russian immigrant party stands out.
</P>
<P>
   It is only in Russian. No Hebrew narration, no Hebrew subtitles;
a message solely for the ears of immigrants from the former Soviet
Union.
</P>
<P>
   The unabashedly narrow appeal was a startling example of
divisions that increasingly define Israeli society. Candidates
tailor their messages to specific groups, fighting for the
sympathies of ethnic voting blocs by promising to promote their
particular agendas.
</P>
<P>
   Ehud Barak, the Labor Party candidate for prime minister,
features unemployed working-class Sephardic Jews in television ads
that lambaste Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's economic
performance. Netanyahu accuses Labor of elitism, charging that the
party ``doesn't represent the people: not the Sephardic Jews, not
the Russian immigrants, not the ultra-Orthodox, not the Jewish
settlers.''
</P>
<P>
   Such depictions of Israeli society as an aggregation of groups,
not individuals, reflect a hardening of social divisions in recent
years. More than ever, Israelis view each other as members of
ideological, religious or ethnic sub-units, rather than as one
society with shared values.
</P>
<P>
   The vanishing of the notion of an Israeli melting pot, once
expected to forge a new secular Zionist man and woman, has
paralleled the growing ethnic assertiveness of various groups in
the United States, where many now focus on maintaining group
identity rather than on integration into the American mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   The social gaps in Israel have geographical expression. Many
religious Zionists, following the pattern of ultra-Orthodox Jews,
are increasingly living in separate neighborhoods and communities.
Newcomers from Russia settle in what have become immigrant quarters
of some Israeli cities, shopping in their own stores and reading
their own Russian-language press; many Sephardic Jews remain in
depressed ``development towns'' and in low-income housing projects.
</P>
<P>
   The tribal trend is graphically evident among those Jews who are
religious enough to wear a yarmulke (kippah in Hebrew) at all
times. For these men, the size and color of the kippah can be an
indicator of their religious and political bent. A black velvet
kippah is typical of the followers of the ultra-Orthodox Sephardic
party Shas. A knitted kippah often means the wearer is a religious
nationalist, perhaps a Jewish settler. And the larger the kippah,
the more religious or nationalist the wearer is likely to be.
</P>
<P>
   Ethnic, religious and political differences increasingly
overlap, reinforcing the divisions.
</P>
<P>
   Most religious Israelis, especially the ultra-Orthodox, have
aligned themselves firmly with the political right in recent years,
putting them at odds with liberal, secular Israelis not only over
questions of religion and state but also over ceding land for peace
with the Arabs.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, one of the most prominent social and political
splits in Israel has been between Ashkenazic Jews _ those whose
origins are in Central and Eastern Europe _ and Sephardic Jews, who
are of Middle Eastern and North African origin. Now ethnic and
religious tension appears to be building between the new Russian
immigrants and the Sephardim.
</P>
<P>
   Culturally apart, the two groups are also divided along
religious lines, with the Russians avowedly secular and the
Sephardim more traditionally observant.
</P>
<P>
   The fissure has opened wide in the current campaign. Yisrael
B'Aliyah, a party of Russian immigrants headed by Natan Sharansky,
is publicly wrangling with Shas over control of the powerful
Interior Ministry, which has long been a preserve of Shas. The
ministry registers immigrants as Jews and grants them Israeli
citizenship, and it has questioned the Jewish credentials of many
arrivals from the former Soviet Union, blocking their marriage or
burial as Jews, and even deporting some.
</P>
<P>
   With the May 17 elections rapidly approaching, the splintering
of Israeli society has produced a cacophony of campaign messages by
32 different parties competing for seats in the parliament. A
multiplicity of voices is sometimes a sign of a healthy democracy,
but that is not the way the babble is being interpreted here.
Rather, commentators and analysts are struck by the tensions that
they hear expressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only are there many groups, but there are fewer points of
connection between them and there is less of a chance for
dialogue,'' said Dr. Asher Cohen of Bar-Ilan University. ``In past
decades there were areas of agreement that moderated the debate.
Now the divisions overlap.''''
</P>
<P>
   Hannah Kim, a columnist for the newspaper Haaretz, said
recently: ``In recent years we have been straddling the seam
between multi-cultural pluralism and factionalism. Pluralism is
enlightened, positive, democratic. Factionalism means the absence
of a common bond uniting the whole society.''
</P>
<P>
   Israel's founders envisioned a state that would unify immigrants
from far-flung Jewish communities in a liberal Western-style
democracy. Instead, the proliferation of entrenched ideological,
ethnic and religious factions seems to be closing many Israelis to
the kind of open discourse in which their groups could integrate,
and this reinforces their sense of isolation.
</P>
<P>
   A stark example is the cocoonlike environment created by Shas,
which is a broad social movement as well as a party, and whose
followers include many traditional working-class Sephardic Jews who
are not Orthodox. Guided by an ideology that scorns Western
culture, the movement has its own newspaper and television
broadcasts, and runs schools and youth programs that teach only
religious subjects.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shas is against broad education and sees it as an enemy, so it
is entrenching the poor in their poverty, not advancing them,''
said Ms. Kim.
</P>
<P>
   Although it seeks to promote the ethnic pride of Jews from the
Middle East and North Africa and has become a powerful political
force, Shas has done little to break barriers to social mobility
that have left many Sephardic Jews living in economically depressed
communities with poor schools. And while Sephardic Israelis have
reached the highest levels of government and the army, they are
still under-represented in universities and the halls of economic
power.
</P>
<P>
   Their resentment, along with the restiveness of the Russian
immigrants, are persistent themes of the Israeli election campaign,
which has at times descended to name-calling and ethnic slurs. When
the dust settles after May 17, Israelis will have to confront the
scars left by the campaign and it will be a challenge to show that
they can still talk to each other.

 By JOEL GREENBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ In the nightly avalanche of television ads
punctuating the Israeli election campaign, a commercial by a small
Russian immigrant party stands out.
</P>
<P>
   It is only in Russian. No Hebrew narration, no Hebrew subtitles;
a message solely for the ears of immigrants from the former Soviet
Union.
</P>
<P>
   The unabashedly narrow appeal was a startling example of
divisions that increasingly define Israeli society. Candidates
tailor their messages to specific groups, fighting for the
sympathies of ethnic voting blocs by promising to promote their
particular agendas.
</P>
<P>
   Ehud Barak, the Labor Party candidate for prime minister,
features unemployed working-class Sephardic Jews in television ads
that lambaste Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's economic
performance. Netanyahu accuses Labor of elitism, charging that the
party ``doesn't represent the people: not the Sephardic Jews, not
the Russian immigrants, not the ultra-Orthodox, not the Jewish
settlers.''
</P>
<P>
   Such depictions of Israeli society as an aggregation of groups,
not individuals, reflect a hardening of social divisions in recent
years. More than ever, Israelis view each other as members of
ideological, religious or ethnic sub-units, rather than as one
society with shared values.
</P>
<P>
   The vanishing of the notion of an Israeli melting pot, once
expected to forge a new secular Zionist man and woman, has
paralleled the growing ethnic assertiveness of various groups in
the United States, where many now focus on maintaining group
identity rather than on integration into the American mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   The social gaps in Israel have geographical expression. Many
religious Zionists, following the pattern of ultra-Orthodox Jews,
are increasingly living in separate neighborhoods and communities.
Newcomers from Russia settle in what have become immigrant quarters
of some Israeli cities, shopping in their own stores and reading
their own Russian-language press; many Sephardic Jews remain in
depressed ``development towns'' and in low-income housing projects.
</P>
<P>
   The tribal trend is graphically evident among those Jews who are
religious enough to wear a yarmulke (kippah in Hebrew) at all
times. For these men, the size and color of the kippah can be an
indicator of their religious and political bent. A black velvet
kippah is typical of the followers of the ultra-Orthodox Sephardic
party Shas. A knitted kippah often means the wearer is a religious
nationalist, perhaps a Jewish settler. And the larger the kippah,
the more religious or nationalist the wearer is likely to be.
</P>
<P>
   Ethnic, religious and political differences increasingly
overlap, reinforcing the divisions.
</P>
<P>
   Most religious Israelis, especially the ultra-Orthodox, have
aligned themselves firmly with the political right in recent years,
putting them at odds with liberal, secular Israelis not only over
questions of religion and state but also over ceding land for peace
with the Arabs.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, one of the most prominent social and political
splits in Israel has been between Ashkenazic Jews _ those whose
origins are in Central and Eastern Europe _ and Sephardic Jews, who
are of Middle Eastern and North African origin. Now ethnic and
religious tension appears to be building between the new Russian
immigrants and the Sephardim.
</P>
<P>
   Culturally apart, the two groups are also divided along
religious lines, with the Russians avowedly secular and the
Sephardim more traditionally observant.
</P>
<P>
   The fissure has opened wide in the current campaign. Yisrael
B'Aliyah, a party of Russian immigrants headed by Natan Sharansky,
is publicly wrangling with Shas over control of the powerful
Interior Ministry, which has long been a preserve of Shas. The
ministry registers immigrants as Jews and grants them Israeli
citizenship, and it has questioned the Jewish credentials of many
arrivals from the former Soviet Union, blocking their marriage or
burial as Jews, and even deporting some.
</P>
<P>
   With the May 17 elections rapidly approaching, the splintering
of Israeli society has produced a cacophony of campaign messages by
32 different parties competing for seats in the parliament. A
multiplicity of voices is sometimes a sign of a healthy democracy,
but that is not the way the babble is being interpreted here.
Rather, commentators and analysts are struck by the tensions that
they hear expressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only are there many groups, but there are fewer points of
connection between them and there is less of a chance for
dialogue,'' said Dr. Asher Cohen of Bar-Ilan University. ``In past
decades there were areas of agreement that moderated the debate.
Now the divisions overlap.''''
</P>
<P>
   Hannah Kim, a columnist for the newspaper Haaretz, said
recently: ``In recent years we have been straddling the seam
between multi-cultural pluralism and factionalism. Pluralism is
enlightened, positive, democratic. Factionalism means the absence
of a common bond uniting the whole society.''

<P>
   Mount Everest, a brutal tower of subzero temperatures, sudden
blizzards and the thinnest air, gives up its dead grudgingly. On
May 1, the remains of the legendary George Leigh Mallory were
identified by an American expedition retracing his route 75 years
later.
</P>
<P>
   It had been Mallory who answered the question, ``Why climb
Everest?'' with the deathless, ``Because it is there.'' Mallory, a
38-year-old British schoolteacher, and Andrew Irvine, a 28-year-old
Cambridge student, disappeared on the northern slope in 1924,
leaving behind a mystery that endures to this day. Did they reach
the summit?
</P>
<P>
   A pair of snow goggles, a hob-nail boot and a length of climbing
rope were found with Mallory. And though the mountaineers of the
1920s also struggled with supplies and oxygen tanks, which were
thought to be unsporting, the content of their load differed from
that of the first successful 1953 ascent by Sir Edmund Hillary and
Tenzing Norgay. The equipment for the 1999 Mallory and Irvine
Research expedition weighed 3.5 tons, excluding more than 1,500
pounds of oxygen, according to Erin Copland of International
Mountain Guides.
</P>
<P>
   Today the assault on the world's highest peak is no longer the
lofty realm of explorers but a highly commercialized enterprise
managed by professional guides, including generations of Sherpas.
For $65,000 and more, relatively inexperienced mountain climbers
can join expeditions that take with them satellite tracking
systems, computers, cellular phones, Krazy glue, espresso machines,
M&AMP;Ms and Pop Tarts, and they leave behind so much detritus that
Nepal and China charge them princely sums for what may seem to be a
license to litter. So far some 600 people have reached the summit;
more than 150 have perished in the attempt.
</P>
<P>
   For those who just want an experience that does not put them in
mortal peril, MountainZone.com, an Internet sporting retailer,
maintains a Web site (www.everest.mountainzone.com) that provides
updated dispatches from the members of the current Everest
expedition while displaying souvenir merchandise like fleece vests
and prayer flags.
</P>
<P>
   Although advancements in mountain-climbing gear have made the
trip lighter over the century, teams now carry more and store their
supplies in camps strung out along the route to the
29,028-foot-high summit.
</P>
<P>
   For those still wistfully upwardly mobile, a sobering breakdown
follows of the equipment that separates the real (overwhelmingly
male) explorers of yesteryear from the antacid-eating, CD-playing
expeditioners of today.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
   The U.S. military-literary-industrial complex is gathering might
with the surprising success of new books that portray modern
warriors as complicated heroes who confront enemies and their own
mistakes with a mixture of courage and fear.
</P>
<P>
   Two nonfiction titles with these themes have climbed onto The
New York Times best-seller list recently despite having been
rejected by top publishers because of doubts about sales prospects
and potential readership.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blind Man's Bluff,'' which recounts the exploits of Navy
submariners who spied on the Soviet Union's harbors, was canceled
by its original publisher, Simon &AMP; Schuster, which had misgivings
about the potential for a book with a Cold War theme. ``Black Hawk
Down,'' a gritty account of the 1993 battle in Mogadishu, Somalia,
that left 18 U.S. soldiers and more than 500 Somalis dead, was also
rejected by large publishers.
</P>
<P>
   Both of these unlikely best-sellers were written by authors with
no military background who offered a sympathetic view of the
20th-century warrior and had a knack for tapping them as readers.
``Blind Man's Bluff,'' by Sherry Sontag and Christopher Drew, a
reporter for The New York Times, was eventually sold to a small
publisher, Public Affairs, while ``Black Hawk Down,'' by Mark
Bowden, landed with Grove/Atlantic, an independent publisher that
paid an advance of only $35,000.
</P>
<P>
   Other current nonfiction titles with military themes include
``Immaculate Invasion'' (Viking), by the novelist Bob Shacochis,
who spent 18 months with a team of Special Forces commandos during
the 1994 U.S. intervention in Haiti, and ``Rogue Warrior: The Real
Team'' (Pocket), an account of Navy Seal missions written by
Richard Marcinko, a retired Navy commander.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the ground for this wave of true-life military tales was
already claimed by best-selling authors like Stephen E. Ambrose,
with his histories of World War II, and Tom Clancy, the
techno-thriller pioneer. But there appear to be several forces
propelling the latest surge in military titles. For one thing,
authors are racing to record the stories of aging World War II
veterans. Elizabeth M. Norman, author of ``We Band of Angels''
(Random House), scrambled to track down elderly women to interview
for her account of American nurses imprisoned by the Japanese in
the Philippines after the attack on Pearl Harbor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew little about our parents' war,'' Ms. Norman said. ``In
middle age, we looked at the current state of our culture and began
to appreciate the enormous obstacles and challenges our parents had
to overcome to wage and win a world war. We also faced the reality
that our parents are old and dying and if we are to extract any
lessons, any details of their experience, we have to do it now.''
</P>
<P>
   Writers are also finding inspiration in the military's
contemporary internal debate about the role of the modern soldier
in regional conflicts _ warrior, humanitarian or a mixture of both?
Unlike much of the literature that emerged after the Vietnam War,
the current books seem to portray soldiers as thoughtful and
conflicted professionals carrying out shifting U.S. policy goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the post-Cold War environment, the military is a bit
confused and doesn't know who it is and is aggressively sorting
that out,'' said Shacochis, whose book explores the ambiguous role
played by U.S. troops in restoring Haiti's first democratically
elected leader to power after he was ousted in a coup.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the Special Forces don't want to do humanitarian
stuff because they signed up for the adventure,'' Shacochis said.
``The idea of baby-sitting Kosovars or Kurds is rather diminishing
to their self-image. So the military is wrangling with this in a
rather fascinating way and they are reinventing themselves. They
understand that the wars of the future are now in places like
Somalia, Iraq, Haiti and Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   The military, in turn, seems fascinated by books that interpret
its role and legacy. As a result, writers who have never worn a

<P>
   After the release of ``Blind Man's Bluff,'' Ms. Sontag and Drew
embarked on an unorthodox stealth book tour to reach the wide
network of military veterans and retirees who might be potential
readers. Ms. Sontag said she collected about 5,000 e-mail addresses
from Web sites devoted to military groups. She then sent letters
announcing the book's publication and asked the recipients to send
the notes to others.
</P>
<P>
   That strategy helped lift ``Blind Man's Bluff'' onto the Times'
best-seller list for 21 weeks, capturing the attention of readers
like George Knudtzon, a retired submarine veteran. When Knudtzon
was told by his Barnes &AMP; Noble in Silverdale, Md., that there
wasn't enough interest in a book like ``Blind Man's Bluff'' to
schedule an author lecture, he rented the local community center,
enlisted his wife and daughter to bake cookies and held an event
featuring Ms. Sontag that he said drew almost 200 people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I gave copies to all four of my kids and to other folks that
I've known throughout my life,'' said Knudtzon, 62. ``And I
included a note saying that this is something I was involved with
that I couldn't talk about. This is why I wasn't home most of the
time when you were growing up.''

<P>
   The U.S. military-literary-industrial complex is gathering might
with the surprising success of new books that portray modern
warriors as complicated heroes who confront enemies and their own
mistakes with a mixture of courage and fear.
</P>
<P>
   Two nonfiction titles with these themes have climbed onto The
New York Times best-seller list recently despite having been
rejected by top publishers because of doubts about sales prospects
and potential readership.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blind Man's Bluff,'' which recounts the exploits of Navy
submariners who spied on the Soviet Union's harbors, was canceled
by its original publisher, Simon &AMP; Schuster, which had misgivings
about the potential for a book with a Cold War theme. ``Black Hawk
Down,'' a gritty account of the 1993 battle in Mogadishu, Somalia,
that left 18 U.S. soldiers and more than 500 Somalis dead, was also
rejected by large publishers.
</P>
<P>
   Both of these unlikely best-sellers were written by authors with
no military background who offered a sympathetic view of the
20th-century warrior and had a knack for tapping them as readers.
``Blind Man's Bluff,'' by Sherry Sontag and Christopher Drew, a
reporter for The New York Times, was eventually sold to a small
publisher, Public Affairs, while ``Black Hawk Down,'' by Mark
Bowden, landed with Grove/Atlantic, an independent publisher that
paid an advance of only $35,000.
</P>
<P>
   Other current nonfiction titles with military themes include
``Immaculate Invasion'' (Viking), by the novelist Bob Shacochis,
who spent 18 months with a team of Special Forces commandos during
the 1994 U.S. intervention in Haiti, and ``Rogue Warrior: The Real
Team'' (Pocket), an account of Navy Seal missions written by
Richard Marcinko, a retired Navy commander.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the ground for this wave of true-life military tales was
already claimed by best-selling authors like Stephen E. Ambrose,
with his histories of World War II, and Tom Clancy, the
techno-thriller pioneer. But there appear to be several forces
propelling the latest surge in military titles. For one thing,
authors are racing to record the stories of aging World War II
veterans. Elizabeth M. Norman, author of ``We Band of Angels''
(Random House), scrambled to track down elderly women to interview
for her account of American nurses imprisoned by the Japanese in
the Philippines after the attack on Pearl Harbor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew little about our parents' war,'' Ms. Norman said. ``In
middle age, we looked at the current state of our culture and began
to appreciate the enormous obstacles and challenges our parents had
to overcome to wage and win a world war. We also faced the reality
that our parents are old and dying and if we are to extract any
lessons, any details of their experience, we have to do it now.''
</P>
<P>
   Writers are also finding inspiration in the military's
contemporary internal debate about the role of the modern soldier
in regional conflicts _ warrior, humanitarian or a mixture of both?
Unlike much of the literature that emerged after the Vietnam War,
the current books seem to portray soldiers as thoughtful and
conflicted professionals carrying out shifting U.S. policy goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the post-Cold War environment, the military is a bit
confused and doesn't know who it is and is aggressively sorting
that out,'' said Shacochis, whose book explores the ambiguous role
played by U.S. troops in restoring Haiti's first democratically
elected leader to power after he was ousted in a coup.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the Special Forces don't want to do humanitarian
stuff because they signed up for the adventure,'' Shacochis said.
``The idea of baby-sitting Kosovars or Kurds is rather diminishing
to their self-image. So the military is wrangling with this in a
rather fascinating way and they are reinventing themselves. They
understand that the wars of the future are now in places like
Somalia, Iraq, Haiti and Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   The military, in turn, seems fascinated by books that interpret
its role and legacy. As a result, writers who have never worn a
uniform are being feted by Navy submariners, invited to sign
autographs at the PX or asked to lecture to the CIA.
</P>

<P>
   KAPUTA, Zambia _ There are no oranges at the refugee camp here,
no canned fish or meat, no press-packed visits from the British
Prime Minister, Tony Blair.
</P>
<P>
   International aid officials say all refugees are treated
equally, but there is no doubt that the world's attention is on the
hundreds of thousands of people displaced in the Balkans, and
refugees and aid workers in Africa worry that attention to the
plight of refugees here may fade even further.
</P>
<P>
   Africa is the continent with the largest number of refugees, and
it counts 30,000 more since March as Congolese fled fighting at
home and swarmed into this corner of Zambia.
</P>
<P>
   Already, the head of the U.N. refugee agency in Africa,
Albert-Alain Peters, has worried publicly that it may be hard to
pay for refugee programs here as the crisis in Kosovo wears on. It
is a concern heard around Africa, he said, including at a recent
meeting about the refugees in Zambia with the nation's president,
Frederick J.T. Chiluba.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the very first thing he said to me,'' Peters said in
an interview. ``I told him of course we are doing our best. But
indeed we have every reason to be worried as to what our financial
situation will be next month or the month after.'' He added: ``I
can understand why Europeans are so concerned about what is
happening at their doorstep. Africa is so far away. They can do it
out of charity. But charity has limits.''
</P>
<P>
   While there is some degree of institutional positioning in
Peters' remarks, U.N. relief efforts for refugees in Africa only
have between one-half and two-thirds of the money needed for this
year. One concern is that the Western nations that donate most of
the money to relief efforts may be tapped out as the year goes on,
depending on how expensive the operation in Kosovo ultimately
becomes or if a crisis develops elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Other officials say the concern is misplaced, that the so-called
``donor nations'' tend to respond to emergencies regardless of how
much they have spent, in part for reasons that have little to do
with humanitarianism: influxes of refugees can make a region
unstable and thus more expensive down the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``Funding is continuing to come in,'' said Jean-Jacques Graisse,
assistant executive director for the U.N. World Food Program. ``Be
it in Africa or Asia, we are still getting good strong support for
other emergencies around the world.''
</P>
<P>
   But Graisse and other officials of aid groups concede that there
is a large degree of what has become known as ``donor fatigue,''
caused by the sense that Africa's problems seem endless. There are
now about 7.3 million people being assisted by the U.N. human
rights agency in Africa, which includes people who have fled their
countries, people displaced inside their countries or those who
have recently returned home.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, that number was 4.6 million. Five years later, after
some 2.2 million people were displaced following the genocide in
Rwanda, the number rose to 11.8 million. Today, 6 of the 10 nations
that produce the most refugees are in Africa: Angola, Burundi,
Eritrea, Sierra Leone, Somalia and Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   Here in the remote northeast of Zambia _ it is a two-day drive
from the capital of Lusaka _ refugees from the continuing war in
Congo began trudging across the border in early March. Some were so
hungry they dug up cassava fields, leaving Congolese francs as
payment in the dirt. For a while, as many as 600 people were
crossing a day, quickly swamping this town of 3,000 people and
scaring them too.
</P>
<P>
   Some 2,500 soldiers loyal to President Laurent Kabila came with
the refugees, who are fleeing from the rebels. Then for several
days, rebel soldiers stood at the border, less than 10 miles away,
making it clear that they disapproved of a camp so full of people
in favor of Kabila so close to Congo.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was quite bad,'' said Ben Sichilimat, the mayor of Kaputa.
``My people got worried. They didn't know what to expect.''
</P>
<P>
   The refugees here have been wandering, alone or in groups, since
as early as August, when the rebellion broke out in eastern Congo.
</P>
<P>
   Manku Kibole, 27, fled with his wife and two children in
November from the town of Moba, on the shores of Lake Tanganyika,
more than 100 miles away. They had a third child, a boy now 3
months old, on the trip here.
</P>
<P>
   The wife of Francios Masele, a fisherman, drowned as she and
hundreds of others tried to flee by barge from Kalemie to Moba to
escape fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Cornier Bayongwo, 34, left in August from Bukavu, some 400 miles
to the north, after four members of his family were killed by the
rebels, including his 9-year-old daughter and his father.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am empty-handed,'' he said. ``Without anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Relief officials, including from the United Nations, the World
Food Program and Doctors Without Borders, quickly set up a camp,
distributing food, plastic sheeting and treated water in difficult
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   But the refugees have been full of complaints, saying their
living conditions are terrible. Beds in the cholera clinic have no
mattresses; a sick, 4-year-old girl, Kimpinde Manda, was lying on
the bare steel frame the other day. They say that they are given
peas _ precooked and donated by Denmark _ which are not part of
their regular diet so they do not eat them. Some people say they
are living in the open because of shortages of plastic sheeting.
</P>
<P>
   The complaints might not resonate as much were it not for the
crisis in Kosovo, with images of people fleeing for their lives
and, to people here, being taken into the arms of the international
community in a different way. Some refugees there have been allowed
satellite phone calls to relatives and are fed canned foods, which
in Africa seem like luxuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't eat these peas,'' said Mulinda Bisoga, a 24-year-old
farmer who fled Moba last November. ``Do they eat them in Kosovo?''
</P>
<P>
   U.N. officials are sensitive to assertions that they treat
European refugees different from African ones. On its face, it
would seem that more money is pouring into Kosovo. The United
Nations says it is spending about $1.23 per person in Kosovo for
three months, assuming a total of 950,000 refugees, whereas the
amount spent in Africa is 11 cents per person.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But officials say it is hard to compare because the Kosovo
operation has large start-up costs. They say, some African
operations have cost nearly as much. World Food Program officials
say the caloric content of what they distribute is the same in both
places, that canned food is only being given temporarily and that
much of the better food is being given by groups other than the
United Nations. The peas, said Bai Bojang, the agency's deputy
director in Zambia, are only being distributed until beans can be
shipped in.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few weeks, the number of people coming across the
border has tapered off, and the relief officials are moving the
refugees to a more permanent camp 250 miles south. But officials
are bracing for another wave of refugees if the fighting
intensifies in southern Congo, a likelihood now that the rainy
season is over.
</P>
<P>
   People here, though, are hoping the fighting will end and they
can go home. ``To say things are good or bad would be lying,'' said
Kyondwa Mwindi, a 38 year-old school teacher who was huddled around
a fire with her six children. ``Nobody likes being a refugee.''

ITALIAN SKIPPER OUTLASTS THE COMPETITION IN AROUND ALONE RACE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Italy, Australia, S.C.)   By BARBARA LLOYD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The slapping sound of slack sails and a fluttering rig tend to
jangle the nerves of the most fervent yachtsman. Add to that the
tension of being within 100 miles of setting a record in a
round-the-world race, and you have Giovanni Soldini, the solo
sailor from Italy.
</P>
<P>
   It was like that for days last week _ just a whisper of a breeze
_ as Soldini struggled to make landfall in Charleston, S.C. But
then, late Friday, the wind came up. Soldini's 60-foot sailboat,
Fila, reared up like a stallion at a gate. Taking off at a brisk 16
knots, the lone sailor's wide, white racing yacht crossed the
finish line in the Around Alone competition at 1:32 a.m. Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was really, really hard, no wind,'' Soldini said Saturday
afternoon about his arrival. ``The miles were not so many, but the
time I needed to reach Charleston was getting bigger and bigger. I
was really happy, and I was surprised to see so many people and so
many boats out at 2 o'clock in the morning.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only had the 32-year-old Soldini won the fourth and final
leg of the 27,000-mile event, he also was first overall, beating
the Around Alone record by more than four days. It was a first for
an Italian solo sailor, a performance that toppled the 120-day
record set in the 1990-91 race _ known then as the BOC Challenge _
by Christophe Auguin.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, Soldini was hailed as a hero who had saved a life.
At the dock at City Marina in the early-morning darkness, a crowd
waited to greet the ebullient Italian. Among the onlookers was
Adolfo Soldini, the sailor's father. The father knew about being
becalmed in a sailboat. It was he who taught Giovanni to sail as a
youngster along the shores of the Mediterranean Sea. But now his
son has gone where his father never dreamed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gio told me that solo sailing is the cheapest way to navigate
the oceans,'' Adolfo Soldini said in a telephone interview from
Charleston on Friday. ``He said you don't need a crew, and you
don't need much else. I envy him.''
</P>
<P>
   It was last Sept. 26 from Charleston that the Around Alone
competition first began to unwind for 16 solo sailors. It was to
become a mental ride of hardship, boredom, elation and terror. But
in the end, it was Soldini who prevailed among the nine competitors
still left.
</P>
<P>
   During the third leg, on Feb. 16, Soldini rescued Isabelle
Autissier of France, a rival in the race. After a lonely and
dangerous search across remote waters of the South Pacific Ocean,
Soldini found Autissier crouched in an overturned sailboat hull
awash with water.
</P>
<P>
   Adolfo Soldini remembers the frightening episode with a touch of
humor now. His son, frustrated at not being able to rouse Autissier
that night by shouting, tossed a hammer at the boat's hull. The
bang let Autissier know help had arrived.
</P>
<P>
   But the hammer was not Soldini's first choice of a calling card.
Earlier that evening, the younger Soldini had sent an e-mail
message to his father in Italy, asking Adolfo if he remembered
where the son's hand-operated siren had been stowed on board Fila.
Giovanni knew that he might need it later that night. Where was the
siren?
</P>
<P>
   ``I was with one of Gio's crew, and we didn't know,'' Adolfo
said. ``Other crew had different ideas _ maybe under the bunk, or
in a boat locker. Then I remembered that they had thrown it away
before Gio left. But it was too late. He had already found the
hammer _ and Isabelle _ before I could tell him.''
</P>
<P>
   Adolfo watches his son's exploits with fascination and pride. In
the 1994-95 BOC Challenge, Giovanni made his global racing debut
and placed a close second to David Adams of Australia. The pair
engaged in a furious race to the finish in Class II, a division for
the competition's smaller 50-foot boats.
</P>
<P>
   In the current race, Soldini came back with a new and innovative
60-footer. The boat faced a highly competitive French contingent.
Among them was Autissier, overall leader before her mishap, and
Marc Thiercelin, a potential winner until his yacht's mast broke
near the rounding of South America at Cape Horn.
</P>
<P>
   Soldini, despondent after coming in fifth in the 6,884-mile
first leg from Charleston to Cape Town, upped his personal pressure
gauge. By Auckland, New Zealand, the race's second stopover, he had
finished a triumphant first. Even with the rescue of Autissier, he
was given a time allowance and managed to win the third leg. Then,
he gained an even stronger foothold on first when two British
rivals, Josh Hall and Mike Golding, were halted by gear breakdowns.
</P>
<P>
   The fearless solo racer, rescuer of others in distress, was not
always Soldini's profile. His father cheerfully reveals how his son
once hid under deck cushions during a particularly nasty storm on
the Mediterranean.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was not so courageous when he was 8 or 9,'' Adolfo said.

MANY RESEARCHERS SAY LINK IS ALREADY CLEAR ON MEDIA AND YOUTH
VIOLENCE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Colo., Ill., Mich., Minn., Wis.)  (rk) 
 By LAWRIE MIFFLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In response to the Colorado school shooting, President Clinton
is to meet with entertainment industry executives and others at the
White House on Monday to discuss youth violence. And on Capitol
Hill, Congress is considering a bill that would require the surgeon
general to conduct a comprehensive study of the effects of media
violence on American youths.
</P>
<P>
   But most academic researchers say they believe that the evidence
is already at the president's and the surgeon general's fingertips.
Hundreds of studies done at the nation's top universities in the
last three decades have come to the same conclusion: that there is
at least some demonstrable link between watching violent acts in
movies or television shows and acting aggressively in life.
</P>
<P>
   Proving such links irrefutably is almost impossible, and many
studies have been criticized for methodological or other flaws. It
is not one individual study, however, but the entire range of
studies, taken as a whole, that has convinced most social
scientists of the probability of a link.
</P>
<P>
   ``The evidence is overwhelming,'' said Jeffrey McIntyre,
legislative and federal affairs officer for the American
Psychological Association. ``To argue against it is like arguing
against gravity.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the surgeon general's office has already done two
comprehensive overviews of existing studies, the first published in
1972, and the second a 1982 update. Both called television violence
a contributing factor to increases in violent crime and antisocial
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   The research does not demonstrate that watching violent acts in
films or television shows directly and immediately causes people to
commit violent acts. Rather, the scholarly evidence cited by
McIntyre either demonstrates cumulative effects of violent
entertainment or establishes it as a ``risk factor'' that
contributes to increasing a person's aggressiveness.
</P>
<P>
   A few scholars object to this research, saying the links do not
prove cause and effect and are therefore relatively unimportant.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question there's a correlational link, that
children who watch television violence tend to be more
aggressive,'' said Jonathan L. Freedman, a professor of psychology
at the University of Toronto. ``It's a very small correlation, but
it's there.''
</P>
<P>
   But Freedman said correlative links could come from many
factors, including the likelihood that children who watch a lot of
violent television shows are often children who are least
supervised by responsible adults.
</P>
<P>
   ``My reading of the research is it's pathetic in terms of
showing the link to be causal,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, from 1990 to 1996, major reviews of scientific studies on
the subject were separately conducted by the American Medical
Association, the American Psychological Association, the American
Academy of Pediatrics, the American Academy of Child and Adolescent
Psychiatry and the National Institute of Mental Health.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of them said that television violence contributes to
real-world violence,'' said Dale Kunkel, a professor of
communications at the University of California at Los Angeles, who
also led a three-year study (1996-98), financed by the National
Cable Television Association, documenting the amount of television
violence and its contexts.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most academically reputable researchers, L. Rowell
Huesmann of the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor, told a Senate
hearing recently:
</P>
<P>
   ``Not every child who watches a lot of violence or plays a lot
of violent games will grow up to be violent. Other forces must
converge, as they did recently in Colorado. But just as every
cigarette increases the chance that someday you will get lung
cancer, every exposure to violence increases the chances that some
day a child will behave more violently than they otherwise would.''
</P>
<P>
   Far less research exists on the effects of popular music _ the
snarling hostility of rock groups like Rammstein or Marilyn Manson,
for example, or some rap music lyrics that seem to glorify violence
against women _ or of violent video games, some of which allow a
player to simulate murder. Both video games and explicitly violent
lyrics are relatively recent phenomena and have not been widely
studied.
</P>
<P>
   Kunkel estimates that more than 1,000 studies on the effects of
media violence _ in televised entertainment, television news or
movies _ have been done in the last 40 years, in academic
departments ranging from sociology to epidemiology.
</P>
<P>
   Some are experiments, in which different groups of children were
shown different television shows and their playground behavior
monitored immediately afterward, for example, or in which college
students were given buzzers and told they could ``zap'' someone who
had offended them and were found more likely to do so after having
watched violent movies.
</P>
<P>
   Some are surveys, where parents recorded what their children
watched and were interviewed at various stages about their
children's behavior. Some are statistical analyses, showing the
increase in crime rates in certain geographic areas after the
introduction of television.
</P>
<P>
   So these studies must inevitably vary in reliability. But the
general findings are consistent, and several meta-analyses _ which
collate the findings of all known studies on a subject, calculating
compensations for the different methods _ have found a definite
link between watching violent entertainment and behaving
aggressively.
</P>
<P>
   Huesmann, the University of Michigan researcher, has done two
longitudinal studies of the effects of television violence, one
begun in 1960 that examined about 600 people at age 8, age 18 and
age 30, and one he is finishing now that has tracked 750
Chicago-area elementary school children for three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boys at age 8 who had been watching more television violence
than other boys grew up to be more aggressive than other boys,''
Huesmann said in an interview, describing his first study. ``They
also grew up to be more aggressive and violent than you'd have
expected them to be on the basis of how aggressive they were as
8-year-olds.''
</P>
<P>
   In his more recent study, Huesmann has found that children who
watched more violence behaved more aggressively the next year than
those who watched less violence on television, and more
aggressively than would have been expected based on how they had
behaved the previous year.
</P>
<P>
   In both cases, he said, this was true even after statistically
canceling out all known effects for social class, educational level
of the parents, quality of the parenting and intelligence quotient
of the child. In the later study, it was true of girls as well as
boys.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Network executives have been reluctant to talk about the
subject, either fearing to appear insensitive in the wake of the
Colorado shooting on April 20 or fearing high-profile political
attacks on the day of the White House meeting.
</P>
<P>
   But network and movie studio executives, as well as producers
and writers, have repeatedly bristled at the academic findings,
arguing that the link found is far too small to warrant the
attention paid to them. The executives also accuse social
scientists of looking for easy solutions _ censoring or restricting
entertainment media _ to avoid confronting more difficult
solutions, like reducing poverty, improving child-rearing skills
and child care services, or restricting the availability of guns.
</P>
<P>
   Like Huesmann, mainstream researchers agree that media violence
cannot be singled out as influencing a person's aggressiveness more
than any other factor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Media and cultural influences,'' Kunkel said, ``are not
necessarily the most potent, but they are one of the most pervasive
influences on children.''
</P>
<P>
   And Kathryn C. Montgomery, president of the Center for Media
Education, a Washington research and advocacy group, said: ``The
accumulation over time is the concern, not a single incident or a
single viewing. A steady diet of violent content over time creates
a culture that tells kids that violence is the accepted way we
solve our problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody argues that the teen-age gunmen in Littleton, Colo., for
example, were inspired by watching violent movies or playing
violent video games, even though they were known to enjoy the game
Doom, in which players simulate murders.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have always been kids drawn toward extreme behavior, but
what qualifies as extreme depends on what is normal behavior,''
said David Walsh, a psychologist who heads the National Institute
on Media and the Family, a Minneapolis group that educates families
on how to cope with media influences.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not as direct as `Oh, they played Doom and then they went
and got their guns,''' Walsh said. ``It's a redefining of our
repertoire of responses. If the norm is respect, an extreme
response might be a punch in the nose, but if the norm is `in your
face' hostility then the extreme is something more extreme.''
</P>
<P>
   Walsh, Ms. Montgomery and many of the public-health groups would
like to see society adopt more warning systems about the potential
effects of media violence, with public education campaigns similar
to those on smoking, drunken driving or seat belts.
</P>
<P>
   ``All we want is to be able to tell parents that watching
violence is an unhealthy influence, just the way eating candy is
unhealthy if it's done in excess,'' said Joanne Cantor, a professor
of communication arts at the University of Wisconsin at Madison and
the author of ``Mommy, I'm Scared: How TV and Movies Frighten
Children and What We Can Do to Protect Them'' (Harcourt, Brace &AMP;
Co., 1998).
</P>
<P>
   Rather than call for censorship, Cantor and others call for
better labeling _ like the rating systems for movies and television
programs _ and for more intensive parental education efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The White House plans to announce just such an educational
campaign on Monday, after its meeting on youth violence, people
involved in the planning said on Friday.

   SPANGDAHLEM AIR BASE, Germany _ Her name is Sydney, she's six
years old and she wore her sky blue Barbie sweater last Wednesday,
waved a pair of American flags and even skipped a bit as the
pounding strains of ``Hail to the Chief'' echoed off the corrugated
steel walls of a cavernous hangar of warplanes.
</P>
<P>
   Even after President Clinton spoke about Kosovo to the U.S.
forces and their families gathered there, little Sydney admitted
that she, like most other Americans, knew little about the
embattled province of Serbia, Yugoslavia's dominant republic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't even know where it is,'' said Sydney, whose mother
asked that her last name be withheld for security reasons. ``But my
Dad's in Kosovo. I think he's flying an airplane.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, with clarity more common among kindergartners than
commanders in chief, she explained exactly why her father is
piloting F-16 missions over Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's saving people,'' said the child. ``Those people are
trying to hurt others.''
</P>
<P>
   Like no other major conflict in history, the NATO air war
against Yugoslavia is being fought to save lives and combat
repression.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not because your country wanted to dominate another people or
control land,'' Clinton told U.S. forces at nearby Ramstein Air
Base, ``but because we want our children and their children to live
in a decent world.''
</P>
<P>
   With humanitarian, not strategic, goals at its core, the mission
is perilously undermined every time an allied bomb kills or injures
civilians, as has happened at least eight times since the bombings
began March 24.
</P>
<P>
   The latest such incidents _ inadvertent hits on the Chinese
Embassy in Belgrade and a hospital and residential complex in the
Serbian city of Nis _ are precisely the kinds of disasters that
have the potential to galvanize and even inflame global opinion
against the air campaign.
</P>
<P>
   More than 200 civilians, including ethnic Albanian refugees,
Serb children and, now, Chinese diplomats, have been killed and at
least as many others have been seriously injured in NATO strikes
like those that hit a passenger train in early April, struck a
refugee convoy a few days later and a destroyed a bus two weeks
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Those highly-publicized accidents of war pale in scope against
the atrocities being carried out far from the eyes of the world in
Kosovo, where civilians have been the targets of a military
campaign that has left thousands dead, by NATO's reckoning, and an
estimated 1.5 million homeless inside and outside the province.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, as the civilian toll from the NATO bombing mounts,
allies fear the alliance will come to be regarded as no less
villainous than Serb leader Slobodan Milosevic, the president of
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``While we see him as a war criminal, when 70 people are blown
up on a bus and a bridge, 15 children, they don't see us as people
of virtue,'' the Rev. Jesse Jackson told NBC News last Sunday after
he traveled to Belgrade and secured the release of three American
soldiers from Serb captivity. ``So there is enough demonizing to go
around.''
</P>
<P>
   Rhetorical criticism, moreover, can quickly translate into
political and diplomatic initiatives in a global village where CNN
provides the electronic campfire and the United Nations serves as a
sort of world council.
</P>
<P>
   No sooner was the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade struck late Friday
than footage of the damage was beamed worldwide. Within hours,
China was denouncing the NATO campaign, which Beijing has never
supported, at an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   That's the very body the United States and its allies are
counting on for support this week, of sending a military
peacekeeping force into Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The civilian casualty count is being closely watched within NATO
itself. The 19-nation alliance is deeply divided over how
aggressively to pursue the air campaign, and each fresh civilian
death lends weight to the camp advocating caution.
</P>
<P>
   ``Democracies,'' said a Pentagon official, ``won't tolerate
limited warfare with civilian casualties.''
</P>
<P>
   That dynamic has been a major restraint on the air campaign,
which has been designed and prosecuted to minimize what military
officials call ``collateral damage.''
</P>
<P>
   That approach sharply limits a wide range of combat variables,
including the types of targets that can be hit, the bombs that can
be used against them and the tactics pilots employ.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have got the clear order to avoid civilian casualties and
that order we execute,'' the outgoing chairman of NATO's military
committee, Gen. Klaus Naumann, told reporters last week in
Brussels.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is deplorable that we hit this bus,'' Naumann said,
referring to last month's incident. ``We regard it as a mistake if
one civilian has been killed.''
</P>
<P>
   To try to prevent that, the NATO air strikes have relied more
heavily than any other conflict ever on the use of precision-guided
bombs, weapons steered to their targets by laser beams, satellite
information, video cameras, infrared-sensors, radio signals or
other means.
</P>
<P>
   Pilots, moreover, and the airborne commanders who help
coordinate their strikes, are under strict orders not to drop bombs
if there are doubts about the nature of the target.
</P>
<P>
   The result would make a statistician marvel.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, before Friday's bombs went awry, the Pentagon claimed
that 99.93 percent of the 15,000 or so bombs dropped on Yugoslavia
have not hurt civilians.
</P>
<P>
   People aren't statistics, however, and civilian deaths by NATO
bombs, even 0.07 percent of them, remain a moral hazard and a
political risk to the ongoing air campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The risks are heightened, in fact, as the campaign escalates
against an increasingly desperate foe who has, from the start, seen
civilian deaths as part of its aim.
</P>
<P>
   According to NATO, Serb forces have made it standard practice to
travel, when possible, with refugee convoys, and to hide tanks,
artillery and other military assets inside homes, near mosques or
around schools. Those tactics, in violation of the Geneva
Convention, deliberately place civilians at risk in an attempt to
protect themselves from NATO search and rescue missions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Collateral damage is too kind a word for what Milosevic is
doing to (Kosovar Albanians),'' said Brian Atwood, director of the
U.S. Agency for International Development, responsible for
overseeing American foreign aid to Kosovo's refugees. ``His central
plan is to use these people as weapons of war.''

<P>
   KUKES, Albania _ For a week refugee Filip Kolgjeraj sat every
day outside the tent that was his hospital ward, smoking cigarettes
and waiting to get back the use of hands and feet swollen like a
grotesque Popeye caricature.
</P>
<P>
   He also talked to two sets of human rights investigators,
supplying details of the beatings he said Serb police
systematically applied with a rubber wand as they questioned him
for three days outside the Kosovo city of Prizren.
</P>
<P>
   The 43-year-old Kosovar Albanian, who doctors said could not
walk when he arrived, is a candidate to become a witness for war
crimes trials already being planned for when the NATO bombing
campaign against Yugoslavia ends.
</P>
<P>
   Kolgjeraj, however, has disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   Much improved, he walked out of the field hospital of a refugee
camp on Thursday and melted into the tens of thousands of Kosovars
swamping this city and dispersing throughout Albania.
</P>
<P>
   The mobility of the refugee population _ the people who are
victims as well as eyewitnesses to what has transpired in Kosovo _
is one reason prosecutions will be so tough. The refugees tell
their stories and then they scatter, and no one is keeping track of
where they go.
</P>
<P>
   Yet scores of people are trying to document the terror that has
happened and continues to unfold within Yugoslavia's embattled
Kosovo province every day. They can only hope witnesses they
identify will rise from the massive shuffle of refugee life.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking for the entire story. We hope that (war crimes)
prosecution is the end result,'' said Rufus Dawkins, an
investigator with the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe (OSCE).
</P>
<P>
   His team of 75 monitors is in Albania to support relief
organizations, but a primary responsibility is documenting the
myriad reports of human rights violations among the 700,000 ethnic
Albanian refugees who have been driven out of the province.
</P>
<P>
   Groups including Medecins du Monde (Doctors of the World),
Physicians for Human Rights, Human Rights Watch and Medecins Sans
Frontieres (Doctors Without Borders) are compiling dossiers.
</P>
<P>
   The latter group has not waited for legal systems to grind out
conclusions, but recently finished its own study that asserted the
Kosovars have been forcibly deported from Yugoslavia under a
systematic and pre-planned policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The crimes committed qualify as war crimes and crimes against
humanity,'' the report charged.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators from the Hague tribunal on war crimes in the
former Yugoslavia, the body that ultimately will try any charges
brought, also have been here to assess potential cases.
</P>
<P>
   But the tribunal has been widely criticized for its wan record
in prosecuting cases that arose since Yugoslavia began its violent
splitting apart in 1991, including cases from the conflict in
Bosnia in which all sides were accused of actions that violate the
norms of civilization.
</P>
<P>
   Out of 89 persons indicted, just one has been convicted and is
serving a sentence, according to the tribunal's information
service. One other pleaded guilty and has yet to be sentenced,
while five found guilty are appealing the verdicts.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps that is why so many humanitarian groups are so intensely
trying to preserve a record while events are fresh and people are
still around.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may talk to 25 or 30 people about an incident. We don't
deal with third- or fourth-hand information,'' said Dawkins, who is
from Killeen, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   He said the OSCE monitors are law-enforcement professionals with
extensive training in witness protection and human rights.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Brook, head of the mission here, said forcible eviction
and theft are the foremost acts reported, followed by beatings,
rapes and killings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to get the places, the names, dates, time and if
possible the identification of the units concerned. If possible,
who the perpetrators were,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators look for multiple, corroborating witnesses to make
an overwhelming case.
</P>
<P>
   The doctors who sit at the border to treat emergencies and who
staff refugee camp clinics are another source of evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very aware and conscious to be alert and to record as
accurately and precisely as possible what has happened,'' said Dr.
Jean Francois Viel, medical coordinator of Medecins du Monde. ``Who
is injured? Do they know the person who beat them? We try to be
very organized about this.''
</P>
<P>
   Each day the doctors' reports are sent to the group's Paris
headquarters, which ultimately will decide what to forward to the
tribunal.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the doctors find evidence of more complicated crimes
than shootings or sexual abuse.
</P>
<P>
   This past week, for example, Viel said the doctors saw signs
that Serb authorities had systematically emptied out a major
hospital in Prizren. They got the patients as proof.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could describe the ward cleared by the people we saw coming
over the border. It was very systematic clearing of the hospital.
One day it was the psychiatric ward, another the infectious ward,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   A four-year-old girl, for example, was brought across to Albania
having received four days of antibiotic treatment for meningitis.
She should have had another eight days, but was forced to leave the
hospital and the country, Viel explained.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors, nurses and pharmacists from the hospital also were
expelled. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
reported that the refugees said they were plucked from the hospital
floor, driven to the border and told to leave. They did not have a
chance to notify relatives, much less pick up personal possessions,
they said.
</P>
<P>
   Does clearing out a hospital qualify as a crime against humanity
or violation of the Geneva Convention, which are among offenses the
Hague tribunal is mandated to prosecute? The lawyers will have to
decide.
</P>
<P>
   There still remains the question of whether reports from doctors
or investigators are hard enough evidence to make a case.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need the people as witnesses. It will be very difficult to
trace them,'' said Stafaan DeWolf of Medecins Sans Frontieres.
</P>
<P>
   His group is not, for now, forwarding information to the Hague
tribunal, but has collected its documentation for a broader
historic record. It also wants to mobilize international pressure
now on the Yugoslav central government to put an end to the ethnic
cleansing of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We defined that this is repeated, systematic abuse, not
isolated cases,'' said DeWolf. ``It was an outcry of our
frustration as well.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Refugees like Filip Kolgjeraj may turn up again to testify some
day. He sounded like a potentially useful witness when talking to
Cox Newspapers in two interviews, taken after he spoke to both the
OSCE and investigators from the Hague tribunal.
</P>
<P>
   He seems to be one of the rare surviving cases of torture. And
he said he can identify at least two of the people who took him
away from his home and family on April 24 _ two days before his
wife's birthday. He knows times and dates and places, can recite
the questions he said the Serbian police asked him about the Kosovo
independence movement in between battering the palms of his hands
and soles of his feet.
</P>
<P>
   So what happened to him? Perhaps he simply wandered into some
friends in town and decided to stay with them. Maybe he found his
wife and daughter of 13, for whom he had gone searching that
Thursday he disappeared, and continued on in pursuit of peace. He
might have decided suddenly to join the Kosovar guerrillas
recruiting around Kukes for fighters. Possibly Serb undercover
units tried to undo a mistake made by letting him leave Kosovo to
tell his story.
</P>
<P>
   He might come back any day. Or he might be gone for good, like
others who carry with them the puzzle pieces that could help create
a picture of responsibility for a tragedy.

<P>
   VELIKA DOBRANJA, Yugoslavia _ The Llugiqi family is hunkering
down, hoping that the storm that has convulsed Kosovo has passed
and that they are not simply in its eerie eye.
</P>
<P>
   The Llugiqis, like the rest of this ethnic Albanian village of
about 2,500 people, have not left their homes. Nor has anyone here
been asked or ordered to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hear different stories, and what is true you never know,''
said Mehmet Llugiqi, 36. ``No one has bothered us here. But we
don't know what will happen tomorrow. If someone comes and says to
leave, I guess we would have to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   This is a purely Albanian village set in the Kosovo plains about
four miles west of Lipljan, a majority-Serb town about 15 miles
south of Pristina. Given the village's proximity to Serbs, a number
of the Albanians here speak Serbian, and the Kosovo Liberation Army
was never much of a presence. So the Yugoslav Army and militarized
police have largely left Velika Dobranja to its own devices.
</P>
<P>
   There is anxiety here, but thus far, at least, no brutality or
panicked flight. But there has been no electricity or fuel for
weeks now, either for travel or for the tractors. There are severe
shortages of food, money and medicine. Even with no ethnic purging,
the village is an emergency in embryo.
</P>
<P>
   But the war has not left the Llugiqis untouched. Three weeks
ago, a misdirected NATO missile presumably aimed at Pristina's
airport, Slatina, landed on the house of Rahman Llugiqi. Six people
were wounded, including three of his children, and his 6-year-old
daughter, Arta, died.
</P>
<P>
   Rahman, 36, like many Albanian men, is not demonstrative. Asked
about Arta, he rubbed his face and looked away. ``My mother is
alive,'' he finally said. ``The worst thing that has ever happened
to her is when the child died.''
</P>
<P>
   He and his two brothers have repaired the roof and walls of his
house, and the wounded children are home from the Pristina
hospital, where Serb officials took them.
</P>
<P>
   But the sound of the NATO planes, throbbing overhead through a
cloudy sky, is enough to set the little ones wailing. The airport,
which is military as well as civilian, has been bombed a lot.
Deridi, a 12-year-old, said he got frightened by planes, but then
went silent.
</P>
<P>
   ``When there are older people in the yard, he is outside with
us,'' said his uncle, Rahmin Llugiqi, 30. ``But otherwise he stays
in the house.''
</P>
<P>
   Rahman said: ``You hear the planes day and night now, and all
the kids are afraid. You never know where the bomb will hit.'' He
bent to pick at some grass, then said quietly, ``We have that
experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Minire Llugiqi, 31, Arta's mother, said they get milk from two
cows, but have no chickens and no eggs. They have run out of salt
and potatoes, and they will soon run short of flour for bread. She
is dressed in a head scarf and a sweater embroidered with a huge
cat's face. Asked if there is enough meat, she laughed. ``We
haven't seen meat for more than three months,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Rahmin, who used to work for the Albanian service of Radio
Belgrade, said: ``There is food in Lipljan, but the problem is
money. It's the old story: Those with money are fine, and those
without are not.''
</P>
<P>
   His sister, Irea, said: ``It's very difficult now. We need
anything. We can find nothing. There is nothing here. And if we can
find something, there is no money.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor has there been any aid from the state or from relief
organizations, which left Kosovo because of the war. Even the
International Committee for the Red Cross, which has received
permission to return to Kosovo, is still negotiating security
arrangements with Belgrade, as if security could be guaranteed by
anyone.
</P>
<P>
   With the war and the shortage of gasoline and diesel, it is
almost impossible to farm, Mehmet said, or even to travel regularly
to work. He worked in the local coal mine, but it closed in March,
about a week before the bombing started on March 24, and gets no
salary now.
</P>
<P>
   Rahman worked as a salesman for a wholesaler in Sitnica, about
eight miles away, that delivered goods to small shops. But the
business failed a few years ago. He gets some benefits, and his
mother gets a pension, which is still coming, he said, then laughs.
``It's 160 dinars a month'' _ about $11.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's bread, and somehow enough to eat,'' he said,
insisting, ``The kids are fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Rahman still cuts a figure with a handsome, tanned face and a
snappy leather jacket. But he says he rarely leaves the village
now. With no fuel, people are traveling by donkey cart, and there
is always a discussion at any police checkpoint. ``They have their
job,'' he said. ``They stop us, but we have no problem with them.''
</P>
<P>
   For all their stoicism, the Llugiqis feel like prisoners of the
war. They cannot go out, but they are also afraid to do so, and
have no idea where to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel safe enough here,'' Rahmin said. ``But no one knows
what will happen. We've heard from television that terrible things
have happened, but we haven't seen it ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Rahman said, ``I will not change my opinion about the Serbs _ we
have to live together.'' Asked what the Serbs think about the
Albanians, he said: ``I don't know what they think. But I know we
must live together.''
</P>
<P>
   Mehmet said, ``We live together and we have to live together.''
Anyway, he said, ``Where would we go? We're from here, and we have
to stay here.''
</P>
<P>
   Rahman thanked his visitors for coming and checking up on the
family. ``Of course people here are frightened,'' he said quietly.
``Anyone who has been bitten by a snake is going to be afraid of a
lizard.''

<P>
   One more day of low clouds, spotty showers and cool weather is
expected in eastern New England on Sunday, bringing the stretch of
unpleasant conditions to nearly a week. A complex warm front will
crawl eastward through New England, but should not move offshore
until Monday. Residual moisture associated with a weakening
disturbance at 15,000 feet over Ontario, Canada will circulate
clouds southward into the eastern Ohio Valley and Appalachian
Mountains. An isolated thundershower is possible in the higher
elevations.
</P>
<P>
   High pressure stretching from the central Great Lakes to the
eastern Gulf Coast will promote dry and seasonably warm weather.
Morning fog is likely in parts of the Southeast. A few
thunderstorms will erupt mainly over central Florida as a weak
disturbance over the central Gulf drifts eastward.
</P>
<P>
   A corridor of humid air will be transported into the southern
and central Plains. By late in the day, a disturbance aloft will
move out of the Rockies triggering thunderstorms from the Texas
panhandle to western Nebraska. Conditions may favor potent
thunderstorms in Kansas and northern Oklahoma this evening.
</P>
<P>
   Wet snow in the higher elevations and cold rain in the low
elevations will dampen northern Wyoming and much of Montana on
Sunday. Showers will spread across the northern Plains. Strong
winds from the northeast will enhance the chill in this area.
</P>
<P>
   The Northwest will be unseasonably cold, but dry. Cooler, dry
air will surge into California and Nevada on gusty winds from the
north. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Northwest Chill &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Early Friday, an inch of snow coated the ground in the lowlands
just north of Seattle as unusually cold air poured into the
Northwest. Snow is relatively rare in the lower elevations of the
Pacific Northwest to the west of the Cascades. The moderating
effect of the nearby Pacific limits the average seasonal snowfall
in Seattle to about 12 inches. Snow is even more scarce during May
as the more intense sun warms the lower atmosphere. Also Friday,
the high at Seattle only reached 48, the coldest high temperature
recorded on that date. It will stay cool in the Northwest this
weekend. &QL;

CHINESE EVACUATE BOMBED EMBASSY IN BELGRADE
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By CARLOTTA GALL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ Chinese Embassy personnel were packing
up, loading up their cars and dragging suitcases across the
forecourt of their bombed embassy, still dazed and shaken after a
NATO raid hit the building overnight.
</P>
<P>
   The red flag of China danced gaily at the top of its pole and
crowds of people strolled in the bright sun to look at the damage.
But inside the compound, the stress and horror were plain. At least
three people died here and about 20 were injured.
</P>
<P>
   A young couple drove out in a Mercedes, the man biting his lip,
the woman next to him holding her hand over her mouth, her face
grimacing near to tears. Behind them in the back seat, they had
tossed suitcases, jackets and belongings.
</P>
<P>
   Special rescue teams were still going through the five-story
building, a police officer said. They had found the military
attache only at 8 a.m., and brought him out, bleeding from a heavy
head wound, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The building, a modern concrete-and-glass structure, only four
years old, was hit close to midnight local time. Daylight revealed
extensive damage, the heavy blue mirrored glass of the windows was
smashed, some of the lower windows blackened by fire. The acrid
smell of burning still hung in the air.
</P>
<P>
   The main building seemed to have been hit from two sides. The
left wing was badly damaged, the facade ripped off and the ground
floor thick with rubble. The second missile hit the back of the
building just yards from the separate building of the ambassador's
residence.
</P>
<P>
   Gas canisters and plastic chairs had been scattered wildly by
the blast, which left one orange canister skewered on the spikes of
the black iron fence surrounding the compound. The glazed tiles of
the decorative roof, with open-mouthed dragons on the corners,
remained intact, as did the wires of the embassy's communications
antenna on the roof.
</P>
<P>
   Local Serbian residents brought bunches of spring flowers to lay
on the compound wall and to wind through the railings of the gate.
``We are sorry for the poor people inside, not for the buildings,
but for the people,'' said Olga Grlja, who lives nearby. ``We have
some Chinese in our apartment building. They are quiet people, kind
people.''
</P>
<P>
   A fleet of glossy embassy cars drove up in a convoy, diplomatic
personnel from the other foreign embassies in Belgrade, arriving in
a show of solidarity. ``We have just come to express solidarity and
support from all the embassies,'' said the Russian consul as he
crossed from his car toward the embassy.
</P>
<P>
   Along with him were representatives from Brazil, Australia,
Mexico, Argentina and Greece. Most other Western embassies had
evacuated their staff from Belgrade before the the NATO bombing
campaign began.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a crime, an attack on a peaceful country,'' said the
police officer on duty in front of the embassy.
</P>
<P>
   Residents said the bombing was the heaviest they had experienced
in Belgrade since the beginning of the five-week campaign. It began
not long after 9 p.m. when air raid sirens sounded and the city was
blacked out as electricity failed.
</P>
<P>
   Four strikes hit buildings in the center of town: the federal
Interior Ministry headquarters, the Defense Ministry headquarters
and, across the street, for the first time, the Serbian government
building.
</P>
<P>
   Close to midnight, missiles roared in on the district known as
New Belgrade, a spacious area of trees and wide boulevards on the
south bank of the Danube where several embassies, hotels and
government buildings lie, along with modern high-rise apartments.
</P>
<P>
   The Hotel Yugoslavia, an ugly Communist-era hotel, was hit three
times, and one wing burst into flames. Workers were sweeping up the
debris this morning and carrying out the elaborate furniture from
the hotel's casino while the man who was one of NATO's targets,
Zeljko Raznatovic, better known as the notorious paramilitary
leader and indicted war criminal Arkan, stood by the entrance
giving court to foreign journalists.
</P>
<P>
   Arkan said he was a part owner of the casino along with an
Italian partner. The casino, however, was not damaged but one wing
of the hotel and the garage behind the hotel were. Dozens of rental
cars belonging to an agency working out of the hotel were wrecked.
</P>
<P>
   Arkan poured scorn on NATO, which managed to kill an old
pensioner lodging at the hotel, but failed to hit any military or
strategic object, let alone harm Arkan himself. ``They are very
precise. They said they wanted to hit me, but I wasn't here,'' he
said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Flashing an enormous diamond ring and a diamond-encrusted gold
watch, Arkan said his paramilitary force, known as the Tigers, had
never stayed at the hotel, nor had he. ``Only my football players
have stayed here before a match,'' he said, referring to the soccer
team he owns.
</P>
<P>
   It seems that the hotel managers had known the hotel was a
target. Marija, who worked for the car rental service Yu-Team,
based in the hotel, said the receptionists had warned her two weeks
ago to evacuate the hotel as soon as she ever heard the air-raid
sirens.
</P>
<P>
   In the center of town, the damage to the military and police
buildings was heavy. ``It was so heavy I thought the ground was
going to open up,'' said one police officer, who had been on duty
in the city center.
</P>
<P>
   A great hole gaped in the police building, where the top floors
had collapsed. Another wing behind the main building had also been
hit. Already burned out from previous strikes, the building still
smoldered. Farther down Kneza Milosa, the main street, the Defense
Ministry was ravaged, seeming ready to topple from a massive
internal blast.
</P>
<P>
   Across the street, the elegant, prewar building of the Serbian
government showed a wide gap in the top floors. The statues and
elaborate decoration of the facade remained standing; the green
copper dome of the center piece was intact.
</P>
<P>
   These missiles had found their targets with obvious accuracy.
</P>
<P>
   Bystanders gazed in awe at the extent of the damage as police
swept the glass and bomb debris and washed down the streets. People
walked their dogs or rode bicycles around to look at the damage.
Other residents wearily swept up the glass from broken windows.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's astonishing,'' said Milos Peskarevic, who lived in an
adjoining street. ``This was by far the worst attack we have had. I
am not afraid anymore, just numb. We don't even know anymore if it
is dangerous for us or not.''

AIR WAR HURTS STABILITY OF YUGOSLAV REPUBLIC   OF MONTENEGRO
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By ANTHONY DePALMA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CETINJE, Montenegro _ It was a beguiling promise, ``To Live
Better,'' that helped Montenegro's governing coalition win power
last year. But few people in this ancient city would say their
lives are better now than before.
</P>
<P>
   The sprawling OBOD electronics plant here, which employs 2,500
people, has been shut down completely since NATO's bombardment of
Serbia cut off the market where 90 percent of the plant's air
conditioners, washing machines and refrigerators were sold.
</P>
<P>
   The last time workers were paid was in February, and what they
received then was December's salary. With no money circulating,
small shopkeepers like Marko Stevov Kaludjerovic have had to extend
credit to so many people that they too are in danger of going
under.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then they can count me as another casualty of the war,''
Kaludjerovic said.
</P>
<P>
   The economy of Montenegro _ which is joined with Serbia in the
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia _ was already severely weakened
before the bombardment began. And although Montenegro has never
recognized Belgrade's declaration that a state of war now exists,
it has suffered several NATO bombardments that have shocked and
angered residents who thought they would be protected because of
Montenegro's fledgling connections to the West.
</P>
<P>
   Add to that volatile mix the economic disruptions and problems
sure to be caused by the recently imposed embargo on oil for Serbia
coming through Montenegro's Adriatic ports, and the stress
fractures challenging the tiny republic's stability threaten to
break wide open.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials here acknowledge the danger. They believe
civil authority is already being undermined by aggressive moves of
the Yugoslav Army in Montenegro and the agitation of opposition
forces loyal to Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   While it struggles to check the army's moves, the government of
Montenegro's president, Milo Djukanovic, fears an economic collapse
could undermine whatever support it retains. Unemployment has
soared to as much as 50 percent, and more than 60 percent of all
635,000 residents of Montenegro may be eligible to receive some
government payment of social assistance _ if the government has the
money to pay.
</P>
<P>
   Things will only get worse. The important tourism season has
been wiped out with the NATO assaults, and the closing of the major
Adriatic seaport of Bar by the Yugoslav navy means shortages are
likely.
</P>
<P>
   The government has appealed to the West for help. The United
States provided $10 million in aid last month to help the
government meet some salary and pension obligations, and the
European Union has promised $13.86 million to cover some of the
cost of caring for the thousands of Kosovo Albanians who have
sought refuge here.
</P>
<P>
   But the government fears the West does not understand the
urgency of Montenegro's problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless we have more help,'' Vojin Djukanovic, minister of the
economy, said in an interview in the capital, Podgorica, ``there
will be a civil war here.''
</P>
<P>
   The minister, no relation to the president , a former deputy
prime minister of the federal government in Belgrade until he was
dismissed by Milosevic last May, said that pro-Milosevic forces
were using Montenegro's economic problems to foment dissent and lay
the ground work for a coup.
</P>
<P>
   He estimates it would take $100 million in loans and credits to
enable Montenegro to survive the current crisis without forfeiting
the democratic advances it has made since Djukanovic was elected
president in 1997, and his coalition won parliamentary elections
last summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tragedy of our day is that the West has been opening the
port of Bar, and now the Yugoslav army is closing it,'' Vojin
Djukanovic said, referring to Montenegro's main Adriatic port.
</P>
<P>
   The government's hope is that the people of Montenegro will be
patient, and not catch war fever.
</P>
<P>
   ``People in Montenegro are not living better, that's quite
correct,'' said Bozidar Jaredic, the government's minister of
information. ``But the majority of people in Montenegro can
understand the current circumstances and they can see the
government and Parliament are doing all they can.''
</P>
<P>
   While the people of Montenegro may not yet have reached their
breaking point, they are showing strains.
</P>
<P>
   Radojica Radosevic, a jeweler in downtown Podgorica, said
business has dropped by 70 percent since the NATO attacks began and
the shop he has owned for 25 years is now empty most of the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one has been receiving their salaries on time so people
just don't have enough money,'' Radosevic said as workmen installed
a new folding metal security gate over the front window of his
shop. He said it was a precautionary measure, against increasingly
desperate times. ``To be honest, I don't know much longer it can go
on,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Montenegrins joke that with the port blocked, the airports
closed and border crossings often slammed shut, their country _
long known for the stunning beauty of its mountains and seaside _
has become ``the world's most beautiful prison.''
</P>
<P>
   Few places though may be under as much pressure as Cetinje,
where practically every family has suffered because of the closing
of the giant OBOD factory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since January, I've worked only 20 days,'' said Kice Pejovic,
a mother of two sons who has been employed at the assembly plant
for 12 years. She said the family survived on the food it grows in
a small garden, and the milk it gets from a cow it keeps nearby.
They cannot remember the last time any one of them bought clothes.
``It's very hard, and every day it seems to get worse,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   No one is suggesting that the NATO assaults caused all of
Montenegro's economic problems. The OBOD plant is 45 years old and
has never been modernized. Productivity is still measured on
Communist-era scales, and the product line has not been updated for
years.
</P>
<P>
   But Branislav Basovic, the general manager, said things would
have been much better if the West had not failed to take full
account of Montenegro's democratic opening.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, he said, the sanctions imposed on Yugoslavia
earlier this decade dried up the small, but important, export
market OBOD had developed with Western Europe and the United
States. Now, he said, practically all exports _ which constitute 90
percent of the factory's output when it is operating _ go to
Serbia.

<P>
   LONDON _ With elections now completed for new legislatures in
Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales, Prime Minister Tony Blair has
won the battle for a Britain with its politics radically
reconfigured to his own design.
</P>
<P>
   But he has also given power and legitimacy to forces in the
three parts of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern
Ireland that are restive over their continuing relationship with
the fourth, England, and dream of full independence from London one
day.
</P>
<P>
   The question facing Blair and his view of a Britain freshly
fitted out for modern times is whether the distinct new political
structures that he has thrown up in Belfast, Cardiff and Edinburgh
help to buttress and maintain the union or work to destabilize and
ultimately dissolve it.
</P>
<P>
   The results of last week's elections in Scotland and Wales and a
similar vote in Northern Ireland last June confirmed that a
majority of voters in the so-called Celtic fringe want their
regions to remain part of the United Kingdom. But they also
installed as the principal opposition in the three places political
parties that have the breakup of the union as their final goal.
</P>
<P>
   In Northern Ireland, the Social Democratic and Labor Party and
Sinn Fein, the political wing of the Irish Republican Army, embody
the largely Catholic desire to leave Britain and become part of the
Irish Republic. The Scottish Nationalists are dedicated to creating
Scotland as a separate nation, and the Welsh nationalists, Plaid
Cymru, though far less committed to full independence, reflect
feelings that their culture is under-represented while Wales
remains tightly yoked to England.
</P>
<P>
   Blair was quick to seize upon the Labor Party's success in
gaining the most seats in the Scottish and Welsh legislatures and
to play down the appeal to voters demonstrated by the Scottish
Nationalists and Plaid Cymru (pronounced plyde KUM-ree), who have
produced a new landscape with some rough footing ahead for
traditional British politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe and I hope that out of these elections the union of
the United Kingdom will have been strengthened rather than
weakened,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   What is looming for Blair is a clash between two proven
instincts of his party _ a bent for keeping highly centralized
authority over outlying party members and its new commitment to
letting regional leaders and not bosses in London decide what is
right for their areas.
</P>
<P>
   This need to allow diverse opinions in its own ranks has emerged
in both Scotland and Wales where Labor failed to win outright
majorities and will consequently have to compromise objectives set
in London that are at odds with those of minority parties whose
partnership local Labor leaders will need in forming coalition
governments.
</P>
<P>
   Coalition governments are themselves a new phenomenon in Britain
and will become more common because of another Blair reform, the
use of proportional representation voting that gives more say to
minority parties and reduces the dominance of the two-party system
that has prevailed in Britain for most of the century.
</P>
<P>
   Meetings began this weekend in Scotland between leaders of the
Labor Party and its most likely partner, the centrist Liberal
Democrats, and an issue has emerged that illustrates the fraught
new brand of politics that has suddenly been introduced to Britain.
</P>
<P>
   As their price for cooperation, the Liberal Democrats are
expected to demand that Labor agree to end university tuition
payments in Scotland, an innovation that Blair put into British
life at some political risk in 1997. The 1,000-pounds-a-year
payments ($1,650) were put forward as a way of marrying the
promises of Labor to increase aid for education with its pledge to
hold the line on taxes. They also fit securely into Blair's
oft-stated philosophy that individuals must join in helping finance
services that were previously the sole responsibility of the state.
</P>
<P>
   If Blair is true to his commitment to devolution, the name of
his program of ceding powers long held by London to the new
regional parliaments, he will have to free Labor leaders in
Scotland to make a decision that clashes with cherished party
policy established in 10 Downing Street.
</P>
<P>
   The problem will not end there. How will the government
reconcile a situation where Scottish students get free higher
education while students elsewhere in Britain and non-Scottish
British students studying at Scottish universities have to pay for
it?
</P>
<P>
   The Welsh elections, which drew less attention than the vote in
Scotland, illustrated another quandary for New Labor and its
devolution policy. Plaid Cymru shocked Labor by winning 17 of the
60 seats in the Welsh National Assembly and defeating Labor in
stronghold mining and valley districts that have never voted for
any other party. Analysts attributed the showing to voters
protesting heavy-handed campaign tactics by the Labor Party
headquarters in London that convinced them that the party was not
really committed to letting the Welsh have a say in their own
affairs.
</P>
<P>
   As the new bodies get up and running, the exercise of new home
rule power could satisfy people that they now have real influence
over their public affairs or it could end up emboldening
nationalists to press their case for even more authority.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we're seeing the breakup of the United Kingdom,
but we are seeing the breakup of a unified, centralized, simple
two-party UK system,'' said Prof. Anthony King of Essex University.
``Provided people are given a degree of home rule, they will be
content to stay within the union.''

ON PIONEERING TRIP, POPE JOINS PATRIARCH IN BALKANS PLEA  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
(ATTN: Ohio)  By ALESSANDRA STANLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUCHAREST, Romania _ Pooling their moral authority, Pope John
Paul II and Patriarch Teoctist of the Romanian Orthodox Church on
Saturday jointly requested an immediate end to the fighting in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first communal appeal for peace between leaders of
the long estranged Roman Catholic and Orthodox churches since the
violence in Kosovo began.
</P>
<P>
   The two expressed support for victims on both sides of the
conflict. Without referring to either by name, they elliptically
suggested that both NATO and the Serbian government were to blame
for the suffering.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to appeal in the name of God to all those who, in one
way or another, are responsible for the current tragedy, that they
may have the courage to resume dialogue and find the right
conditions to bring about a just and lasting peace,'' they said in
a joint statement.
</P>
<P>
   Pope John Paul II, who is the first pope to visit a
predominantly Orthodox Christian country, is in Romania to mend
relations with the Eastern church. He is also seeking to use his
presence at the edge of the Balkans to allay age-old Orthodox
mistrust of the Vatican that has only been heightened by the war
next door.
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican has denounced the NATO bombing and the expulsion of
ethnic Albanians from Kosovo many times. Prominent Orthodox leaders
have mostly focused on the killing of civilians in Serbia, though
Patriarch Aleksy II of the Russian Orthodox Church mentioned the
plight of ethnic Albanian refugees when he met with Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic in Belgrade. For the Romanian
patriarch, however, it was one of the fullest acknowledgments to
date of the suffering Serbs are inflicting on ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to express our human and spiritual solidarity toward
those who, chased from their homes, their lands and separated from
their loved ones, as well as the victims of murderous bombings,''
the statement said. ``In the name of God and of all mankind, we ask
all parties engaged in the conflict to permanently put down their
arms.''
</P>
<P>
   The statement did not mention the bombing of the Chinese Embassy
in Belgrade, or comment on any of the negotiation initiatives that
have sprung up recently in Moscow and Brussels.
</P>
<P>
   Serbs, who share a border with Romanians, are also mostly of the
Orthodox faith, and many of them view the NATO bombing campaign as
an assault by the West on their nation, and even on their religion.
In Bucharest, some Romanians said they viewed the papal visit as
part of a Western plot to keep the Bulgarian government on NATO's
side, evidently unaware that the pope has been highly critical of
the alliance's bombing campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The pope's dream of full reconciliation with the Orthodox faith
before the beginning of the third millennium, which he first laid
out 20 years ago, is further complicated by deep tensions between
Orthodox Romanians and the Catholic minority here, many of whom
belong to the Greek Catholic Church, which follows Eastern rites
but is loyal to the pope.
</P>
<P>
   The pope sought to work with his Orthodox counterpart to seek an
end the current war in the Balkans, but his visit to Romania mostly
drew him back to conflicts between the two faiths that date back to
the Communist era in Eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday morning, he prayed a cemetery before the tombs of
several Greek Catholic bishops who were persecuted under Communism.
The Vatican has started the process of beatification for seven
Greek Catholic Romanian martyrs who were killed during the
Communist era.
</P>
<P>
   When the Communists took power in 1948, they persecuted the
Orthodox Church and forced its leaders to collaborate. Catholics,
who were viewed as less compliant, were treated even more
mercilessly. Bishops and priests were executed and Catholic
churches were turned over to the Orthodox Church.
</P>
<P>
   The Orthodox church has only returned about 100 of some 2,000
properties that once belonged to the Greek Catholic church.
</P>
<P>
   The pope asked Orthodox bishops to end the conflict. ``The end
of persecution has given back freedom, but the problem of churches
still awaits a definitive solution,'' he said in a meeting at the
Patriarchy. ``Let dialogue be the means to healing still open
wounds and to resolve remaining difficulties.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``God knows our world, and also our Europe, which we
had hoped was freed of fratricidal struggles, need an example of
fraternal love, that overcomes hate and quarrels and opens hearts
to reconciliation.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, at a Greek Catholic mass at the Cathedral of St.
Joseph, the pope also asked his Romanian followers to forgive old
grievances.
</P>
<P>
   ``A painful wound was inflicted on our fellowship with our
brothers and sisters in the Orthodox Church,'' the pope said in his
homily, ``even though many of them shared your suffering in
persecution.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let common suffering generate, not separation, but the miracle
of reconciliation.''
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of thousands of Catholics from all over Romania
Saturday poured into the capital and lined the streets around the
Cathedral for a glimpse of the pope.
</P>
<P>
   The Orthodox Church did not allow the pope to travel to heavily
Catholic regions like Transylvania, where religious and ethnic
tensions are particularly high.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``The fact that the pope chose to come anyway is a sign that he
is willing to go the extra mile for reconciliation,'' John Michael
Botean, bishop of St. George in Canton, a Greek Catholic diocese in
Canton, Ohio, who was in Bucharest to greet the pope. Botean said
he told American congressmen last month, ``Castro couldn't do in
Cuba what is being done here, restricting the Pope to one city.''
</P>
<P>
   But the bishop noted that sacrifices in the name of
reconciliation were necessary, nevertheless.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that the pope would come under these circumstances
sets an example for Catholics in Romania and elsewhere,'' he said.
``It has to happen. The only thing that keeps our churches apart
are the same things that divided them 1,000 years ago, human pride
and stubbornness.''

INDIA'S CHANCES OF SIGNING THE NUCLEAR TEST BAN APPEAR TO FADE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By CELIA W. DUGGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India _ A year after India and Pakistan sent tremors
of anxiety around the world by conducting nuclear tests, the
once-strong likelihood that India would soon sign the nuclear test
ban treaty faded this week to a very faint possibility.
</P>
<P>
   The Hindu nationalist-led government, which appeared to be
headed toward signing the treaty, narrowly lost a confidence vote
last month after only a year in office. It now faces a general
election in late September that coincides with an informal but
politically crucial deadline for adopting the treaty, which would
ban all nuclear testing.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the fallen government and its chief rival, the
Congress Party, said in interviews last week that they were very
pessimistic about the prospects for India signing the treaty before
the election.
</P>
<P>
   The political instability in India _ and the diminished
prospects for its signing the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty _ may
undermine Pakistan's resolve to sign, as well. American diplomats,
who have been trying to persuade India and Pakistan to sign, say
the treaty is a crucial step to halt the spread of nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan and India have fought three wars since 1947. They
engaged in tit-for-tat nuclear tests last May, and in tit-for-tat
tests of ballistic missiles that can carry nuclear warheads last
month.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan's Foreign Minister, Sartaj Aziz, said in a telephone
interview that if India did not sign the treaty it would become
more difficult for Pakistan to follow through on plans to sign if
the United States lifts all sanctions imposed after the nuclear
tests. ``So far, we have not changed our formal position,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The test ban treaty faces obstacles not only in India, but in
the United States as well, where there is stiff Republican
opposition in the Senate. Neither China nor Russia has ratified the
treaty yet, either.
</P>
<P>
   The treaty ``is in big, big trouble in Washington, which also
means in Moscow and Beijing,'' said George Perkovich, director of
the Secure World Program at the W. Alton Jones Foundation in
Charlottesville, Va. ``India and Pakistan not having signed deepens
the trouble, but does not cause it.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the treaty, the United States, India and
Pakistan, along with 41 other specified countries, must sign and
ratify the treaty before it can take effect. But so far only 17
have done so. The countries that have agreed are supposed to meet
to decide how to proceed if the treaty has not won the required
signatures by Sept. 24, three years after the treaty was open for
ratification.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials are now husbanding their political
capital to build support for the NATO campaign against Yugoslavia
and to deal with criticism of how the administration handled
accusations of nuclear espionage by China. They may have little
left over to spend on getting the test ban treaty through the
Senate, nuclear analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials had hoped a decision by India and Pakistan to
sign the treaty this summer would have helped to give it momentum.
</P>
<P>
   They worry that if approval is delayed into next year, the
United States will be in the midst of a presidential election
campaign, and President Clinton, a leading proponent of the treaty,
will be a lame duck without much leverage in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians are facing a similar political problem right now.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee, a lame duck after only 14
months in office, said in recent interviews with news magazines
that it would be improper to sign the treaty before the election
unless he was able to build a consensus that includes the
opposition, led by the Congress Party. ``But I don't have much
hopes since we are in the midst of a do-or-die election,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His pessimism appears well grounded. K. Natwar Singh, chief
foreign policy spokesman for the Congress Party, said Vajpayee's
government had not kept the opposition well informed about the
details of its talks with the United States on nuclear issues. He
said there was ``no chance at all'' that Congress would support
signing the treaty before elections.
</P>
<P>
   In another interview on Wednesday, Singh was a little less
categorical, but still insisted the Congress Party was unlikely to
support a decision to sign the treaty, especially if the campaign
turns ``vicious and personalized.''
</P>
<P>
   Since India conducted nuclear tests a year ago, American
officials have invested heavily in diplomatic efforts to persuade
India to sign the treaty. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott
has held eight rounds of talk with Foreign Minister Jaswant Singh.
</P>
<P>
   Karl F. Inderfurth, assistant secretary of state for South Asia,
said the United States still hoped the Vajpayee government and the
Congress Party would find common ground on the treaty before the
election.
</P>
<P>
   ``We recognize the difficulty of moving forward with the CTBT
between now and the election, but we would hope the caretaker
government and the opposition would continue to see if steps could
be taken,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One senior State Department official said he hoped that progress
made in building closer ties between the United States and India
did not also get lost in India's political turmoil. ``Otherwise,
we're in danger of once again being ships passing in the night,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Relations between the United States and India may become more
contentious on nuclear issues if the Congress Party heads the
government.
</P>
<P>
   Singh, the Congress Party leader and a former foreign minister,
said the Congress Party was not willing to give up its demand that
the United States and the other major nuclear powers agree to take
steps toward disarmament within a defined time frame. Only then, he
said, would India agree to sign the test ban treaty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should we drop it?'' he said. ``They can go on having more
and more sophisticated experiments in their nuclear labs and there
are enough loopholes in the CTBT for the P-5 to do so.'' The P-5
are the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council, all
nuclear powers: the United States, Russia, China, Britain and
France.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile Pakistan is watching the political situation in India.
If the Congress Party wins, they wonder what will happen to the
efforts to improve relations begun by Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif,
and reciprocated by Vajpayee.
</P>
<P>
   After Pakistan's foreign minister, Aziz, listened to a
description of what Singh of the Congress Party had said about the
test ban treaty, he said, ``Did he say anything about continuing
the dialogue?''
</P>
<P>
   When Aziz's question was posed to him, Singh replied: ``Most
certainly we'll talk to Pakistan. We'll want to strengthen our
relations with Pakistan.''

SECURITY COUNCIL MEMBERS EXPRESS SHOCK AT BOMBING OF EMBASSY
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By JACQUES STEINBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ China convened a rare overnight session of the
Security Council early Saturday and condemned the NATO bombing of
its embassy in Belgrade as a ``flagrant attack'' that it said
constituted a ``crime of war and should be punished.''
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Security Council, as well as about a half-dozen
representatives of other countries, variously condemned the bombing
or expressed their sympathies to the Chinese. But China failed to
persuade the council to adopt a statement condemning the bombing as
a ``serious violation of international law.''
</P>
<P>
   The bombing, for which NATO took responsibility and expressed
``regret,'' left three people dead, with one person still missing,
and badly damaged the embassy building at about midnight in
Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even in times of war,'' said the Chinese delegate here, Qin
Huasun, addressing the emergency meeting of the council at 3:45
a.m., ``it is internationally recognized that the diplomatic
institutes should not be violated and that diplomats should be
protected.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We reserve our right for taking further actions,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, speaking to reporters briefly
in Washington later Saturday morning before addressing graduates at
the Howard University commencement, said he was ``rather shocked''
about the damage to the embassy.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a reason for continuing peace talks,'' he said. ``I
hope it will not unduly complicate our search for peace.''
</P>
<P>
   However, he added: ``Obviously it is not going to make matters
easy.''
</P>
<P>
   Overnight, the acting American representative, Peter Burleigh,
said that the causes of the bombing, which NATO said was a mistake,
were being investigated. ``NATO would never target civilians,'' he
said, ``and NATO would never target an embassy.''
</P>
<P>
   Burleigh urged the council members to keep their eyes fixed on
``the big picture'' and said that ultimate blame for the casualties
lay with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We worked for months and months and months on a negotiated
settlement with Milosevic,'' Burleigh said. ``He never agreed. And
as the world knows, he triggered a humanitarian catastrophe.''
</P>
<P>
   The delegates met for three hours behind closed doors, and then
for an 80-minute open session. But no clear consensus on the NATO
air campaign emerged from their statements.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the council president, Ambassador Denis Dangue Rewaka
of Gabon, emerged from the closed portion of the session at 3:20
a.m., rubbing his eyes, to report that the council members
``expressed their shock and concern over the casualties and
damage'' and ``expressed their sympathy and condolences to the
Chinese government and the families of the victims.''
</P>
<P>
   Several of the diplomats who spoke at the council's circular
wooden table Saturday morning took pains to alienate neither the
United States nor China, which could wield veto power to block any
peacekeeping initiative by the council, as Russia, the United
States, Japan and five other nations have reached a fragile
agreement on the need for an international force to protect Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We share our colleagues' distress and concern,'' said Jeremy
Greenstock, the British ambassador. ``This is a thoroughly
unpleasant crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   But Russian Ambassador Sergei V. Lavrov did not hesitate to
bludgeon NATO, of which Russia is not a member, condemning what he
called its ``unconscionable activities'' and ``military
adventurism'' in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day,'' Lavrov said, ``we hear reports of further
civilian casualties.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav ambassador, Vladislav Jovanovic, who has no seat on
the council but was permitted by the council president to speak,
cast the destruction of the Chinese Embassy as the latest instance
of ``illegal and brutal aggression'' by NATO. He characterized the
NATO strategy as ``hit anything, any time, anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   For Cuba and Iraq, two longtime rivals of the United States who
also attended the meeting overnight, the bombing offered an
opportunity to vent their own anger.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqi ambassador, Saeed Hasan, called NATO's ``targeting''
of the Chinese Embassy a ``barbaric act which violates the charter
of the United Nations.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Who knows which of the peoples of the third world will be the
next victims,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Cuban ambassador, Bruno Rodriguez Parrilla, said he saw
little need for a NATO inquiry into the attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is no accident, but rather an act of aggression,'' he said.
``There is not much to investigate.''

<P>
   DAMASCUS, Syria _ As Syrians turned out by the millions in
February to re-elect their leader of 29 years to another seven-year
term, the chant reverberating through this capital was ``Assad,
Assad forever!''
</P>
<P>
   But Hafez al-Assad turns 70 this year, and he is looking frail.
At times, his manner has seemed vacant, visitors say. Twice in the
last six months, he has canceled speeches to Parliament. His focus,
diplomats here say, has turned to smoothing the way for his son,
Bashar, to succeed him.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to describe Assad's agenda, a Western diplomat said: ``One
word: succession. It has become the filter through which everything
is filtered.''
</P>
<P>
   With the Clinton administration having vowed to try again in the
months ahead to promote peace between Syria and Israel, Assad's
fixation on succession has left some diplomats here concerned. They
say they worry that he may be less willing to make concessions out
of concern that domestic criticism would rebound against his son.
Still, if Assad is indeed feeling his years, the diplomats say, it
is conceivable that he might prove eager to secure peace as his
legacy.
</P>
<P>
   Assad has suffered from heart trouble and diabetes, and he
underwent a prostate operation in 1997. He was said to have been
suffering from flu in December, when his address to Parliament was
canceled with just 30 minutes' notice, and from hoarseness in
February, when he canceled another speech.
</P>
<P>
   On the latter occasion, he traveled to the Parliament anyway to
accept members' congratulations for his election. But otherwise, he
has rarely been seen in public.
</P>
<P>
   ``You remember that image of him as a kind of sphinx, with a
chessboard in his head?'' one diplomat said. ``If you saw him now,
you wouldn't think that.''
</P>
<P>
   There have been indications that Assad was testing Bashar, 34,
as a successor for at least two years. A British-trained
ophthalmologist, Bashar al-Assad returned to Syria in 1994, after
the death of his brother, Basel, then the heir apparent, in a car
accident.
</P>
<P>
   Bashar was plunged into a military career, and by 1997, his face
began to appear on posters that hailed Basel as ``The Example'' and
Bashar as ``The Future.''
</P>
<P>
   The president moved last year to eliminate two of Bashar's
potential rivals, dismissing Assad's wayward brother, Rifaat, from
his post as one of Syria's three vice presidents, and then
dismissing the army chief of staff, Gen. Hikmat Shehabi. Neither
man was said to get along well with Bashar.
</P>
<P>
   He then promoted Bashar for the fourth time in five years,
making him a full army colonel and putting him in charge of
relations with neighboring Lebanon, where Syria is the main power
broker. That job had been the preserve of another vice president,
Abdel Halim Khaddam.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the scenes, Syrians and Western diplomats say, the Syrian
leader has begun to promote army and intelligence officers loyal to
Bashar, creating what could prove an important power base.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Assad has remained cautious. Under the 1973 Constitution,
it is the governing Baath Party that has the power to nominate a
successor, and diplomats say Assad is aware that some of its
members harbor doubts about whether Bashar is prepared to be a
national leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anyone thinks he's ready,'' a Western diplomat
said of Bashar al-Assad. As long as such opposition persists,
diplomats say, the president's death could set off a struggle for
power.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of succession is a delicate one in Syria, in large
part because Assad, a former air force pilot, has maintained since
taking power in a 1970 coup that the choice of Syria's leaders is
up to the people. When asked by a French reporter last year whether
he wanted his son to succeed him, Assad answered vaguely, saying
only that his son had as much right to be active in politics as any
other Syrian.
</P>
<P>
   Bashar has been similarly coy. In an interview in February with
a Lebanese newspaper, he insisted that he was not seeking ``any
official position.'' But, he added: ``If the party command or the
rank and file call on my services to fill a certain position, I
will not say no. I am ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Bashar has begun to assume greater responsibilities,
traveling to Jordan in March, to meet with King Abdullah, 37, who
in February succeeded his father, the late King Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an exam or a test for Bashar to prove himself,''
Mounzer Moussly, an Assad loyalist and member of Parliament, said
of the young man's expanding portfolio. ``But I think he looks as
if he's sure of himself, and his father is sure of him.''
</P>
<P>
   The sense that a transition is under way has reached the point
that many in Damascus have predicted a show of acclamation in
support of Bashar. This would amount to an orchestrated outpouring
in which people took to the streets to demand that Bashar be given
more power and perhaps even elevated to the post left vacant when
Rifaat was dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   But some Syrians, including Riad Seif, another member of
Parliament, criticize the idea of such a spectacle. He said the
display would be seen as ``silly and old-fashioned,'' like the
weeks of staged tributes this year to celebrate the re-election of
Assad, the only candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even people like Seif are careful to say the affection
for Assad and his son is genuine.
</P>
<P>
   One obstacle to Bashar al-Assad's taking power is the fact that,
under the Constitution, a president must be 40 years old, an age
Bashar will not reach until 2005. But an effort to amend the
Constitution could find support, diplomats say, particularly if
Bashar al-Assad first proved his mettle on the Baath Party's main
policy-making body, to which he is expected to be elevated sometime
this year.
</P>
<P>
   People who have met Bashar describe him as a quiet, thoughtful
bachelor who wanted to pursue a career in medicine. But his return
to Syria was followed by a rapid switch.
</P>
<P>
   By late 1994, he had graduated as a captain from the Military
Academy at Homs after a course as a tank battalion commander.
Within two months, he was a major in the Presidential Guards,
continuing his brother Basel's fight against corruption. In 1997 he
became a lieutenant colonel and commander of the Republican Guards,
and last year he was elevated to staff colonel.
</P>
<P>
   He leads Syria's computer society. His associates say that
during his time in London, he developed an affection for the West.
</P>
<P>
   In the February interview, with the Beirut newspaper Al-Kifah
Al-Arabi, however, he sounded much like his father in criticizing
the decisions by Egypt, Jordan and the Palestinians to make peace
with Israel.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Bashar was never as popular as his brother, a champion horseman
and military man whose dashing bearded figure is still seen on
posters around Damascus.
</P>
<P>
   For years, prominent Syrians have expressed doubt that he would
have the toughness to stand up to people like his uncle, Rifaat,
who led tanks into the streets in a 1984 coup attempt against his
brother and, though exiled for a time, was never stripped of his
vice presidential post.
</P>
<P>
   But the removal of Rifaat and Shehabi, who for 27 years had been
the chief of staff, may have eliminated two obstacles. At the same
time, diplomats say, Bashar has begun to cement alliances,
including one with Assef Shawket, the deputy chief of Military
Intelligence, who is married to his sister, Bushra.

 &HT;    Coke debate: Fight or settle?
 &HT;    By David McNaughton
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The advice may be hard to swallow, but some crisis
managers and marketing specialists suggest Coca-Cola should settle
an employment discrimination lawsuit filed against the company.
</P>
<P>
   One former and three current employees sued April 22 in federal
court in Atlanta, charging the company discriminated against
African-Americans in pay, promotions, evaluations and terminations.
They also seek class-action status, which would raise the stakes
considerably for both sides.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the most important thing is that a company take a look
at what we call its trust bank, or how likable it is,'' said Eric
Dezenhall, a crisis manager and a founder of Nichols-Dezenhall
Communications Group in Washington. ``A company like Coca-Cola is
an extremely likable company.
</P>
<P>
   ``The general rule of thumb (for companies) with a high trust
bank is to keep it out of the news and settle it promptly,''
Dezenhall said.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola, which has not filed a legal response to the suit,
says it would be premature to comment on the issues, including on
the debate whether it would be more advantageous to fight or
settle.
</P>
<P>
   But in fact, attorneys say, most employment discrimination suits
are not resolved by trial, particularly class-action ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``If class action gets certified, generally they work out some
means of trying to settle,'' said Max G. Brittain Jr., a Chicago
attorney who specializes in employment law. ``The downside of going
through with the lawsuit is that the connection between Coca-Cola
and racism gets played over and over,'' said Pam Scholder Ellen, an
associate professor of management at Georgia State University who
specializes in marketing and advertising. ``In the long run, it may
not be worth the negative publicity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the easiest way is to settle,'' offered Asterios G.
Kefalas, a management professor at the University of Georgia and a
Coca-Cola shareholder. The benefit of doing so, he said, is that it
gets ``all the bad publicity off your back.''
</P>
<P>
   Not so fast, argued Martin R. Stoller, a professor of
organizational behavior at Northwestern University in Evanston,
Ill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why capitulate the moral high ground unless there is clear and
compelling evidence you don't deserve it?'' asked Stoller, who has
helped defend companies in employment-related litigation. ``A
vigorous defense of your innocence is my advice.''
</P>
<P>
   Stoller added, however, it is ``rare'' for a company to mount a
proactive defense like the one put on by Johnson &AMP; Johnson during
the Tylenol poisoning scare of 1982.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he said, ``the company will leap on its own sword
without being pushed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal of good crisis management is to fight on the
territory between what you did and how deliberately you are alleged
to have done it,'' Stoller said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Settlement is the safest course of action from a legal
standpoint,'' advised Ian I. Mitroff, a professor of business
policy at the University of Southern California and founder of the
school's Center for Crisis Management.
</P>
<P>
   If a company defends itself, it needs to be ``squeaky clean, or
you're going to make the crisis worse,'' Mitroff said. If the
allegations are not true and the defendant has hard facts to prove
they aren't, ``I would come out blasting.''
</P>
<P>
   The suit alleges a companywide pattern of discrimination, a
charge Coca-Cola Chairman M. Douglas Ivester has denied to
employees. He also issued a statement saying the lawsuit is without
merit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Discrimination at the Coca-Cola Co. is not tolerated,''
Ivester said in an e-mail to employees. ``If discrimination is
alleged, we investigate it. If we find it, we act to stop it.''
</P>
<P>
   Companies that find themselves under attack have to deal with
two courts, Mitroff said. One is the actual legal system, and the
other is public opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if you are not guilty, in the court of public opinion,
the burden of proof is on you,'' Mitroff said. He added that a
company has to ask itself, ``What's going to do the least damage?''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, calculating the long-range impact of publicity goes
into formulating strategy, according to attorneys. That apparently
is not lost on Cyrus Mehri, whose Washington-based law firm filed
the suit against Coca-Cola.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is a public dimension to (the suit), that's something
the company may have to deal with,'' Mehri said recently. ``They
are the most prominent company in Atlanta. There's an
African-American community there, and the African-American
community has a right to know what is going on in this company.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, said Northwestern University's Stoller, the publicity
is not necessarily going to affect business.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is unlikely, in my mind, that a customer of Coca-Cola is
going to make a change based on some as-yet-unproven allegation,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   -- Gregory Allen Clark, a security officer at Coca-Cola. The
suit charges ``he has been denied promotions on the basis of race,
and has been repeatedly denied the opportunity to even apply for
promotions, because of the common practice of filling supervisory
jobs without posting the positions.''
</P>
<P>
   -- Motisola Malikha Abdallah, an administrative assistant at the
company. The suit alleges she ``has experienced discrimination in
performance evaluations and in the terms and conditions of her
employment.''
</P>
<P>
   -- Linda Ingram, an information systems analyst at Coca-Cola.
The suit alleges she ``has been consistently paid below her grade
level and thousands of dollars less than comparable Caucasian
employees.''
</P>
<P>
   -- Kimberly Gray Orton, a former employee of Coca-Cola. The suit
charges she ``was significantly underpaid compared with comparable
Caucasian employees, was compensated at the low end of her pay
grade range, and supervised Caucasian employees who were paid more
than she was.''

LEFTIST DOVE IS NETANYAHU'S FAVORITE CAMPAIGN TARGET  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By DEBORAH SONTAG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEL AVIV, Israel _ There could be no more mild-mannered
lightning rod of controversy than Yossi Beilin, a soft-spoken,
bespectacled academic who is serving as the right wing's voodoo
doll in the current election campaign in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   While he is invisible on the public stage of his own Labor
Party, Beilin, a leftist, is prominently featured as archenemy by
the conservative Likud Party and its supporters. Sometimes it seems
as if Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is running against Beilin,
who is the fifth-ranking member of Labor's One Israel coalition,
rather than Ehud Barak, its more moderate leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can basically hear what Labor thinks by listening to Yossi
Beilin,'' Netanyahu said in a recent interview. ``What Yossi Beilin
says today, Barak will tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   In one Likud commercial for the May 17 elections, Beilin's head
pops out from behind Barak's like a jack-in-the-box. In another,
paid for by an organization apparently supporting Likud, Beilin is
nastily portrayed as a furry white, manicured lap dog with wire-rim
glasses and red _ nothing is subtle here _ ribbons. It is an
allusion to a cutting nickname that the late Yitzhak Rabin attached
to Beilin when he was a protege of Shimon Peres, the former prime
minister: ``Peres' poodle.''
</P>
<P>
   As the leading dove of his political generation and one who has
established a tight working relationship with the Palestinians,
Beilin, a political scientist, makes for a surer target and cleaner
hit than Barak, a highly decorated former general.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very flattering, really,'' Beilin said, sitting on a
black leather armchair in his sparsely decorated apartment. ``By
Netanyahu's logic, if he fails, then it's my victory. If I am the
monster Beilin who is the architect of the master plan of bad
things, and he loses, then my views win.''
</P>
<P>
   What Netanyahu most frequently refers to are Beilin's
negotiations with the Palestinian official Abu Mazen, which laid
out a blueprint including a Palestinian state with Abu Dis, a small
Arab town outside Jerusalem, as its capital. Netanyahu refers to
the Beilin-Abu Mazen agreement as if it were a secret document
unearthed by security agents, Beilin said, when it is something he
discussed openly in a recent book.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is, in a way, a promoter of my work,'' said Beilin, who
served as deputy foreign minister in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Outspoken, Beilin consciously tries to push the envelope of
political debate, introducing ideas before their time and watching
Israelis grow into them. While some mock him as a nutty radical,
others consider him prescient and the rare politician who speaks
his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our politicians are seldom blessed with Beilin's dedication,
industry and guts,'' Amotz Asa-El of The Jerusalem Post said on
Friday in a column headlined ``Who Is a Poodle?'' ``Now the ease
with which Beilin's depiction as a joke is both conceived and
received speaks volumes about our political degeneration.''
</P>
<P>
   Among his ideas, aside from the Palestinian state, that have
come to seem more mainstream are calls for a unilateral withdrawal
of Israeli troops from southern Lebanon and for a cessation of
Jewish charity from abroad to the prosperous Jewish homeland.
</P>
<P>
   As minister of economy and planning in 1995 and a champion of
good government, he also became the only Cabinet minister ever to
preside over the dissolution of his own ministry at his own behest.
</P>
<P>
   Among those ideas that have not caught on yet is a recent
proposal for ``secular conversions'' to Judaism, which would train
converts to become Jewish culturally but not religiously. While
Beilin thinks that it could be a mechanism to sidestep the Israeli
chief rabbis' objections to religious conversions that are not
Orthodox, many think the idea absurd and joke that the test would
feature questions like, ``What is a bagel?''
</P>
<P>
   Barak, in a recent interview, called Beilin the ``enfant
terrible'' of the Labor Party, suggesting that it is a role that
he, at 50, should have outgrown. But then they have a complicated,
if mutually respectful, relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Beilin challenged Barak for the party leadership in 1997,
calling it the race of the ``nerd against the macho,'' and lost.
But he remains popular, having captured second place in the party
primaries held last winter, and his criticisms of Barak have not
been forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not twin brothers,'' Beilin said. ``But there is a
platform that connects us.''
</P>
<P>
   In the campaign, elections, Beilin's role, like that of Peres,
remains behind the scenes. Beilin is the avatar of the retail
politician. Charged with getting out the vote among Israeli Arabs,
he travels the country village by village, even family by family,
attending weddings, parties and town hall meetings.
</P>
<P>
   ``They ask why is our campaign so hawkish,'' Beilin said of the
Israeli Arabs. ``They want to know why Barak is portrayed as a war
hero in all the commercials and not as a peace man. I remind them
about Rabin. I remind them that they hesitated to support Rabin
since he once broke the arms and legs of their brethren but that he
turned out to be an advocate for peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``I also remind them that when I ran against Barak inside the
party, there were many Arabs who said they couldn't support me even
though they felt closer to me because he, not I, could get the
votes of Israelis.''
</P>
<P>
   While polls show Barak with a firm lead over Netanyahu, Beilin
said he did not let himself believe them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot relax,'' he said. ``I told Barak this morning, `Don't
take seriously any good polls, only the bad polls.'''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about his place in a future government should Labor win,
Beilin said he knew that he is too controversial for top positions.
He said he felt that the next government should be broad-based,
moderate and ``not necessarily leftist'' in order to win consensus
for the big diplomatic decisions ahead, about the Palestinian
state, Lebanon and the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
   ``My influence does not necessarily have to be connected to a
job,'' he said. ``In a way, I've been more influential in
opposition than in many of my jobs in government.''

U.S. TO TRAIN POLICE LEADERS FOR INDONESIA IN RIOT CONTROL  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By PHILIP SHENON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration has decided to offer
riot-control training to the Indonesian police in preparation for
next month's national elections despite concerns from human rights
groups over the abysmal human rights record of the police there,
administration officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan, they said, a team of American police commanders
will be sent to Indonesia within the next several days to offer
training to their Indonesian counterparts in how to deal with crowd
control and riots, and how to improve relations between the police
and news organizations and opposition political parties.
</P>
<P>
   The training program was recommended by an American government
inspection team that recently traveled in Indonesia and found in a
report that the program ``could well reduce violence'' during and
after the election by offering techniques to deal peacefully with
crowds of anti-government demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said that the size of the American team and its
composition had not been decided but that it was unlikely to number
more than a dozen. The program, they said, has been approved
enthusiastically by the Indonesian government.
</P>
<P>
   The training program, which is being organized principally by
the State Department and the Justice Department, has drawn a mixed
reception from human rights groups.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Jendrzejczyk, Washington director of Human Rights Watch
Asia, said that his group would tentatively support the program in
hopes that it might prevent the sort of police violence seen during
anti-government riots last year in Jakarta, the Indonesian capital.
</P>
<P>
   But he offered a warning: ``If Indonesian police officers
trained by the U.S. end up mishandling crowd-control situations,
there could be a real backlash, especially from Congress. On the
other hand, it may be worth taking that risk if the level of
official violence can be reduced.''
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials insisted that the program was a modest
one, that only a relative handful of the police commanders of
Jakarta would receive the American training, and that Indonesian
human rights groups would help prepare the curriculum.
</P>
<P>
   But they acknowledged that the United States could face harsh
criticism if any of the police commanders who receive the American
training or officers under their control are later found to have
been involved in violence against protesters or other human rights
abuses.
</P>
<P>
   The Defense Department has been repeatedly criticized by human
rights groups and members of Congress for a similar cooperative
program with the Indonesian military, which has long been accused
of human rights abuses, including the murder and torture of
Indonesian dissidents.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 1,200 people, most in Jakarta, died during a spasm
of anti-government riots last year that culminated in the
resignation of President Suharto after 32 years in power. Most of
the deaths were blamed on the police or soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Suharto's successor, B.J. Habibie, has organized new national
elections to be held on June 7, and Indonesian officials and
diplomats in Jakarta fear that large political rallies in the
period before the election could dissolve into riots.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this spring, the Justice Department and State Department
sent a team of inspectors to Indonesia to determine whether
American police training might help control street violence in
Jakarta and elsewhere in that vast archipelago nation. The team
members included a private human rights lawyer and a deputy sheriff
of the Los Angeles County Sheriff Department.
</P>
<P>
   The report shows that the team agreed that the training could be
of value both before and after the election.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if the training begins only in May, the police could
receive sufficient training before the June 7 elections to be
better able to keep demonstrations from escalating to serious
violence,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Training ASAP could well reduce violence during the period
following the elections, when there is expected to be considerable
political violence initiated by political parties _ or their thugs
_ that are dissatisfied with the election results,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
   The investigators said that if the police were able to control
crowds peacefully, it might end the threat that Indonesian military
troops would step in, as has happened in the past. Until last
month, the police were formally part of the Indonesian armed
forces. On April 1, they were given nominal independence, although
they still remain under the control of the Defense Ministry.
</P>
<P>
   The report also called for nongovernment organizations,
including human rights groups, to be involved in preparing the
curriculum and in the training course itself.

 &HT;    SPOLETO FESTIVAL USA: Interview with Laurie Anderson
 &HT;    By Wendell Brock
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Still looking slightly spooked after all these years,
with the trademark spiky hair she cuts herself, performance artist
Laurie Anderson seems hermetically sealed in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   With the androgynous sensibility of Andy Warhol, the
anesthesia-soaked voice of William S. Burroughs and the eternal
presence of a Mapplethorpe photograph, she remains, at 51, the
queen of the experimental downtown scene she helped define more
than 20 years ago. She is one of the few artists who've stuck
around long enough to become an oxymoron _ having, as The New York
Times recently put it, evolved into the ``mainstream avant-garde.''
</P>
<P>
   On this day, at her Canal Street studio overlooking the Hudson
River, Anderson is wired for sound. Literally.
</P>
<P>
   Drinking coffee, breaking the filters off Marlboros before
lighting them up, she closes a window to drown out the noise of a
jackhammer, then decides later she wants to tape the intriguing
sound. We're here to discuss ``Songs and Stories From Moby Dick,''
the multimedia opera based on the Herman Melville novel. She's
bringing the piece June 3-4 to Spoleto Festival USA in Charleston,
S.C., but before this hour is over, she'll talk about everything
from her father's recent death to the time she taught poetry to
prisoners at Rikers Island.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in red loafers, gray socks, black pants, an orange tank
top and a meshy, chartreuse sweater, she shucks off her stern
demeanor when asked about the time in 1978 that she worked as a
migrant farmer with a family near Covington, Ky.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I was a cotton picker,'' she says in a country twang,
smacking her lips and sounding as if she's about to spit chewing
tobacco from her mouth.
</P>
<P>
   She had almost forgotten about her Rikers Island days, she says,
until she happened upon a set of purple notes from an old
mimeograph machine. ``It was a list of things like, `Always
remember your client is mentally ill.' And I thought, `I'm going to
put that on my desk right now, because that's a useful thing to
remember.'''
</P>
<P>
   This is the voice of a woman with a deadpan sense of humor and a
dark sensibility, a person who works with equal success as a visual
artist, filmmaker, poet, spoken-word performer, singer, musician,
stand-up comic and electronics wizard.
</P>
<P>
   Her influence has been profound.
</P>
<P>
   ``She really has changed the history of art in very big ways,''
says Roselee Goldberg, a New York University art professor and
curator who is writing a book on Anderson. ``I've taken the
opportunity to say loud and clear that she's indeed one of our most
important American artists at the end of the 20th century. She's
way up there, along with Warhol and (Robert) Rauschenberg.''
</P>
<P>
   Says Larry Larson, Anderson's company manager for the past two
years: ``I don't know of any other artist who is involved on an
international level with so many different disciplines. We work
with record companies. We work with international presenters. And
at the same time, we meet with the heads of the great museums of
the world.
</P>
<P>
   Professionally outgoing by necessity, Anderson is intensely
private. She never brings up the rock singer Lou Reed, for example,
even though he's been her boyfriend for six years. A
black-and-white photo of Reed hangs in the book-filled studio,
which is full of electronic instruments, a telescope pointed toward
the river and a scale model of the ``Moby Dick'' stage.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, who grew up in the small town of Glen Ellyn, Ill., in
the 1950s, has always embraced nonconformity and rallied for
individual rights. In 1987 she made a video titled ``Alive From Off
Center.'' In 1980, she performed at the anti-inaugural ball for
Ronald Reagan. The program notes to her 1989 album, ``Strange
Albums,'' contain a poignant letter to her friend Robert
Mapplethorpe, the controversial photographer who died of AIDS that
year. His images of Anderson grace the cover.
</P>
<P>
   After getting degrees in art history and sculpture, and putting
in her years of community service, Anderson launched her career in
1974 with a mixed-media performance art exhibition titled
``As:If.'' She played her trademark violin, which she has studied
since age 5 _ with her feet encased in blocks of ice.
</P>
<P>
   In 1983, her eight-hour version of ``United States'' was covered
by Newsweek and Time magazines. ``Big Science,'' the first of her
seven albums, sold 800,000 copies, and ``Strange Angels,'' with its
lush arrangements and conventional verse-chorus structure, signaled
that she had crossed over into the popular culture.
</P>
<P>
   She has given numerous concerts in Atlanta. In 1989, her
much-hyped Spoleto world premiere, ``Empty Places,'' so enraged
festival founder Gian Carlo Menotti that he banned her from the
sister event in Italy.
</P>
<P>
   But Anderson says she is looking forward to returning to
Charleston with ``Moby Dick.'' She says she enjoys Spoleto
audiences because ``they are up for something different.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People kind of go, `OK, this is an extremely bizarre thing,
and this is a classic.' They aren't afraid to mix 'em up.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Moby Dick'' is Anderson's most ambitious work to date and the
culmination of a 25-year obsession with the 1851 novel. It employs
three other actors, countless computers and a new gizmo called the
Talking Stick, which allows performers to manipulate computer
sounds and the sophisticated computer software that controls them.
</P>
<P>
   Something unknowable
</P>
<P>
   As a visual artist, Anderson has had a retrospective at the
Guggenheim Museum in SoHo, and an exhibition is planned for the
Whitney Museum of American Art. In the arcane world of ``Moby
Dick,'' Anderson seems to have found a perfect partner for her free
associational, image-driven narratives and her own bleak worldview.
When a visitor notices a picture of the Dalai Lamai in her
book-filled studio, he asks if she's Buddhist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a seeker,'' she says, turning on the mordant sense of
humor and evading the answer. ``I'm not in anything, although
that's part of my attraction to `Moby Dick,' that I am trying to
find something unknowable. I mean Melville's very funny, but he's
very dark, too. His conclusions, if there are any, are incredibly
bleak. That is, if there is something that created the world, it's
completely mechanical and it's heartless and it will eat you
alive!''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson says she's read the book five times. It's been a
recurring theme in her work since the 1974 film ``Dear Reader.'' On
the 1989 song ``My Eyes'' she crooned:
</P>
<P>
   ``And down in the ocean where nobody goes
</P>
<P>
   ``Some fish are fast, some are slow
</P>
<P>
   ``Some swim round the world, some hide below
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the ocean, so deep, so old.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson's two-hour production, says Spoleto director general
Nigel Redden, uses the book as a springboard. ``It will be a
combination of images in a variety of different media,'' he says,
``slides, video and laser, overlaid one on top of another. It's not
going to be a retelling of the Melville novel.''
</P>
<P>
   In exploring the world of Captain Ahab, Anderson echoes the
first line of her first album: ``Good evening, this is your
captain.'' She's always had a thing for airplanes; now she's on a
journey through water and the brain. Asked about the connection,
she says it's all about ``getting out of the box.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm having trouble getting out of the book, because the
book is a kind of box for me. So I've given up on telling the
story.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, who has always used technology to illumine the
banalities of modern life (answering machines, plastic surgery) and
to meditate on questions of spirituality, is asked for her thoughts
on angels and the afterlife. ``I think we are the closest to angels
there is _ that's what I think, and I think when you die, you turn
into rain, and then you disappear.
</P>
<P>
   According to her friends and colleagues, Anderson is as kind as
she is smart. ``First of all, she's just white-hot brilliant,''
says Larson. ``And she is also the kindest major artist I've ever
met, much less worked with. Laurie is up there with, say, Merce
Cunningham and Philip Glass as being a good human being as well as
being a great artist.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, there's a fragile core hidden underneath the
guarded surface. Anderson recently had to interrupt a vacation to
rush to the side of her 88-year-old father, who was dying of
cancer. She said a Buddhist friend coached her on how to ease his
departure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope I wasn't too irritating. But I did try to help him a
little bit, just by synchronized breathing and trying to make a
situation that wasn't too panicky, to try to encourage him to bring
his energy from the heart up to the top of his head so he could
come out that way. I do believe that is important, that you catch
the part of yourself that is the deepest and let that go, not just
die from your gut but have your heart pass through your head and
then out.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Anderson decides she wants to tape the articulated
sound of the jackhammer outside. She jumps up and goes down into
the bowels of her recording studio for a gigantic tape recorder,
which she clearly has no idea how to operate.
</P>
<P>
   In a moment, she leads her visitor to the elevator. When he
mentions that he might call again with questions about ``Moby
Dick,'' Anderson _ who has been acting a little anxious about not
having an end for the piece _ responds, without skipping a beat,
``And I'll call you if I have any questions about the structure,
too.''

 &HT;    NEW REFUGEE WAVE DESCENDS ON ALBANIA
 &HT;    With KOSOVO-WARCRIMES-0509; KOSOVO-CASUALTIES-0509.
 &HT;    By MARCIA KUNSTEL 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service

<P>
   MORINA BORDER POINT, Albania _ Tractors brought the first of the
new wave of Kosovar refugees on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Packed tight with people and bags, the carts began arriving
around 8 a.m. (local time) and numbered as many as 200.
</P>
<P>
   The caravan broke three days of relative border calm and began a
stream of refugees that continued unrelieved all day and into the
night, adding about 7,500 to the estimated 700,000 Kosovar
Albanians already made refugees in a nearly seven-week-long
campaign of ethnic cleansing, according to aid officials.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's arrivals came largely in groups, each with a
different story, all underscored by fear.
</P>
<P>
   The tractor caravan carried villagers from around Pec in western
Kosovo. Some reported shooting assaults drove them out of their
houses in recent days, while others said they simply had been told
to leave.
</P>
<P>
   These ethnic Albanians from an array of villages had been
gathered at a town called Staradara, where they said Serb police
and military formed them into a long convoy on Friday and sent them
packing.
</P>
<P>
   There were reports that scores of men were taken from their
families just before departure.
</P>
<P>
   One who was returned after being separated was Fatmir Husaj, 33,
who told of calling over his wife to say goodbye as he was put
against the wall of a school with more than 100 other men. She came
and they talked for an hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some police told her to get up and leave with the baby, and
then they released me, too,'' he said, weeping. ``As I was walking
away they said I was saved only because of my wife and child.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the others?
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody can say what happened to them,'' said Husaj.
</P>
<P>
   The second segment of Saturday's new wave began around 11:30
a.m. These refugees came in cars.
</P>
<P>
   They travelled not so far, less than 30 miles from the southern
Kosovo city Djakovica. They told of no trouble en route, yet many
arrived shaking and in tears, apparently after weeks of anxiety in
which they were afraid to leave, yet just as frightened of staying.
</P>
<P>
   Several in the carloads of refugees said fighting broke out
Friday night between Kosovo Liberation Army guerrillas or
self-armed civilians and Serb soldiers, and the quarter of town
called Cabrat was in flames.
</P>
<P>
   ``First they burned the houses, and then they shot from tanks,''
said Vyollca Gjarra, a 43-year-old mother.
</P>
<P>
   The KLA's Kosova Press agency also reported heavy fighting over
the past two days in Djakovica but gave no further details nor
casualties.
</P>
<P>
   By late afternoon another big group was walking over the border,
having been carried in six buses, courtesy of Serb police, from the
central part of the Yugoslav province of Kosovo to the town of Zhur
just north of the border.
</P>
<P>
   Mehti Avdullaliu, 58, said Serb police came Friday night to the
houses of Obelic, another village where people from around the area
had been gathered in past weeks when driven out of their homes. The
police said buses would arrive on Saturday and the people would
have to leave, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day they have gotten us outside and told us we would go.
Then they would turn us back,'' said Avdullaliu. ``For a month we
have wanted to come.''
</P>
<P>
   This time they did come, and the man said he was relieved.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finally we are 100 percent safe,'' he said.

<P>
   PRIMERO DE MAYO, Bolivia _ Ever since drought drove his family
from a rocky cornfield high in the Andes 15 years ago, Espinosa
Leon has been chopping down tropical rain forest to grow coca
bushes, which produce cocaine. Now, at 38, Leon finds himself at
another crossroads.
</P>
<P>
   ``The army is coming any day to destroy my last coca,'' said
Leon, who had already slashed three-quarters of his crop in recent
months in exchange for aid from U.N. technicians forming a forestry
project here. ``I don't have to like it, but coca has no future.''
</P>
<P>
   For the last decade Leon's turnaround would have been the rarest
exception in Bolivia, a country that has been a sponge for more
than $500 million in international money to fight the drug trade,
mostly paid by American taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   But life is fast changing in the Chapare lowlands, where only a
few years ago drug dealers weighed coca paste on scales openly in
the street and drug money flowed so freely that shirtless peasants
drank Chivas Regal.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Chivas days are over. CIA satellite surveys indicate
that last year Bolivia eradicated coca from 25 percent of the land
where it was grown in the Chapare, a region the size of New Jersey
that supplies 90 percent of the country's illicit exports.
</P>
<P>
   That pace has accelerated so far this year and new plantings are
increasingly scarce, senior U.S. officials say. These officials say
they are beginning to believe President Hugo Banzer might fulfill
his pledge to eradicate all of Bolivia's illegal coca crop by the
end of his term in late 2002.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bolivia is making history,'' said Donna Hrinak, the American
ambassador in La Paz. ``Bolivia has the potential of becoming the
first country ever to stop producing illegal drugs. A year ago no
one in the U.S. government would have come out and said that.''
</P>
<P>
   Anthony P. Placido, the chief of the Drug Enforcement
Administration operations in Bolivia, went further: ``The planets
and stars are in alignment to take Bolivia out of the drug
circuit.''
</P>
<P>
   But even the most optimistic U.S. officials concede that the
gains in Bolivia, and similar ones in Peru, have made little or no
impact on the availability of cocaine or its price or use in the
United States, in large part because growers in Colombia have
filled the gap.
</P>
<P>
   But even if the decline in coca growing here does not
significantly effect the world's drug trade, Bolivian officials say
they have their own reasons for eliminating the crop.
</P>
<P>
   Drying up a well for government and judicial corruption is
foremost among them, along with improving what even they concede is
a miserable international reputation that discourages foreign
investment.
</P>
<P>
   Bolivians still grow about 70,000 acres of coca and earn $300
million a year from the drug. And there is no assurance that the
resistance of coca growers, the difficulties they face earning a
living from other crops, or a policy shift by whoever succeeds
Banzer in 2003 will not slow or reverse Bolivia's gains.
</P>
<P>
   Bolivia had tried coca eradication for more than a decade,
relying mostly on incentives that paid growers to switch crops,
policies that by themselves had little effect and met great
resistance from growers. The difference now appears to be that
Banzer has mixed some sticks with the carrots.
</P>
<P>
   His so-called Dignity Plan, the government's counternarcotics
program, made a clean break from past U.S.-financed efforts, which
had netted an unremarkable 3 percent reduction in coca acreage
between 1993 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
   In years past, coca growers who were paid to dig up their bushes
and grow pineapples and bananas typically took the money,
eradicated one coca field and then cultivated another deeper in the
jungle.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials vainly ranted at one Bolivian president after
another for relenting under pressure from the growers and their
families, a political force of 50,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   But when he took office a little over a year ago, Banzer quickly
phased out the ``voluntary eradication'' approach, which paid
growers $2,500 for every 2.5 acres of land they cleared of coca
without guarantees they would stop planting.
</P>
<P>
   He offered to sign agreements with communities across the
Chapare under which they would receive credits, roads and technical
help to grow alternative, legal crops in exchange for promises that
they would never grow coca again. Any communities refusing to sign,
or breaking their agreements would face ``forced eradication,''
possible arrest and even forced relocation.
</P>
<P>
   So far 75 agreements covering about 7,000 growers have been
signed, officials said, with many more communities poised to
follow.
</P>
<P>
   These communities are typically composed of former miners and
mountain corn and potato growers who populated the Chapare in the
1970s when the taste for cocaine began to boom in the United
States. These growers have little experience growing tropical
produce, which means harder work fighting the pests and diseases
that accompany the less lucrative crops.
</P>
<P>
   The coca growers, known here as cocaleros, responded to the
eradication effort the way they always did when the government
intermittently turned up the pressure. Last March and April
hundreds of growers blocked the only major highway between La Paz
and Santa Cruz, the country's business center.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with such protests, previous governments had always
compromised. But Banzer sent 2,000 army troops to the Chapare to
clear the road forcibly and then ordered the soldiers to stay and
reinforce police eradication units.
</P>
<P>
   ``We decided we could not compromise on the principle that no
Bolivian family should live off crime,'' said Interior Minister
Guido Nayar Parada in an interview. ``The only way to recuperate
our credibility was with results.''
</P>
<P>
   Having failed to force government concessions, the coca growers
formed ``self-defense committees,'' which made a series of
hit-and-run ambushes on army and police units with sticks of
dynamite and old rifles. They killed three police officers and
wounded 15. In response, government units killed up to 12 growers
and, after a baby died inhaling tear gas, brought cries from
critics of human rights violations.
</P>
<P>
   By early June, the attacks had slowed the eradication effort to
a snail's pace, as the troops cutting down the fields were forced
to move in large, cumbersome units.
</P>
<P>
   Fearing a guerrilla insurrection, the government decided to send
units of the Anti-Terrorism National Center, a CIA trained and
financed agency, into the antidrug fight for the first time. The
intelligence agents paid informers in the cocalero movement and
captured code books, a list of terrorist leaders and maps that
showed where booby traps were laid to protect the coca fields,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   By July, the rebellion had collapsed and the most militant
cocaleros were forced to flee the Chapare. Over the next couple of
months, the cocaleros marched on La Paz, but their demonstrations
fizzled.
</P>
<P>
   ``The resistance has dropped,'' said Filemon Escobar, a longtime
union leader who advises coca peasant leaders.
</P>
<P>
   American and Bolivian officials still predict future violence.
But they say their security concerns have been reduced by changes
in the international cocaine scene that have created a power vacuum
at the top of the Bolivian drug world.

</P>
<P>
   Until five years ago, Bolivian coca was controlled by the
Colombian Cali cartel, which did everything from dictating the
quality of the product to shipping it to Colombia for refining to
trafficking it to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But under pressure from Washington, the Colombian government
jailed the top cartel leaders in 1995 and 1996. Meanwhile, a
Peruvian policy over the last four years to shoot down drug
trafficking planes persuaded emerging Colombian cartels to grow
their coca at home rather than depend on faraway crops.
</P>
<P>
   Brazilian-organized crime groups have tried to fill the vacuum
in Bolivia, but they have shown neither the experience nor the
resources to organize an armed opposition to the new eradication
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, more peasants are learning how to farm tropical
fruits and vegetables. Officials estimate that 9,000 families in
the Chapare are growing legal crops, compared with only 5,000 in
1992. But that still leaves 10,000 families in the region who still
primarily grow coca.
</P>
<P>
   Viewed overhead from a Bolivian Army helicopter on a recent
morning, the Chapare's coca fields looked frantically busy.
Hundreds of government troops dug up coca bushes while in adjacent
fields just a shout away hundreds more peasants picked their coca
bushes just as fast as they could. The soldiers were under orders
to let the peasants collect one last harvest to avoid any violence.
</P>
<P>
   On the ground, in the tiny settlement of California, a dozen
peasants appeared to be in a teary daze sitting over piles of
freshly picked coca leaves that covered the dirt floor of their
straw hut. Soldiers were tearing up their fields outside. And as a
radio blared a melancholy love song in the native Indian Quechua
language, peasant men dressed in colorful soccer uniforms expressed
the will to resist _ if they only had guns.
</P>
<P>
   ``This government can't last forever, so we'll just have to
wait,'' said a 24-year-old grower who would identify himself only
as Pedro. Because California lies in Carrasco National Park, one of
two in the Chapare, the government cannot offer the local growers
alternative crops.
</P>
<P>
   Since all agriculture is illegal on such lands, officials say
they will probably have to evacuate settlements like California
forcibly, a move that could include up to 7,000 families. The
government has so far delayed, trying to avoid political unrest or
crime.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually every coca community offers the government its own set
of challenges. The nearby settlement of Sacaba, for example, lies
outside park lands, but the 47 families who grow coca there have
refused to sign any agreements with the government. They say
previous governments had failed to meet their promises of helping
them develop an alternative pineapple crop.
</P>
<P>
   Banzer's troops did not wait for negotiations to conclude before
they destroyed all of Sacaba's coca. But in another break with
policy, the government offered to give Sacaba 45,000 pineapple
shoots for planting, worth $29,700, free of charge, as a
demonstration of good faith.
</P>
<P>
   The offer led to a contentious debate within the community, as
outside cocalero leaders argued that the acceptance of the shoots
would be a capitulation. But after a close vote, the community
accepted the plantings on March 17, and agreed never to grow coca
again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coca pays better than pineapple,'' said Ignacia Billazuel, 29,
as she chewed on a stalk of sugar. ``But what choice do we have?''

<P>
   While publicly confident that the attack on the embassy would
not have a lasting impact on their diplomatic efforts, the
administration appeared to be doing what it could to mollify the
Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright was trying to call the
Chinese foreign minister, Tang Jiaxuan, to express her sympathy, a
State Department spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, inspecting tornado damage in Oklahoma, has
not been involved in talking to the Chinese, a White House
spokesman said. He was expected, however, to comment on the bombing
later Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the outward confidence, the strike against the Chinese
Embassy comes as relations between Washington and Beijing have
soured over a number of issues. The Chinese have been very critical
of the NATO assaults against Yugoslavia, largely because they fear
that a precedent is being set that could allow interference in
Tibet. Trade disputes and allegations of Chinese espionage have
complicated relations further.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese showed earlier this year how they can wield their
diplomatic weight when they vetoed a Security Council resolution to
extend the mandate for a United Nations peacekeeping operation in
Macedonia. The veto was an expression of China's anger at
Macedonia's diplomatic recognition of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   At an emergency session of the Security Council called by the
Chinese at midnight on Friday night, emotions ran high. After hours
in closed-door session, the council expressed ``shock and concern''
over casualties at the embassy. In an open session, China and
Russia condemned NATO.
</P>
<P>
   China called the strike a ``war crime.'' The Russian delegate to
the United Nations, Sergei V. Lavrov, accused NATO of trying to
``destroy world order.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States has not had an chief delegate ambassador to
the United Nations since last summer. Its representative, Peter
Burleigh, apologized to the council for the mistaken attack and
urged council members to keep `the big picture' in mind as the
United Nations became a forum for seeking a diplomatic end to the
war.
</P>
<P>
   In Moscow, President Boris N. Yeltsin called on NATO to end the
bombing and said the attack on the embassy was a ``gross violation
of international law.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   He ordered his foreign minister, Igor S. Ivanov, to cancel a
long-planned trip to visit the British foreign minister, Robin
Cook, at his country home over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   But after speaking with Ivanov by telephone, Cook played down
the cancellation, saying the Russian minister remained supportive
of the principles set out on Thursday in Germany by the Western
allies and Russia to end the war.
</P>
<P>
   The bombing did not curtail the diplomatic efforts of Russia's
special envoy for the Balkans, Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, who arrived
in Germany on Saturday from Moscow to meet with Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder.
</P>
<P>
   As the NATO allies expressed regret, there was heightened
criticism of NATO in other parts of the world. In New Delhi, the
Indian government said the continued air campaign contributed to
greater instability in the Balkans.

U.S. TRIES TO LIMIT POLICY DAMAGE FROM BOMBING OF CHINA EMBASSY 
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration struggled Saturday to
prevent the accidental bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade
from either hobbling NATO's air campaign or stifling the nascent
diplomatic search for a way to end the war over Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The White House said the American ambassador in Beijing, James
Sasser, had apologized to the Chinese government and would continue
to provide Chinese officials with information on how the accident
happened.
</P>
<P>
   In an attempt to show sympathy with China, administration
officials said NATO would guarantee safe passage for a Chinese
plane being sent to Belgrade to evacuate embassy staff members.
</P>
<P>
   The attack against the Chinese Embassy came just as the
diplomatic process to end the Kosovo war had begun to gather steam,
raising concerns that the efforts could stall, particularly at the
U.N. Security Council, where China is a permanent member.
</P>
<P>
   The Western allies are banking on Russia's and China's support
for a Security Council resolution to authorize an international
security force in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Administration and NATO officials expressed confidence that the
emotional outpourings in Beijing, in Moscow and at the United
Nations, where China called an emergency session that lasted hours
past midnight Saturday, would be short-lived. They even suggested
that the accident might actually add urgency to the diplomatic
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will just have to ride it out,'' a senior administration
official said. ``Everyone recognizes this is an unfortunate
development.''
</P>
<P>
   The official said the administration had prepared itself for
more civilian casualties and mistaken hits as the price of a more
expanded air campaign, but had not counted on hitting the embassy
of a key Security Council member. There was little doubt that the
NATO military planners would take extreme caution in the coming
days about their targeting, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from the United States and other NATO countries said
they were prepared for some days of anger over the incident but
argued that since a U.N. resolution on the security force was at
least some weeks away, the accident need not affect the final vote.
It was unlikely, they said, that if Russia backed a resolution,
China would stand alone and veto it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe there is broad agreement to the contours of a
settlement and that the Chinese would not block it,'' a spokesman
for the National security Council, David Leavy, said.
</P>
<P>
   National Security Adviser Sandy Berger met with U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan at the White House on Saturday. Leavy
said Berger had expressed regret but had vowed that the air
campaign would go on. Before the meeting, Annan, speaking to
reporters briefly in Washington before addressing graduates at the
Howard University commencement, said he was ``rather shocked''
about the damage to the embassy.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a reason for continuing peace talks,'' he said. ``I
hope it will not unduly complicate our search for peace.''
</P>
<P>
   But he added, ``Obviously it is not going to make matters
easy.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon said Saturday that the accidental bombing of the
embassy would not affect the basic direction of its air campaign.
There will be no pauses in the bombing, said Pentagon spokesman
Kenneth H. Bacon, nor will NATO give advance warning of its targets
to neutral parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``NATO is determined to continue this campaign and to intensify
the campaign,'' Bacon said. ``I don't anticipate there will be a
pause. In fact, I see that there will be broadening attacks as NATO
continues to work toward its goals.''
</P>
<P>
   The round-the-clock air campaign has grown to include around 600
missions daily.
</P>
<P>
   In a step toward a diplomatic solution, the Russians agreed with
the Western allies on Thursday that a security force was necessary
in Kosovo to guarantee the return of the ethnic Albanian refugees.
</P>
<P>
   There are still considerable gaps between Russia and the allies
on the composition of the force, and Saturday administration
officials said they doubted that the embassy incident would
fundamentally affect those discussions.
</P>
<P>
   It was possible, a NATO official said, that the attack could
weaken the hand of the allies a little as they bargained with the
Russians on the composition of the force, which presumably will
enter Kosovo with the assent of Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   But overall, this official said, the attack should ``encourage
the Russians to be more forthright in sorting out the problems and
encourage the Russians to lean on Milosevic.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana called the bombing of the
embassy ``a tragic mistake.'' Apparently determined to show that it
would not deflect attention from the military campaign, NATO and
administration officials stressed Saturday the successful hits in
Belgrade on Friday night, including a bunker complex they said was
used by Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Solana said in a statement in Brussels that NATO would continue
its military campaign and at the same time back the diplomatic
track.
</P>
<P>
   ``NATO is prepared to suspend its air strikes once Belgrade has
unequivocally accepted the five key conditions set down by the
North Atlantic Council for a peaceful settlement of the conflict,''
Solana said. ``NATO will continue to support all attempts at a
diplomatic solution which respect these conditions.''

CLINTON ORDERS JOB RELIEF IN AFTERMATH OF TORNADOES  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   OKLAHOMA CITY _ As he prepared to tour communities devastated by
Monday's tornadoes, President Clinton announced in his weekly radio
address Saturday that he had instructed the Labor Department to
hire thousands of Oklahomans who lost their jobs in businesses
destroyed by the storms and that he would ask Congress for more
money for disaster relief.
</P>
<P>
   In a detour from what had been scheduled as a political trip to
Texas, the president also announced his support for a national
weather center for tornado forecasting at the University of
Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   Touring areas damaged by natural disasters ``is a duty I've
performed many times,'' Clinton said in the broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing I've learned,'' he continued, ``is that the
images we see on television can never fully convey the level of
sheer destruction or the depth of human grief. Yet I've also
learned that the worst of nature can bring out the best in
people.''
</P>
<P>
   The tornadoes killed 46 people and injured hundreds more in
Oklahoma and Kansas, with suburban areas around Oklahoma City the
hardest hit. About 12,000 homes were destroyed in the two states.
The list of the missing, which at one time numbered about 100
people, has been narrowed to three, and rescue workers said that
they may never be found.
</P>
<P>
   He said he had instructed the Labor Department to spend more
than $12 million to provide temporary jobs for 3,500 men and women
whose jobs were lost in the tornadoes. They will work at relief
centers and on construction crews.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll be able to feed their families by rebuilding their
communities,'' the president said.
</P>
<P>
   He also said he would ask Congress for an additional $372
million for the federal Emergency Management Agency.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton alluded to the political fault line that he believes
divides Democrats from Republicans, who favor reducing the
influence of government. ``The federal government,'' the president
said, ``has the responsibility to provide individuals with the
tools they need to improve their own lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton flew here from Texas. After returning to Washington on
Thursday night from meetings with allies in Europe on the war in
Yugoslavia, he spent Friday at political fund-raising events in
Houston and Austin that were expected to raise $700,000 for the
Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, he departed from his standard political speech to talk
about the tornadoes. At a lunch in Houston, where supporters
donated $20,000 per couple, he said:
</P>
<P>
   ``This maybe belongs more in a sermon on Sunday than a political
speech, but the lesson is, no matter how well America does, a
little humility is always in order. We are not in full control. And
we have to be sensitive about this, especially here in this part of
the country. We have to do more to try to prepare ourselves for
these storms, and we have to do more to try to minimize their
impact when they occur.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, at a poolside Mexican dinner at a supporter's home in
Austin, the president brought up the storms again. He said: ``I'm
thinking about what we can do to try to prepare better for the next
one. I'm thinking about what we can do if we know we're going to
grow and expand in areas that have been tornado alleys _ what we
ought to do to build houses that will do a better job of
withstanding them or have quicker escapes to places that will be
safer.''

YELTSIN CALLS CHINA EMBASSY BOMBING AN OUTRAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By CELESTINE BOHLEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Russian President Boris Yeltsin on Saturday condemned
the bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade as ``yet another
flagrant violation of international law'' by NATO leaders and
called on them to end their military action in Yugoslavia
immediately
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a blatant outrage, and there can be no justification
for it,'' Yeltsin said in a statement released by the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
   In his first reaction to the embassy bombing, Yeltsin ordered
Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov to put off a planned three-day visit
to Britain. Ivanov told journalists in Moscow on Saturday that
NATO's latest bombing error would ``seriously complicate the work
being done'' to negotiate an end to the war in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   He described the strike as a provocation and a challenge to the
world community that should be taken up again at the U.N. Security
Council on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   However, Russia's special Balkan envoy, Victor Chernomyrdin,
flew to Bonn for meetings with German leaders. Ibrahim Rugova, the
moderate leader of Kosovo Albanians, who flew to Italy on
Wednesday, was also expected to meet with Chernomyrdin, German
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin is expected to go from Bonn to Belgrade on his
third mission there in three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   In a joint statement signed in Bonn the week before last, the
foreign ministers of Russia and the world's seven richest countries
agreed to pursue a peace settlement at the United Nations, where
both China and Russia have veto power on the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   Last March, China joined Russia in condemning the NATO bombing
campaign, and Russian diplomats in Moscow said Chernomyrdin had
already been considering a trip to Beijing to negotiate the terms
of a U.N. resolution before a NATO bomb struck the Chinese Embassy.
</P>
<P>
   The embassy bombing could solidify Chinese support for a Russian
proposal to put any future peacekeeping operation in Kosovo
strictly under Security Council control. NATO leaders are insisting
that their troops be the core of such a force and that they be
under NATO command, with U.N. authorization.
</P>
<P>
   Russia, which has taken on the role of mediator between Belgrade
and the West, has pushed for a greater U.N. role, arguing that
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic will not accept NATO troops
in Kosovo, particularly from those countries that have taken part
in the bombing campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin's statement was one of the harshest he has made since
NATO began its attacks on Yugoslavia six weeks ago, and reflected
Moscow's concern that the conflict in Kosovo could spin still
further out of control
</P>
<P>
   It repeated warnings of ``very harsh consequences'' of continued
bombing for European security and stability, adding,
``Responsibility for those consequences fully rests with those who
masterminded this venture.''
</P>
<P>
   Ivanov went further Saturday, saying that those who were
launching military strikes ``must be punished appropriately'' and
warning that those who ``hope to escape punishment are seriously
deluding themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   As Russian diplomacy moved into high gear in recent weeks, the
stridently anti-Western tone in official statements had begun to
soften. Saturday, after the embassy bombing, a top military
official again accused the United States of pursuing global
ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   ``By attacking the Chinese Embassy, the United States
demonstrates the drive for a unilateral dictatorship of force to
meet its interests,'' the official, Leonid Ivashov, head of the
Defense Ministry's international liaison department, said. ``The
United States sent a strategic challenge to the world community
which can result in a global apocalypse.''

IN BREAK WITH NRA, TWO GUN GROUPS AGREE WITH SOME CLINTON
PROPOSALS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Colo., Okla., Pa.)  (rk) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Two groups representing gun manufacturers have
agreed in principle to back some of President Clinton's proposals
to clamp down on access to guns in the wake of the school shootings
in Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   The proposals are generally opposed by the National Rifle
Association, and the other groups' support for them is the first by
manufacturers for gun-control measures. The move signals a breach
among the powerful firearms interests over tactics as the
manufacturers try to take steps to appease public officials and
avoid costly lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   With Congress expected to begin debating gun-control legislation
this week, a split within the gun lobby could help gun opponents
portray the rifle association as an extremist organization and
begin to break the lobby's political hold on lawmakers,
particularly those from swing districts.
</P>
<P>
   The five proposals being backed by the two groups, the American
Shooting Sports Council and the National Shooting Sports Council,
include: raising the age limit for possessing a handgun to 21 from
18, while still allowing exemptions for hunting, target shooting,
employment and ranching; extending background checks to those who
buy guns at gun shows, provided that the records are eventually
expunged; banning juveniles who are convicted of violent felonies
from ever owning guns; prosecuting parents if they recklessly or
negligently allow guns to fall into the hands of children who then
use them to commit crimes, and expanding to 75 cities the
government's gun-tracing program, which is now under way in 35
cities.
</P>
<P>
   The proposals emerged from the annual meeting in January of the
U.S. Conference of Mayors. The industry has been working with
several of the mayors, notably Ed Rendell of Philadelphia, to try
to show a good-faith effort to reduce youth access to firearms.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Philadelphia has held off joining seven other cities in
filing potentially expensive lawsuits against the gun manufacturers
to try to recover the health and social costs of gun-related
violence.
</P>
<P>
   After the rampage by two students in a Littleton, Colo., high
school last month, Clinton announced a package of anti-gun
measures, many of which had been advanced by the mayors.
</P>
<P>
   In bits and pieces, spokesmen for the weapons manufacturers
publicly offered their backing for five of those measures, although
they, along with the rifle association, still oppose one that the
administration considers crucial _ restricting handgun sales to one
a month per person.
</P>
<P>
   The White House has called a seminar for Monday on youth and
violence and invited representatives of gun manufacturers. In
preparation for the seminar, Bruce Reed, Clinton's domestic policy
adviser, invited Robert A. Ricker, executive director of the
American Shooting Sports Council, and Robert Delfay, president of
the National Shooting Sports Council, to the White House, and they
met for 90 minutes on Tuesday to discuss the legislation. Also at
the meeting was Paul Jannuzzo, general counsel for Glock, a gun
manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   The White House has spurned the high-profile members of the
rifle association, not inviting Charlton Heston, the association's
president, or Wayne LaPierre, its executive director.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it has invited a member of the association's board,
Bill Brewster, a former Republican congressman from Oklahoma and
now a lobbyist in Washington. Reed described Brewster, who has gone
duck-hunting with Clinton, as ``an old friend of the president's.''

STUDY FINDS SOME STRATEGIES THAT HELP POOR STUDENTS LEARN
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Low-income students are making significant academic
gains in schools with educational strategies that include higher
standards and more personal instruction, parent involvement and
teacher accountability, according to reports made public last week.
</P>
<P>
   Education Trust, a nonprofit organization in Washington that
seeks to improve education for the poor, based its conclusions on a
survey of 366 elementary and secondary schools, in 21 states, that
had scored above average on standardized math and reading tests but
had poverty levels of more than 50 percent _ that is, at least half
of the students received free or reduced-price lunches.
</P>
<P>
   After adopting new teaching approaches, Public School 72 in
Buffalo displayed dramatic improvements in reading. Ninety-five
percent scored at or above grade level in the 1996-97 school year,
compared with the New York state average of 86.1 percent. The
previous school year, it had reported a score of 45 percent,
against a state average of 83.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In Gary, Ind., the Arthur Melton Elementary School stood out for
its math and reading scores, with 78 percent of students reading at
or above grade level, compared with the state average of 68
percent, and 91 percent in math, compared with 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Shallow Water Elementary School in Shallow Water, Kan., saw its
scores improve to 80 percent from 50 percent in math, compared with
state averages of about 45 percent for 1996 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The trust found that the schools that are doing well or have
improved shared five characteristics: increased learning time for
reading and math; money devoted to continuing education for
teachers and staff members; systems to monitor student progress and
provide extra help; efforts to involve parents in the day-to-day
learning process, and state or district accountability requirements
for teachers and the staff if students fail to show measurable
improvement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Poor kids can achieve at high levels if we teach them at high
levels,'' said Kati Haycock, the director of Education Trust.
``What remains to be done is for more schools to do what these
schools have proven can be done.''
</P>
<P>
   Another study, conducted by the Education Trust and the Kentucky
Association of School Councils, found that several schools in
Kentucky with a high number of poor students achieved the highest
scores on the state's standardized tests in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The study found that as a result of new teaching and
administrative methods, 5 of the 20 elementary schools with the
highest reading scores were low-income schools, as were 6 of the 20
with the highest math scores and 13 of the 20 with the highest
writing scores.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every child can learn,'' said Bob Sexton, the director of the
Prichard Committee for Academic Excellence in Lexington, Ky., an
advocacy group seeking education improvements in Kentucky. ``The
socio-economic barrier can be overcome with the pursuit of high
standards for every child. But we have a long way to go.''

FEMALE CADET GRADUATES AT THE CITADEL, A FIRST 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLESTON, S.C. _ She was not the first woman to gain admission
to the Citadel, but Nancy Mace on Saturday became the first female
graduate of this 156-year-old state-supported military college.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mace, 21, became a cadet in the fall of 1996, just months
before her father, J. Emory Mace, a retired Army brigadier general,
became the Citadel's commandant of cadets.
</P>
<P>
   She has fulfilled the dashed dream of the first female cadet,
Shannon Faulkner, who was admitted in 1995 following a federal
court order that was fiercely contested by the Citadel and the
state of South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Faulkner's victory was shortlived. She left the college
after less than a week, citing isolation and stress.
</P>
<P>
   The Citadel now has 42 women among the 1,700 cadets and expects
to have as many as 90 women next year, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mace has remained largely aloof from the news media in her
three years at the Citadel. But she lowered her guard slightly as
graduation approached, appearing, for example, with her father and
mother on the ABC program ``Good Morning America'' on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Though she values the conservative traditions of the corps, she
sees herself as a trailblazer for women with similar ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted an opportunity to join the long, gray line. I
think I am paving the way for other women,'' Ms. Mace said in an
interview with the Charleston newspaper, The Post and Courier.
</P>
<P>
   In the fall of 1996, Ms. Mace entered the Citadel with three
other women, but their integration into the harsh military culture
did not go smoothly. Two of the women, Kim Messer of Clover, S.C.,
and Jeanie Mentavlos of Charlotte, N.C., quit that winter, citing
hazing, harassment and abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Several male cadets were disciplined after an investigation of
the accusations.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth woman, Petra Lovetinska, is an upperclass cadet.
</P>
<P>
   What the institution seemed to yearn for more than anything was
a sense of normalcy, for a time when the graduation of a woman
would no longer be news. `This marks the end of the transition,''
said Brig. Gen. Roger Poole, the chief academic officer of the
college and presided over the admission of Nancy Mace and her three
classmates
</P>
<P>
   ``From the day Nancy Mace and the three others stepped onto this
campus, we were committed to seeing them graduate,'' Poole said.
``We're just sorry that only two of them will make it to
graduation.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Ms. Mace's name was only mentioned in the graduation ceremony as
she walked across the stage and received her diploma from her
father, who is also a Citadel graduate. Her brief appearance was
greeted with long and enthusiastic applause from many in the
audience and reserved smiles from her military family as she raised
her diploma in triumph.
</P>
<P>
   And her understated place in history was just as she wanted it
to be.
</P>
<P>
   Following the ceremony, she briefly met with reporters and said
she just wished that her fellow cadet, Petra Lovetinska, could have
been on the graduation list with her. Ms. Mace graduated after
three years at The Citadel because she transferred credits from a
community college.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how they had changed The Citadel, Ms. Mace and Ms.
Lovetinska smiled at each other and said as a chorus: ``for the
better.''

 Taking a dip into the mailbag  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The choice was to either blow off Saturday's column before
leaving on a long getaway weekend, or dip into the mailbag and
leave the writing to the readers:
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to comment on your article on `Congress, not the IRS,
is the problem.' I just spent three months working (two days a
week) at the Johnson County Library doing voluntary free tax
preparation for elderly or low-income persons. Many availed
themselves of this free service, but many did not, either because
they didn't know about it or it wasn't close to where they lived.
That means many many people...had to pay somebody else to help them
prepare their return....That enormous cost is directly related to
what you call the `tax code's complexity (and) body of
incomprehensible law' and has nothing to do with the IRS.''
</P>
<P>
   {Dear Fuming: Your grass-roots experience should be legally
required of every member of Congress and every member of every
tax-writing congressional committee. Such a law would force
Congress to adjourn from March 1 to April 15 each year to provide
everyone involved in tax policy the opportunity to perform tax-help
volunteer service. Then perhaps we'd get some simplification.}
</P>
<P>
   Moving from Main Street to Wall Street, our next contributor has
been pondering the last memorable occasion when everyone reassured
us, ``This time it's different.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I read your (column) on the value of Web stocks and was
reminded of something I read...about stocks in the late 1960s,
which were known as `the Nifty Fifty.' (I)nvestment managers
defined (their) risk not as the risk of overpaying (for them), but
as the risk of not owning them.''
</P>
<P>
   {Dear Sentimental: Ah, yes, those were the days, my friend, we
thought they'd never end (to quote the lyrics of a popular song
back then). Some of the Nifty Fifty companies are once again
nifties, but none escaped the damage of the 1973-74 bear market and
ensuing years in the doldrums. Meantime, it's worth noting, many
erstwhile nifties have long since been relegated to the trash heap
of Wall Street history.} &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What would a mailbag column be without a letter about Social
Security? It would be a mailbag column that ignores much of the
mail's focus. Here's one, though, with a different wrinkle.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of smoke is being blown about Social Security....The
question I have is this: Is the private sector any better off?
Right now, the stock market is flying high, (but) what's going to
happen when the baby boomers decide to stop throwing cash at the
market and start saying, `I want to cash in my stocks for some real
money'? I would think there is going to be a liquidity crunch.''
</P>
<P>
   {Dear Curious: It could happen, and probably will someday. But,
then, demographic trends ebb and flow in the same way the stock
market's strength does. There are a couple of key differences
between the Social Security situation and the stock market. One is
that buyers and sellers determine a stock's market value. The
Social Security trust fund comprises nonmarketable securities
representing claims against the Treasury. This means the fund is an
accounting fiction containing IOUs whose value depends on the
willingness of society to honor the debt.}
</P>
<P>
   Keep those cards and letters comin', hear?

ENVIRONMENT AND POLITICS ENTER DEBATE ON JUDGESHIP  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By NEIL A. LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Ted Stewart, chief of staff to Utah's governor,
would not seem a likely choice for President Clinton to want to
nominate as a federal judge.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart has been a veteran aide to several Utah Republicans. A
lawyer who headed the state's Natural Resources Department, he has
been a harsh critic of the president's land-use policies and
politics and, in turn, has been disliked by major environmental
groups. Nonetheless, the White House has decided that it will
probably soon name Stewart to fill a vacancy on the U.S. District
Court in Utah, a senior administration official said this week.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart's most compelling qualification, as far as the White
House is concerned, is that he has been proposed by Sen. Orrin G.
Hatch, the Utah Republican who heads the Senate Judiciary
Committee. As chairman, Hatch has enormous influence over the
administration's other choices to be federal judges.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, White House officials say that unless they agree to
nominate Stewart to the bench, they believe Hatch will block
several of their other judicial candidates. Hatch's aides depict
that fear as an exaggeration, arguing that they merely want a
decision soon on whether the president will nominate Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   The case of Stewart illustrates the sometimes tangled and
strange politics behind who gets to be a federal judge at a time
when that issue has become immensely politicized. Stewart's
candidacy has involved not only the president and a powerful
senator but also Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who is seen by the environmental groups as their greatest
supporter within the administration, has been pressed by them to
block the nomination. But Gore, in the words of one White House
official, ``has taken a pass on this one,'' choosing not to try and
buck the larger political issues involved.
</P>
<P>
   While administration officials may believe that if they do not
accommodate Hatch he will not allow any other nominations to go
forward, Hatch's aides deny that is so. But the senator told
reporters for Congressional Daily and The Deseret News in Utah that
he recently spoke by telephone with the president to press
Stewart's nomination. Hatch was quoted as saying that the president
assumed that his nominations were being held hostage to the Stewart
nomination ``and I did not disabuse him of that notion.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatch's spokeswoman, Jeane Lopatto, said the Judiciary Committee
had, in fact, processed some nominees in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``One would think that given Senator Hatch's demonstrated
bipartisan consideration of judicial nominees,'' Ms. Lopatto said,
``the White House would have made a decision on this particular
judgeship, which has been vacant since November 1997.''
</P>
<P>
   The Utah Democratic Committee has sent a letter to Clinton
opposing the Stewart nomination, as has a coalition of the
Wilderness Society, the Sierra Club, the Natural Resources Defense
Council, Defenders of Wildlife, Friends of the Earth, the National
Environmental Trust and the Environmental Defense Fund.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic committee letter describes Stewart as a ``highly
partisan political operative'' who should not be given a lifetime
judicial appointment by a Democratic president. The environmental
coalition complained about Stewart's tenure as director of the Utah
Department of Natural Resources, saying that, among other things,
he worked to reduce the ability of the department to protect
wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Wetstone, legislative director for the Natural Resources
Defense Council said, ``We just think that Orrin Hatch should not
have to be rewarded with the right to name Utah's version of James
Watt to the federal bench.''
</P>
<P>
   Nan Aron, director of the Alliance for Justice, a liberal
Washington group that monitors judicial selection, said that if the
Clinton White House nominated Stewart it would be ``an abdication
of their constitutional responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   But Cullen Battle, a Salt Lake City lawyer who is active in
environmental causes and represents the Sierra Club and the Nature
Conservancy, said he believed that it was unfair to depict Stewart
as an anti-environmentalist.
</P>
<P>
   Battle said that when Stewart was the head of the Natural
Resources Department, he was a strong supporter of habitat
protection throughout the state.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, who since 1992 has worked under Gov. Michael O.
Leavitt, a Republican, declined to comment when reached in Salt
Lake City.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ At the crest of the massive Sunshine
Skyway Bridge, 200 feet above the jade-colored waters of Tampa Bay,
Gary Schluter and James C. Covert of the state Highway Patrol have
to persuade people poised on the edge of their own destruction to
step back slowly, and live.
</P>
<P>
   It happens again and again to these men and others who patrol
the bridge on Florida's west coast. They regularly find a car
pulled to the side of the span and see a woman or man sitting or
standing on the concrete railing, watching one last sunset, working
up the nerve.
</P>
<P>
   Then, their nerves humming, the patrolmen try to convince
complete strangers that lost loves, lost jobs or feelings of lost
youth are not reason enough to step off into thin air.
</P>
<P>
   ``People look at that water and think it's very serene, an easy
way to die,'' said Schluter, a 45-year-old corporal who, in two
years, has been credited with saving four lives on the Sunshine
Skyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more like hitting concrete,'' said Schluter, who has seen
the number of suicides, and attempts, climb steadily over the last
few years. Like Covert, a 28-year-old trooper who talked down three
people in four days in May 1998, Schluter has little or no formal
training in suicide prevention.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Sunshine Skyway is no Golden Gate Bridge, where more
than 1,200 people have killed themselves in the six decades since
the bridge was built, a rising number of suicides here has
officials concerned. At the urging of Gov. Jeb Bush, state
transportation officials are expected to build a barrier _ perhaps
even a net to catch jumpers _ and install telephones that would
quickly connect counselors to people considering suicide at the
Sunshine Skyway.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, six people jumped to their deaths from the bridge, and
five people were persuaded not to jump, according to police
reports. Eight people killed themselves there in 1997, but 11
others were saved after being talked down by state troopers,
sheriff's deputies and counselors.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Schluter said, 12 people jumped to their deaths from
the bridge, and about the same number were persuaded to reconsider.
In the first four months of 1999, five people died in suicides on
the bridge, according to police reports, and at least four were
saved, troopers said.
</P>
<P>
   The bridge is more than four miles long, and the troopers have
often been the only rescuers who make it in time to intervene. They
must get to know someone in a few minutes, understand why the
person has given up on life and search that stranger's past for a
reason, any reason, to go on living.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they have children, I try to get them to think about their
children,'' said Covert, who has saved four people.
</P>
<P>
   It is a drama that takes place almost in the clouds, so high
that the sailboats that pass underneath look like toys in a
bathtub, and most often it is just the two of them, the desperate
stranger and a new best friend.
</P>
<P>
   The bridge, as much a fixture on west Florida postcards as
alligators and orange groves, was born in tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   On May 9, 1980, the freighter Summit Venture slammed into one of
the pylons of the old bridge, also named the Sunshine Skyway, and
knocked a part of its span into the bay. Eight vehicles, including
a bus, fell into the water. Thirty-five people were killed.
</P>
<P>
   The state closed that bridge and, over years, built a massive
new Skyway, which opened in 1987 with majestic yellow cables that
rise from its center span to towering concrete posts. The bridge is
also a toll road costing $1.
</P>
<P>
   The ones who jump usually do so before help arrives, leaving
their cars and sometimes notes, apologizing, asking somebody to
look after a house or feed a cat, the troopers said.
</P>
<P>
   If the troopers get there in time, they must be gentle, though
their own hearts are pounding so hard it almost hurts, because if
their words are clumsy, if their movements are too forceful, they
may crumple what hope the people hold. Here, so high, hope is the
next-to-last thing they lose.
</P>
<P>
   Once, when a man on the bridge said he was afraid of going to
jail, Schluter took off his gunbelt and his shirt, to be less
threatening.
</P>
<P>
   It all unfolds with the troopers knowing that the despondent,
unstable people could reach for them in desperation and,
accidentally or not, drag them into the water. The railing is a
thin concrete barrier about three and a half feet high.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's dangerous for us,'' Schluter said. So he tries, he said,
to stay out of reach.
</P>
<P>
   On New Year's Day, Schluter found a man sitting on the rail, his
legs dangling over the bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a long way down,'' Schluter told him as he walked
carefully up to him. The man had tears running down his face.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you agree not to jump for 15 minutes,'' he added, ``I will
agree not to try and stop you for 15 minutes.'' So they just
talked. He found out the man was in debt, that he was despondent
over family problems.
</P>
<P>
   They talked for about 40 minutes, calling each other by their
first names. But the man seemed hurried by, of all things,
backed-up traffic that had been caused by the drama on the span. It
was as if he was sorry for causing others an inconvenience.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `Gary, I'm really sorry but I really have to go,' and
he started inching himself closer and closer,'' to the edge,
Schluter said. Believing he was losing the man, he broke one of his
own rules.
</P>
<P>
   He motioned for another officer to inch up close behind his own
back, close enough to grab onto him in case the man tried to take
him over the wall, then he gently laid a hand on the man's leg.
That simple touch, Schluter said, seemed to break through the
bubble of the man's hopelessness.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what I needed,'' he told Schluter.
</P>
<P>
   He came down off the wall and meekly allowed himself to be
handcuffed and taken to nearby St. Anthony's Hospital. Under the
law, officers can take someone into custody and deliver the person
to a mental hospital if he is a potential danger to himself. Most
of the people who attempt suicide on the Sunshine Skyway are held
for at least a while under the law, for evaluation.
</P>
<P>
   Schluter and Covert do not know of a single person who attempted
suicide again on the bridge, or elsewhere. Schluter gives his
business card and beeper number to the people he talks down, in
case.
</P>
<P>
   Given a second chance at life, he said, most people use it. In a
study of prevented suicides on the Golden Gate Bridge, researchers
found that would-be jumpers rarely tried again.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The troopers do not think the people they talk down are just
trying to get attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that everyone who goes up there has the intention of
going through with it,'' Covert said. One was a woman who had been
in an abusive relationship, and one had lost her job. Two others
had lost jobs and lovers, and just gave up.
</P>
<P>
   ``They feel they've exhausted their options, and this is the
last part of their lives they have control of,'' Covert said. ``I
tell them this is a permanent solution to a temporary problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Jumpers tend to die ugly, the troopers said. The fall, less than
four seconds, ends in a bone-snapping, organ-rupturing trauma, but
some jumpers do not lose consciousness, and drown in agony.
</P>
<P>
   He cannot imagine the hopelessness that sends them up that steep
incline. Sometimes, Schluter said, people hand a toll booth
operator their wallets and say, ``I won't be needing this any
more.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, he can prove them wrong.

NEW MUSEUM TRACES HISTORY OF DRUGS IN THE U.S. 
</HEADLINE>
  (ART ADV: A photo is being sent. Non-subscribers can make

(DW) 
 By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Franklin Delano Roosevelt hated fascists. He didn't
like drug dealers either, ranking them barely above murderers as
the worst sort of criminals.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the case of murder, you take away the life of a fellow
human being,'' President Roosevelt said in 1940. ``In the case of
distributing narcotics, you take away the mind of the individual
and make his life intolerable for the good of his own soul.''
</P>
<P>
   Roosevelt's sentiment is, not surprisingly, shared by the Drug
Enforcement Administration. It has given his remark prominence in
its new museum on drugs, which opened last week at the agency's
headquarters in Arlington, Va.
</P>
<P>
   The agency, whose personnel spend much of their time pursuing
drugs and thugs in secret operations, is not known for operating in
the limelight. But Terry Parham, a special agent who is acting
chief of public affairs, said the new museum and visitors center is
consistent with the agency's mission. ``We try to get understanding
from the American people on what the problem is all about,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to early expectations, the museum is short on
propaganda celebrating the agency's exploits. Some displays verge
on whimsy, like a presentation of the early ``tools of the agent's
trade'' _ a Thompson submachine gun and a pair of standard-issue
hand grenades. There is also a clumsy pair of green platform shoes
worn by a bell-bottomed agent who infiltrated Detroit's music scene
in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   The museum's curator, Jill Jonnes, said the museum tries to give
context and coherence to the whole national experience with drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was really lost history,'' said Ms. Jonnes, the author of
``Hepcats, Narcs and Pipe Dreams: A History of America's Romance
with Illegal Drugs'' (Johns Hopkins University Press, 1999).
``Everyone in this country knows of heroin,'' she said. ``Almost
nobody knows it was a pharmaceutical product introduced by Bayer''
a century ago.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the museum entrance are three storefronts representing
changing views of drugs in America. There is a benign drug store in
1940, when people looked at drugs as more of a help than a
hindrance. There is a ``head shop'' displaying rolling papers for
marijuana, colored glass bongs, or pipes, and other drug
paraphernalia used in 1970. There is a crack-house door through
which crack cocaine was sold in 1990. Beyond the hole in the
reinforced steel door is a bleak photograph of children playing
with a pile of crack vials.
</P>
<P>
   The museum entwines three themes: the trends in the popularity
of drugs, society's reactions to those trends and the evolution of
federal drug enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   The history of drug use in the United States begins with the
opium-smoking of some Chinese immigrants who joined the California
gold rush, which started in 1849.
</P>
<P>
   The displays move on to the Civil War, when wounded veterans
returned home addicted to morphine, a painkilling opiate, in what
was called the ``soldier's disease.'' By the late 19th century,
genteel ladies with discreet access to doctors and legal opiates
made up the majority of addicts. Laudanum, a form of opium, cost 28
cents for a three-ounce bottle from Sears, Roebuck &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   In 1885, cocaine was introduced as an elixir for every ailment
from depression to hay fever. A yellow label on display briskly
instructed users: ``For catarrh and all head diseases, snuff very
little up the nose five times a day until cured; before bedtime put
grease up the nose, wash out with warm water next morning.''
</P>
<P>
   Another advertisement urged mothers to give cranky children a
dose of Mrs. Winslow's Soothing Syrup, which was laced with
morphine. The museum displays an ensuing death certificate from
Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   By 1900, one in 200 Americans was addicted to opiates or
cocaine, according to the museum. The typical user was a white,
middle-class woman who became addicted through well-meaning medical
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives you a sense of how many people were routinely using
drugs,'' Ms. Jonnes said, describing what she called the forgotten
epidemic.
</P>
<P>
   Marijuana rose to prominence in the 1930s. The museum offers
lyrics for a jazz song extolling marijuana in 1938: ``When your
throat gets dry, you know you're high, everything is dandy.'' There
is an enlarged photograph of a marijuana smoke-in by Michigan
college students in 1978. By that time, a caption reports, more
than one-third of the nation's adults and one in five teen-agers
were frequent drug users.
</P>
<P>
   Drug dealers had more sartorial class in the old days, judging
by a display of surveillance photographs of an undercover drug
purchase in Baltimore in 1940. The pushers wore jackets, ties and
straw boaters.
</P>
<P>
   Exhibits of smuggling devices include a lime-green surfboard
hollowed out to conceal packets of drugs, and a cuddly Paddington
Bear stuffed with money from drug sales.
</P>
<P>
   The profits of drug smuggling are manifested by the .45-caliber
pistol, elaborately engraved and encrusted with diamonds, that
Rafael Caro-Quintero, a Mexican drug trafficker, was carrying when
he was captured in Costa Rica in 1985. Another such souvenir is a
$35,000 chrome Harley-Davidson motorcycle, confiscated from a
Hell's Angel who is in prison for selling drugs.
</P>
<P>
   A gallery shows photographs of rock stars killed by heroin,
including Janis Joplin and Jimi Hendrix.
</P>
<P>
   ``The overall point of the museum is that drugs have exacted a
significant toll on us as a society,'' Ms. Jonnes said, ``and we
want to tell that story in a very accessible way.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael R. Harris, a museum consultant who helped design the
displays, said he hoped to put the exhibits on a CD-ROM for
schools. ``It needs to be brought into the classroom and talked
about,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The 2,200-square-foot museum is open from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.,
Tuesdays through Fridays, to visitors who make an appointment (202)
307-3463 and clear the metal detector at the entrance to the
agency.

HOUSTON AND SPREWELL EACH SCORE 22 POINTS AS KNICKS ROUT MIAMI  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Every past fight had been dredged up, and so had all the
history between the Heat's Pat Riley and the Knicks, in an electric
buildup that reflected the hostility between these two teams.
</P>
<P>
   But playing with uncommon poise, the Knicks pulled out an effort
Saturday that few would have guessed they were capable of after
their dysfunctional season, and took the edge right off the hype.
Unselfish and efficient, the Knicks overwhelmed a shell-shocked
Heat team, taking Game 1 of the first-round playoff series, 95-75,
at the Miami Arena.
</P>
<P>
   It began with a 10-point first-quarter lead. The Knicks just
kept on coming. They never let the Heat believe they had a chance.
With everyone contributing _ from Allan Houston (22 points) to
Latrell Sprewell (22 points), from Larry Johnson to Charlie Ward _
the Knicks relentlessly built a 17-point halftime lead and were up
by 81-55 with seven minutes left in a game the Heat gave up on.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from Alonzo Mourning's 27 points, the Heat had little to
offer. Tim Hardaway made only four of 19 shots and finished with 10
points. An exasperated P.J. Brown didn't even stick around for the
end. After flailing at Chris Childs, and picking up two
back-to-back technicals, he was ejected with 7 minutes 48 seconds
to play.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks held a 70-54 lead entering the fourth quarter after
playing as confidently and together as they had all year.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks' 48-31 lead at the half gave them the kind of cushion
they needed to absorb the fury of the Heat in the third quarter.
Whatever motivational tricks Riley had left in his bag, he pulled
them out and threw them in his team's face.
</P>
<P>
   Hardaway, who hit just one of nine shots in the first half,
responded with a 3-pointer to open up the third quarter, and the
Heat seemed ready to roll up some points. But then Jamal Mashburn
missed an open 3-pointer and Hardaway missed another, while Johnson
broke free for back-to-back 3-pointers to disrupt the Heat's
intentions to surge back.
</P>
<P>
   As the third wore on, the defensive intensity by both teams took
over. With Mourning jumping up and down around the basket to block
shots, the Knicks began to miss where they had been hitting
earlier. They missed eight shots in a row and allowed the Heat to
peck away at them and cut the lead to 58-48 with 3:31 left in the
third.
</P>
<P>
   But the Knicks weathered the series of mini-runs. Ewing, who had
not been a factor, came up with a 3-point play after a runner fell
in and he was fouled. As an encore, Ewing then blocked a layup by
Jamal Mashburn. In transition, Johnson was left alone to pop a
back-breaking 3-pointer with 53 seconds left in the quarter.
Suddenly, the Heat, who had pulled to within 10 points a minute
earlier, were behind by 68-52. The Knicks ended the quarter
leading, 70-54.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks had shaken the dreams from their heads and popped out
of bed with a confident strut. Although South Beach and Coconut
Grove offer unlimited nightlife opportunities, the Knicks looked as
if they had resisted the temptations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a weird time,'' Coach Jeff Van Gundy said before the
game. ``It's early. A lot of guys are late-night guys. But I don't
think we have any more late-night guys than anyone else does.''
</P>
<P>
   If any of the Knicks had checked out the clubs, it did not show.
The start of the game revealed a team that was wide awake and ready
for the challenge. The Knicks looked like they were meant to be
together. Everyone was working in concert; there was no star, no
dominant player, no egos, just electric efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   The Heat could not handle it, trailing at halftime by an amazing
48-31. The only solace they had was knowing that a comeback could
be mounted. The last time the Knicks played in Miami, on April 24,
the trailed by 20 points in the third quarter and charged back to
win. Would it be the Heat's turn this time?
</P>
<P>
   There was no hint of that potential in the first half. The Heat
could not put a dent into the determination of Houston, as he drove
the ball and pulled up for jumpers. They could not stop the wild
jumpers or driving layups that Sprewell was coming up with on the
fast break, which punished the Heat for every turnover.
</P>
<P>
   In one sequence, the Heat's point guard, Tim Hardaway, was
stripped of the ball on a move through the paint by Kurt Thomas.
The ball fell into Sprewell's hands, and he took it the length of
the floor with Mourning right behind him. As Sprewell went up and
made the layup, Mourning raked him down to the baseline.
</P>
<P>
   Then Sprewell understood the gravity and intensity of this
rivalry. A little dazed, he picked himself up and made the free
throw to complete a rousing 3-point play that gave the Knicks a
46-31 lead with 1:41 left in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   Then Houston, whose awkward partnership with Sprewell has been
an issue most of the season, scored on the Knicks next possession
to put his team ahead, 48-31.
</P>
<P>
   The two combined to shoot 11 for 16 from the floor in the first
half. It made the ups and downs of Ewing _ who scored 6 first-half
points and allowed Mourning to duck in and around him for the bulk
of his 16 points _ an aside to the game that the Knicks' small men
were playing.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks were efficient and smooth from the start and
instantly quieted the late-arriving Miami crowd, hitting their
first five shots and taking an 11-6 lead with 9:05 left in the
first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Houston seemed especially ready for the occasion. So often in
the past, as Houston has gone, so have the Knicks. In Game 7 in
Miami two years ago, he made just 1 of his first 9 shots and the
Knicks lost. In Game 5 in Miami last year, he scored 30 points and
the undermanned, seventh-seeded Knicks took the series from the
second-seeded Heat.
</P>
<P>
   Understanding how much his success meant to the team, Houston
shaved his hair to the nub and came out with a streamlined effort.
He hit his first five shots, using an array of jumpers and driving
layups to send the Knicks off to a 28-18 lead after the first
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the leader for the Heat, Hardaway, was way off his
game. He made one of his first seven shots. Although Mourning was
dominating with 12 of his points _ many of which came on head fakes
around a slow-footed Ewing _ the Heat was sagging before the
multiple threats of the Knicks, who shot 13 for 21 in the first
quarter. &QL;

SECURITY COUNCIL EXPRESSES `SHOCK AND DISMAY' AT BOMBING
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds: replaces KOSOVO-U.N.-CHINA)   (rk) 
 By JUDITH MILLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   After weeks on the political periphery of the Kosovo crisis, the
U.N. Security Council made a dramatic return to diplomatic center
stage early Saturday, as an outraged China denounced the United
States and its NATO allies for their bombing of its embassy in
Belgrade and demanded an immediate halt to the airstrikes.
</P>
<P>
   In a rare emergency meeting that began after midnight Friday and
adjourned just before dawn, Qin Huasun, China's representative at
the United Nations, condemned NATO for what it called its
``flagrant'' attack, which he said constituted a ``crime of war
that should be punished.''
</P>
<P>
   But he failed to persuade a majority of the 15-member council to
condemn the bombing of its embassy or even investigate it. Instead,
the council issued a statement expressing ``shock and concern'' at
the attack on the Chinese Embassy and extended condolences to China
for the attack.
</P>
<P>
   The statement carries no legal weight, but it reflects what
little consensus exists among the council members, who apparently
were as deeply divided over NATO's military intervention Saturday
morning as at the beginning of the conflict 46 days before.
</P>
<P>
   These divisions have been largely responsible for keeping the
Security Council until now on the periphery of military and
diplomatic efforts to resolve it.
</P>
<P>
   Having aroused representatives from the 15-member council from
dinner parties and their beds to attend the emergency session,
China made clear that it might take unspecified ``further
actions.'' But Qin made no immediate demand for another emergency
meeting and gave no further indication Saturday morning of his
country's intentions.
</P>
<P>
   Sergey Lavrov, the Russian representative to the United Nations,
used the occasion to reiterate his country's demand for an
immediate halt to the airstrikes, which he called ``a necessary
prerequisite'' to any diplomatic solution of the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly on the defensive, the United States and its allies
stressed that the attack, which NATO was still investigating, was
an accident. Peter Burleigh, the acting U.S. representative, told
China and the other council members that NATO would never
deliberately target either civilians or an embassy.
</P>
<P>
   Britain, as it has since the NATO air campaign got under way on
March 24, took a somewhat more hawkish line, noting in the angry
debate that it was a ``gross distortion'' for Qin to imply that the
embassy had been deliberately attacked.
</P>
<P>
   After extending his apologies to China, Burleigh urged fellow
council members to keep ``the big picture'' in mind. He said the
ultimate blame for the Chinese casualties lay with President
Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia. ``We worked for months and months
on a negotiated settlement with Milosevic,'' Burleigh said. ``He
never agreed. And as the world knows, he triggered a human
catastrophe.''
</P>
<P>
   This prompted an irate retort from Lavrov, whose tone within
council deliberations has remained acerbic even as the Russian
special envoy, Viktor Chernomyrdin, has shuttled back and forth to
Belgrade, trying to help the United States achieve a diplomatic
solution.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many people must be left homeless,'' Lavrov said, ``how
many countries must be destabilized in order to punish that one
single person?''
</P>
<P>
   The ``big picture,'' he added, ``is not the fact that one single
person is responsible for all this,'' but that NATO's military
adventurism ``has been used as a slogan to cover up NATO attempts
to destroy world order.''
</P>
<P>
   Other countries used the session to vent longstanding grievances
against the United States. Saeed Hasan, Iraq's representative, said
NATO had deliberately targeted the Chinese Embassy, calling the
attack a ``barbaric act which violates the charter of the United
Nations.''
</P>
<P>
   China, as one of the five permanent members of the council, has
a veto over council actions, has staunchly opposed the NATO bombing
campaign in Yugoslavia and had previously often expressed its
suspicion about the motives of the Western alliance.
</P>
<P>
   Still, while diplomats at the United Nations acknowledged that
the bombing might complicate efforts to win council endorsement of
an international military force to maintain peace in Kosovo, few
thought that China would veto such a resolution if Russia and the
United States succeeded in producing a diplomatic accord to end the
conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard for us to believe that China would deliberately
block a peaceful resolution to the Kosovo conflict,'' a Western
diplomat said Saturday.

SAFETY BOARD COMPLAINS ABOUT DIFFICULTIES WITH FBI INVESTIGATNG TWA
CRASH  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After prolonged jurisdictional jostling between the
FBI and the National Transportation Safety Board over the
investigation into why Trans World Airlines Flight 800 exploded
three years ago, the safety board is throwing some political
punches.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, three staff members from the board are expected to
tell a Senate subcommittee that the FBI withheld a report ruling
out a bomb or missile. The report was prepared by the Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms shortly after the crash.
</P>
<P>
   Last Thursday, NTSB Chairman James Hall asked Congress for ``an
explicit statutory basis'' for asserting primacy over law
enforcement agencies in cases like Flight 800, in which crime was
initially suspected but never proved.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I failed in asserting our interest and authority'' in
the Flight 800 investigation, Hall told the aviation subcommittee
of the House Transportation Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The plane, a Boeing 747, exploded a few minutes after it took
off from Kennedy International Airport on July 17, 1996, killing
all 230 people on board. In theory the safety board has
jurisdiction over all plane crashes unless they are shown to
involve crimes. But in the case of Flight 800, the FBI quickly
seized control of the wreckage, at one point barring safety board
investigators from taking photographs.
</P>
<P>
   In the months that followed, the safety board investigators
worked alongside counterparts from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco
and Firearms and understood informally that the latter had no
evidence of a bomb or missile, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   By October 1996, three months after the crash, safety board
officials were saying publicly that the cause of the explosion was
probably mechanical, and not sabotage, a view that was not endorsed
by the FBI. By December, the board was issuing recommendations to
prevent future crashes based on its belief that the cause was
mechanical.
</P>
<P>
   The ATF report ruling out a bomb or missile was completed around
the end of 1996. A spokesman for the FBI in New York, Joseph
Valiquette, said the FBI had found a letter from James Kallstrom,
the special agent in charge of the New York office, to Hall, dated
March 17, 1997, conveying the report. But Ted Lopatkiewicz, a
spokesman or the board, said the board became aware of the letter
only after it received a copy from the Senate subcommittee in
preparation for Monday's hearing, and that no one at the board
recalled seeing the report.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI waited until May 1997 to say publicly that evidence
pointed to a ``catastrophic mechanical failure'' causing the crash,
and it did not formally withdraw from the inquiry until November
1997. The safety board held hearings on the crash the following
month.
</P>
<P>
   The board has not formally established the cause of the crash,
but it has said the plane was destroyed by an explosion of fumes in
the center fuel tank. It is still searching for the source of
ignition.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Judiciary Committee's subcommittee on Administrative
Oversight and the Courts, which has previously delved into problems
at the FBI's crime laboratory, has been investigating the FBI's
role in the TWA case and will hold a hearing on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the board say the FBI's involvement created
difficulties for them. One was being excluded from the initial
witness interviews, and thus not being able to ask questions
related to a possible mechanical cause, as opposed to a crime. In
the end, however, witness information did not prove important.
</P>
<P>
   Hall, the board chairman, said in a written submission to the
House subcommittee on Thursday that legislation was needed to
insure that the board could lead future accident inquiries.
Congress established the board 30 years ago as an independent
agency to supervise all government work after transportation
accidents.
</P>
<P>
   Board officials say that in past cases, in which crime has been
shown, they have been quick to relinquish jurisdiction. For
example, when a recorder on a Pacific Southwest Airlines flight in
December 1987 captured the sound of a disgruntled employee shooting
the pilots, the board yielded control to the FBI.

VENUS WILLIAMS TOPPLES HINGIS AT ITALIAN OPEN  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ Like the picture-snapping American tourists in front of
the Pantheon and the Trevi Fountain, Venus Williams will have fine
memories of her trip to Rome when she heads back across the
Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   For the second consecutive year, Williams is in the final of the
Italian Open, and she got there Saturday by beating Martina Hingis,
the world's No. 1 player in three uneven but consistently
compelling sets, 6-4, 1-6, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
   It was Williams' first victory on clay over Hingis, and it came
one day after the Swiss teen-ager had her way with Venus' sister
Serena on the very same sun-drenched center court, winning 6-2,
6-2.
</P>
<P>
   ``Serena didn't play her best yesterday,'' Venus Williams said.
``Today I had a good day.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Williams, Mary Pierce, her final-round opponent Sunday,
lives in Florida. Unlike Venus, Pierce represents France, and in
Saturday's first semifinal in the Foro Italico she defeated another
talented Frenchwoman, Amelie Mauresmo, 6-7 (1-7), 6-2, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
   At this year's first Grand Slam event, the Australian Open,
Mauresmo lost to Hingis in the final. Venus Williams was beaten in
the quarterfinals by Lindsay Davenport, but as the year's second
Grand Slam event, the French Open, rapidly approaches, the pecking
order has now shifted. Davenport has a left wrist injury that is
taking longer than expected to heal, and Venus has lifted her level
of play significantly.
</P>
<P>
   She has won three of her last four tournaments and 18 of her
last 19 matches. Now, she has beaten Hingis in their first
encounter in nearly a year, and though Hingis still holds a 6-3
career edge over her fellow 18-year-old, she did not look like a
teen-ager with an edge in the final game Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Williams won the opening point with the sort of well-timed,
reasonably well-disguised drop shot that Hingis likes to hit.
Hingis made a forehand error, and then, tellingly, pushed a short
forehand wide moving forward that she normally would have stroked
with much more confidence. That made it 0-40, but Williams would
not need more than one match point as Hingis made another unforced
forehand error.
</P>
<P>
   While Williams did a little jig on the clay and pointed toward
her mother Oracene and other supporters in the stands, Hingis
jogged forward and tossed her racquet in disappointment. The
handshake was cordial, but Hingis made it clear that she wants to
be in a better, more triumphant mood the next time they meet at the
net.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though I lost today, I'm going confident into the
French,'' she said. ''I don't think I was too far away today, and I
don't think I played my best.''
</P>
<P>
   She added, ``It's more important, the French, so watch out
Venus.''
</P>
<P>
   Early in the third set, it appeared that Williams might also
have to watch out in Rome. Though she had played excellent
attacking tennis in the opening set, frequently overpowering the
Swiss and winning points consistently at the net, she had then lost
her way. Hingis won the second set in 20 minutes, breaking Williams
all three times she served. Like sister Serena on Friday, the
unforced errors were coming in bunches, and Hingis was mixing her
shots and spins effectively.
</P>
<P>
   Hingis broke Williams again in the opening game of the final set
and jumped out to a 2-0 lead, but her run would stop there.
Williams held with ease in the next game and then broke Hingis to
get even.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really good at comebacks these days,'' Williams said. ``I
felt I could win the match, and I knew I wanted to win the match.''
</P>
<P>
   If she wants to become the first woman with four WTA titles in
1999, she must now defeat Pierce in a final for the second time in
two weeks. Last week in Hamburg, it did not take long for her to
win, 6-3, 6-0. The fact that Pierce, seldom short on injuries, had
to play the last two sets against Mauresmo with her left leg
wrapped tightly because of a groin strain will not increase her
chances of changing her luck in Rome. &QL;

THERE'S A NEW MAN IN ST. LOUIS, AND HE HAS ONLY 60 MORE TO GO  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mo., Texas, Calif., Mass., Ind., Canada)   By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A couple of general managers who transacted some business at the
trading deadline last July were in Baltimore last Monday for the
Orioles' game with Cuba and had dinner together. Baseball talk, of
course, was on the menu.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember, Walt,'' Doug Melvin said to Walt Jocketty at one
point, ``if he leads the league in runs batted in, you owe me
another player.''
</P>
<P>
   Jocketty, the St. Louis general manager, did not choke on
Melvin's words. He knows a joke when he hears one.
</P>
<P>
   The player they were talking about, though, is no joke. Fernando
Tatis, the Cardinals' third baseman, is establishing himself as one
of the bright young stars in the National League. He entered the
weekend tied for the league lead in home runs (11) and runs scored
(28), and second in rbi (32).
</P>
<P>
   Melvin, the Texas general manager, can only watch from a
distance and take consolation in knowing that Tatis is fulfilling
the expectations the Rangers had for him before they traded him and
pitcher Darren Oliver to St. Louis for shortstop Royce Clayton and
pitcher Todd Stottlemyre.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always thought he was going be a 30-home run, 30-stolen
base guy,'' Melvin said. ``He's a good defensive player, too.
That's the risk that goes with trying to win. You make a decision
and live with it.''
</P>
<P>
   On the same day they reluctantly traded Tatis, the Rangers
acquired third baseman Todd Zeile from Florida for two minor
leaguers. ``We could not have won without making the deals,''
Melvin said, referring to the American League West title.
</P>
<P>
   Stottlemyre beat the Anaheim Angels twice in the last two weeks
of the season, including the game that put the Rangers in first to
stay. Zeile reached base 11 consecutive times on 5 hits and 6 walks
in a critical three-game stretch that culminated in the Rangers'
clinching the division championship.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that two weeks before the Tatis trade he sent Warren
Morris, a promising young infielder, to Pittsburgh for pitcher
Esteban Loaiza, Melvin said: ``We're trying to build a reputation
for winning. If winning wasn't important, I wouldn't have made any
of those deals. I'd still have Morris and Tatis.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals are happy for the Rangers. Having Tatis enables
them to be magnanimous.
</P>
<P>
   In two months in St. Louis last season, Tatis batted .287, hit 8
home runs and drove in 26 runs in 55 games. His eighth home run was
sort of overlooked. He hit it in the last game of the season, the
one in which Mark McGwire swatted his 69th and 70th.
</P>
<P>
   Now Tatis, a 24-year-old native of the Dominican Republic, is
carrying the Cardinals' load while McGwire struggles to get
untracked. How hot has Tatis been? He hit his 11th home run in the
Cardinals' 27th game Thursday night. Last year McGwire hit his 11th
in the 27th game.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he came over here last year, I think it was a big
adjustment for him,'' Jocketty said. ``He left a situation that was
comfortable for him. But we have a few more Latin players this
year, and Jose Oquendo is our bench coach.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals have another new coach to work with Tatis on his
hitting, the former outfielder and designated hitter Mike Easler,
who played with Tatis' father in the Houston organization in the
early '70s. It was less than two years ago that Tatis located his
father, whom he had not seen since he was 3.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike has a great relationship with Fernando,'' Jocketty said
of Easler, whom Mo Vaughn credits with making him the hitter he is
today. ``He's taken him under his wing and worked with him. He
found some things they started working on in spring training. He
got his hands down. Mostly Fernando has gained confidence. He's a
highly motivated kid.''
</P>
<P>
   No one expects Tatis to maintain his home run lead over McGwire,
who had hit six through Friday, but on the far-out chance that he
does, the day (April 23) Tatis caught and passed McGwire will be
long remembered in baseball history. That was the day Tatis hit two
grand slams in the same inning, a feat never before accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire, who was ``the man'' last season, saluted his younger
teammate by saying, ``Now Fernando's the man.''
</P>
<P>
   If Tatis should finish the season as the rbi man, would Jocketty
consider sending Melvin another player? ``I bought dinner for him
in Baltimore,'' Jocketty said. ``That should suffice.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   A Clemens Deal Footnote  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Boston Red Sox's trade of Jeff Bagwell for Larry Andersen in
1990 stands as one of the most notorious examples of a team's
swapping a minor league prospect for an established veteran who it
feels can help it win a pennant. The Red Sox won the division title
that season, but Bagwell has become one of the game's biggest
stars.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the Fernando Tatis trade may one day be remembered in
the same way. But Doug Melvin is so certain that such trades have
to be made that he was prepared to make another during spring
training this year. Ruben Mateo, a 21-year-old outfielder, is the
Rangers' No. 1 prospect, but he could have been in Toronto's minor
league system.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was prepared to do that if I had Clemens from Day One,''
Melvin said, meaning if he could have had Roger Clemens from the
first day of the season.
</P>
<P>
   In discussing a possible trade of Clemens, Melvin said, the Blue
Jays had asked for Mateo as part of a package. Rusty Greer, Rick
Helling and Tom Goodwin were other players mentioned. Melvin said
it finally came down to Mateo, pitcher Esteban Loaiza and Jonathan
Johnson, a minor league pitcher, for Clemens.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have been a risky deal, but we basically agreed on
it,'' Melvin said. He said that Gord Ash, the Toronto general
manager, told him he was ready to make the deal, but he wanted to
go back to the Yankees first. ``He said he needed to make one more
call, but he didn't think they'd give him the player he wanted,''
Melvin said. The Yankees, however, surprised Ash. They said yes to
David Wells, and Mateo remains with the Rangers.  &QL; 
 &QL; 
Down to the Minors . . .  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Brett Tomko and Tony Saunders were in their third major league
seasons. Tomko, 26, had an impressive 24-19 record for Cincinnati
in his first two years. Saunders, 25, had only a 10-21 record, but
pitching for Florida in 1997 he beat the Atlanta Braves three times
and started a game in the World Series. Tampa Bay then made him the
first player selected in the expansion draft.
</P>
<P>
   Now Saunders and Tomko are in the minor leagues. Saunders had a
2-3 record and 8.67 earned run average in six starts, allowing a
ratio of 22 base runners per nine innings. Tomko had an 0-1 record
and 7.76 era in five starts, averaging 16.5 base runners per nine
innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to give him time to get his feet back on the ground,''
Larry Rothschild, the Devil Rays' manager, said of Saunders. ``We
want him to get good command of his fastball and get his confidence
back. He just wasn't doing his job. We could've put him in the
bullpen and brought him back slowly, but I think the more drastic
move will get him back to where we want him to be. He should be a
third starter here. The other way he could be the fifth.''
</P>
<P>
   Rothschild said the club was not putting a time frame on
Saunders' return. ``I don't want him to think he can have one good
start and come back,'' the manager said. ``It's going to take him
time to establish what he needs. He knows that.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Bowden, the Reds' general manager, said Tomko had been hit
hard in all five starts, ``and he wasn't making any adjustments; he
was just getting worse.'' The Reds, Bowden said, hope that Grant
Jackson, the pitching coach at Class AAA Indianapolis, ``will get
him back to pitching the way he did the last couple of years.''
Asked how long he thought Tomko would be in the minors, Bowden
said, ``Hopefully it won't be too long if he's going to win 12 to
15 games for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Back to the Big Leagues For Righetti  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dave Righetti returned to the major leagues last week. He had
not been there since he pitched for the Chicago White Sox in 1995.
His visit was brief but long enough for him to enjoy a new
experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I go to the ball park, I don't have that thing in the pit
of my stomach,'' Righetti said. ``I can relax. When you're playing
and having the job I had for a few years, I don't know if I enjoyed
it. All that nervous anxiety you went through. Now it's fun to go
to the park.''
</P>
<P>
   Righetti, 40, is in his first year as a roving pitching
instructor in the San Francisco Giants' organization. He joined the
parent club last Monday to fill in for Ron Perranoski, the pitching
coach, whose mother suffered a stroke.
</P>
<P>
   ``They threw me right into the fire,'' Righetti said.
``Throw-overs and pickoffs, getting guys up, talking to guys,
seeing who can pitch, who can't.''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the Giants' manager, Dusty Baker, Righetti added:
``Dusty said: `You're not here just as a fill-in. Your job is to
help these guys.' I have a feeling that it's partly grooming to see
if this is what I want some day. But I'm perfectly happy doing what
I'm doing. Roving is a pretty good job.''
</P>
<P>
   Righetti, who pitched a no-hitter for the Yankees in 1983,
became a reliever and gained 223 saves for them in the next seven
seasons. He was out of baseball for three years until the Giants
lured him back last year.
</P>
<P>
   He worked with the Giants' instructional league team last
November, then went to spring training and became their roving
instructor. The job provided an unexpected bonus when he was
summoned to fill in for Perranoski. The closer Robb Nen, for one,
appreciated Righetti's presence.
</P>
<P>
   In the ninth inning of Righetti's first game with the Giants,
Nen gave up four runs, turning an 8-5 lead into a 9-8 loss.
Righetti said that Nen told him: ``I can talk to a lot of guys, but
they don't know what I go through. It's nice to talk to someone who
knows what I'm going through.''

NBC SEES STORY LINES AS FOCUS FOR THE FINALS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By MIKE WISE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   An Indiana-Utah final is generally seen as a prime-time
nightmare for NBC: two small-market, veteran teams with declining
vertical leaps, vying for pro basketball's championship a year
after Michael Jordan's farewell tour.
</P>
<P>
   A series without Kobe Bryant, Shaquille O'Neal, Patrick Ewing or
Pat Riley would seem to point to fewer viewers. But the network
contends that it is not playing favorites, that small-market teams
can sell under the right circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a big believer that for the finals to work, you have to
have stories,'' said Dick Ebersol, the president of NBC Sports.
``With Reggie Miller and Larry Bird, you have ready-made stars. And
Utah has been in the finals the past two years. If they were to end
up playing each other, that's an enticing series.''
</P>
<P>
   The finals draw more casual fans than do the regular season or
early playoffs. And a great angle _ or a pop-culture star like
Jordan, Charles Barkley or Shaquille O'Neal _ certainly attracts
them in bigger numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the average rating for the six games between the Jazz
and the Bulls was 18.7, the highest ever for the finals. (Each
rating point represents 980,000 households.) The 1993 finals
between Jordan's Bulls and Barkley's Phoenix Suns were second at
17.9.
</P>
<P>
   ``The two most important factors _ in order _ are story line and
length of series,'' said Ed Markey, an NBC spokesman. ``Market size
is gravy.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``The bigger cities carry more TV viewers, and more
ratings weight. So if everything else was equal, you may get a
little bit higher rating if the cities were major market. But not a
lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Even a marquee matchup like Lakers-Knicks would not guarantee
incredible ratings, especially if it were one-sided.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's World Series, which the Yankees swept from San
Diego, was the lowest-rated in history at an average of 14.1. In
1980, the World Series between the Philadelphia Phillies and the
Kansas City Royals _ the latter being a comparatively small market
_ achieved a 32.8 rating, the second-highest ever. The 1995 NBA
finals featured O'Neal and Anfernee Hardaway, along with Hakeem
Olajuwon trying to repeat as champion and Clyde Drexler trying to
win his first title. But it was a Houston sweep and ended with a
13.9 rating.
</P>
<P>
   As for a Jordan-less post-season, ``We factored in about a 15
percent decline over all,'' Ebersol said. ``When a transcendental
figure like that leaves the game, it's just natural. In many ways,
we've been spoiled.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon after NBC struck a deal with the NBA in 1990, taking the
rights away from CBS, the league's longtime partner, a CBS official
said his network was ``getting out just in time.'' A Cleveland-Utah
final seemed likely, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Led by Jordan, the Bulls won their first of three straight
titles, and six in eight seasons, the following season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was a rather snide remark, showing how little
people thought of Michael's long-range possibility as a champion,''
Ebersol said. ``We were clearly spoiled.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 2 Unmade Knicks Bids &LR;
</P>
<P>
   It has become fashionable to knock the Knicks' front office for
some of the acquisitions it has made over the last few seasons. But
deals not made may have been more detrimental to the franchise than
any trade completed.
</P>
<P>
   David Falk, the agent for Patrick Ewing and many of the league's
top players, confirmed that he was trying to orchestrate a deal
after the lockout ended in January that would have brought Rod
Strickland, one of the league's most accomplished point guards,
back to New York.
</P>
<P>
   Strickland's contract negotiations with Washington had stalled,
and Falk said he tried to broker several deals in which the Wizards
would have signed Strickland and then traded him. His client
eventually re-signed for $40 million over four years with the
Wizards.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth is, we worked very hard to get Rod there,'' Falk
said Friday. ``They weren't comfortable doing the deal. Patrick
knew about it and supported it, but management was not comfortable
accepting it. I don't know who made the decision, but I was told
that certain commitments had been made already.''
</P>
<P>
   Falk would not divulge which players would have been involved in
the deal, but soon after the lockout ended the Knicks committed $27
million to Charlie Ward.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they could have done that deal again at the trade deadline,
they would have,'' Falk added. ``But they simply couldn't because
of their salary cap situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Through a spokesperson, Dave Checketts, the president of Madison
Square Garden, declined to comment on any possible trades involving
Strickland.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks also lost out in the Stephon Marbury sweepstakes at
the trading deadline, entering the bidding process long after Falk
had orchestrated a three-team deal that insured the Nets of getting
the Timberwolves' young floor leader.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Checketts said at the time that other forces might have been at
work to prevent the Knicks from getting Marbury _ a thinly veiled
reference to behind-the-scenes maneuvering by Falk.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Payton Is Unhappy  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   After a loss to Portland on April 28, Seattle's Gary Payton
fumed. In front of teammates and reporters, he blurted out to his
agent, Aaron Goodwin, ``Aaron, you got to do something about
this!'' The two retreated to another room to discuss the matter.
</P>
<P>
   It was the clearest sign yet that the All-Star point guard was
fed up in Seattle, which did not qualify for the playoffs at 25-25,
and was apparently interested in forcing an off-season trade.
Goodwin admits that his client is unhappy, but also said last week
that the chances of Payton's winding up in New York or anywhere
else are slim.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's false that he has asked to be traded and that he wants
Wally Walker's head to roll,'' Goodwin said, referring to the
Sonics' general manager. ``I won't let him deny that he's unhappy
and that he wants change. This is a player who has won an average
of 56 games the last six seasons. But he wants to finish his career
in Seattle.''
</P>
<P>
   Goodwin added: ``I can tell you now that Seattle has no thoughts
about moving him. He's not going to New York unless they're willing
to give a franchise player back, and I can't see the Knicks wanting
Gary without also having Patrick.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if Payton's relationship with Paul Westphal, who replaced
George Karl as coach after last season, could lead to Payton's
departure, Goodwin said: ``He's got a good relationship with Paul.
It's not like his relationship with George Karl, but those things
take time. With the lockout, there wasn't an opportunity for that
relationship to jell this season.''
</P>
<P>
   Payton may be the league's most accomplished floor leader, but
his constant mood swings have been a source of angst for the team's
front office, a fact that may ultimately lead to the team moving
him. He has three years left on his current contract at $12
million, $13 million and $14 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see him traded, but stranger things have happened,''
Goodwin said. ``Hey, Gary's a high-octane person. That's him.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Union Notes Higher Pay &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Billy Hunter, executive director of the players association,
sent an end-of-the-season mailing to his constituency last
Wednesday. Comparing salaries before and after the new
collective-bargaining agreement, the letter seems to dispel the
notion that the union was pummeled during the contentious labor
negotiations that led to the shortened season.
</P>
<P>
   The average salary jumped from about $2.3 million to $2.8
million; the median salary went from $1.4 million to $1.7 million.
For the first time, there are veteran players (those with more than
10 years experience) making the $1 million salary exception that
both sides agreed to. The 22 players earning the $1 million
exception would most likely have been making much less under the
old agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, 74 players made $1 million to $2 million. This
year, 112 players made that much. Over all, the players took in
$1.12 billion in nonprorated salaries _ a 17 percent increase from
last season.
</P>
<P>
   While the middle class is clearly doing better, the major
concession by the union _ putting limits on high-end salaries _ has
affected some of the game's marquee players. In particular, Kobe
Bryant and Allen Iverson signed deals far below what they could
have commanded in a bidding war. But only one player, Rik Smits,
hit the absolute ceiling for veteran limits; the Pacers center
 &UR; settled &LR;  for $14 million a season.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Sprewell Is Litigious &LR;
</P>
<P>
   More than 18 months after his suspension for choking P.J.
Carlesimo, Latrell Sprewell's continuing attempt to recoup lost
money from the NBA and the Golden State Warriors keeps costing him.
</P>
<P>
   According to an NBA official, Sprewell must pay roughly $150,000
in court costs for the league and the team after a federal judge in
San Francisco rejected his lawsuit for a second time last month and
ordered Sprewell to compensate the defendants.
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell's lawyers argued that many of the hours billed by the
league's lawyers were extraneous, and an exact fee has yet to be
agreed upon. Meanwhile, Sprewell presses on.
</P>
<P>
   Despite urgings from the players association and others to drop
the case, Sprewell has given his lawyers the go-ahead to file yet
another appeal.  &QL;

SPORS COLUMN: THE FATHER UNDERSTANDS THE PRESSURE HIS SON FACES  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ky., Tenn.)   By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ You could hear the relief in Wade Houston's voice. He
was flying here for Game 1 of the Knicks-Heat playoff series, and
he was glad to be going as a father and a fan _ not a coach.
</P>
<P>
   It has been a crazy season in the National Basketball
Association, especially for the supposedly underachieving Knicks,
and no one, including Houston's son, Allan, has been spared
scrutiny. Now every game seems like some sort of referendum on
which players will stay, which will go. The longtime general
manager, Ernie Grunfeld, has been demoted. The head coach, Jeff Van
Gundy, reads every day that his job is on the line and endures open
speculation over who might take his place.
</P>
<P>
   There may have been a time when Wade Houston missed the coaching
business _ when he yearned a little to get back in _ but this
season, more than any in the last four years, has weaned him away.
Fandom is just fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``The longer you're away from it, the more you mellow,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   As a former coach, Houston can empathize with Van Gundy. He was
the head basketball coach at the University of Tennessee from the
1989-90 season until March 1994, when he resigned after a 5-22
season. The highlight of his career was having the opportunity to
coach Allan for each of his seasons at Tennessee. But Wade also
remembers the cruel, public process of job evaluation.
</P>
<P>
   ``You review tapes of a game and you hear announcers saying that
there are rumblings in Knoxville, and that the word is your job is
on the line,'' Houston recalled. ``Then recruits start to hear
this, and it's used against you by other coaches. Then it becomes
an uphill struggle. There are so many things, whether it's Ernie or
Jeff or me, that you can't control. It makes coaching a pretty
tough profession.''
</P>
<P>
   Allan Houston grew up around basketball. Wade Houston started
coaching at the high school level in 1966, five years before Allan
was born. He earned $200 as an assistant junior varsity coach,
$5,100 a year as a teacher.
</P>
<P>
   ``We coached because we loved the kids, we loved to impact
them,'' Houston said. ``From then to what it's come to now, is just
full circle.''
</P>
<P>
   Houston became an assistant coach at Louisville in 1976 under
Denny Crum, and recruited much of the Cardinals' outstanding
talent. Allan was 15 when the Cardinals won the National Collegiate
Athletic Association championship in 1986 and, as expected, he made
a committed to go to Louisville in 1989. Then Wade Houston made the
decision to leave Louisville and took the head job at Tennessee,
where he became the first black head coach in the Southeastern
Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Houston was dismissed as the Tennessee head coach in 1994. There
were possibilities of another job, but finally he decided he did
not want to go through it again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I probably could have had another job, but as I got more
involved in our business I became more removed from coaching,'' he
said. ``The time away provided me with a lot of time to reflect on
where I'd been, where I am, where I want to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Houston decided there were more pressing things than coaching _
like family, home and his own business to attend to. He is now the
president and chief executive officer of Mavis Specialized Carrier
Company in Louisville, Ky., a truck transportation business he
started in 1982. His wife, Alice, is the president of one of the
four divisions of the company.
</P>
<P>
   His oldest daughter, Lynn, became a two-time Atlantic Coast
Conference high jump champion at Georgia Tech. She begins graduate
school in engineering this fall and is pointing to the Olympic
trials. His youngest daughter, Natalie, begins medical school this
fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just been a Godsend to get a chance to spend time with
the family, to sit up in the stands and watch a track meet when
there were maybe 25 or 30 people there,'' he said. ``I've had a
chance to watch her over the last three or four years, which I
couldn't have done had I been coaching.''
</P>
<P>
   Allan, meanwhile, has been near or at the center of controversy
this season, ever since the Knicks traded for Latrell Sprewell. Can
the two guards coexist? Does Houston need to be less of a coach's
son and more of an aggressive gunner?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they could complement each other very well,'' Wade
Houston said. ``It's not something that will happen overnight, and
it has not happened overnight. But when it happens _ I looked at
how the better team over the last several years has been Chicago.
When you look at what made them successful, they had a lot of
interchangeable players, players that could do a lot of things. So
hopefully, adding more interchangeable players to the Knicks could
make some of those things happen for them.''
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't feel Allan has to become selfish.
</P>
<P>
   ``Allan was part of the team concept,'' he said. ``He was always
listening to me talk about how the parts fit together to make the
team better _ even before he started playing for me. Getting people
involved on the team is important. He has enough skills, if they
want him to step up and do more, he has the ability to do that.
He'll do whatever they want him to do.''
</P>
<P>
   In any event, Wade Houston has his own life. He, Alice and Allan
will visit on Sunday, then Wade will fly to Detroit on Monday for a
business meeting. He really doesn't have any playoff predictions.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have home-court advantage, so that's big,'' he said
of the Knicks. ``You just have to figure out a way to get some wins
on the road.''
</P>
<P>
   You get the distinct sense from Wade Houston that he's relieved
he doesn't have to go figure. &QL;

 &HT;    POLICYMAKERS INFLUENTIAL PEOPLE RESPOND TO ANTI-VIOLENCE PLEAS
 &HT;    By ANDREW MOLLISON

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Catherine Murphy, a public housing policewoman in
New York City, engulfed Tom Mauser of Littleton, Colo., in a hug of
welcome and consolation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year must be the year when enough is enough,'' Murphy
said Saturday in the East Room of the White House. Her son
Christopher was 11 in 1997 when he was shot to death in a
preventable accident by a gun stored unsafely in a neighbor's
house.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is it about our society that has gone wrong?'' asked
Mauser, whose son Daniel was 15 when he, a dozen other teenagers
and a teacher were slain by two teen gunmen in Columbine High
School last month. ``We may have the freedom to bear arms in this
nation, but we don't have freedom from fear.''
</P>
<P>
   Leaders from the White House, both parties in Congress and the
gun, movie, television, video-game, Internet and recording
industries -- as well as national groups of parents, clergy, law
enforcement officers and teachers -- will start responding this
week to those passionate pleas and the national agony that erupted
in the wake of the shootings in Littleton.
</P>
<P>
   Louis Sullivan, former Secretary of Health and Human Services in
the Bush administration, compared the massacre to an airplane crash
that leads to reforms in air safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are tragedies, but one special benefit may be that they
focus more sustained and serious national attention on the fact
that we have a problem,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the week ahead:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  President Clinton will lead a ``strategy session'' of
representatives of all those groups Monday around a U-shaped table
in the White House. They will plan the formation of a nonprofit
organization that would lead public and private efforts to protect
children from violence, just as similar organizations worked to
lower teenage pregnancy rates, find jobs for welfare recipients and
encourage volunteerism in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will talk about how we can shield our children from
gratuitous violence, keep parents involved in their children's
lives, reach out to troubled young people early enough, and do more
to keep guns out of their reach,'' Clinton said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., has scheduled a
debate to begin Tuesday on a juvenile delinquency bill. He said it
will include a chance for senators to offer amendments that could
add tighter limits on explosives and guns to the bill which revamps
federal programs that help states and localities cope with young
lawbreakers.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., has endorsed the White
House meeting, and said that he and Lott will also proceed with
their plans for a Republican-sponsored ``national dialogue on youth
and culture'' at locations outside of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Touching all bases in the multi-sided process of
solution-seeking, Hastert said, ``While we should look at school
safety and gun violence, we also must examine other influences on
our society, such as drugs, video games, the entertainment
industry, the Internet, school prayer, parental responsibility and
family involvement.''
</P>
<P>
   He and Lott spoke separately about how moved they had been by
private pleas from parents at Columbine High School for help in
avoiding future massacres.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, gun control advocates took heart from a new,
tentative offer communicated to the White House by the makers and
sellers of firearms. Though stopping short of endorsing all of
Clinton's gun control proposals, the American Shooting Sports
Council went far beyond concessions offered since Littleton by
leaders of the National Rifle Association, the country's biggest
gun-owners' group.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're things we've been looking at and discussing for as
long as two years with Philadelphia Mayor Ed Rendell and the U.S.
Conference of Mayors,'' said Robert A. Ricker, executive director
of the council, which he described as an association of ``all
segments of the firearm, ammunition and shooting sports accessory
industry.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that, if the proposals are properly worded, the council
would accept a lifetime ban on gun sales to a juvenile convicted of
a violent felony; instant background checks for sales at gun shows;
raising the 18-year minimum age for gun purchases to 21; mandatory
tracing of all guns found at crime scenes, and laws holding adults
criminally responsible for allowing children unsupervised access to
guns.
</P>
<P>
   However, he said it would not support three other proposals
endorsed by Handgun Control, Inc.: restoration of the three-day
waiting limit before a gun sale; a limit of one gun sale per month
to an individual; and mandatory packaging of an optional trigger
lock with every gun sold.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does look like they are making some reasonable
concessions,'' Naomi Paiss, communications director for Handgun
Control, said Saturday. ``The fact that gun manufacturers recognize
that it does not help their cause to be providing their products to
kids and to criminals shows that some progress may be made in the
Senate this time.''

HASEK, HOCKEY'S MOZART, SEEKS MORE HIGH NOTES WITH THE SABRES 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By ROBIN FINN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Some people shrug into a hair shirt. Some attend
confession. Some cast the blame like a fishing line. For Dominik
Hasek, all it took was an afternoon of playing the focal point, and
voluntary target, in an up-tempo series of decapitation drills at a
suburban practice rink Friday to atone for the fact that he came up
uncharacteristically mortal in Game 1 of the Eastern Conference
semifinal series between his Buffalo Sabres and the Boston Bruins.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get over the loss only by working to get ready for the next
game,'' said the 34-year-old Hasek, who can even the series here
Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Hasek savors the chance to remind Bruins goalie Byron
Dafoe, who upstaged him by 10-9 in the shutout stakes during the
regular season and leads Hasek by 2-1 in 1999 playoff shutouts,
just who the real understudy is in this series.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not personal,'' said Hasek, who rates the late-blooming
Dafoe among the top five goalies in the league. ``I like the way he
plays. He'll try to make the save even if it looks impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   Those kind of saves are pure Hasek, who flutters, flops and
flails like a drowning man, or a drowning butterfly, while tackling
rebounds that would provoke most goalies to surrender. With joints
that have apparently been reinforced by Silly Putty and a mind that
works like a camera shutter, Hasek makes impossible stops with
regularity, but not always.
</P>
<P>
   The Dominator unwittingly played the Accommodator in a 4-2 loss
to the Bruins on Thursday night at the Fleet Center, where his woes
included a catastrophic second period in which he yielded two goals
on four shots. Hasek was so bad, he inspired the hometown crowd to
bay like a pack of wolves when they weren't taunting him by
botching his name: ``Heah-shick! Heah-shick!''
</P>
<P>
   If he heard, he didn't let on. His powers of concentration,
after all, are legendary, and at one time or another have enabled
him to tune out everything and everyone from the former Buffalo
coach Ted Nolan, who received his walking papers after receiving
Hasek's cold shoulder, to the Czech army, which suspended him after
he refused to tend goal for the military team in a game that would
have caused the certain demotion of his boyhood club.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder the Boston hecklers failed to move him.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the lithe little guy who cannot fathom why the
chroniclers of sport insist on calling him the masked Mozart of his
genre _ ``How can you compare the Mozart of music to a hockey
player who stops pucks?'' Hasek said _ simply played on until the
bitter end. At that point, the Bruins scored an empty net goal, and
Hasek could be seen glowering behind his wire cage while confined
to the bench in favor of a sixth but ineffectual attacker.
</P>
<P>
   The Sabres trampled the Ottawa Senators in the first round, when
Hasek yielded a stingy six goals on 162 shots. It prompted more
than one Senator to speculate that the entire Czech Republic, which
declared the goaltender a god after he pulled off the gold-medal
shutout of Russia last year at the Olympics in Nagano, Japan, might
be onto something. But then Hasek fell to earth in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was average,'' he said, curling his lip around the forbidden
word as he sipped a succession of post-practice sodas in the lobby
bar of his Boston hotel.
</P>
<P>
   He was the only man in the place who wasn't nursing his first
cocktail of the weekend, not to mention the only man bereft of a
tie. With Hasek's sugar high came clarity. No, he did not
contemplate jumping out the window after his subpar evening brought
his undefeated 1999 playoff streak to a screeching halt. Not when
he finished the season with a career-best 1.87 goals-against
average and a personal as well as league-best .937 save percentage.
While he admits to a few sleepless nights when he was convinced his
mistakes cost his team a game, nights attested to by the gray hairs
that dust his sideburns, Thursday was not one of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``On two of the goals, I never even saw the puck, so I couldn't
really get mad at myself,'' Hasek said, ``and anyway, I'd never get
so depressed about losing a game that I'd jump out the window or
something.''
</P>
<P>
   After all, his college history degree tells him that it is far
better to learn from one's mistakes than flee them.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I want to do is win,'' he said, ``and I try to do
everything I can to make sure I win. But if you lose, then you're
sad, and that's all there is to it. I didn't feel I made big
mistakes in Game 1, but that doesn't mean I don't think about every
goal that went in. It doesn't mean I can't be better in my next
game.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, average, for Hasek, is inadmissible. This is the
Vezina trophy czar who, a year after becoming the league's first
goalie most valuable player in 35 years in 1997, coolly pocketed
the award again in 1998. That feat followed an Olympic tournament
that flowed like an aria: six games played, six goals allowed, and
a 20-save crescendo shutout against Russia in the gold-medal
finale.
</P>
<P>
   That performance turned him into a national hero back home,
where the Czech president, Vaclav Havel, suggested that Hasek
succeed him as head of state. Not bad for a goalie who was drafted
199th overall by the Blackhawks in 1983 (he waited six years to
go), was a flop in 1989 in his debut as a high school history
teacher (he lasted two months, just long enough to earn a college
degree), and cheerfully limits his domestic skills to ``taking out
the garbage and changing light bulbs.''
</P>
<P>
   While Hasek has no designs on Havel's job, he has already used
his chess master's skills to think ahead to what he will do when he
gets tired of stopping pucks. The next step for Hasek could happen
sooner rather than later, particularly if Buffalo decides not to
honor his $7 million-a-season contract through 2002.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I would be traded by Buffalo, then maybe I would say I
don't want to play anymore,'' he said. ``If that happens, I think I
can be almost 100 percent sure that I would say goodbye to
hockey.''
</P>
<P>
   Hasek has started a sportswear firm, Dominator, in the Czech
Republic, and plans outposts for the United States and Canada.
``Already I'm on the phone to Prague almost every day talking about
the business, about quotas and things.''
</P>
<P>
   Hasek still does splits that could make a cheerleader blush, but
with a tiny hernia in his groin after 30 years of snuffing shots,
tending profit splits instead of goal is starting to have its
appeal.
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of winning a Stanley Cup, there is not much
left undone in hockey for Hasek, who learned his craft at age 4 in
the doorway of the kitchen in Pardubice. He and his mother lived
with his maternal grandparents while his father worked 100 miles
away in a uranium mine. Every night, while his grandmother prepared
dinner, his grandfather tossed tennis balls at Hasek, who plied his
body like a carnival contortionist to stop them.
</P>
<P>
   ``My grandmother would be mad at me because I was always jumping
around and kicking her ankles while she was trying to cook,'' Hasek
said. ``Right there by the hot stove, that's where I learned my
style and started my career.''
</P>
<P>
   Right there in chilly Buffalo, with or without a Stanley Cup, is
where he wants to end it.

 By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After 18 years of marriage, Paul and Kathy Schroeder
squabble not about money or in-laws but about heroin. ``She thinks
I'm taking from her,'' he said, ``and I accuse her of taking from
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Since 1991, heroin has transformed the Schroeders from
comfortable middle-class homeowners in Wayne, N.J., to addicts
living in a homeless shelter in Harlem, scavenging bottles from
trash cans and shooting up in rubble-strewn lots.
</P>
<P>
   Their story as two of New York City's estimated 200,000 regular
heroin users illustrates the changing face of the city's stubborn
heroin problem.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors and sociologists report that more urban blacks are
turning their backs on heroin. But at the same time, they say, the
use of heroin has increased among whites because its unprecedented
purity allows users to obtain a high by inhaling, rather than
injecting, the drug. High purity has made the drug more potent, and
thus more dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   The purity has soared since Colombian traffickers muscled into
the New York market, undercutting the longtime Asian suppliers with
lower prices and purer heroin. Between 1988 and 1995, heroin prices
dropped by an average of 50 percent in 19 major cities, including
New York, encouraging more consumption, according to a new study in
the American Journal of Public Health.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're seeing a substantial increase in the use of heroin,''
said Dr. Stephan Lynn, a senior emergency-medicine doctor at St.
Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center at 113th Street and Amsterdam
Avenue. ``It is occurring in a younger, more affluent population.
And there is a larger number of white patients than in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   New users have been emboldened by the misconception that
inhaling heroin is not addictive.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of people coming into treatment for heroin addiction,
more than half are sniffing heroin,'' said Don Des Jarlais, the
research director for the Chemical Dependency Institute at Beth
Israel Medical Center. He said that about 40 percent of sniffers
end up like Paul and Kathy Schroeder, injecting their heroin.
</P>
<P>
   John Galea, the director of the street studies unit of the New
York state Office of Alcohol and Substance Abuse Services, compared
New York's new heroin problem to the explosion of crack cocaine in
the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``People did not have any idea of what the outcome was going to
be,'' he said. ``They knew about the good times but not about the
bad times.'' Because younger users cannot remember the damage
caused by heroin during the 1970s epidemic, he added, ``they're not
afraid to sniff or snort because they think it's not going to
happen to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Schroeder, 38, and his wife, Kathy, 37, incongruously
well-spoken and courteous, were encountered lining up to swap used
syringes for clean ones at a sidewalk table run by the AIDS
Brigade, a legal needle-exchange program on 125th Street near
Lexington Avenue. They consented to be interviewed and photographed
because, Schroeder said, ``we want to make sure we can save
somebody else.''
</P>
<P>
   He also harbored a dream that someone might yet whisk them out
of their nightmare into permanent recovery.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not where I planned to be at this time of my life,''
Schroeder said. ``I'm up to three bags a day, and all it does is
make me feel I'm functioning normally.''
</P>
<P>
   A $10 bag of heroin used to suffice for one high, but addicts
today are injecting greater quantities. ``If the money was there,
I'd do more,'' Schroeder admitted.
</P>
<P>
   It was a little more than eight years ago, he said, when a
friend introduced him to sniffing heroin. Schroeder was earning $30
an hour as an elevator mechanic, working so much overtime that one
year his salary hit six figures, he said. Kathy Schroeder was
raising their three children in the family's three-bedroom ranch
house in Wayne. The Schroeders acquired three cars, they said, and
bought into a Florida condominium.
</P>
<P>
   But when he accepted some of his friend's heroin, Schroeder
said, ``I couldn't believe how strong it made me feel _ I was
delighted.''
</P>
<P>
   After a week, he initiated his wife. ``I hated the heroin at
first,'' Mrs. Schroeder recalled. ``It made me throw up because my
body was rejecting it.''
</P>
<P>
   Within a year, Schroeder had lost his job, leaving him unable to
pay the mortgages on the house and the Florida condominium, which
were foreclosed on. The cars were sold off. Their two daughters,
now 17 and 13, and son, now 10, have been taken in by relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Land records in New Jersey support Schroeder's account of the
foreclosure on his house, and neighbors said they knew of the
couple's drug use.
</P>
<P>
   Before heroin, the Schroeders had smoked a little marijuana with
friends and had tried cocaine. ``I've got to admit, if I hadn't
started smoking pot, I wouldn't have even started using heroin,''
Schroeder said. ``It is a stepping stone. All our friends were
using it.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   But once he had a heroin habit, he said, his old companions
ostracized him. ``These people who were our friends all hated and
resented me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It dropped the bottom out when they told me: `You're no longer
a free man. You're hooked,''' Schroeder said. ``It hurt. It changed
my whole life. Even my union didn't want anything to do with me.''
</P>
<P>
   With heroin taking center stage in their lives, the Schroeders
moved to Harlem and became full-time street people. After inhaling
heroin for five years, Kathy Schroeder said: ``We couldn't feel it
anymore. We couldn't get high sniffing, so we started shooting.''
</P>
<P>
   At first, they were so squeamish that they paid the drug dealer
an extra $5 to inject them. Now they eagerly pump heroin into their
own veins. They credit needle-exchange programs with protecting
them from AIDS. And they no longer share needles with each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought it would happen to me,'' Mrs. Schroeder said.
``I remember saying at 12 years old, I'll never stick a needle in
my arm.''
</P>
<P>
   The Schroeders have drifted in and out of programs that dispense
methadone, a synthetic opiate that blocks the effect of heroin.
Kathy Schroeder is taking 80 milligrams of methadone a day. Paul
Schroeder's dose has increased to 100 milligrams, well above
average.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time we go into rehab, it doesn't help,'' Schroeder
said. ``The only place that worked has been jail. I walked out of
it clean and feeling good.'' He underwent detoxification at the
city jail on Rikers Island in 1997 when he was locked up for seven
weeks on a charge of selling drugs. But he returned to heroin use
within days after rejoining his wife.
</P>
<P>
   The Schroeders blame P-dope _ as the local heroin is called,
because of its purity _ for their inability to quit, saying they
believe that it overrides the methadone because it is adulterated
with lidocaine, an anesthetic. ``Ninety-nine percent of the stuff
is geared up for that extra whammy,'' Schroeder said. ``They know
you'll come back, not because you want to, but because you have
to.''
</P>
<P>
   His welfare benefits are suspended because Schroeder failed to
show up for his workfare job collecting trash. He said he injured
his knee. The food stamps and cash that Mrs. Schroeder collects
through welfare can hardly feed them, leaving them to scrounge and
hustle to support a heroin habit that costs $50 to $100 a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try not to steal, but we collect a lot of bottles and
cans,'' Schroeder said. ``I fix fans and TVs. Things that are
broke, I fix.'' Asked whether he sold drugs, as many other addicts
do, he said that he used to steer customers to dealers, ``but it's
dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   So is being an addict. For those who can afford it, drug dealers
offer personal service, accepting orders by cell phone or beeper
and tacking on a delivery surcharge amounting to a $50 minimum in
Manhattan. But when street addicts like the Schroeders want to buy,
they depend on surly street dealers, and sometimes are robbed.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder said he had been mugged more times than he could
count. One day he was held up at gunpoint at Lexington Avenue and
130th Street. Six hours later and eight blocks away, he was beaten
after he gave a dealer his last $10. He limped to the nearest
subway station, where, he said, ``two cops walked down and gave me
a ticket for sitting on the steps.''
</P>
<P>
   When enough money is left after buying heroin, the Schroeders
try to go to New Jersey to see their children for birthdays or
holidays. ``They want us home,'' Kathy Schroeder said. ``That puts
a guilt trip on me because I know the kids need us.''
</P>
<P>
   She numbs herself to the guilt with more heroin.
</P>
<P>
   The Schroeders have pleaded with their children to avoid drugs,
Mrs. Schroeder said, ``but we feel it's a double standard, telling
them one thing and doing another.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet they sometimes sound ambivalent about being trapped in the
coils of heroin addiction. ``I want to get my act together, get out
of New York, go back to New Jersey, get my kids back and have a
normal life,'' Kathy Schroeder declared. But the prospect of
spending a minimum of 18 months in residential treatment, even if
the couple could afford it, made her pause.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see myself doing that right now,'' she said, ``but
there's always an excuse for an addict not to get treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Schroeder lost two friends to fatal overdoses and said he
had considered suicide. ``I'd like to start my life over again,''
he said. ``I feel my life is useless. I'm still down, and I can't
stand up.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say you have to hit rock bottom before you can go back
up,'' Schroeder mused. ``Do you know when you hit rock bottom,
there's a trap door that opens up and drops you down another
level?''

NEW EXTRA-STRENGTH HEROIN: IS IT THE PURITY OR THE ADDITIVES? 
</HEADLINE>
   (sidebar with HEROIN-COUPLE)  
 (bl)  
 By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As a nickname for heroin, P-dope has been around for
years. But among many current users, the belief has spread that
distributors are doctoring P-dope with adulterants to make it cut
through methadone, the heroin blocker, to avoid losing customers to
treatment clinics.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors who have studied addiction are skeptical, attributing
P-dope's greater potency to its purity.
</P>
<P>
   Jon Struan-Parker, who runs the AIDS Brigade, which distributes
clean syringes, agrees with the addicts. P-dope, he says, is cut
with anesthetics like lidocaine or procaine to hook users faster
and heighten their cravings. ``This is the crack of heroin,''
Struan-Parker said. ``It's more deadly.''
</P>
<P>
   A former heroin addict, Struan-Parker said the old heroin, cut
with quinine, left a user feeling blissfully mellow. ``When you do
P-dope,'' he said, ``you got a chip on your shoulder, you got an
attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   Other addicts collecting sterile syringes at his needle-exchange
table on 125th Street agreed that the heroin is being doctored.
Gerardo Ramos said, ``I'm on 80 milligrams of methadone, and it
goes right through.''
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. John Morgan, a professor of pharmacology at the City
University of New York Medical School, said that adding lidocaine
or procaine to heroin should not make it more addictive. Morgan,
who has studied the pharmacology of marijuana and other drugs,
suggested that P-dope's extraordinary purity was at fault.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the low purity of heroin traditionally that caused
people to inject it,'' Morgan said. ``If it's a high enough purity,
it will override methadone.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Edwin Salsitz, the director of a pilot methadone
prescription program at Beth Israel Medical Center, said the street
culture could also lead some addicts to sabotage their own
methadone treatment. ``Very often, these people don't have much
socialization outside of drugs,'' Salsitz said. ``They're
injecting, hanging around. It's not considered nice to pass up the
heroin.''
</P>
<P>
   Terry Furst, a sociological researcher who teaches at John Jay
College of Criminal Justice, said active adulterants in heroin have
proliferated since 1995. Because lidocaine and procaine reduce the
melting point of heroin base so it can be smoked more easily, he
speculated that some P-dope was created for smoking but was being
snorted and injected instead.

<P>
   They were pioneers as American soccer players, star defenders on
teams that won a world championship in 1991 and an Olympic gold
medal in 1996, and now they are plowing new cultural ground as
soccer moms.
</P>
<P>
   Last December, facing six months on the road in preparation for
next month's Women's World Cup, residing at a training camp in
Orlando, Fla., and barnstorming the United States and Portugal to
play tune-up games, Joy Fawcett and Carla Overbeck negotiated to
have the U.S. soccer federation pay for a nanny to accompany the
team and to help care for their young children.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't pay for day care at home; we are our own day care,''
Overbeck said. ``We didn't think we should have to incur those
expenses in being uprooted for six months. The federation was
willing to help out. A big headache has been relieved.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no professional soccer league for women in the United
States, so the top players get their prime competition with the
national team, which can travel two or three weeks a month. In
previous years, Fawcett and Overbeck had to pay for their own nanny
on the road. The players split the cost and used friends or their
mothers as baby sitters. But flights, hotel rooms and meals added
up to big expenses, especially on international trips.
</P>
<P>
   ``We smuggled a lot of food from team meals,'' Overbeck said
with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   She and Fawcett belong to the first generation of women able to
fully explore the possibilities of Title IX, the 1972 federal law
that essentially prohibited discrimination against women in
collegiate and high school sports. The two players have sought to
secure from U.S. Soccer, the national governing body, some of the
rights that women have attained in the corporate workplace, such as
maternity leave and child care.
</P>
<P>
   ``This gives a lot of hope for women's sports,'' said Nicolette
Richards, a 19-year-old who is taking time off from San Diego State
to work as a nanny for Fawcett and Overbeck. ``I think it's awesome
that the federation is so accepting and understanding. These girls
are like any other women who want to have a family, children and a
career.''
</P>
<P>
   Sports differs from most occupations in that the workplace is
constantly on the move, and women's soccer requires even more time
away from home. The Women's National Basketball Association, for
example, has no day care provision for its players, but they seldom
travel more than several days at a time. By contrast, Fawcett and
Overbeck are effectively on a six-month road trip, away from their
husbands and relatives except for a week's break each month, as
they prepare for the World Cup. During the three-week competition,
the children will attend the matches, but they will have to stay
with their fathers and other relatives so their mothers can
concentrate on soccer.
</P>
<P>
   The federation has budgeted $50,000 for the nanny, removing a
huge financial weight from the soccer moms, who, like their
teammates, are paid by U.S. Soccer and have endorsement contracts,
but play a sport where the average salary for the top Americans is
$30,000 to $40,000 a year. Some players, like Overbeck, work second
jobs as college coaches, while others have also played in
international leagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think U.S. Soccer has been very progressive,'' said Tony
DiCicco, the coach of the women's national team. ``They felt it was
the right thing to do, and they felt that the players had paid
their dues and had been here when there wasn't a lot happening
internationally for women's soccer. For them to be able to continue
their careers, they needed to do this.''
</P>
<P>
   Fawcett, 31, has long been considered by DiCicco to be the
world's best defender. She has two daughters _ Katey, who will be 5
in a week, and Carli, who will turn 2 this month. When Carli was
born in 1997, Fawcett was coaching the UCLA women's soccer team,
commuting two hours each way from her home in Orange County,
Calif., while also coaching a youth team and playing on the
national team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Breast-feeding at halftime, or on the sideline, that can get
interesting,'' Fawcett said. ``It's like, `I'll be back in a
minute.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Overbeck, who is celebrating her 31st birthday Sunday and and
who won four national championships at the University of North
Carolina, is a co-captain of the national team, which also won the
bronze medal in the 1995 Women's World Cup, and the player who sets
the bar in terms of fitness and preparation. Teammates and team
officials said she ran stadium steps during her ninth month of
pregnancy and lifted weights the day she delivered her son,
Jackson, who is 20 months old.
</P>
<P>
   Both Fawcett and Overbeck were important bricks in the
foundation of U.S. women's soccer, playing on the national team
that won the initial Women's World Cup in 1991. When the players
returned from China and told others they were world champions,
Overbeck said the frequent response was, ``We didn't even know you
had a team.''
</P>
<P>
   Five years later, the American women played in front of 76,481
in Athens, Ga., to win the Olympic gold medal and convince
officials that the 1999 Women's World Cup should be moved from
small stadiums on the East Coast into the same arenas that housed
the 1994 men's World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   The team's success turned its stars into role models for the 7
million girls who play soccer in this country, including Richards,
who said she jumped at the chance to become the nanny. As a high
school player in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, Richards had posters of team
stars like Mia Hamm, Julie Foudy and Kristine Lilly on her wall.
``My brother had Michael Jordan to look up to,'' Richards said.
``This was the start of girls having someone to look up to.''
</P>
<P>
   The women's national team travels with equipment bags and diaper
bags, a double stroller, car seats, a bag of soccer balls for the
players and a bag of toys for the kids. Richards earns $750 a week
and has her living and travel expenses paid by the soccer
federation.
</P>
<P>
   When the team is training in Orlando, Richards lives with
Fawcett, her two daughters and Shannon MacMillan, a forward on the
national team.
</P>
<P>
   On the road, Richards gets her own hotel room. And she is
getting a crash course on the joys and responsibilities of
motherhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I could take any break from school, this is the perfect
one,'' Richards said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's also the best birth control that money can buy. I've
decided I'm going to wait until I'm more than ready to have kids.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   During camp, Overbeck lives in a home in Orlando with her son
and teammates Foudy and Lilly. ``They do everything,'' Overbeck
said of Foudy and Lilly. ``Well, they haven't changed a diaper yet.
I'm waiting for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Fawcett, Overbeck rooms with her child in hotels.
</P>
<P>
   The mothers say that Richards and their teammates have been
indispensable, watching the kids during practice, helping to feed
and bathe them, taking them swimming and on walks, playing on the
computer, coloring in coloring books.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like having 20 aunts,'' Richards said.
</P>
<P>
   It is still rare to see mothers in international soccer.
MacMillan, who played professionally in Japan in 1996 and 1997,
said players there quit the sport when they get married. When the
Japanese national team came to Atlanta and Charlotte, N.C., to play
the Americans in two recent World Cup tune-ups, the Japanese
players seemed surprised and happy, yet a bit wistful, to find that
Fawcett and Overbeck could continue their careers as mothers,
MacMillan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seeing our players doing it as mothers gives them hope that
they may be able to do it, too,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Like many working mothers, however, Fawcett and Overbeck have
conflicted emotions. Feeling pressure that was either real or
self-imposed, Fawcett returned to scrimmaging with the national
team three weeks after Katey was born in 1994 because ``I was too
scared to say no.''
</P>
<P>
   Overbeck, who took a year off after the Olympics, was back
playing seven weeks after her son was born. ``You start thinking,
`Am I going to be able to play at that same level mentally and
physically?' '' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The kids miss their fathers, and the fathers miss their kids.
Inevitably, there are tearful departures when the mothers and
children leave home. Greg Overbeck, a restaurateur in Chapel Hill,
N.C., tries to see his son every two weeks. Walter Fawcett, a
computer analyst, relocated from Southern California to Florida
during previous training camps, Joy said, but was unable to do so
this year for the World Cup. He puts his daughters to bed when they
are home, but now he does it by phone, a continent away.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough, it's hard, but I understand why we go through it,
and I totally support what Carla is doing,'' Greg Overbeck said.
``To see how far they have come is amazing. Before the 1991 World
Cup, they didn't get paid, there was no insurance, no exposure, no
endorsements. Not enough to make a living at it. Carla worked at an
elementary school.''
</P>
<P>
   After 1991, many players might have quit, he said, except that
women's soccer was being considered for the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had sacrificed relationships and careers, put everything
on hold, then they reached the pinnacle and had nothing to show for
it,'' he said. ``They were very discouraged. To turn around and see
what they've become, it's great for women.''
</P>
<P>
   Fawcett and Overbeck want to play in the 2000 Olympics in
Sydney, Australia, and team officials said they believed the nanny
program would continue. But Katey Fawcett will be in kindergarten
next year and has already signed up to play in a soccer league at
home. Joy said she hoped the Olympic training camp would be in
California instead of Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the beginning, I questioned whether this was good for the
kids,'' Fawcett said. ``I talked to other moms, and their kids eat
at 8 and sleep at 12, and it's all so regular. My kids eat when
they can, sleep in the stroller. But they're adaptable. Things
don't bother them too much. I think it's good. They get to see the
world, and it allows me to play soccer.''

</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Sunday, May 9:
</P>
<P>
   Term limits being what they are in New York City, Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani's present job ends on Dec. 31, 2001. Thus, the mayor has
been casting an eye on other possibilities, most noticeably a run
for the U.S. Senate in the year 2000. Such yearnings are now
raising questions about how well the mayor is balancing his quest
for a new national office next year with his management of the most
important and diverse city in the world. To put it more bluntly,
will the mayor's political ambitions harm New York City?
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani bridles at the question, but it has begun to register
on the city's political sensors in a number of ways, most noisily
these days on the issue of education. In some ways, the mayor has
been acting like a man trying to rewrite the recent history of the
New York City public school system. He says the system should be
``blown up.'' He has been freezing out his Chancellor, once a
cigar-smoking pal who did the mayor's bidding until he threatened
to resign over the Giuliani voucher plan and blindsided the mayor
with a public defense of the school system. Giuliani wants to
abolish the Board of Education, which he has now shown that he can
control, and he is also pushing changes that, while politically
correct within the Republican Party, may not work as well for 1.1
million public school students in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   If this is an effort to revamp the system before next year's
election, or simply to ``stir things up,'' as he puts it, it is
awfully late. If it is an effort for the mayor to say that the last
five years at city schools were somebody else's problem, it doesn't
work. The New York City school system may be a political hot
potato, but it belongs on Giuliani's plate.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor has vigorously denied any political motives for these
latest outbursts. He is right, of course, that the reforms he is
pushing now are not recent additions to his political agenda. But
the urgency and harshness of his effort are a new development. With
time running short before next year's campaign, the mayor is
stepping up the pressure to start an experiment with vouchers, to
halt social promotion and to dismantle the school boards and Board
of Education.
</P>
<P>
   We favor dismantling the boards, while recognizing that the
effort faces many hurdles. But we have severe misgivings about the
timing, implementation and content of the mayor's other
initiatives. Chancellor Rudy Crew has said he will resign before
starting a voucher program. On social promotions, the chancellor
last Monday hurriedly outlined such a tough plan for next year that
he estimates about 300,000 students could fail. Even in Chicago,
the model city on this issue, a no-pass plan was phased in slowly
to keep from overwhelming the system.
</P>
<P>
   The five-year capital improvement plan suddenly created by the
mayor and his Board of Education majority also invites skeptical
political analysis. The mayor's plan cuts the chancellor's budget
for improving school facilities from $11 billion to $7 billion, an
amount the mayor believes is closer to reality. Of the remaining
funds, larger chunks go to Queens, which desperately needs
facilities, and to Staten Island, where the need is far less
urgent. The mayor says that need is what matters here, not
politics, but the boroughs that won in his plan are more
politically in tune with him than the three that could lose the
most money _ Manhattan, Brooklyn and the Bronx. Moreover, dealing a
chastening loss to the chancellor feels like a major reason for
this vote. Crew has rebelled publicly. Now the mayor has sent his
thunderbolt as a sign he is boss.
</P>
<P>
   It is not only what the mayor is proclaiming on the education
front that is troubling. Some important issues seem to be getting
less emphasis these days. New York City schools are clearly among
the neediest in the state _ a point the mayor made well about three
months ago in Albany.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of squabbling with the chancellor, the mayor should be
pushing the governor and state Legislature to spread the wealth
beyond schools in the Republican-rich suburbs. The STAR program, a
tax cut especially popular in suburban and upstate areas, came with
a promise of more money for prekindergarten and smaller classes.
That promise is now in jeopardy in Albany _ an injustice that the
mayor also has not been battling with his usual fervor.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor may be trying to balance his job overseeing the
schools in all five boroughs with his courting of Republican
campaign donors and upstate voters. A future Senate seat may depend
on what he says, but 1.1 million public school students from all
five boroughs need his support today.

EDITORIAL: FAIR TREATMENT FOR LEGAL IMMIGRANTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Congress makes a mistake that inflicts undue hurt on
individuals and their families, it has a duty to correct the
injustice.
</P>
<P>
   Harsh deportation rules adopted in 1996 condemn many productive
legal residents to automatic expulsion based on low-level offenses
they committed long ago, and for which they have paid their debt to
society. The problem arises because Congress failed to draw a
distinction between immigrants who committed murder, rape and other
serious crimes worthy of deportation and those who committed a
minor theft or were found in possession of a small quantity of
drugs. Hundreds of longtime legal residents with minor offenses
have been abruptly wrenched from their families and sent back to
their birth countries.
</P>
<P>
   A corrective measure sponsored by Reps. Barney Frank, D-Mass.,
Martin Frost, D-Texas, and Lincoln Diaz-Balart, R-Fla., would
restore judicial discretion and due process rights that Congress
unwisely obliterated three years ago. Meanwhile, Attorney General
Janet Reno should provide some immediate relief by allowing waivers
in cases already pending when the law went into effect.
</P>
<P>
   On a related issue, Congress has not fully corrected the unfair
treatment of legal immigrants under the 1996 welfare reform law.
The welfare law was primarily intended to move welfare recipients
to work. But it exacted a much harsher, unjust toll on legal
immigrants. It declared them ineligible for many kinds of cash and
nutritional aid, even though legal immigrants pay taxes to support
safety-net programs like everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   Since then Congress has scaled back some of the most drastic
cuts to immigrant children and the disabled, but not enough. A new
bill sponsored by Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., would fully
restore Supplemental Security Income assistance and food stamp
benefits to all eligible immigrants who were in this country
legally prior to welfare reform, and would restore SSI eligibility
to those who have come after 1996 if they become disabled. It would
also allow states to enroll immigrant children in the new Child
Health Insurance Program and provide Medicaid coverage to pregnant
women and children whenever they arrive.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of the Moynihan proposal would be about $2.7 billion
over five years. That is a small price to restore basic fairness to
immigrants who are a vital part of this society.

EDITORIAL OBSERVER: BANKRUPTCY REFORM THAT SPARES THE WEALTHY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, Fla.)   (bl)  
 By FLOYD NORRIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Watching a rich man stiff his creditors while walking away with
millions can grate on people. Yet a gaping loophole in the
bankruptcy laws routinely allows that to happen.
</P>
<P>
   That loophole enabled such people as Martin Siegel, the former
investment banker who was convicted of insider trading; former
baseball commissioner Bowie Kuhn and actor Burt Reynolds to emerge
from bankruptcy with ample assets _ sometimes valued in the
millions _ even as their creditors suffered huge losses.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, amid much rhetoric about how outrageous it was that
people who could afford to pay some of their bills were able to
walk away from all of them, the House of Representatives passed a
bankruptcy reform bill. If enacted, the bill will make it much
easier for creditors _ particularly credit card companies _ to
collect money from bankrupts.
</P>
<P>
   But while it will become harder to evade a few thousand dollars
of credit card debt, it will not be any more difficult for
millionaires to shelter their assets while declaring bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   The wealthy can often stay millionaires because the laws in a
handful of states _ most notably Florida and Texas _ set no limit
on the value of a home that a bankrupt person can keep even as his
debts are discharged by the court. So some people, as bankruptcy
nears, sell their homes in states like New York and buy
million-dollar homes, for cash, in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   A fair bill would put a limit on the amount of home equity that
could be protected from creditors. The Senate tried to do that last
year, with a limit of $100,000, but that bill was killed. The House
wants no limits on what state legislatures let the rich keep.
</P>
<P>
   The House bill will make life harder for poor and middle-class
people who file for bankruptcy. People whose income has been above
the regional median income will be forced into plans requiring some
repayment of debts, even if future income is likely to be less
because the person has lost his previous job. The calculations
regarding how much a person can afford to pay may not take into
consideration his actual living costs. It is reasonable to try to
force bankrupts to pay what they can afford, but this bill, with
its lack of discretion for bankruptcy trustees and judges, is
likely to bring unreasonable hardship for some.
</P>
<P>
   This bill was pushed by the credit card companies, who worry
that people abuse them by taking on credit card debts and then
going broke. The companies already can challenge any bankruptcy on
fraud grounds, but doing so costs money and may not seem to be
worth it when only a few thousand dollars or less are at stake in
any one filing. They hope that strict rules will enable them to
force many more people to repay at least some money.
</P>
<P>
   The 1990s have seen booms in bankruptcy filings _ and in credit
card issuance. Last year, 1.45 million people filed for bankruptcy,
up 3 percent from 1997, while credit card companies sent out 3.4
billion card solicitations, a 15 percent increase. It would appear
that rising bankruptcies have not yet caused lenders to grow more
cautious.
</P>
<P>
   One interesting feature of the House bill is that it requires
the government to pay for random audits of bankruptcy filings to
see if people are cheating. Yet Congress will not spend money to
let the IRS conduct random audits of tax returns. Protecting Visa's
revenues would seem to be a higher priority than protecting those
of the government.
</P>
<P>
   Two centuries ago, it was common for states to allow creditors
to throw people into prison if they had not paid their debts. But
even then, the creditor had to pay the state the cost of
imprisoning the man. Now, if this bill passes, the taxpayers will
foot the bill to force people to pay their debts.
</P>
<P>
   Unless, of course, they are once-rich people who can afford to
buy expensive houses in Texas or Florida. Those people are to be
protected even as the government cracks down on middle-class people
who have fallen on hard times.

SALE FOCUSES ON A LIFETIME OF MECHANICAL GENIUS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAMES FISHER  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KNOB NOSTER, Mo. _ Last Sunday, five miles northwest of here,
hundreds of cars, trucks and trailers turned 40 acres of tranquil
farmland into a parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   A quarter-mile up the road in another pasture, 1,500 to 2,000
men, women and children _ an authentic throng for a Sunday here in
Johnson County _ ebbed and flowed, following a portable public
address system.
</P>
<P>
   A small country and western concert? A revival? Even an oddly
scheduled field crop demonstration?
</P>
<P>
   Nope. It was an estate sale, the last of three such offerings in
the past couple of months that have netted _ from the holdings of a
man who was essentially a farmer and a blacksmith _ more than
$580,000 for medical research.
</P>
<P>
   Two earlier sales _ bric-a-brac, household furnishings and farm
equipment _ had also drawn droves. Last Sunday's, though, was the
whopper: On sale was what Donald G. Skidmore had been renowned for:
antique machinery, vintage tractors and Model T Fords.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guarantee the news was all over the country _ even
overseas,'' said Don Merrill, who lives in Warrensburg, Mo. ``Had
been for months. You'd hear, `Don Skidmore's stuff is up for
auction,' and people would just say, `When?' He was known all
over.''
</P>
<P>
   Skidmore's genius _ and that word was used unsparingly last
weekend _ was threefold:
</P>
<P>
   He could take an old tractor that had been abandoned for years
in a hedgerow and restore not only its exterior to a gleaming
newness but make its innards hum like the day it came off its
assembly line.
</P>
<P>
   Lacking a part, he could make it from scratch in the shop out
behind his home. Any part.
</P>
<P>
   With an engineer's intuition, he could see faults in an original
design and then come up with a fix that worked better. Skidmore,
incidentally, had only a high school education.
</P>
<P>
   It was a common sight to find Skidmore in the shop behind his
house from dawn to well past dusk shaping wheels, machining gears,
bending sheet metal, cutting steel. Metal work was his passion,
friends said. He didn't drink. Tobacco was anathema, as reflected
by a prominent sign outside the shop put up years ago: ``No Smoking
on This Farm _ No Exceptions.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll tell you how good he was,'' said Charles Swearngin, a
friend and executor of the estate. ``See that little John Deere
crawler over there? Half-scale. A little bulldozer. Look at it
close. Every detail is perfect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once we were at an Iowa show and, naturally, Don had taken
best of show with that crawler. This old guy comes around, looks
that crawler up and down, and then said he's been a John Deere
dealer for 40 years and he sure didn't recollect the company ever
making any crawlers that small.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don looks right at him and says it was a `very limited
production run.' And that old dealer bought it and walked away
satisfied.''
</P>
<P>
   Swearngin told another story: When Skidmore came up with one of
his simpler ways to do things, say a better way to connect the
transmission linkage so it would last longer, be easier and cheaper
to make and assemble, and mean less servicing, he would fire off a
suggestion to the manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   ``And pretty soon,''said Swearngin, ``you'd go in the dealership
and there'd be the new model with just what Don had recommended.
Only it was always just a little bit different so they wouldn't
have to pay him any royalties.''
</P>
<P>
   Merrill said Skidmore, a species once common to every village
and hamlet in America but which now has all but disappeared, had a
touch with metal that had to be seen to be believed.
</P>
<P>
   ``One day I found him welding on a pipe tobacco can.'' he said.
``You or I trying that would catch the can on fire, burn it to a
crisp. The metal's that thin. Not Don.''
</P>
<P>
   The other thing recalled about Skidmore was an uncanny ability
to look ahead and figure out what might be valuable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to start this by telling you he went in the Army and
got assigned to the motor pool,'' said Swearngin. ``Hated it.
Nothing but Dodges and Chevys. He was a Ford man.
</P>
<P>
   ``What he did, over 50 years ago, was start going around to Ford
dealerships, asking if they had any old Model T or Model A parts.
They did, especially these little-bitty dealers that used to be in
every small town.
</P>
<P>
   ``He went all everywhere _ way out West, down South, back East.
Sometimes he'd pay a little, but usually the dealer would just
throw the stuff at him, glad to get rid of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don would bring truckloads home _ motors, fenders, frames,
seats, upholstery, absolutely everything. He knew those cars would
make a comeback, that somebody down the road would want them.''
</P>
<P>
   Skidmore, of course, was in the catbird seat. With the detritus
from hundreds of dealerships he was able to build Model T's and
Model A's. Not many. Nor at an assembly-line pace. But when he was
done, he had a virtually new car. Last Sunday, one Model A here,
believe it or not, had two miles on the odometer.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, said Swearngin, Skidmore never was boastful about his
ability to make a silk purse out of a sow's ear. To strangers he
was just a lanky Missouri farmer with worn hands, a craggy face and
a taciturn manner. To his friends he was an original.
</P>
<P>
   Besides running cattle, Skidmore built, among other things, farm
trailers that he'd haul to weekend antique tractor and car shows
and sell. Then he would return home with some old tractor or a load
of fence posts he'd bought or traded for. There were no wasted
trips.
</P>
<P>
   In 1978, Skidmore was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer,
invariably a death sentence. A tumor the size of a grapefruit was
removed. Skidmore recovered.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988 cancer was found in his liver. Chemotherapy held that in
check.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, Skidmore's wife, Ruby, died. The couple was childless.
</P>
<P>
   Then a couple of years ago Skidmore's heart weakened because of
fluid buildup caused by the ongoing chemotherapy for his liver. He
died in November, age 73, at a Kansas City hospital of congestive
heart failure.
</P>
<P>
   At the sale here last Sunday 30-plus old tractors sold, six of
the remaining Fords (most assembled out of unused parts), plus
hundred of old parts, tools, iron implement seats, trailers, steam
whistles, license plates, even several hog rendering kettles.
</P>
<P>
   The miniature John Deere crawler brought $8,500; the cars $7,500
to $11,000. The total Sunday, said Swearngin, was $260,000. Add
that to $348,000 from the two earlier sales, he said, and there's
well over half a million dollars to be split evenly between the
lung and heart associations.
</P>
<P>
   Which will be a legacy for Skidmore. But maybe a more personal
tribute was paid when auctioneer Densil Allen paused in his
rapid-fire pitch and announced that unlike most sales there
wouldn't be any starting of engines to make sure they ran.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew Don Skidmore,'' said Allen. ``If it was on his place,
it ran.''
</P>
<P>
   Several people in the crowd smiled and nodded. The engines
remained still. The bidding continued.

FOR MANY STORM VICTIMS, JOY OF SURVIVAL TRANSCENDS LOSS OF
POSSESSIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICK MONTGOMERY  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOORE, Okla. _ Why was Leigh Tucker laughing?
</P>
<P>
   She stood in the flattened remains of her home holding only a
small stack of cards _ her driver's license, voter identification,
video-rental card and Sears charge card. Save for the dining-room
chairs and some coffee-table books, almost everything else had been
blown away. Fifty-nine years' worth of earthly possessions, blown
away.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago Tucker decided to stop making the $50 monthly
payments for homeowners insurance. Oh, she could just kick herself!
She had owned this place nearly 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, Leigh?'' one of her art students said as he pulled a book
out of the debris. ``This yours?''
</P>
<P>
   And Tucker broke out laughing again: ``Ha, ha, ha _ thank
goodness!'' The book was The Joy of Sex, and yes, it was hers.
</P>
<P>
   You might think Leigh Tucker is acting strangely. But then, has
your house ever been ruined by a tornado? Have you ever crawled out
of a hallway closet, dazed but uninjured, and known what it was
like inside one of the most powerful twisters ever recorded _ what
experts call an F5?
</P>
<P>
   If you were Leigh Tucker, your material possessions might seem
about as valuable as they looked there in the mud, broken and
scattered and coated with dust. Junk, that's all. ``Five-and-dime
goulash,'' as one of Tucker's neighbors described it in Moore, this
ravaged Oklahoma City suburb.
</P>
<P>
   ``You might as well laugh than cry,'' Tucker said. ``I guess I
used to be sort of materialistic, before my father died a few years
back. I'm not that way anymore.''
After the shock
</P>
<P>
   That is a common reaction, said Terry Pace, associate professor
of counseling psychology at the University of Oklahoma in nearby
Norman.
</P>
<P>
   ``For tornado victims who don't lose family members _ and that's
the key distinction _ the first stage is shock: What are we going
to do? But that may last from only a few hours to a day or two,''
Pace said.
</P>
<P>
   ``By now, what you're seeing is a practical focus. ... People
are saying, `OK, we're alive. We've got a lot of work to do.' It's
not just a cliche: The things you really cherish after an event
such as this are your health, your family's health and your
connections with friends.''
</P>
<P>
   At least a half-dozen persons died and 1,000 homes were
destroyed in Moore, population 40,000, where the largest of Monday
night's tornadoes hit full force. Hard adjustments lie ahead, as
hundreds scramble to find temporary housing, schooling for their
children and any federal help available to resume their lives.
</P>
<P>
   By week's end, however, wisecracks and laughter broke through
Tucker's neighborhood of brick, middle-class homes. A photo album
or an heirloom found intact was cause for celebration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tom, isn't that dresser heavy?'' asked one homeowner to a
younger, burlier neighbor who heaved the bureau onto a Ford truck.
</P>
<P>
   Tom replied: ``Does a one-legged duck walk in circles?''
</P>
<P>
   Joy Watson, 69, silently stared at what remained of her house of
22 years. A few walls. No roof. No garage, no bedrooms or kitchen.
Craft magazines everywhere. Only her husband's neckties dangled in
a skylit closet.
</P>
<P>
   A reporter asked how she was holding up, and Watson gazed deeply
into his face and said, ``Honey, you need some sunscreen.'' She
marched to the cab of her pickup _ the same truck that allowed
Watson and her husband to escape the tornado. She grabbed a tube of
lotion and urged the reporter to use it all.
</P>
<P>
   Watson wore a ratty fishing cap. ``I was so happy to find my
hair curlers in this mess,'' she whispered with a chuckle. ``I
won't have to look like this forever.''
</P>
<P>
   There is misery, and it comes in waves. When the survivors
arrive in the morning to start another cleanup day, the depression
is thick, obvious. When they come back from lunch and view the mess
again, depression returns.
</P>
<P>
   But in the hours between, they help one another and hold
together.
</P>
<P>
   What else can they do?
</P>
<P>
   ``My husband and I have never been through this, so I'm not sure
what happens next,'' said Watson, who for the moment is living in
her son's home. ``We're insured. ... I suppose we get an apartment.
Shop some garage sales. We have to keep living.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe your sense of humor is the last thing to go. If you
don't have that, you're dead.''
A changed landscape
</P>
<P>
   At the height of the storm, Tucker was certain that death raged
behind that closet door, rapping with all its might to get in.
</P>
<P>
   She reached up from her crouched position beneath the coats to
grab the knob with both hands. Even there in the closet, the wind
tossed her hair. Just outside the door it was moving at nearly 300
mph.
</P>
<P>
   Then all turned quiet. Tucker creaked the door open. Where there
once had been a dining room with art deco furniture, salmon-colored
walls and arched entryways, there now was ... daylight.
</P>
<P>
   She stumbled into the yard. What happened to the double garage?
Where was the sunset maple tree with the burning red leaves that
you could see all the way from Interstate 35?
</P>
<P>
   A part-time art teacher, free-lance fashion illustrator and
activist Democrat, she and her ex-husband had bought this house
just out of college. She had raised a daughter here. But in her
last few years alone, with the house paid off, she succumbed to
rising utility bills and her distrust of insurance firms. She
stopped paying her homeowners' premium.
</P>
<P>
   Tucker's driveway was littered with campaign signs that she had
stored in the garage after her failed bid for the state Legislature
in 1996. ``Leigh Tucker _ Your Ticket for Change!'' they read.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly she was facing more change than she had ever thought
possible.
</P>
<P>
   But she was alive.
</P>
<P>
   Her sister in Houston, Dee McCants, would not learn of Tucker's
fate for hours; she drove all the way to Oklahoma as the car radio
blared reports of the tornado damage. Their mother, who is 83, was
so distressed that night, she vomited.
</P>
<P>
   Tucker was grief-stricken the first day. ``What will I do?'' she
asked. ``Where will I stay?'' But when her sister found her, and
her brother Tommy Noah of Oklahoma City found her, the whole family
hugged and wept and eventually laughed. Tucker said she learned
that she hadn't lost what mattered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now this is art,'' she said Thursday, spreading her arms in
front of a cracked and mud-splattered wall in her old bedroom.
``It's a Pollock! Ha, ha, ha.'' If artist Jackson Pollock could
make millions splattering paint on canvas, Tucker asked, then why
couldn't she make a couple of bucks off this wall?
</P>
<P>
   Acquaintances came calling. ``Oh, Leigh, this is much worse than
you described on the phone,'' one tearful friend said. They would
embrace, Tucker would say, ``Well, you dear,'' and soon they would
burst out laughing about something.
</P>
<P>
   Across the street at the Gannaways, Kevin R. Kemper helped with
the cleanup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see how a person gets through this without family,
without friends to support them through the whole process,'' said
Kemper, a Baptist preacher from Hartshorne. ``Some people out there
have nobody, not to mention no insurance. They'll have a hard time
surviving.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gannaways, Butch and Billie, fished through the rubble with
daughter Lori, who drove in from Hartshorne, and with Butch's
brother Harlan and his wife, Anita, who live down the way.
</P>
<P>
   The Gannaways were insured. They survived the tornado by packing
into a storm shelter with 22 other persons and a dog.
</P>
<P>
   Their house was lost. But something strange, almost magical,
happened as Lori crawled beneath a wall that had fallen on the
stereo cabinet. From deep in that mess trickled the faint sound of
a music _ ``Hark! the Herald Angels Sing'' _ and Lori pulled out a
musical snow globe of the Nativity.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't even scuffed.
</P>
<P>
   She set it beside other bits of buried treasure _ the ``Gannaway
Reunion Tape 1990,'' and a video of granddaughter Lauren, now 10,
singing songs when she was a toddler.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're finding those things that we wanted the most,'' Lori
said.
</P>
<P>
   Those are things not even an F5 tornado could destroy.

MAJ. JOHN HOWARD, 86, BRITISH D-DAY HERO 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By RICHARD GOLDSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Maj. John Howard, the commander of glider-borne British
infantrymen who seized the strategically vital Pegasus Bridge in
the first battle of the D-Day invasion of Normandy, died May 5 in a
hospital in Surrey, England. He was 86 and had lived in Burford,
near Oxford.
</P>
<P>
   Under cover of night on June 6, 1944, six gliders carrying 181
officers and men of the 2nd Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light
Infantry landed on the eastern flank of a 60-mile invasion front on
the northern coast of France. The regiment had a heritage going
back to the battles of Bunker Hill and New Orleans, to Waterloo and
to World War I. Now its soldiers were in the vanguard of the
invasion of Hitler's Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Howard's D Company was ordered to seize two bridges, one over
the Caen Canal and the other spanning the parallel Orne River. If
the Germans held on to those bridges, panzer units could move
across them in a counterattack isolating 10,000 British
paratroopers jumping behind the British invasion beach known as
Sword, where infantry forces would arrive at daybreak. And Howard's
men sought to strike swiftly to prevent the Germans from blowing up
the bridges if they were overwhelmed; the British needed those
bridges to resupply their airborne units.
</P>
<P>
   British Halifax bombers towed the gliders over the English
Channel, then cut them loose.
</P>
<P>
   Howard's lead glider landed at 12:16 a.m., only 50 yards from
the Caen Canal bridge, but the glider's nose collapsed on impact,
knocking everybody aboard unconscious for a few seconds. The
soldiers quickly emerged, and over the next five minutes the men
directly under Howard killed the surprised German defenders.
</P>
<P>
   The nearby Orne River bridge was captured by other troops in
Howard's unit, and soon the words ``Ham and Jam,'' signifying
mission accomplished, were radioed to the airborne.
</P>
<P>
   Two British soldiers were killed and 14 wounded in the
operation.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next 12 hours, British paratroopers and commandos
reinforced Howard's men, and British forces were able to move
toward the city of Caen, their flank having been protected by the
capture of the bridges.
</P>
<P>
   On July 16, Howard received the Distinguished Service Order,
Britain's second-highest award for valor. On the 10th anniversary
of D-Day, he received the Croix de Guerre Avec Palme from the
French government, which had renamed the Caen Canal span Pegasus
Bridge, for the flying horse symbolizing the British airborne. The
road crossing the bridge was later renamed Esplanade Major John
Howard.
</P>
<P>
   Howard was an adviser for Darryl Zanuck's 1962 film ``The
Longest Day,'' in which he was portrayed by Richard Todd, the
British actor, who had jumped into Normandy on D-Day with the
British 6th Airborne Division.
</P>
<P>
   John Howard was born on Dec. 8, 1912, the first of nine
children, and grew up in London's West End. At 19, he joined the
army, and except for an 18-month stint as a police officer in
Oxford he remained in military service through World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Howard was wounded twice in the summer of 1944, then returned to
England in September to reorganize his company. In mid-November, he
suffered severe leg and hip injuries in a military vehicular
accident and was hospitalized until March 1945. He left the
military at the end of the war and later worked for the British
National Savings Committee and Ministry of Food.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by a daughter, Penny. His wife, Joy, died in

   Howard often returned to Normandy for anniversary ceremonies,
where he was reunited with his comrades. He also visited the
Gondree family, owners of a cafe near Pegasus Bridge, who had
provided information on German defenses to the French Resistance
for transmission to Howard when he was preparing for his mission.
That cafe was the first French building to be liberated. Pegasus
Bridge was rebuilt in 1994, and a museum commemorating D-Day is to
be opened there on June 6, 2000.

THE STRUGGLE FOR THE SOUL OF PUBLIC EDUCATION COMES TO A HEAD IN
KANSAS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KATE BEEM  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Think of it as an educational tug of war.
</P>
<P>
   On the one side, the establishment that has run the nation's
public school systems for years.
</P>
<P>
   On the other, social conservatives who say liberalized public
education is destroying the country's moral fabric.
</P>
<P>
   In the middle, millions of children.
</P>
<P>
   It is a national phenomenon, but nowhere are the two sides
pulling harder than in Kansas. The state's 10-member elected Board
of Education is split evenly along ideological lines. Five members
are moderate Republicans or Democrats, and five, all Republicans,
are Christian conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   The struggle is likely to intensify this week, as the board
takes up new science standards and an old question: How did life
and the universe begin?
</P>
<P>
   Evolution would be taught as a cornerstone of science in revised
standards the board will consider Wednesday. The standards spell
out what children would learn and be tested on, and they do not
mention creationism.
</P>
<P>
   A conservative board member is expected to introduce a competing
proposal that questions the validity of evolutionary theory. It
also describes creation as being the result of ``intelligent
design.''
</P>
<P>
   Although they lack a majority, the conservatives have had an
effect since they first gained control of half the seats in 1996.
Through a series of 5-5 votes and the compromises that followed,
the conservatives have forced new curriculum standards and testing
methods, and they have stalled implementation of some federal
programs.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Meek, a moderate Republican who lost a bid for the state
board in 1996, says the frequent gridlock has hurt Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we stand still, people really do pass us by,'' said Meek, a
member of the Spring Hill, Kan., Board of Education. ``I don't
think there's such a thing as standing still anymore. You either go
forward, or you regress.''
</P>
<P>
   He pointed to the board's 5-5 deadlock last year on accepting
federal money through the Workforce Investment Act, which provides
aid to states that develop career programs. Meek says such programs
help students make choices about the future.
</P>
<P>
   Christian conservatives object to such programs because, they
say, they steer students toward jobs that businesses say are in
demand instead of leaving those decisions to the students and their
families.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer state board members deadlocked on a plan that was
intended to give students more advanced, real-world math skills.
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives objected because the plan would have allowed the
use of calculators _ considered a crutch _ instead of requiring
math by hand only. The moderates compromised.
</P>
<P>
   The standards, approved in March almost a year after first
reaching the board, now focus on basic mathematics and prohibit
elementary students from using calculators on state tests.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Gilmore, a conservative from Olathe, Kan., who was
chairman of the Kansas state board for two years, views the
deadlocks as the democratic process at work. If the conservatives
don't always get their way, he said, that is the democratic
process, as well.
</P>
<P>
   His colleagues are not the strident radicals they are sometimes
painted to be by political foes, Gilmore said. ``I don't view any
of them as extremists,'' he said. ``I don't think extremists get
elected.''
</P>
<P>
   Kansas is not the only place where Christian conservatives are
making their voices heard:
</P>
<P>
   - In Texas conservative members of the state school board pushed
through a biology textbook with few references to evolution. In
Alabama a conservative group persuaded state legislators to have a
disclaimer about evolution pasted inside every biology text, a move
that the National Center for Science Education said intimidated
teachers from introducing the subject.
</P>
<P>
   Other national groups support creationism and ``creation
science,'' the theory that the Earth is just a few thousand years
old and that the dinosaurs died out in the Great Flood, recorded in
Genesis.
</P>
<P>
   Courts repeatedly have struck down efforts to teach such
theories in science classes.
</P>
<P>
   - Like their Kansas counterparts, Christian conservatives in
Ohio and Michigan have opposed the federal Workforce Investment Act
and its School-to-Work program.
</P>
<P>
   - ``Parental rights'' initiatives have cropped up in recent
years in Congress and in more than 20 states, including Kansas,
Indiana, Michigan and Colorado. Conservatives say the bills would
guarantee parents' rights to raise their children. Liberals and
moderates say the bills would make it easier for parents to
challenge school teachings on religious grounds.
</P>
<P>
   About half of the members of the Texas school board are
Christian conservatives. Additional states in which Christian
conservatives have significant representation on local and state
boards include California, Ohio and Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   In Missouri state school board members are appointed by the
governor.
Wide-ranging power
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas Board of Education dictates much of what is taught in
the state's public schools.
</P>
<P>
   The board has sweeping authority over the state's 304 public
school districts, as well as its vocational schools, community
colleges and schools for the deaf and the blind, but not the state
universities. It can require any program it wishes without seeking
the approval of the governor or the Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   The deadlocked votes have upset some state lawmakers. Feeling
pressure, board members have split the board's two-year
chairmanship, which controls the board agenda. Linda Holloway, a
conservative from Shawnee, Kan., is chairwoman this year; Harold
Roth, a moderate from Haven, Kan., will be chairman in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The board hoped to send voters a message that it would try to
avoid deadlock. Indeed, in March, the board unanimously approved
the compromise math standards.
</P>
<P>
   But a state audit of the board's performance in the last two
years said the deadlocks had frustrated teachers and school
administrators across Kansas. ``The tie votes are seen by some as a
lack of decision-making,'' said the report, released in March.
</P>
<P>
   Some lawmakers have worried that conservative members would try
to reverse reform efforts such as Quality Performance
Accreditation, the state's moderate-supported school improvement
program. Under the program, schools are accredited based on how
well students learn specific subjects rather than on standards such
as the numbers of books the schools have.
</P>
<P>
   The accreditation effort developed alongside the state's new
school-finance formula, and both took effect in the early 1990s.
The Legislature saw the new accreditation system as a way to link
accountability and school funding.
</P>
<P>
   Quality Performance Accreditation has remained intact, but
conservatives have slowed the programs that the previous board was
enacting. The accreditation testing program, for example, almost
died after conservatives voted not to renew it in 1997. A
compromise was reached later when moderates, in part, agreed to
scrap subjective tests, which the conservatives disliked.
Finding a voice
</P>
<P>
   Christian conservatives think public schools have turned away
from the country's educational foundation: Schools run by churches
that taught right and wrong from one basic text, the Bible.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Christian conservatives are just trying to have a voice,
said Sam Blumenfeld, a conservative scholar in Boston who writes
for the online news service WorldNet Daily.
</P>
<P>
   Blumenfeld said public schools ``undermine Christians' ability
to influence their children.''
</P>
<P>
   Christian conservatives want to return to a time when public
schools worked, he said. America's founders, he said, were
Calvinists who believed that man is, by nature, a depraved creature
who needs fear of a higher power to do the right thing.
</P>
<P>
   Public schools at one time were based on this philosophy,
Blumenfeld said, but in recent decades the schools have been shaped
by secular humanism, which holds that humans control their
destinies.
</P>
<P>
   Christian conservatives, he said, ``have no influence over what
the public schools do. Whatever policies they have are made by
liberals.''
</P>
<P>
   Christian conservatives say ``A Nation at Risk'' gave voice to
their fears. The report, released in the early 1980s by a
presidential panel, sharply criticized American education. That
criticism was taken by Christian conservatives as an explanation of
why society's bedrock _ the family _ was crumbling.
</P>
<P>
   In a sense it validated social conservatives' opinions about
higher rates of divorce, teen-age pregnancy and sexually
transmitted disease. America's children spend much of their time in
school. What were they learning there?
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, several Christian conservative leaders,
including ministers Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell, have publicly
stated their disdain for the nation's public education system.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech at last fall's Christian Coalition national
convention, Robertson said that 19th-century reformer John Dewey
trained teachers to spread the ``poison'' of secular humanism into
public schools. Falwell has said public schools are a place of
darkness.
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives have decried tests that they say often contain
open-ended questions to which students choose the best answer, not
the right answer. That's a form of moral relativism, in which there
are no rights or wrongs, Christian conservatives say.
</P>
<P>
   Comprehensive sex education in schools often presents abstinence
as a choice, along with the use of contraception. The context of
marriage is not necessarily part of the lesson. That undermines the
Christian belief that sex outside marriage is wrong, conservatives
said.
</P>
<P>
   And in outcomes-based education, which grew out of the reforms
of the 1980s, conservatives saw a trend toward focusing on
children's social well-being and teaching political correctness at
the cost of rigorous academics.
</P>
<P>
   Education is a top priority of many national conservative
organizations, such as Phyllis Schlafly's Eagle Forum and James
Dobson's Focus on the Family. These groups often have state
chapters that can mobilize members for intense grass-roots
campaigning, said Martha McCarthy, an Indiana University education
professor who has studied the religious right.
Political action
</P>
<P>
   The conservatives' power stems from that political support, said
Rob Boston, assistant director of communications for Americans
United for the Separation of Church and State. The group publishes
a monthly newsletter that details the activities of the Christian
right.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years conservative leaders have mobilized their
followers to vote for school board members and legislators who
share their beliefs, and low voter turnout in many elections has
ensured their success, Boston said.
</P>
<P>
   Along with their claims that public schools are destroying
America, many conservatives advocate publicly financed charter
schools, homeschooling and aid, such as vouchers or tax credits,
for parents who send their children to private schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they don't want to abolish the public schools, then they
want to Christianize them,'' Boston said.
</P>
<P>
   Similarities between conservatives' efforts across the country
have caused groups such as the liberal People for the American Way
and the Mainstream Coalition in Johnson County, Kan., to suggest
that there is a concerted effort to discredit public schools.
</P>
<P>
   Caroline McKnight, executive director of the Mainstream
Coalition, a nonpartisan group that has been critical of the
conservative movement, points to conservative literature
criticizing school reform efforts by a handful of states. Many of
the publications use the same catch phrases, such as ``fuzzy
standards'' and ``secular humanism.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Christian conservatives won five of the 10 seats on the
Kansas state board, some moderate and liberal groups warned that
the conservative agendas showing up in other states would show up
in Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   The conservative board members ``have been elected to a position
that's supposed to look out for the best interest of public
schools,'' McKnight said. ``But the argument can be made that they
don't like public education.''
</P>
<P>
   Gilmore, the former board chairman, said he did not run for
office out of any dislike for schools, but because for many years
social conservatives had no voice in public education. Holding
office, he said, is the American way to ``have a voice in
government to push conservative views.''
New standards
</P>
<P>
   The flap over evolution is heightening public interest in the
new Kansas science standards, which the board will take up
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The standards, which were written by a committee appointed by
education Commissioner Andy Tompkins, list evolution as one of five
unifying concepts that cut across the scientific disciplines.
</P>
<P>
   Since January, when the standards first appeared before the
board, Christian conservatives have urged board members to reject
the document because evolution goes against their beliefs. They
want equal time for the belief that God alone created Earth and its
creatures.
</P>
<P>
   Many scientists and teachers have asked the board to focus on
the consensus among scientists that biology, and other aspects of
science, cannot be mastered without first understanding evolution.
</P>
<P>
   Evolution _ the theory that life on Earth has mutated and
adapted over millions of years _ is the accepted theory in the
biological sciences, said Mary Blythe, an elementary science
specialist in the Kansas City, Kan., School District and a member
of the science standards committee.
</P>
<P>
   Students need to be aware of all of the scientific theories to
understand science, Blythe said. That some conservatives continue
to push for creationist ideas to be taught in science classes is a
concern, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Not for Kansas board member Steve Abrams, a conservative from
Arkansas City, who rejects evolution. On Wednesday he will give the
other board members a different draft of the science standards
written by a group of people who don't believe in evolution. The
document includes evolution and ``intelligent design'' _ the theory
that life happened intentionally, not by chance _ under the heading
``historical science.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I just didn't like the standards that were proposed,'' Abrams
said. ``And instead of sitting there complaining, I thought I would
propose something I liked.''
</P>
<P>
   Blythe and the other members of the science committee knew that
weaving evolution through the standards would be controversial, but
she said she was puzzled all the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never had a conflict with evolution,'' she said. ``I felt
like it was a mechanism that God started to make everything work.''

DOPING INVESTIGATION GATHERS STEAM IN FRANCE
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By SAMUEL ABT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Patrick Keil, the publicity-shy, 36-year-old magistrate
who leads the French investigation of doping in professional
bicycle racing, has a busy morning ahead of him Monday.
</P>
<P>
   At 9:30 a.m., he is scheduled to meet in his office in the
northern city of Lille with three of the prime figures in what
became known as the Festina Affair in the last Tour de France. They
are Bruno Roussel, the French team's former coach; Willy Voet, a
former masseur, and Richard Virenque, the team's former leading
rider.
</P>
<P>
   This will be their first confrontation since Voet's arrest in a
car full of illegal performance-enhancing drugs last July set off
an investigation that has led so far to the suspension of six
riders and destroyed reputations and friendships. Roussel and Voet
confessed to a systematic program of doping and the two accused
Virenque of participating. The rider's constant defense has been
that he has not failed a drug test.
</P>
<P>
   The three are among 12 people notified by Keil that they were
officially under investigation, a status short of being charged.
Three others have been similarly notified by a magistrate in Reims,
where a drug case involving the TVM team from the Netherlands has
been proceeding more slowly. None of the participants in the Monday
meeting is talking beforehand.
</P>
<P>
   An hour after the Festina gathering, Keil is scheduled to meet
with Hein Verbruggen, the dapper 57-year-old Dutchman who has
headed the International Cycling Union, known as UCI, the overseer
of the sport, since late 1991. Verbruggen was exceedingly willing
to talk beforehand, and to talk caustically.
</P>
<P>
   From his headquarters in Lausanne, Switzerland, he denounced as
nonsense and cheap talk the criticism of UCI suspensions of riders
for six and seven months as too lenient. Charges by French riders
that they are handicapped by new and stringent drug tests that
riders from other countries do not face were dismissed as
``rubbish'' and ``stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How many times did they win last year and the year before in
the classics? Or premier one-day races? I don't know why the French
don't win,'' Verbruggen said. ``But we should stop saying
automatically that those who do win use doping.''
</P>
<P>
   Verbruggen has as many supporters as he has critics.
</P>
<P>
   There is general agreement that Verbruggen has done well for the
sport: as a member of the International Olympic Committee, he
helped open the Olympics to professional riders; he has developed
the World Cup series of classic races into a prestigious contest,
and he has given the computerized point system that ranks riders a
rational importance.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, there is less agreement. Supporters claim he has
revolutionized the racing season's calendar, moving the world
championships to October from August and the Vuelta a Espana to
September from May. While the change has revitalized the Spanish
race, critics say it has robbed the championships of some of
racing's biggest stars.
</P>
<P>
   On doping, supporters say that Verbruggen instituted a health
program of testing riders' levels of red blood cells, an indication
of the use of the synthetic hormone EPO, a year before the Festina
Affair exploded. Critics say the tests are badly administered and
are only a rough, easily evaded guide.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Festina Affair, supporters say that he has exerted
himself in quiet damage control that has kept the sport from
falling apart under suspicion. Critics, like l'Equipe, the French
sports newspaper, mock him in print as one of those, still pretty
numerous, who believe there wouldn't be any doping if journalists
didn't write about it.
</P>
<P>
   Because the majority of the nine-man Festina team returned to
action on May 1, the telephone interview focused on their
suspensions. Verbruggen was indignant that the six- and seven-month
suspensions could be considered too short.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think its nonsense to call this a slap on the wrist,'' he
said, adding that the IOC, at a doping conference this winter,
advocated a suspension of six months to two years for a first
offense. ``But the lawyers say no way that they accept two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``My advisers say for a cyclist, the consequences of a two-year
ban are completely different than for a shooter, presumably a
biathlete,'' Verbruggen said. ``A shooter has a career of 40 years
and a cyclist has a career of 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you do this to a cyclist and it is generally accepted that
this means the end of his career _ it is not acceptable. I am
responsible for cycling in 173 countries. We have to have sensible
rules.''

 By DEBORAH SONTAG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEL AVIV, Israel _ There could be no more mild-mannered
lightning rod of controversy than Yossi Beilin, a soft-spoken,
bespectacled academic who is serving as the right wing's voodoo
doll in the current election campaign in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   While he is invisible on the public stage of his own Labor
Party, Beilin, a leftist, is prominently featured as archenemy by
the conservative Likud Party and its supporters. Sometimes it seems
as if Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is running against Beilin,
who is the fifth-ranking member of Labor's One Israel coalition,
rather than Ehud Barak, its more moderate leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can basically hear what Labor thinks by listening to Yossi
Beilin,'' Netanyahu said in a recent interview. ``What Yossi Beilin
says today, Barak will tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   In one Likud commercial for the May 17 elections, Beilin's head
pops out from behind Barak's like a jack-in-the-box. In another,
paid for by an organization apparently supporting Likud, Beilin is
nastily portrayed as a furry white, manicured lap dog with wire-rim
glasses and red _ nothing is subtle here _ ribbons. It is an
allusion to a cutting nickname that the late Yitzhak Rabin attached
to Beilin when he was a protege of Shimon Peres, the former prime
minister: ``Peres' poodle.''
</P>
<P>
   As the leading dove of his political generation and one who has
established a tight working relationship with the Palestinians,
Beilin, a political scientist, makes for a surer target and cleaner
hit than Barak, a highly decorated former general.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very flattering, really,'' Beilin said, sitting on a
black leather armchair in his sparsely decorated apartment. ``By
Netanyahu's logic, if he fails, then it's my victory. If I am the
monster Beilin who is the architect of the master plan of bad
things, and he loses, then my views win.''
</P>
<P>
   What Netanyahu most frequently refers to are Beilin's
negotiations with the Palestinian official Abu Mazen, which laid
out a blueprint including a Palestinian state with Abu Dis, a small
Arab town outside Jerusalem, as its capital. Netanyahu refers to
the Beilin-Abu Mazen agreement as if it were a secret document
unearthed by security agents, Beilin said, when it is something he
discussed openly in a recent book.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is, in a way, a promoter of my work,'' said Beilin, who
served as deputy foreign minister in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Outspoken, Beilin consciously tries to push the envelope of
political debate, introducing ideas before their time and watching
Israelis grow into them. While some mock him as a nutty radical,
others consider him prescient and the rare politician who speaks
his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our politicians are seldom blessed with Beilin's dedication,
industry and guts,'' Amotz Asa-El of The Jerusalem Post said on
Friday in a column headlined ``Who Is a Poodle?'' ``Now the ease
with which Beilin's depiction as a joke is both conceived and
received speaks volumes about our political degeneration.''
</P>
<P>
   Among his ideas, aside from the Palestinian state, that have
come to seem more mainstream are calls for a unilateral withdrawal
of Israeli troops from southern Lebanon and for a cessation of
Jewish charity from abroad to the prosperous Jewish homeland.
</P>
<P>
   As minister of economy and planning in 1995 and a champion of
good government, he also became the only Cabinet minister ever to
preside over the dissolution of his own ministry at his own behest.
</P>
<P>
   Among those ideas that have not caught on yet is a recent
proposal for ``secular conversions'' to Judaism, which would train
converts to become Jewish culturally but not religiously. While
Beilin thinks that it could be a mechanism to sidestep the Israeli
chief rabbis' objections to religious conversions that are not
Orthodox, many think the idea absurd and joke that the test would
feature questions like, ``What is a bagel?''
</P>
<P>
   Barak, in a recent interview, called Beilin the ``enfant
terrible'' of the Labor Party, suggesting that it is a role that
he, at 50, should have outgrown. But then they have a complicated,
if mutually respectful, relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Beilin challenged Barak for the party leadership in 1997,
calling it the race of the ``nerd against the macho,'' and lost.
But he remains popular, having captured second place in the party
primaries held last winter, and his criticisms of Barak have not
been forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not twin brothers,'' Beilin said. ``But there is a
platform that connects us.''
</P>
<P>
   In the campaign, elections, Beilin's role, like that of Peres,
remains behind the scenes. Beilin is the avatar of the retail
politician. Charged with getting out the vote among Israeli Arabs,
he travels the country village by village, even family by family,
attending weddings, parties and town hall meetings.
</P>
<P>
   ``They ask why is our campaign so hawkish,'' Beilin said of the
Israeli Arabs. ``They want to know why Barak is portrayed as a war
hero in all the commercials and not as a peace man. I remind them
about Rabin. I remind them that they hesitated to support Rabin
since he once broke the arms and legs of their brethren but that he
turned out to be an advocate for peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``I also remind them that when I ran against Barak inside the
party, there were many Arabs who said they couldn't support me even
though they felt closer to me because he, not I, could get the
votes of Israelis.''
</P>
<P>
   While polls show Barak with a firm lead over Netanyahu, Beilin
said he did not let himself believe them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot relax,'' he said. ``I told Barak this morning, `Don't
take seriously any good polls, only the bad polls.'''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about his place in a future government should Labor win,
Beilin said he knew that he is too controversial for top positions.
He said he felt that the next government should be broad-based,
moderate and ``not necessarily leftist'' in order to win consensus
for the big diplomatic decisions ahead, about the Palestinian
state, Lebanon and the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
   ``My influence does not necessarily have to be connected to a
job,'' he said. ``In a way, I've been more influential in
opposition than in many of my jobs in government.''

THE FUTURE IS OURS TO LOSE 
</HEADLINE>
   For release: May 16 or thereafter  
 By NAOMI WOLF  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 c.1999 Naomi Wolf  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Standing at the turn of the millennium, how odd it seems that
women, the majority of the human species, have not, over the course
of so many centuries, intervened successfully once and for all on
their own behalf. That is, until you consider that women have been
trained to see themselves as having no relationship to history, and
no claim upon it.
</P>
<P>
   Feminism can be defined as women's ability to think about their
subjugated role in history, and then to do something about it. The
21st century will see the End of Inequality _ but only if women
absorb the habit of historical self-awareness, becoming a mass of
people who, rather than do it all, decide at last to change it all.
The future is ours to lose.
</P>
<P>
   Since there has always been some scattered awareness that
women's low status was unfair, you could say that there has always
been a women's movement. And just as you could say that there has
always been a women's movement, you could also say that there has
always been a backlash.
</P>
<P>
   It is truly striking how often Western humanity has taken the
leap forward into more egalitarian, rational and democratic models
of society and government, and made the decision _ for a decision
it had to be _ to leave women out. At every turn, with a heroic
effort of the will to ignore the obvious path of justice, men were
granted, and granted themselves, more and more equality, and women
of all races were left in history's tidewater.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, we are at a turning point. This decade has seen one
new landmark after another: the Family and Medical Leave Act; a
feminist sitting on the Supreme Court; a woman in charge of
American foreign policies that now include opposition to
clitoridectomy.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, feminism has become mainstream: Betty Friedan has met
Betsy Ross; Barbie's ads now read ``Dream With Your Eyes Wide
Open'' and ``Be Your Own Hero.'' Oprah is talking about how to walk
out of an abusive marriage, and Tori Amos and Fran Drescher speak
out in the celebrity press about sexual assault.
</P>
<P>
   This flood tide could either crest further to change the
landscape forever, or it could recede once again. This is what
historians call an ``open moment,'' and women have blown such
moments in the past. What determines the outcome is the level of
historical awareness we reach before the tide inevitably turns.
</P>
<P>
   There are four ways that our culture militates against
historical consciousness in women. One is the steady omission of
women from history's first draft, the news. Women, Men and Media, a
national watchdog project, reports that women are featured in only
15 percent of the front-page news _ and then usually as victims or
perpetrators of crime or misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   It is not because no one is interested in what women are doing
that this ceiling of visibility is kept so low; nor is it a
conscious conspiracy. But if tomorrow the editors in chief and
publishers of national news media were to see front sections
dominated by 53 percent female newsmakers, they would not shout,
Stop the presses! Too many women!
</P>
<P>
   Rather, there would be the impression that somehow these
publications had, by featuring newsmakers who are part of a
majority, marginalized themselves. So women's advances take place
with little day-by-day, let alone month-by-month, popular analysis.
</P>
<P>
   The second pressure, which complements the omission of women
from historical culture, is the omission of history from women's
culture. One example: under its previous editor, Ruth Whitney,
Glamour magazine ran a political column. Bonnie Fuller, a new
editor fresh from Cosmopolitan, has deleted this monthly column and
added a horoscope.
</P>
<P>
   It's a shift from real-time _ historical-political time _ back
into that dependent, dreamy, timeless state of Women's Time. In
Women's Time, your fate is not in your own hands as an agent of
historical change. Rather _ Hey, are you a Pisces? Why bother
running down your Manolo Blahniks to do something as mousy as
voting? Your fate is in your cleavage, and in the stars.
</P>
<P>
   Emerging naturally from this is the third pressure: the
recurrent ideological theme that if women take themselves seriously
they will lose femininity and, therefore, social status. If what
they do, think, worry about and long for doesn't matter, surely
it's not important that history pays them attention.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth pressure is forgetfulness. Young women I have met on
real college campuses think sex discrimination is a thing of the
past. Or that the struggle for the vote lasted maybe 10 years, not
more than 70. Or that women got the vote when African-Americans
did. Or that it has always been legal to get an abortion in
America.
</P>
<P>
   They are stunned to discover that in their mothers' lifetimes
women could not get credit on their own. They are amazed to learn
that it was African-American middle-class women's clubs that led
the movement against lynching. They didn't know that women chained
themselves to the gates of Congress, or went on hunger strikes and
were force-fed _ so that young women far into the future could take
their rights for granted. These young women are shocked, in other
words, to find that they have a history.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, women remain dependent on other models of
``revolution'' for their own. They must catch the taste and
techniques of activism like a hit song of the month wafting through
the air. So one sees women slumbering and then ``waking up'' every
30 years or so. Periods of feminism always follow periods of
agitation by women on behalf of other, more respectable causes.
</P>
<P>
   This past century shows how fragile conscious feminism has been.
The 1910s, with their wave of populist reform, saw the crescendo of
women's push for the vote. But the year before it was granted, in
1919, the term ``post-feminist'' had already expediently been
coined. By the '20s, pop culture was once again ridiculing the
suffragists' generations as being man-hating old battle-axes,
irrelevant and out of touch with ``today's women.''
</P>
<P>
   A long sleep followed, with fitful waking. After Friedan's 1963
book helped middle-class white women identify the causes of their
deeper malaise, the magical 15 years, from 1965 to 1980, began,
representing a high point of historical self-awareness for Western
women. Again, other movements had to set the stage: the anti-war
movement, the free-speech movement and the hippie movement all
contributed to the idea that it was all right to break free of
social roles.
</P>
<P>
   The civil-rights movement trained a generation of
African-American activists. The '70s were astonishing: the statutes
against sex discrimination labeled Title VII and Title IX; Shirley
Chisholm's 1972 race for the Democratic presidential nomination.
That era, personified by Gloria Steinem and Erica Jong, NOW and the
National Women's Political Caucus, showed what could happen for
women when, as an energized mass in a democracy, they wanted change
badly enough to make noise about it.
</P>
<P>
   The predictable backlash came, as it always does. The evil '80s
were a time of shoulder pads, silicone and retrenchment. Again _ so
quickly, so thoroughly _ women ``forgot.''
</P>
<P>
   A Time/CNN poll found that only 33 percent of women called
themselves feminists _ and only 16 percent of college-age women.
``Guilt'' and ``the Mommy Track'' were the catchwords of the day.
Once again, feminists were represented as hairy-legged man-hating
shrews.
</P>
<P>
   The heartbreak of those times was in seeing newly clueless young
women come of age. Once, when I visited Yale as a speaker, a
brilliant young Asian-American student joined her male debating
society peers in loudly ridiculing feminism. Later, when we were
alone for a moment, she confided that she didn't really believe
what she said _ but the guys were in charge of the club and she
just wanted to get along with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Besides,'' she had said, as if parroting some women's
magazine, ``women my age just have to accept that we can't have it
all.'' It was as if all those words _ flextime, family leave,
egalitarian marriage _ had vanished, taking with them the ways in
which that young woman could have reconsidered her life.
</P>
<P>
   Enter the explosive '90s. Women are now the most important
voting mass in America. ``Women's Issues'' dominate the agenda. The
word ``feminism'' is as taboo as ever, but does it matter if you
call yourself a feminist if you are living feminism?
</P>
<P>
   And American women are doing that, considering the number of
their new businesses and their new judgeships, new elected
officials and new spending power. Feminism today is not a label;
it's a way of life.
</P>
<P>
   But here's the catch: If we remain indifferent to history, we
risk losing it all. The bad old days are always ready to knock at
your door, sisters. While you're packing your briefcase or getting
into your truck, feeling confident, having thrown out the mailing
from that advocacy group, you could just find that you can't get a
legal abortion anymore; or that your boss knows that those sexual
harassment statutes can be managed with a wink and a nod.
</P>
<P>
   Women who are ignorant of their own history forget the main
lessons, such as: Here's how you mobilize; being nice is never as
good as getting leverage; the nature-nurture debate has been going
on forever, and neither side is going to win; your representatives
pay attention when you use your money, your voice and your will.
And voting millions can provide the will.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe we will learn at last. Maybe we will create institutions
that are willing to share influence with younger women coming up,
rather than hoarding power for one generation. Maybe we will learn
to honor our heroines and role models while they are still alive:
maybe Steinem and Shirley Chisholm will get their commemorative
stamps and parades in their own lifetimes, so our daughters will
grow up with some one to turn to more powerful in their
imaginations than Kate Moss and Calista Flockhart.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe we will learn at last that dissent and disagreement among
women across the political spectrum is a sign of our diversity and
strength. Maybe we will turn from the horoscope page to the
Congressional Quarterly, and understand at last that our salvation
lies not in our stars, but in ourselves.

   For release: May 16 or thereafter  
 By GAIL COLLINS  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 c.1999 The New York Times Magazine  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A century ago, people who looked ahead to 2000 had an
exaggerated faith in the promise of pneumatic tubes.
</P>
<P>
   For some reason, when people then thought long-term, they saw
everything from business correspondence to ready-cooked meals
whizzing across town through underground pipes. Nobody imagined
computers.
</P>
<P>
   Funny, the things we can't anticipate.
</P>
<P>
   When I was researching a book on the millennium a few years ago,
I was struck by how people's predictions about the future say much
more about the predictors' own era than about what will happen
next.
</P>
<P>
   Our ancestors were prescient about the invention of the radio,
but never conceived of nuclear warfare _ French cigarette cards in
1899 depicted 21st-century aviators in open planes, dropping little
bomblets on the enemies. A writer for an early edition of Ladies
Home Journal _ the magazine that made its mark by exposing the
evils of the patent medicine trade _ looked forward to our current
era and decided that we would all be fit, very fit: ``A man or
woman unable to walk 10 miles at a stretch will be regarded as a
weakling.''
</P>
<P>
   H. G. Wells, who had a particular horror of the clunky
19th-century kitchen, predicted the coal-burning stove would be
replaced by a ``neat little range heated by electricity'' that
would make cooking ``a pleasant amusement for intelligent invalid
ladies.'' We're still waiting for his self-cleaning windows.
</P>
<P>
   Until just a few years ago, women who dreamed of an independent
and fulfilling future generally started thinking they had to
separate themselves from men. The utopians drew pictures of
all-female communes or Amazonian civilizations, and those hoping
for a real-life career in which they could control their own
destinies generally applied to a convent.
</P>
<P>
   It was only recently _ speaking in millennial terms _ that
average women saw the possibility of achieving equality in the same
world as the opposite sex.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia Woolf thought that having a room of one's own and an
income of 500 pounds a year would do the trick. The flapper
generation, born at the turn of the last century, was the first to
enjoy the outer forms of sexual liberation, such as social drinking
and one-piece bathing suits. But even flappers knew that they had
little of substance, and that their well-being still hinged on
picking the right husband.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, why am I a girl?'' wails one of F. Scott Fitzgerald's
smart, semihysterical heroines, who complains of being born a
hundred years too early, ``with the brains to do everything, yet
tied to the sinking ship of future matrimony.''
</P>
<P>
   Women had no faith in their own ability to support themselves,
but they had confidence that their great-granddaughters would no
longer have to toss down one last cocktail, straighten their
shoulders and marry the wrong man because he was the one with the
money.
</P>
<P>
   Women who had been freed to cut their hair, discard their
corsets and cuddle in the rumble seat with the football hero would
eventually get the vote, get careers and get more efficient birth
control _ and before you knew it, the sinking ship of future
matrimony would be totally optional.
</P>
<P>
   History seldom evolves by tidy progression toward happy endings
_ the Muslims who welcomed Jews and Christians to tolerant kingdoms
like Granada a thousand years ago got driven out by the folks who
gave us the Spanish Inquisition.
</P>
<P>
   But in 20th-century industrialized nations, women really have
kept marching forward. In America, the proportion of women in the
work force has been steadily increasing since those flappers were
in diapers, while the number of children they bear has been
dropping.
</P>
<P>
   Women are now a majority of the electorate. They receive 55
percent of the nation's college degrees and are much more willing
to reinvent themselves as adults by returning to school. They live
longer, and because they survive their husbands they wind up
controlling a large share of the nation's personal wealth.
</P>
<P>
   They own more than a third of the businesses, employ a quarter
of the workers and make up nearly half the students in medical and
law schools. Among two-income families, nearly a quarter of the
wives now earn more than their husbands.
</P>
<P>
   That's a very narrow snapshot _ this is still the same planet on
which many women can be killed by their male relatives for refusing
to marry the man of the family's choice or on the mere suspicion of
promiscuity. The status of women has actually declined in parts of
eastern Europe since the collapse of communism.
</P>
<P>
   But you still might say _ with dozens of qualifications and a
nervous glance over your shoulder _ that women have won. If they
haven't achieved gender equality, then at least they've created the
tools to get it in much of the developed world.
</P>
<P>
   We mate by preference, not out of necessity. We can get all the
education we desire. If we do not all achieve the careers we want,
at least our chances are not dictated by Y-chromosomes.
</P>
<P>
   A romantic modern young man who builds castles in the air
generally presumes that his future wife will help pay the mortgage.
Men who may be chauvinists on the job and patriarchs in the living
room will nevertheless kill to make sure their little girls get all
the opportunities the little boys get.
</P>
<P>
   Given daughters' tendency to stick closer to their parents than
sons do, there is no better hedge against old age than a female
child with a good income.
</P>
<P>
   But it still seems doubtful that women will soon reach full
equality. At the present rate, it will be 2270 before women are as
likely as men to become top managers in corporations and 2500
before there is gender parity in Congress. So far, no culture has
constructed a truly level playing field for sharing family
responsibilities and job opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women in Sweden have lots of day care, but when you look at
where most of their jobs are, they work in the public sector,''
says Andrew Cherlin, a professor of public policy at Johns Hopkins
University. ``You can't make partner in a Stockholm law firm
working six hours a day. Mothers get more support caring for
children, but it doesn't remove inequities in the labor force.''
</P>
<P>
   We presume that all these things will change as women use their
present and potential power to remake the world. Analyses of how
women will vote and set social policy, in fact, generally seem to
presume that our instincts and priorities are just, well, better.
Women are less enamored of the use of force, leery of quick fixes
and more willing to pay more taxes for social concerns such as
feeding the poor.
</P>
<P>
   If women continue to gain economic and political power, the
government of the 21st century will probably spend more on nursing
homes and home attendants for senior citizens, and on better
schools. There might not necessarily be more access to abortion
services but there would be stronger gun controls. Their attitudes
also reflect an emotional conservatism, a fear of sudden moves or
drastic action.
</P>
<P>
   If women get to run the show, Americans had better hope they're
running it in other countries too, because our economy will
probably be more regulated and less able to compete against a
testosterone-fueled capitalism elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Our attempts to hedge against disaster and provide more services
might also create a larger bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have a strong safety net,'' says Heidi Hartmann,
director of the Institute for Women's Policy Research in
Washington. ``It's hard to know how bureaucratic it would become.
Women do tend to perhaps value security and stability more. If men
spent as much time being caretakers as women, their attitude toward
risk might be different too.''
</P>
<P>
   When most women lived on family farms, Hartmann noted, they ran
the truck gardens that produced a modest but steady income from
vegetable sales, while men focused on the large, high-risk crops.
``Women's economic strategy was always, Well, let's make sure we
have a little bit to count on here.''
</P>
<P>
   But all these projections say more about us now than in the
future. Right now we know we want children and careers, but we
don't want to be deprived of job advancement because of one or be
forced to scrimp on our attention to the other. We want our
husbands to take equal responsibility as parents, but are often
reluctant to drop our role as the primary caregivers.
</P>
<P>
   James Levine of the Families and Work Institute in New York says
he believes that while women often want men to do more of the
parenting, ``they want them to do it the `right way,' and if Dad
doesn't do it, Mom takes it back and the cycle continues.'' Levine,
the author of ``Working Fathers: New Strategies for Balancing Work
and Family,'' has been running workshops on this issue for 25
years. Whether he's in Omaha talking to the agricultural extension
or in midtown working with corporate executives, he hears the same
complaints.
</P>
<P>
   One classic involves getting kids ready for school. ``Dad is
dressing them and the preschooler comes down with purple pants and
an orange top. Mom says, `She can't wear that,' which is saying:
`You don't know how to dress the kid. I have to do everything
myself.'''
</P>
<P>
   Working-class parents are showing their wealthier peers a way
out of this particular battle: If Dad is the only adult in the
house when the kids are dressing for school, purple and orange
rules. Nearly half of fathers who have municipal jobs like fireman,
or service jobs like gas-station attendant, care for the children
while their wives are at work.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I do is watch the kids and work,'' says a Wisconsin
correctional officer who chose a night shift so he could be home
while his wife worked days.
</P>
<P>
   That is, of course, what women have been saying for decades, and
the ideal answer would be an economy that allows both sexes to
advance on the job without requiring so many hours at work. In that
early era we now refer to as ``the '60s,'' many young women
believed that's what the developed world would look like by the
year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Technology would improve productivity, creating a society in
which job-sharing or 20-hour workweeks were the norm. Even single
mothers would be able to pursue careers and still get home in time
to pick up the kids after school. Needless to say, that leisure
society wound up in the same category as the self-cleaning windows.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, we got a global economy that pits the American factory
worker with a 12-year-old alone at home against a Third World
sweatshop in which the 12-year-olds are the workers. Unless the
underlying economy changes strikingly, our future will probably
involve opportunities that are limited only by our ability to come
up with jerry-built solutions to the competing demands on our time.
</P>
<P>
   The most significant development on the immediate horizon is the
graying of the industrialized world. People 65 and over accounted
for 4 percent of the U.S. population in 1900, but in 2015, some
say, they could be at least 20 percent, and two-thirds will be
women.
</P>
<P>
   If Social Security gets propped up and the political power of
seniors continues to increase, those older women will consume a
large portion of the national budget _ and control a hefty portion
of the assets.
</P>
<P>
   Our great-great-grandmothers waited a lifetime for the social
glacier to creak forward an inch. Charlotte Perkins Gilman, a
turn-of-the-century American utopian, spent her life agitating for
the liberation of women from the chains of household duties, for a
world where child care and housework would be done by well-paid,
well-trained specialists who preferred that kind of career and
where every family would enjoy ``the professional service of cooked
meals to the home.''
</P>
<P>
   When she started writing her autobiography in the 1920s, Gilman
admitted that she'd seen only the tiniest of changes after 37 years
of effort: ``Reason has no power against feeling, and feeling older
than history is no light matter,'' she said philosophically. It
would have been nice if she could have at least lived to order
takeout pizza.
</P>
<P>
   These days, you wake up one morning and a social phenomenon that
you thought immutable will have vanished. I must have written at
least a dozen essays decrying the fact that the entertainment
industry targets boys when it creates movies and television because
everybody knows that girls will watch male heroes but boys usually
won't watch girls.
</P>
<P>
   It was just the other day, really, that I noticed that teen-age
girls now seem to have their own TV network, WB, while teen-age
boys get professional wrestling and Ninja Turtle reruns.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most famous WB series is ``Buffy the Vampire
Slayer,'' in which a teen-age girl rescues humanity from extinction
every week. Last year she had to kill her vampire-boyfriend and,
though he has been resurrected, she keeps noting that it could
happen again at any time.
</P>
<P>
   Buffy really rides alone, just like the male heroes in the TV
westerns that dominated my own childhood. The most popular was
``Bonanza,'' the story of Ben Cartwright, a rancher and three-time
widower, and his three adult sons. The Ponderosa took out wives
faster than a toxic-waste dump. Even the least sophisticated viewer
eventually got the message that you could not have an interesting
time on the frontier if you were saddled with a woman.
</P>
<P>
   At some point while I wasn't looking, the idea that girls didn't
have adventures seems to have faded out of our popular culture,
just like the idea that only boys get to play rock music. The most
successful movie of the last decade is ``Titanic,'' in which a
young woman falls in love with a charming artist, who dies after
making a long speech urging her to seize the day. She lives for
about 80 years of thrills and romance before being reunited with
him after death.You do have the feeling that if he hadn't drowned,
he would have got in the way.
</P>
<P>
   I always hoped that some day women would become co-heroes with
men in entertainment programming. But instead, the sexes may just
be switching responsibility for suffering an untimely death in the
second act. Things progress, but never exactly the way you'd
expect.

THROUGH WOMEN'S EYES, FINALLY 
</HEADLINE>
   For release: May 16 or thereafter

<TEXT>
<P>
   The history of women in art is such a great unruly subject that
any curator trying to pull together a representative exhibition
would probably start by having her head examined.
</P>
<P>
   Titian, to mention just one old master inspired to greatness by
the female, made at least 39 paintings of the Madonna and 19
Venuses.
</P>
<P>
   At that, choosing from among the many thousands of similar works
in the traditional Western canon might be easier than deciding
which pieces among today's outpouring of paintings, sculptures,
videos and installations are meant for the ages.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it would be derelict to let these thousand years go by
without acknowledging how deeply our cultural reflexes, and our
sexual politics, have been influenced by images of women: woman as
mother, as goddess, as muse or sex object and ultimately, woman as
master of her own place in the creation of art.
</P>
<P>
   And if the task is approached with humility, one can at least
show a few fragments of this overwhelming history.
</P>
<P>
   Art, to begin with, is about power, plain and simple; about who
owns the tools, who makes the rules, who gets to shape the image of
the world.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, in high art, men were the image shapers _ and not
coincidentally men were the ones with access to training, peer
support and patronage, as the art historian Linda Nochlin pointed
out in a landmark 1971 article, ``Why Have There Been No Great
Women Artists?''
</P>
<P>
   The exceptions always tended to prove the rule: certain medieval
nuns famed for their manuscript illustrations; a handful of
Renaissance painters, including Sofonisba Anguissola and Lavinia
Fontana. It was not until our own century, and particularly in the
last 30 years, that this pattern started to change significantly,
with women systematically claiming art and the life of the artist
as their own.
</P>
<P>
   In one famous 12th-century French carving of the Virgin and
Child, the anonymous sculptor paid scrupulous attention to human
details of his subject. Mother and child, with their drooping eyes
and pursed lips, share an endearing family resemblance. But the
import of this work is transcendental, not personal. Despite the
woman's dominant size, the weight of authority is with her son. In
the medieval Christian scheme of things, He embodies Divine Wisdom;
she is Wisdom's throne.
</P>
<P>
   Half a millennium later, around 1639, the Flemish artist Peter
Paul Rubens painted a secular version of the Holy Family, in which
he hovers somewhat anxiously over the figure of his wife, Helena
Fourment, and their infant son.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, it is the mother, an aura of light playing around
her head, who looks childlike. (Fourment was 16 and Rubens 53 when
they married.) With her guileless face and baby-fine hair, and
encased in silk and satin, she seems to be led haltingly forward by
her husband's paternal hand.
</P>
<P>
   But see how the atmosphere relaxes and comes alive when family
portraits are painted by women. In 18th-century France,
Elizabeth-Louise Vigee-LeBrun paints a portrait of herself and her
young daughter Julie. The two figures, dressed in the newly
unencumbering fashions of the day, look candidly outward as they
embrace like sisters. And in that affectionate, egalitarian hug,
old hierarchies of power seem to melt away.
</P>
<P>
   One senses the presence of a new kind of wisdom, confidently
rooted in the here and now, in Alice Neel's forthright 1978
portrait of a nude, pregnant woman. (Neel painted the theme over
and over because she felt it had been neglected in art.)
</P>
<P>
   There's a mirror in the picture, that ancient emblem of vanity
and self-examination, but it's behind the sitter, as if she isn't
aware or doesn't care that it is there. Her alert eyes stare
straight ahead. Her body, awkwardly perched on a stiff, little,
dust-ruffled chair, is literally filled with life but also
self-contained.
</P>
<P>
   Paintings in which women play the role of artistic muse are
similarly varied, particularly when this time-honored theme is
transformed in the hands of women.
</P>
<P>
   A canonical example of the type is Jan Vermeer's ``Allegory of
Painting'' (1667). It depicts an artist at work at his easel. His
female model, dressed as Clio, the muse of history _ from which, it
is implied, all art seeks inspiration _ stands passively before
him.
</P>
<P>
   But a version of the same motif done some decades earlier by the
Italian artist Artemisia Gentileschi had already radically revised
the convention. In her extraordinary ``Self-Portrait as the
Allegory of Painting'' (1630), Gentileschi depicts herself,
paintbrush raised, eyes focused intently on the canvas before her.
Her unkempt hair and the gold chain around her neck were standard
symbols for creative passion and the rewards of artistic
accomplishment, but in this case, artist, model and muse are one
and the same person.
</P>
<P>
   The multifaceted image of woman as muse comes up-to-date in
painted quilts from the 1990s by the African-American artist Faith
Ringgold. By using the quilt as a medium, Ringgold touches on the
vast, rich tradition of art by women in media usually referred to
as crafts. And her works shrewdly rewrite the story of women's role
in modern painting. In one, the fabulous Josephine Baker makes
herself at home as an erotic odalisque in Matisse's studio.
</P>
<P>
   The history of the image of women as erotic objects in art is
endless and, for modern eyes sharpened by the critical insights of
feminist thought, endlessly problematic. One can only hint at how
many ways it has been reshaped in women's hands.
</P>
<P>
   A nude Venus in the style of Botticelli and another by Titian
are embodiments of Neoplatonic ideals. But in both cases women are
also sensuous, passive ornaments intended primarily for the male
gaze.
</P>
<P>
   This is particularly so in the case of Titian; one painting not
only provides a surrogate audience in the figure of an ogling
musician but also models its Venus on a courtesan type familiar in
16th-century Venice.
</P>
<P>
   Beside these two canvases one might instructively place more
recent paintings. Suzanne Valadon's ``La Chambre Bleu'' (''The Blue
Room,'' 1923) is one, with its clothed model who smokes cigarettes,
reads books and doesn't make her bed.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is a recent self-portrait in male attire by the
young California artist Catherine Opie, a witty study in the
fluidity of gender, and a striking icon of same-sex desire,
offering a perspective that gives those Venuses a whole new lease
on erotic life.
</P>
<P>
   All of the work mentioned so far is Western in origin, and
mostly from the past. But new art is global in scope, and much of
its expansionist impulse is a direct result of concerns with
self-identity _ visual and psychological _ generated by the
feminist movement.
</P>
<P>
   You can see this at work in revisionist examples of that most
venerable of female images, the goddess. The young Japanese-born
artist Mariko Mori has based a recent series on a pan-Asian image
of a female Buddhist deity associated with nature. Using elaborate
multimedia technology she has transformed herself into a goddess
floating in the cool nirvana of cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   The Mexican-American artist Yolanda Lopez, meanwhile, has
adopted the icon of the Virgin of Guadalupe, that potent New World
symbol of political affirmation and resistance, for her own
self-portrait, with results that depart radically from the serenity
of the original.
</P>
<P>
   In this painting, wearing running shoes and carrying a serpent,
Lopez bursts forth from the Virgin's traditional flaming mandorla,
throws off her star-spangled cloak and dashes straight toward us,
beaming, into the future. The merging of past into future is what
this painting is all about.
</P>
<P>
   There are countless more transformative visions where this comes
from _ the freed imaginations of women.

GOOD HOUSEKEEPING 
</HEADLINE>
   For release: May 16 or thereafter  
 By MARGARET ATWOOD  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 c.1999 O.W. Toad, Ltd.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When I was in my 20s and inhabiting rooming houses, I was given
a book called ``Cooking in a Bedsitter,'' by the formidable
Katharine Whitehorn. It pointed out that although I was living in
squalor, I didn't have to live in total squalor. With a hot plate,
some herbs and a little foresight, a degree of elegance might be
achieved.
</P>
<P>
   I have been a grateful reader of such advice books and their
variants, women's magazine articles, ever since. (Grateful, though
sometimes bemused: Do I really want to marbleize an end table or
make a gingerbread chalet? Not today.)
</P>
<P>
   There's no shortage of such advice; nor is there any shortage of
women dishing it out. Where did they come from, all these kindly,
bossy, ersatz aunts, whether real or invented _ Fannie Farmer,
Betty Crocker, Martha Stewart and the rest?
</P>
<P>
   I'd say they trace their lineage to Mrs. Isabella Beeton.
</P>
<P>
   For most of our millennium, the few advice books for women were
likely to be religious or moral. Often the only women who could
read were nuns or noblewomen, and housework and cooking were done
by servants. If you were of the higher orders you supervised them,
a skill in itself; if not, you learned the basics from your mother
or from other servants.
</P>
<P>
   Advice books didn't arrive until the rise of a literate middle
class. The ``new money'' created in the 19th century by the
Industrial Revolution often meant young brides who were not only
unprepared to run large establishments but who were also unversed
in the manners required in the polite society to which they'd been
elevated.
</P>
<P>
   Along came the professional advisers, often calling themselves
``A Lady,'' offering bits and pieces of what you might require: a
cookbook here, an etiquette primer there.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Beeton was thus by no means the first of her kind. But
``Beeton's Book of Household Management'' was the first to use
tested recipes, with costs and sample menus. It was also the first
comprehensive book on running a household, telling readers what to
pay their servants and how to remove spots from lace. In addition,
the book had many helpful illustrations. (What does a stair brush
look like? How do you tell one breed of pig from another?)
</P>
<P>
   From her name, which suggests a round, industrious busybody,
you'd expect Mrs. Beeton to have been at least 40. Not a bit of it.
She was born in 1836, and through the death of her father and the
remarriage of her mother, she became the oldest girl in a family of
21 children, which gave her ample experience coping with domestic
chaos.
</P>
<P>
   She was only 23 when she began her magnum opus, in successive
numbers of The Englishwoman's Domestic Magazine, published by her
husband's company; it appeared in book form in 1861. She was
compiling a cooking dictionary and writing a book on needlework
when she died of childbed fever after the birth of her fourth
child. Se was 29.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Beeton is direct in her style and equally clear about her
aims. ``What moved me ... to attempt a work like this,'' she says
in her introduction, ``was the discomfort and suffering I had seen
brought upon men and women by household management. I have always
thought that there is no more fruitful source of family discontent
than a housewife's badly cooked dinners and untidy ways.''
</P>
<P>
   Unless you keep ``a comfortable home,'' she warns, the husbands
will flee to their ``clubs, well-ordered taverns and dining
houses''; it is with these that a wife must compete.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for her success was her acknowledgment of human
frailty. She knew that servants' references were likely to skimp on
truth, so she told employers to visit the reference giver: If her
own house is a wreck, don't hire the servant.
</P>
<P>
   She knew you could get caught short, so she explained not only
how to make butter but also how to make butter in a hurry. (Put the
cream in a bottle and shake it.)
</P>
<P>
   She advised the young wife about almost everything _ the
importance of keeping accounts, the best conversational topics
(entertaining histories), what to wear (green goes well with
violet) and how to spend evenings at home (the ladies do
needlework; the man reads aloud from some ``good standard work or
amusing publication'').
</P>
<P>
   And that's just in the first 17 pages. Her book is more than
1,000 pages long.
</P>
<P>
   Is there anything Mrs. Beeton left out that she might cover now?
Germs; they hadn't really hit the scene. And sex, of course, which
was unprintable.
</P>
<P>
   About ``female emancipation'' she was dubious, but far from
being a delicate Angel in the House, a Beeton woman was the
Generalissimo in the House, commanding an army of servants, men
included. Her work was emphatically work, and required
intelligence, tact, character, energy and dignity.
</P>
<P>
   Much of her advice is dated now, but her insight and common
sense endure. For Mrs. Beeton life is an art, and its aim is
enjoyment, one's own included. The woman practicing this art must
be a stage manager, but she is also the lead actress, saying her
lines effortlessly.
</P>
<P>
   And the details of this art, which some _ men, for instance _
might consider frivolous, are actually of deep importance, because
on them depends the happiness of all.

 BABY in a BOX  
 For release: May 16 or thereafter  
 By NATALIE ANGIER  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 c.1999 The New York Times Magazine  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A month shy of giving birth to her first child, Laura Pouzer, a
college chemistry teacher, reclines on a padded table at Johns
Hopkins University, the luxuriousness of her belly and her wit on
equal display as she takes the infamous Stroop stress test.
</P>
<P>
   Lists of words flash on a screen, each of them specifying a
color _ blue, yellow, white, purple _ but each printed in a color
other than the color it signifies. It is Pouzer's assignment to
call out, as quickly as possible, the colors the words appear in,
rather than the color they specify.
</P>
<P>
   I look at the slides over her shoulder and feel my brain lurch
and creak. I see the word ``blue,'' I think the word ``blue,'' the
tint it's written in be damned.
</P>
<P>
   Pouzer, though, is acing the Stroop, flying through the lists
without missing a beat or flubbing a shade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perfect, perfect,'' says Kathleen Costigan, a researcher and
obstetrical nurse. ``You're awesome.''
</P>
<P>
   As Pouzer barrels along, transponders taped to her belly reveal
two things: first, that she is enviably relaxed, her heart rate
slow and skin-conductance response flat; and second, that the
36-week-old male fetus within her is sleeping soundly. It is as
though the purity of the mother's mental concentration has lulled
the baby into long-wave bliss.
</P>
<P>
   The test over, the 28-year-old Pouzer nudges her eyeglasses up
her nose and shrugs. ``That wasn't too bad,'' she says to Costigan
and Janet DiPietro, a developmental psychologist. ``Much easier
than the last time.''
</P>
<P>
   A moment later, thump, jab, squirm. Her fetus is awake.
Something about his mother has changed, and he is practically
knocking on the door of her uterine chamber to find out what it is.
</P>
<P>
   Half a world away, in the laboratory of Yosinori Kuwabara and
his colleagues at Juntendou University in Tokyo, a fetal goat
floats in a clear acrylic tank the size of a large toaster oven,
bathed in eight quarts of artificial amniotic fluid kept at body
temperature.
</P>
<P>
   Its umbilical cord is threaded to two machines that jointly
perform the nuts and bolts of a placenta, pumping in blood, oxygen
and nutrients and cleaning out waste. The fetus is almost 20 weeks
old, weighs about six pounds and has been living in its eerie
fishbowl of a universe since it was removed from its mother by
Caesarean section several days earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The creature behaves like any other prenatal goat, blinking its
soft black eyes and kicking its slender white limbs. Should it
survive for two more weeks, to the full 21-week goat term, it will
be ``born'': lifted out of the tank and its umbilicus cut.
</P>
<P>
   Kuwabara and his co-workers are striving to create a viable
artificial womb, a system to sustain a developing infant when the
real womb won't or can't do. So far, the researchers have managed
to keep their goats-on-a-rope alive for up to 10 days, and they are
getting closer to understanding why the artificial environment
eventually fails its charges.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists hesitate when asked when their experimental
uterus will be ready for human use, but others happily speculate
for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of difficult technical problems to be
overcome,'' says Malcolm Levene, professor of pediatrics and child
health at the University of Leeds in England. ``But I see them as
being soluble in the next 5 to 10 years.''
</P>
<P>
   In vivo, in vitro, the womb in two views: one, the mother's
belly, the sum of humanity's yesterdays, the umbilicus the original
apron string that yokes us all to the body's throbbing loneliness
and joy; and the other, the acrylic baby bumper, an embryonic
technology that has the seductive flash of the eternal tomorrow, of
the airplane foil, the computer screen, the crystal ball.
</P>
<P>
   Yet as polarized as the two vignettes of the uterus initially
appear, they are both, in the end, about the future. Tales of
reproduction and birth have always been about the future, about
extending the shelf life of your longings and fantasies beyond your
personal expiration date.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe my child will revolutionize art; maybe my child will help
colonize Mars. People have always dreamed of consorting with gods
and bearing immortal progeny, or suckling at the breast of the
Virgin Mary to attain eternal salvation.
</P>
<P>
   Being the natural currency of tomorrow, the topic of human
fertility lends itself to the wildest sci-fi spasms and millennial
speculations. And as though to oblige our fixation on big round
numbers, our high priests and priestesses of fecundity, our
reproductive endocrinologists, embryologists, gynecologists and
geneticists, lately have pipetted up an unceasing supply of
millennialist material.
</P>
<P>
   Postmenopausal women have gestated their daughters' eggs and
given birth to their own grandchildren. Congenitally infertile men
can have their dysfunctional sperm mechanically rammed into the
body of an egg, and thus sire sons who inherit the once
uninheritable: the fathers' sterility. An older woman's fading egg,
and the chromosomes it enfolds, can be rejuvenated through the
addition of the rich, viscous cytoplasm from a younger woman's egg.
</P>
<P>
   If that chimeric gamete is then fertilized and transferred into
the womb of a third woman for gestation, the resulting child can
claim three biological mothers: chromosomal mom, cytoplasmic mom
and gestational mom.
</P>
<P>
   Once a little couplet said it all: mother's baby, father's
maybe. Now DNA tests can pretty well settle the question of
biological paternity, while the issue of biological maternity has
been sufficiently muddied to demand the regular intercession of
judges.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're being forced to rethink the whole concept of
motherhood,'' says George J. Annas, chairman of the department of
health law at the Boston University School of Public Health. ``I
never thought that would happen in my lifetime.''
</P>
<P>
   These goggle-eyed tomorrow scenes are already today's tomorrows,
if not yesterday's. There are more to come, of course, many more.
Most of them can't be predicted or described in any detail, but
each will surely force us to think better and harder than we're
used to about two mighty piers of life's foundation: power and
love.
</P>
<P>
   How much power can we have over the timing and circumstances of
our reproduction? And does that power give us greater freedom, or
does it deprive us of one of life's most unsung freedoms: the
freedom to have things happen on their own?
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people don't choose to have children, they just get
pregnant,'' says R. Alta Charo, professor of law and medical ethics
at the University of Wisconsin in Madison. ``Reproductive
technologies cumulatively reduce the range of events that happen by
serendipity and increase the range of events that happen by active
planning. This changes the texture of life. One of the rights we
have is the right to not have to make choices.''
</P>
<P>
   The new fertility fetishes also bring us face to face with our
concept of love, and what it means to love our children, and what
inspires that love or sullies it. Can we love a child who is
genetically unrelated to us? Of course; every parent of an adopted
child knows as much.
</P>
<P>
   Yet infertile couples go to extraordinary lengths to give birth
to a genetically related baby, and their hunger to see their
chromosomes represented in the next generation has inspired many of
the new reproductive manipulations. But does the quest to have
genetically related offspring mean that we are delighted with
ourselves, our spouses, our extant genomic kin?
</P>
<P>
   ``When I talk to people who say how important it is that their
children be theirs, and who think of adoption as a terrible last
resort, I say to them, `Oh, you must be so close to your parents
and your siblings,''' says Barbara Katz Rothman, a sociologist at
the City University of New York. ``They say, `No, I haven't seen my
brother in three years _ he's a real jerk.' So I reply, `What makes
you think it will be different for you and your genetically related
children?'''
</P>
<P>
   Two of the emerging technologies exemplify the profound tension
and interdependency between power and love, between our hopes and
nattering fears for tomorrow, as medicine does what we demand that
it do, and plays the stork through any kind of outrageous weather.
</P>
<P>
   The artificial uterus is one technology: In this we see the
ultimate attempt to control gestation, which means to control
ourselves, the personal plant. The other is genetic enhancement,
the attempt to improve or select some of an embryo's traits _ that
is, to control our children.
</P>
<P>
   They are both coming, if not in 10 years, then in 15 or 50. If
we can tinker, we will tinker, and when it comes to our kids, we'll
hammer ourselves deaf, bent and bruised, until we hammer ourselves
away for good.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty years ago, the feminist Shulamith Firestone wrote in
``The Dialectics of Sex'' about the need for an artificial uterus,
a way to remove the act of reproduction from the female body and
thus free women from what she saw as the source of their biological
servitude.
</P>
<P>
   Kuwabara and his colleagues are not working on the artificial
uterus as a nod to female liberation, of course. They're doing it
with the hope of helping extremely premature infants, those born
before 22 or 23 weeks of gestation, the current outer limit of
salvageability, when the fetus is meant to be an aquatic animal,
suspended in solution, its fragile gelatinous flesh shielded from
the brutality of air or touch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Artificial wombs will begin as a response to the needs of
women who are unable to carry a baby through to term,'' says
Marshall Marinker, a visiting professor of general practice at the
University of London. ``But like so many things in medicine, what
begins as a response to illness may become a lifestyle choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Look at Viagra, he says. It began as a drug for clinical
impotence and now is seen as a recreational means to megapotence.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, horrors, the mother who would choose to turn her fetus over
to a burbling laboratory broth!
</P>
<P>
   Mary B. Mahowald, a professor at the MacLean Center for Clinical
Medical Ethics at the University of Chicago, believes that the
demand for an artificial uterus will be negligible and that most
women view pregnancy as a whole-body thrill, one of life's few
genuine odysseys.
</P>
<P>
   She published a study in 1997 in the Journal of Women's Health
in which she asked women the following question: If you could
either gestate a baby using a donor egg or have your own egg
gestated by a surrogate mother, but couldn't do both, which would
you choose? A slight majority opted for gestation with donor egg.
``Many women feel that there's a relationship you can develop with
the fetus during pregnancy that men are not privy to,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe. But when I posed Mahowald's question to a dozen friends
and colleagues, some of them mothers, some of them not, a slight
majority opted for having their personal eggs baked in a surrogate
womb. ``The idea of being pregnant seems noxious to me,'' explained
one woman, a childless professor at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology.
</P>
<P>
   When I further told my respondents to imagine that they had had
a hysterectomy but wanted a child and asked if they would prefer to
have their eggs gestated by a surrogate human mother or in an
artificial womb, a sizable majority opted for the artificial womb.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously the thought of a fake Frankenstein-ian uterus was not
as disturbing to them as the prospect of dealing with a genuine
surrogate mother, who might get drunk or smoke while pregnant or
demand visitation rights after birth.
</P>
<P>
   If we cannot blithely assume that every woman who wants to have
children wants to be pregnant _ if some women, like many men, find
the prospect noxious _ then we are left to wonder just how bad it
might be for a fetus to spend much of its tenure in a box.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, the artificial uterus may be reasonably proficient at
performing the basics of nutrient delivery and the exchange of
blood gases. But what of the rest, the spectacular rest that is the
maternal-fetal dyad, an exquisite push-me-pull-you relationship
millions of years in the forging?
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to DiPietro's country, the land of blinkered darkness.
DiPietro is one of the only scientists in the world who are
studying the relationship between maternal and fetal behavior.
Doctors have spent a lot of time tracking how the fetus grows and
when its various organs and sensory capabilities mature: the fetus
as an independent operator, the free-floating homunculus at the end
of ``2001: A Space Odyssey.''
</P>
<P>
   DiPietro herself was performing such an orthodox study about 10
years ago. She was electronically monitoring the progress of a
fetus that happened to be gestating in the belly of a nurse who
worked in a neonatal intensive-care unit.
</P>
<P>
   Just to be conversational, DiPietro asked the woman if it
bothered her to be around desperately sick newborns while she
herself was pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said, `Not really, except once,''' DiPietro recalls.
``That was when her office was used as a temporary morgue for the
newborns that had died.''
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, DiPietro's monitors detected a big surge in heart
rate. ``At first, I thought it was the nurse's heart rate going up
at the memory,'' she says. ``But then I realized it was the fetus's
heart. It was racing. It was an instantaneous reaction.'' The nurse
remembered that she had felt a suffocating grief, and her fetus
fairly keened in reply.
</P>
<P>
   In short order, DiPietro changed her focus from tracking
prenatal development to the study of the behavioral interplay
between mother and fetus. She wanted to know whether a woman's mood
or temperament or stress level had any impact on her fetus. If so,
how, why, when, to what end? If not, why not?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's ridiculous _ the questions just haven't been asked,'' she
says. ``Women have their ideas. Anecdotes abound. There are
references in the Bible and in Shakespeare about how a mother's
emotions affect the fetus. But our scientific knowledge is utterly
crude.
</P>
<P>
   ``A mother's emotions have to affect an infant's temperament,
they have to,'' she says, at once earnest and matter-of-fact. ``A
fetus is bathed in maternal hormones, chemicals, peptides, at just
the time when its brain is forming.''
</P>
<P>
   But personal conviction is one thing; proof is another. And so
DiPietro studies pregnant women and their fetuses and puts women
like Pouzer through stressful quizzes to see how they and their
babies react and interact.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're learning, what is a new scientific finding, is
that, yes, the fetus does respond to its mother's emotions,'' she
says. ``Sometimes the reaction of the fetus, in terms of heart rate
and movement, is even more pronounced than the reaction of the
mother. That reactivity is not necessarily a bad thing. The arousal
must be doing something to its nervous system, perhaps helping to
drive brain development, but we don't know that yet for sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mother provides such a complex, labile environment for the
fetus. She gets up, she sits down, she shifts position. She eats
something different, it affects the amniotic fluid. When she
laughs, she shakes the baby around really vigorously.'' DiPietro
waves her arms in the air to demonstrate. ``Who knows? That could
be why we like roller-coaster rides _ and why they make us laugh
even while we're screaming.''
</P>
<P>
   To C. Sue Carter, a neuroendocrinologist at the University of
Maryland, the womb is the perfect place to begin preparing a fetus
for the habitat it can expect to find postnatally. ``The uterus
does more than just provide a physical setting for a baby,'' Carter
says. ``There's also the hormonal priming that may help regulate
the later development of the child.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, she says, if a mother is pregnant under drought
conditions, she may secrete more of the hormone vasopressin in her
womb. Vasopressin is a practical hormone that helps the body
conserve water. It is also thought to play a role in territorial
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``And so the infant, having had this early-warning system in
utero of the environmental conditions outside, may end up more
territorial and protective of itself,'' Carter says, ``while an
infant gestating in conditions of abundant food and water may not
have to go in that direction. Hormonal priming adds an extra level
of adaptation to the mix.''
</P>
<P>
   Does any of this matter to humans, the most adaptable species
yet to evolve? Do we need our mothers' prenatal coaching or
previews of coming attractions? As for stimulus, laboratory and
hospital settings may not be as changeful as a woman's womb, but
they're not exactly quiet or predictable places. People talk,
laugh, yell, play radios.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's the ubiquitous whir of equipment. Most infants
love the hum of machines. They love vacuum cleaners, window fans,
dishwashers. Maybe that's what it sounds like in the womb _ heavy
industry. Who's to say, then, that a laboratory brat won't be the
most well adjusted and sensorily and intellectually primed kid on
the block? We haven't a clue.
</P>
<P>
   Less debatable is any impact the artificial uterus might have on
the strength of mother love. Current evidence suggests that the
chemistry of pregnancy facilitates the bond between a mother and
her young but that there are many other ways to arrive at the
Jerusalem of overwhelming love.
</P>
<P>
   Cuddling a newborn, holding it against your naked breast,
stroking it at the soothing rate of 40 strokes per minute, smelling
its fontanel _ all these gestures appear to release in the brain
the flow of peptides like oxytocin, the hormone of harmony and
attachment. So it is that father love can be as powerful as mother
love without the benefit of gestation, and adoptive parents can
fall madly in love with a baby the moment they hold it in their
arms. The human body is built to love, whether it owns a womb or
borrows one.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to love a baby, any baby, and yet so many of us yearn
to love babies that we can claim credit for, that are ours, that we
have made. And in this age of the gene supreme, we are according
ever more credit for the ingredients of the self to our genetic
code. Paradoxically, the thirst for a genetically related child at
all costs is helping to usher in the age of the genetically
enhanced child.
</P>
<P>
   People don't seem to want just any potentially gifted child: a
sperm bank that has sought to market the semen of Nobel laureates
has had remarkably few takers. But they want more than a rehash of
themselves and their mates. The old adage has it that parents hope
for a better life for their children than they had for themselves,
and many of us hope for children who are better than we are:
smarter, taller, happier, with thicker keratin, more resilient
collagen.
</P>
<P>
   This desire is often presented as a late-20th-century
affliction, evidence of yuppie acquisitiveness and superficiality.
But it is much older than that, more an expression of the
Judeo-Christian belief in perpetual self-improvement, a life
devoted to surmounting one's sins, failings, uncleanness.
</P>
<P>
   An embryo is all potential, all Edenic. Can we not bless it? Can
we not shower it with the strength of our love and buffer it from
our specific disappointments?
</P>
<P>
   Already doctors are attacking genetic diseases at the embryonic
stage, through preimplantation diagnosis. They remove one cell of
an eight-celled embryo in a laboratory dish to see if the embryo
has inherited a disease such as cystic fibrosis or Fanconi's
anemia, and if it has, they don't implant the embryo in the
mother's womb. How long before subtler forms of preimplantation
favoritism are upon us?
</P>
<P>
   The human genome project will be completed in the next several
years. We'll have the code of 3 billion DNA letters in hand. We
won't understand what most of that code means, but we'll have just
enough knowledge to be dreamy and careless.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of us would like to believe that the human organism is
simply too complex to manipulate or genetically enhance,'' says
Erik Parens, a philosopher at the Hastings Center in Garrison,
N.Y., a bioethics think tank. ``But consider what we already do
with pharmacological agents like antidepressants. We're willing to
use these drugs even though we understand rather little about them,
and even though they come with a lot of bad side effects, because
they give us something that we value.''
</P>
<P>
   All is not dire, though. If we can't trust ourselves, we can
trust our children. They have never done our bidding, and they're
not going to start genuflecting tomorrow. Farmers had children to
help out on the farm, and the kids left for the city. The heir to
the throne runs off with a divorce. Your daughter tattoos her
tongue and becomes a neo-Darwinist.
</P>
<P>
   Like a roller coaster or a mother's laugh, the ingratitude of
youth is sure to make for a wild and bumpy ride.

<P>
   To reach Zhang Hanzhi, one first has to navigate through a
traditional Chinese home. Peaceful open-air courtyards lead to
private rooms with shelves of Chinese classics and hanging scrolls.
The place is a walled-in maze, like Chinese boxes within boxes.
</P>
<P>
   And so by the time you reach Ms. Zhang in her modern office with
its computer loaded with Windows 95, the journey seems not only a
relief but also a metaphor for the distance women have traveled in
China these last 1,000 years.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Zhang, a hint of gray now peeking through her neatly permed
hair, offers a welcome in the same perfect English that she used to
try to teach Chairman Mao.
</P>
<P>
   She sits back in her chair in front of a large wooden desk and
reminisces amid the bountiful distractions. A tailor visits. A
government economist drops by. She gets a couple of calls from
Zhongnanhai, the sprawling compound where China's top leaders live.
</P>
<P>
   She offers a box of European chocolates and some French tea. The
surroundings are so refined that it seems incongruous when she
recalls her years in Mao's inner circle _ or the time after Mao's
death when she was imprisoned inside the Foreign Ministry as an
alleged ultra-leftist.
</P>
<P>
   She laughs easily about all that now, reaches for a chocolate
and takes a deep breath as she begins to tell the story of her
grandmother, a spunky woman born in a village near the coastal
Chinese town of Suzhou.
</P>
<P>
   The grandmother's name is unknown; in fact, she may never have
had one. As recently as the 19th century, many Chinese women were
simply called Daughter No. 1, Daughter No. 2 and so on.
</P>
<P>
   The clan matriarch, however, had a shrewd mind and good looks,
and early in this century she moved from the countryside to the
shadowy night district of Shanghai, taking her young daughter, Xi
Cuizhen, with her. It was a move that not only created a Chinese
revolution in her own family but also resulted in breathtaking
opportunities for her progeny.
</P>
<P>
   The tale of this woman _ and of the three generations of women
who followed her _ underscores how life has changed for Chinese
women in a remarkably short time. If one of the themes of this
millennium has been the increasing liberation of women, it perhaps
has even more resonance in the East than in the West, for nowhere
has the evolution in women's power been swifter.
</P>
<P>
   While no one family can do justice to the enormously varied
conditions of women in Asia _ from the child brides of India to the
tough women entrepreneurs of Taiwan _ the transformation
experienced by the women of Ms. Zhang's family is one that has
parallels across the region.
</P>
<P>
   For much of history, a Chinese woman considered herself a
servant first to her father, then to her husband and then to her
son. When her husband died, she showed her loyalty by not
remarrying, even if it meant she might have no livelihood; she
always had the option of dying of hunger.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a trifling when a widow starves to death,'' said Cheng
Hao, a prominent Confucian philosopher of the Sung dynasty. ``But
it is a very serious matter when she loses her chastity.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, not all Chinese women lived by this credo. In ancient
times, there were some famously strong and dynamic Chinese women.
But about the year 1000, the social noose around women tightened.
Philosopher-rulers designed a strict Confucian code of conduct they
hoped would impose stability; virtuous women were rewarded with
money and gifts.
</P>
<P>
   By the 14th century, attitudes had hardened. Prostitution became
common, but sadistic punishments were prescribed for socialites who
strayed from Confucian values. If a women had a ``yehe,'' an
extramarital liaison, one punishment was to ``peel the skin off the
bones _ to the death.'' Not surprisingly, many widows chose to
commit suicide when their husbands died.
</P>
<P>
   When the family's great-grandmother got to Shanghai, it was the
most sizzling city in Asia. The details of her adventures are
sketchy, but somehow she created one of the best nightclubs on Hui
Le Li, a street famous for bordellos.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were so many young girls looking for a better life, and
the only way was to find a man who could take care of them,'' said
Ms. Zhang. ``There was not much that China provided for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Shanghai's nightclubs were the setting for vibrant political
debate, as rising revolutionaries sought the secrecy of dimly lit
corners to map out political campaigns. The great-grandmother's
daughter, Xi Cuizhen, grew up partly in the club and met some of
the wealthiest men in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
   One of those men was a scholar and lawyer, Zhang Shizhao, a
married man. A former Minister of Education, Mr. Zhang spent
considerable time in Shanghai's bordellos, where he enjoyed the
charms of the entertainers who poured wine, talked sweetly and
performed a dance or two.
</P>
<P>
   Xi Cuizhen was gracious with her mother's guests and obviously
caught Mr. Zhang's eye, but for her, dancing was virtually
impossible. That was because of her very small feet, which had been
bound when she was little. As with most other young girls in the
countryside, Xi Cuizhen's mother had wrapped white cloth around her
feet when she was probably 4 or 5.
</P>
<P>
   Every evening, the mother would unwrap and wash her daughter's
feet and then rewrap the cloth before Xi Cuizhen went to sleep. It
was extremely painful as her feet began to grow, and it was often
difficult to sleep with the throbbing pain. Eventually, though,
Xi's arches broke and her two small toes began to curl under, as
they were supposed to.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese women began binding their feet just at the turn of the
millennium. By the 13th century, foot binding had become a means to
curb women, an attitude captured by a poet who wrote: ``Why must
the foot be bound?/
</P>
<P>
   To prevent barbarous running around!'' The Mongols, who came to
power in 1279, outlawed the practice, but it still spread, as men
craved the beauty of the crescent foot, slender and pointed at the
toe. For women, foot binding was the price for a good marriage.
</P>
<P>
   The problem was that while women were supposed to be virtuous,
men were not. Zhang Shizhao ended up marrying Xi Cuizhen, and they
adopted a daughter: Zhang Hanzhi, my host. But Mr. Zhang never
divorced his first wife. Xi simply became the second wife.
(Eventually, he added a third.)
</P>
<P>
   The arrangement was not out of the ordinary. Women were often
forced to live in marital competition: Sometimes relations were
cordial; other times they were not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the time before 1949, all three wives were living in
Shanghai, but not together,'' said Ms. Zhang. ``It was part of
society. It became the status quo.'' Sometimes, Ms. Zhang added,
``he would have dinner with us, and then he went back to his third
wife.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 20th century, women gained status as Western ideas began
filtering into China. Reformers began demanding greater literacy
for women and an end to foot binding. Families who bound their
daughters' feet would find their names in the newspaper; a women's
movement spread.
</P>
<P>
   Communism extended the liberation of women, with Mao Zedong
preaching that women held up half the sky. Child weddings were
banned, concubines were outlawed and brothels were closed. Women
went to night school, studied sewing or joined the local factory.
Women drove combines and became pilots.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women finally gained financial independence,'' said Yufu
Huang, a scholar of women's issues at the Chinese Academy of Social
Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   After the 1949 Communist revolution, Mr. Zhang joined the top
leadership of the People's Congress and moved to Beijing with Xi
Cuizhen and their daughter, the young Ms. Zhang. Ms. Zhang went to
college at the Foreign Languages Institute, an achievement that
women in her mother's generation would never have dreamed of.
</P>
<P>
   She became a freethinking academic there and married Hong
Junyan, a Beijing University professor. Together they had a
daughter, Hung Huang.
</P>
<P>
   Then in 1962, after an encounter at Mao's 70th-year birthday
party, the Communist leader asked Ms. Zhang to give him his first
English lesson. He was impressed by her and in 1970 sent her to the
Foreign Ministry. ``We need women diplomats,'' he said. ``China
needs a woman spokesman.''
</P>
<P>
   At first, it was an awkward fit: Ms. Zhang with her
free-spirited academic ways and the Chinese Foreign Office with its
bureaucratic, formalistic approach. On her first day as a diplomat,
Ms. Zhang went to work carrying a green army bag with the phrase
``Serve the People'' spelled out in the red characters of the
Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
   From it, she took out her teacup _ a jam jar with a plastic net
that held the jar of hot tea so that she wouldn't burn her fingers.
Her conservative colleagues used porcelain teacups.
</P>
<P>
   ``They all examined my jar when I left,'' she says. ``I was like
someone from outer space dropping into the Foreign Office.''
</P>
<P>
   Then she was given a ruler, scissors, glue and a small desk and
told to read cables of foreign news articles from Chinese embassies
abroad and to scan for news about Pakistan. ``Just read the
Pakistan cables,'' she recalls her boss telling her. ``Don't read
the others, because they are confidential.''
</P>
<P>
   She had no idea what her new tools were for. Her male boss
explained, ``Use the ruler to draw a line around the article, cut
it with a scissors, stick it onto a piece of paper and give it to
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Zhang, demoralized, was ready to quit. But she persisted,
and her support from Mao and her command of English led her to
become one of China's top translators, interpreting for Henry
Kissinger on his secret mission to Beijing and then for President
Nixon on his visit to China in 1972. She worked closely with Mao
and was privy to some of the confidential talks that helped
establish the foundations of Chinese-American relations.
</P>
<P>
   In November 1971 Mao had nominated her to be an interpreter for
the first Chinese delegation to the United Nations. It was on that
trip to New York that she got the attention of Qiao Guanhua, the
Deputy Foreign Minister and a widower.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Zhang had to get Qiao's signature for a document, and when
she finally got a chance to see him, he said he was too tired and
wanted to take a nap. Disgusted, she tossed the document on the
desk and said, ``Well, it's up to you!'' and stalked out.
</P>
<P>
   The Deputy Foreign Minister was shocked that a woman dared to
behave so boldly. Still, he must not have been too appalled, for
two years later, in 1973, after Ms. Zhang had divorced her first
husband, she and Qiao married.
</P>
<P>
   That same year, Hung Huang, Ms. Zhang's 12-year-old daughter,
went to the United States as one of 28 children chosen as part of
an experiment to educate Chinese youth abroad. She lived with a
family in New York, who introduced her to ``The Cat in the Hat,''
``Sesame Street'' and Ray's Pizza.
</P>
<P>
   In 1977, however, Hung had to cut her schooling short and return
to China. With Mao's death, the political tides had turned against
her mother, who had been put under house arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Zhang's guards wanted to get rid of her but didn't want any
blame, so they dropped hints. ``They left a pair of scissors one
day,'' said Ms. Zhang. ``Another day they left a rope. But not for
a moment did I ever think of killing myself. I knew how to
survive.''
</P>
<P>
   Hung remained in Beijing until her mother was released in 1980.
She then went back to the United States to go to college at Vassar.
On graduating, she returned to China to become a metals trader in
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Confucianism may have enslaved women for centuries, but
capitalism and commercialism have been enormously powerful in
helping women overturn history. Women in China now have real
freedom when it comes to choosing their careers _ freedom that will
be hard to strip away.
</P>
<P>
   But by no means is the transformation of female power complete.
Advertisements strongly hint that women should be housewives or sex
symbols. Women also face a confusing array of pressures and
options.
</P>
<P>
   As Yufu of the Chinese Academy said, ``Women are right in the
process of finding a path.''
</P>
<P>
   Hung has certainly stumbled along that path. Once, when she was
desperate to win a $60 million contract, she stayed for hours in
the offices of the two bureaucrats responsible for awarding the
deal. She answered their phones, pleaded with them, but won the
contract only after she broke into tears.
</P>
<P>
   Hung has also struggled to find a way to act in a male-dominated
business, sometimes with mixed results. One evening, in
time-honored tradition, she went drinking with customers and ended
up vomiting in their laps.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Hung sees these episodes as growing pains, the awkward
acts that come with any transition. Now she is a partner at a
high-powered consulting firm in Beijing. While her mother is an
enlightened traditionalist in her views about women, Hung, who is
37, is modern, individualistic and multicultural. She is on her
third marriage _ this one to a French diplomat.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike her forebears, Hung is much less dependent on men.
Like a growing number of women in China today, her achievements are
varied and distinctly her own. Women may still be treated like dirt
in many rural areas, but in the cities, the relationship between
the sexes is not all that different from the way it is in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   The Zhang family's own troubled journey underscores some of the
changes between the sexes. For the great-grandmother and the
grandmother of the clan, the only opportunity to rise was to appeal
to men's passions.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Zhang Hanzhi came along, it was possible for a woman
to demonstrate her talents, but even Ms. Zhang was aided by her
marriage and her association with Mao. Now the next generation,
Hung Huang, is finally able to do whatever she can on her own, as a
person rather than as a woman.
</P>
<P>
   When Ms. Zhang's memoirs became a best-selling book in China
last year, readers got a glimpse of how Hung's mother, like other
women of her generation, views her own success. All they had to do
was read the title: ``Ten Years in the Storm: Remembering My
Father, My Husband and Chairman Mao.''
</P>
<P>
   While her success was very much her own, she still saw her life
path as intertwined and enhanced by the three powerful men in her
life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would never have given that title to my book,'' says Hung.
``Link my achievements to the men in my life? Never.''

POWER SUFFERING 
</HEADLINE>
   For release: May 16 or thereafter  
 By JENNIFER EGAN  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 c.1999 Jennifer Egan  
<TEXT>
<P>
   At sunset one evening in 1353, the 6-year-old Catherine
Benincasa is said to have experienced the first of the mystical
visions that would power her brief, extraordinary life.
</P>
<P>
   While returning to her home in Siena with her brother Stefano
after a visit to their married sister across the valley, she gazed
over the church of St. Dominic and saw Jesus drenched in light,
flanked by SS. Peter, Paul and John.
</P>
<P>
   Jesus smiled at Catherine and blessed her. Stefano, finding his
sister standing in the road gaping at the sky, shook her from her
trance. The vision evaporated, and Catherine burst into tears.
</P>
<P>
   She returned that evening to what must have been a teeming
household; Catherine was the second youngest of 25 children, though
some of them, like her own twin sister, had died in infancy.
</P>
<P>
   While Catherine, later to become St. Catherine of Siena, kept
her vision of Christ a secret, her piety sharpened after that
encounter. In imitation of the public flagellants who had been
roaming Europe since the outbreak of bubonic plague some years
before, Catherine and several playmates took to flagellating
themselves in secret.
</P>
<P>
   An appetite for self-mortification would prove one of the
saint's most enduring traits, and would lead to her death, at 33,
of starvation.
</P>
<P>
   In this respect, Catherine's behavior foreshadowed that of a
great many women today for whom power and suffering _ often
self-inflicted _ are curiously intertwined. Modern-day anorexics,
bulimics and self-injurers experience an illusion of control
through disciplining or mutilating their bodies, echoing the pious
self-punishments of Catherine's time.
</P>
<P>
   The lives of Catherine and other saints like her can help to
explain why these impulses persist among women _ from athletes and
models to Diana, princess of Wales _ when both the world and the
position of women in it have been radically transformed.
</P>
<P>
   Catherine's childhood vision of Jesus and the penitence it
inspired were common in the lives of mystic saints: individuals
whose piety took the form of frequent, direct and personal visions
of Christ and other holy figures.
</P>
<P>
   Though mystics have existed since the earliest days of
Christianity, they gained prominence during the chaotic later
Middle Ages, a time of plague, civil strife and economic transition
that historians have compared to our present era.
</P>
<P>
   A great many of these visionaries were female _ St. Hildegard of
Bingen, St. Teresa of Avila, St. Catherine of Genoa, St. Bridget of
Sweden, to name just a few _ and their visions and prophecies
afforded them a degree of visibility and influence that was
virtually unheard of in women of their time.
</P>
<P>
   Fourteenth-century girls were married off as early as 12 or 13,
shortly after they reached puberty, in part to ensure their
virginity. But Catherine Benincasa had other plans _ she had
promised her chastity to Christ at the age of 7. The death of her
favorite older sister, in childbirth, sealed her resolve not to
marry, and she chopped off her long gold hair to repel potential
suitors.
</P>
<P>
   Her parents, distraught at having to forfeit the wealth a new
son-in-law might have brought to the family, retaliated by forcing
Catherine to work as the family servant. But when no amount of
punishment could break her will, her father relented, allowing her
to pursue her spiritual endeavors.
</P>
<P>
   At about 17, Catherine became a tertiary, or lay member, of a
Dominican order in Siena whose adherents she had watched and
admired as a child. These were chaste widows who ministered to the
sick and the urban poor (a growing presence as Europe's
agricultural economy yielded to commerce and city life).
</P>
<P>
   As a young virgin, Catherine made an incongruous addition. She
continued to live at home, spending most of her time praying alone
in a tiny cell beneath a flight of stairs, where she was plagued by
demonic visions and temptations.
</P>
<P>
   To combat these, she amplified her acts of penance, not speaking
for three years except at confession, eating nothing but bread,
water and raw vegetables, sleeping on a wooden board and
flagellating herself three times daily until she drew blood. Her
mother, aghast, took Catherine with her for a bathing cure; she
scalded herself in the sulfuric water.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that time, the more you were like Jesus in his sufferings,
the holier you were and the better,'' says Sister Suzanne Noffke,
who is translating and editing Catherine's letters. ``She very much
wanted martyrdom.''
</P>
<P>
   Catherine's desire for martyrdom drew on popular tales of the
martyr-saints, some of whom died spectacularly at the hands of the
Romans during the first three centuries of Christianity, while
others were killed later by invading Huns, Vikings and Saracens.
</P>
<P>
   Yet martyrdom was only one route to sainthood for women, who
account for fewer than 20 percent of all saints. Many early female
saints were foundresses and patrons of churches and also
converters, both in the first centuries A.D. (St. Helena, Emperor
Constantine I's mother, is believed to have converted him) and
during the sixth to eighth centuries, when missionaries worked to
spread Christianity among the Frankish and Germanic tribes of
Northern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Queens and noblewomen, whose job it was to receive these
missionaries, often were first to convert, and then converted their
husbands _ which, in early societies, meant the simultaneous
conversion of that ruler's subjects.
</P>
<P>
   Catherine found succor in her solitary torments on Shrove
Tuesday 1367, when she was about 20. It was the last night of
Carnival in Siena, and revelers filled the streets. As Catherine
prayed alone in her cell, the Virgin Mary and Jesus appeared to her
along with King David, John the Evangelist and SS. Paul and
Dominic. While King David played a harp, Jesus placed a ring of
betrothal upon Catherine's finger. It is said that the ring
remained visible to her throughout her life, though no one else
could see it.
</P>
<P>
   After this spiritual union _ a recurrent element in the lives of
female mystics _ Catherine's retreat from the world came to an
abrupt end: God instructed her to venture forth and help her fellow
creatures. She rejoined her family at dinnertime (though she seldom
ate) and reluctantly began to talk about her visions.
</P>
<P>
   She accompanied the other women in her order, known as
mantellate, on their visits to the hospital, where she was said to
have effected miracle cures. By the time she was in her early 20s,
she had amassed a group of disciples who called her Mamma. Male and
female, religious and lay (one of her closest friends was a young
nobleman she had extricated from a blood feud), these devotees
watched over Catherine during her ecstasies, when she went rigid
for hours at a time, and also served as her secretaries and
scribes. (Though she had learned to read, like most laypeople she
probably could not write.)
</P>
<P>
   She began an enormous correspondence, often dictating letters to
several scribes at once, imparting her wishes and advice to
neighbors, family members, kings, religious leaders and the pope
himself.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Siena was plagued by bloody internecine disputes,
and Catherine became known for her ability to mediate these
successfully, as well as to touch and convert sinners and
prisoners. She rekindled the faith of one man, Niccolo di Toldo, on
the eve of his own beheading, then accompanied him to his execution
and caught his severed head in her hands.
</P>
<P>
   She began visiting other Tuscan cities, often to dissuade them
from rebelling against the papacy, something they were increasingly
tempted to do as their own populations and commercial power grew.
There she would preach in public squares, urging the conversion of
sinners, and several priests were required to hear the thousands of
confessions her words provoked.
</P>
<P>
   For a 14th-century woman, such a public life was extraordinary
to the point of being freakish. By then, even aristocratic women
had lost much of the power they wielded in the early Middle Ages.
The population had grown, land was more scarce and heredity laws
were rewritten in favor of primogeniture so that family estates
could be kept intact. Women could rarely inherit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good woman was invisible,'' says Elizabeth Petroff, a
professor of comparative literature at the University of
Massachusetts. ``She wasn't supposed to leave the house. She wasn't
even supposed to be seen standing at the window of the house.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside the convent, women received little or no education, and
with the rise of the all-male university in the 13th century,
education within the convents began to suffer.
</P>
<P>
   Medieval theology portrayed women as the more fleshly of the
sexes, corrupt and dangerous to men; accounts of many male saints'
lives abound with lewd female temptresses.
</P>
<P>
   It was no surprise, then, that pious women of Catherine's era
turned to mysticism; contemplation was virtually forced upon them
by the lack of other opportunities. But that their visions and
prophecies were taken seriously by men points to a paradox in the
medieval view of women: Their very lowliness, it was thought, made
them more likely conduits for celestial intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Newman, professor of English and religion at
Northwestern University, says: ``Women's bodies were seen as being
more permeable than men's, more open to diverse influences. Just as
women are more easily tempted by the Devil, the same thing is true
with the Holy Spirit.''
</P>
<P>
   For this reason, Newman says, it was impossible for male clerics
to dismiss out of hand the holy visions of a woman. ``Women
embodied that voice from the underground,'' she says, ``of Christ
standing in judgment over the power structure.''
</P>
<P>
   In the medieval mind, there was a connection between weakness,
self-abnegation and holiness _ a connection that originated in
Christ's shame and suffering on earth. Female mystics believed this
too.
</P>
<P>
   St. Hildegard of Bingen, a 12th-century visionary and
Benedictine nun who penned strenuous works of theology, medicine
and natural history as well as hymns and other liturgical music,
wrote of herself, ``I am a poor earthen vessel and say these things
not of myself, but from the serene Light.''
</P>
<P>
   Catherine's correspondence is sprinkled with professions of her
own unworthiness. ``Poor wretched woman that I am, my sins are so
much more numerous than ever,'' she wrote in one letter, and in
another, to an apostolic nuncio for Pope Gregory XI, ``I received
your letter, my dear father, and it was a great consolation and joy
to think you would remember someone so poor and lowly.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet these disclaimers hardly offset the emphatic, even imperious
tone of the letters themselves, in which Catherine used her status
as an empty vessel for God's word to chide, exhort, cajole and even
threaten with damnation people she believed were failing to embody
their full Christian potential.
</P>
<P>
   ``If women had a reputation for genuine holiness, that was a
ticket to influence,'' Sister Noffke says, and Catherine did not
hesitate to use it. In a letter to a governor of Milan who
violently opposed the papacy, she likened him to a gangrenous limb
on a body of the church.
</P>
<P>
   To King Charles V of France, whose involvement in the Hundred
Years War Catherine felt was sapping resources from the more worthy
project of initiating another crusade, she wrote: ``Enough of this
stupid blindness! I am telling you in the name of Christ crucified
to wait no longer to make this peace. Make peace! Make peace!'' At
times she even mocked her own zeal. ``I don't want to say any
more,'' she wrote to her old friend Frate Bartolomeo Dominici,
``because I wouldn't stop until I died _ or bored you to death!''
</P>
<P>
   Catherine's most ardent wish for the church was that the papacy
would return to Rome from Avignon, where it had relocated in 1309
to escape civil unrest. To this end, she wrote hortatory letters to
Pope Gregory XI, with whom she felt a great familiarity, addressing
him often as Babbo, or ``Dearest Daddy,'' and urging him to act.
</P>
<P>
   ``Up, father! No more irresponsibility!'' she wrote in one
letter, and in another: ``You ought to be using the power and
strength that is yours. If you don't intend to use it, it would be
better and more to God's honor and the good of your soul to
resign.''
</P>
<P>
   In this and nearly all of her letters, she concludes by
apologizing for her forwardness. ``Forgive me! Forgive me! My great
love for your salvation, and my great pain when I see it
threatened, makes me speak ... Don't make it necessary for me to
complain about you to Christ crucified. (There is no one else I can
complain to, since there is no one greater (than you) on earth).''
</P>
<P>
   Mingled with this odd swirl of diffidence and cheekiness, of
grandiosity and self-effacement, was the tendency among female
mystics to take physical self-punishment to brutal extremes.
Catherine overcame her revulsion at a cancer patient's fetid sore
by drinking a cup of the pus it discharged, and she was famous for
her drastic fasting _ she often inserted sticks into her throat to
make herself vomit after eating.
</P>
<P>
   Bridget of Sweden poured hot wax on her flesh. St. Clare of
Assisi slept on the floor in wintertime and fasted three days each
week during Lent. ``The men had work to do, so they didn't have
time for a lot of penance and suffering,'' Noffke says. ``Women
were not to be seen, not to be heard, but they could suffer.''
</P>
<P>
   Priests tended to glorify suffering in women, and encouraged it
in their confessions. Yet extreme self-mortification could also
make a woman the object of suspicion, for around the corner from
inspired female holiness always lurked the possibility of heresy or
witchcraft _ the danger that Satan, not God, was employing the
woman as his vessel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not surprised at your fear, father, especially about my
eating habits,'' Catherine wrote to a priest in Florence. ``I am
always fearful because of my own weakness and the devil's
cleverness.''
</P>
<P>
   The historian Caroline Walker Bynum has noted that witch and
saint were in a sense mirror images of each other: Both were
impelled by an outside power, whether good or evil; both could read
people's minds and perform supernatural feats; both were lifted off
the ground _ witches by flying, saints through levitation.
</P>
<P>
   Suspicions about Catherine's orthodoxy prompted the leaders of
the Dominican order to summon her to Florence in spring 1374, when
her reputation first began to grow. Though she satisfied her
examiners, the Dominicans assigned her a new confessor, Raymond of
Capua, whom they charged with keeping a sharp eye on her.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, Raymond became Catherine's most loyal
defender, and wrote her vita, or biography, which made a strong
case for her sainthood. (She was canonized in 1461 and declared a
Doctor of the Church _ one of three women to bear that title _ in
1970.)
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, most female mystics who became saints had the allegiance
of one or more powerful men who shielded them from the world's
suspicion. ``If you didn't have somebody in the church hierarchy
who could speak for you, you were really lost,'' Elizabeth Petroff
says.
</P>
<P>
   One casualty was Marguerite Porete, author of ``A Mirror of
Simple Souls,'' who was accused of heresy and burned in 1310.
According to Barbara Newman, the problem for Margaret may have been
one of style as much as doctrine: ``She did not say, `I have had a
vision' or `I have had a prophetic call.' She just wrote the book
the way a male author would have written it, and she didn't get
away with it.'' Female strength, untempered by humility,
self-abnegation or the imprimatur of a male authority, was an
intolerable threat.
</P>
<P>
   In 1376, Catherine intensified her campaign to move the papacy
from Avignon to Rome by visiting Avignon herself, where she met
repeatedly with Gregory XI and continued to write him as well,
urging his departure.
</P>
<P>
   In September of that year, he finally set off for Rome by ship,
his reluctant court in tow. But the pope's return to Rome failed to
have the salubrious impact Catherine had hoped for. Disheartened in
a foreign land, Gregory XI died in 1378, and his Neapolitan
successor, Urban VI, managed to alienate the French cardinals and
royalty almost instantly.
</P>
<P>
   The cardinals retaliated by appointing a second pope, or
antipope, from Geneva, whom they installed in Avignon as Clement
VII. Thus began the Great Western Schism, in which two, and even
three, popes sought to preside over Western Christendom until 1417.
</P>
<P>
   At Urban VI's request, Catherine journeyed to Rome and worked
furiously to rally support behind him, believing that his
legitimate election was inviolable, whatever his personal faults.
She was brokenhearted over the failure of her mission, and her
years of austerities had ravaged her physically, leaving her in
constant pain.
</P>
<P>
   Unable to eat or even drink water, she deteriorated rapidly.
``Here is my body which I acknowledge as coming from Thee and I now
offer it to Thee; may it be an anvil for Thy beatings, to atone for
their sins,'' she prayed. She died in 1380.
</P>
<P>
   In his book ``Holy Anorexia,'' Rudolph M. Bell argues
compellingly that Catherine of Siena, along with many other Italian
female mystics, fits the classic profile of an anorexic. In a
14th-century context, anorexia actually makes a kind of sense.
Self-deprivation was widely agreed to be holy, and holiness was one
of the few modes of self-expression available to women _ virtually
their only route to power.
</P>
<P>
   The surprise, then, is not that anorexics existed in St.
Catherine's time, but that in our present secular, affluent
culture, where women have access to a degree of education,
independence and self-expression that would have staggered a
14th-century woman, self-denial and suffering continue to hold out
the same kind of promise.
</P>
<P>
   Today, anorexia nervosa afflicts about 1 of every 100 female
adolescents in America, a majority of whom may never recover fully,
and between 10 percent and 20 percent of whom will eventually die
from the disease. About 2 million people, mostly women, cut and
burn themselves compulsively in pursuit of an illusory sense of
control, and many millions suffer from bulimia.
</P>
<P>
   In high-pressure athletic disciplines such as ballet,
gymnastics, figure skating, diving and long-distance running, the
incidence of eating disorders among women is much higher. Rudolph
Bell cites a study showing that nearly 1 in 6 aspiring ballerinas
was anorexic. Clearly, a substantial number of women still derive a
sense of power from disciplining their bodies, despite the fact
that their deprivations and self-inflicted wounds ultimately weaken
them and sometimes cost them their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Most remarkably, sufferers of anorexia and self-injury tend to
be white, Western and middle to upper class _ precisely the women
who, more than any before them in history, would seem able to
control a great deal more than their physical selves.
</P>
<P>
   Even as our culture decries these disorders, in subtle ways it
endorses the equation of suffering with female power. In recent
fashion photography what was heroin chic if not a study of the
stark beauty of feminine duress, a beauty that seemed to pulse
forth with even greater intensity from the scrawny, bruised-looking
models with raccoon eyes and hair tangled to perfection.
</P>
<P>
   And how else can we interpret the popular rehabilitation of
Hillary Clinton, now that her outright power _ offensive to many
Americans _ has been tempered by her dignified and mostly silent
endurance of the most public marital humiliation ever. Now, for the
first time since her arrival at the White House six years ago, the
first lady is widely hailed not only as a model for women, but _
most dizzyingly _ also as a future senatorial and even presidential
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   It is as if, through suffering, a certain unseemliness
associated with her authority has been erased. Pain has worked for
Hillary Clinton, involuntary though it may have been _ a lesson
that doubtless will be absorbed by younger women who look up to
her.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the best example of a woman whose visible pain inspired
passionate devotion was Diana, princess of Wales, who can
legitimately be called a popular saint. In the princess, as in the
late-medieval mystics, personal charisma and a desire to help
others was tinctured with suffering, including some of the same
self-inflicted torments _ anorexia, bulimia, self-mutilation _ that
the mystic saints underwent.
</P>
<P>
   But Catherine of Siena punished herself in imitation of Christ,
and the power she experienced came from feeling a greater proximity
to God. Lacking any such divine affiliation, the suffering our
culture elicits from its women seems doubly tragic _ pointless in
itself and, in most cases, a distraction from the real sources of
power they might otherwise be able to tap.
</P>
<P>
   Toward the end of her life, Catherine of Siena tried to reverse
her extreme fasting, but by then her body could no longer tolerate
food. Though she urged other women not to follow her example, her
suffering was glorified after her death, and scores of young
Italian girls starved themselves in her image.
</P>
<P>
   In this, as in all matters, Catherine employed her most trusted
weapon: epistolary advice. ``And where is the hope that you used to
have in the kingdom of God?'' she wrote to a Dominican nun who had
grown ill from too many austerities. ``It is gone with the
attachment to penance, by which means it hoped to have life
eternal. ... Don't wish for the lesser good of penance to hinder
the greater good.''
</P>
<P>
   Fewer women nowadays may long for a union with Christ, as
Catherine did, but her advice still resonates: Pain, as an end in
itself, may well distract us from our greater good.

 THE REST of the STORY  
 For release: May 16 or thereafter  
 By NATALIE ZEMON DAVIS and JILL KER CONWAY  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 c.1999 Natalie Zemon Davis and Jill Ker Conway  
<TEXT>
<P>
   For all their drama and insight, traditional histories of the
last thousand years fall short.
</P>
<P>
   Written mostly by men, they introduced women into the standard
parade of wars, revolutions, monarchs and parliaments only at
moments such as their ascension to inherited thrones or religious
authority. In the 19th century, most male historians compounded the
problem by making women's history sound as though women had only
then begun making headway.
</P>
<P>
   Women's history has more to it than that. Women have always
questioned their subordination and often found ways around it.
Further, some institutions important in the lives of women that
seem timeless, such as monogamous marriage, are in fact rooted in
the last thousand years; some ostensibly modern movements reach far
back in time.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, many turning points on the thousand-year time line of
women's history are little known or little understood. The
following brief account of that history describes the rest of the
story.
 &UR; Who Says Men Are Closer to God? &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Are women and men more alike than they are different? And where
they are different, are women inferior or superior? Such questions
have been debated since biblical times, and especially in the years
after 1000. Some medieval theologians _ male, that is _ taught that
woman was not created in God's image. But that could not be true,
abbesses and nuns objected, for they had felt Christ's ``imprint of
resemblance'' on them.
</P>
<P>
   Hildegard of Bingen, a nun in the Rhineland in the 12th century,
insisted that women's ``weakness'' did not refer to spiritual
capacities. A woman could mortify the flesh and draw close to God
as well as any man.
</P>
<P>
   Such women accepted the general view that the universe was
organized into realms of higher and lower: angels over humans,
humans over animals, nobles over commoners, soul over body. But
when it came to men over women, women balked.
</P>
<P>
   Christine de Pizan, poet and moralist at the French court, said
in her ``Book of the City of Ladies'' of 1405 that God had created
men and women with equal potential. If men had stronger bodies,
women had freer and sharper minds, if they were just educated.
Against the old medical idea that women had a hungry womb _ that
is, a sexual appetite less controllable than men's _ Christine
countered that women were by nature virtuous and modest.
</P>
<P>
   The hottest debates about male-female relations in medieval
Europe turned on celibacy. In the 10th and 11th centuries, many
priests were married, and their wives had access to the sacred. In
a turning point in women's history, the 11th-century reforms of
Pope Gregory VII did away with clerical marriage in the Roman
Church.
</P>
<P>
   These reforms inaugurated 10 centuries in which sexually active
males _ and all women _ were forbidden to perform important
liturgical functions. A spiritual demotion it may have been, but it
also confirmed an ideal of the celibate life, leaving nuns such as
Hildegard of Bingen scope for high ascetic devotions.
 &UR; One Man, One Wife &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The church put all its force behind insisting on monogamous,
permanent marriage. An important step was declaring the full
doctrine of marriage as a religious sacrament in 1215. Getting the
doctrine accepted by lay people was another matter.
</P>
<P>
   Among the landed classes, men lived with concubines instead of,
or along with, wives and cast their women aside at will. Only when
the great families decided that the church's rule would help keep
feudal property together did they go along.
</P>
<P>
   Then in the 16th century, the Protestant Reformation did away
with marriage as a religious sacrament and allowed for divorce. Yet
it legitimated marriage all the more by allowing clergymen to wed
and doing away with celibate nunneries and monasteries. In Europe,
prostitution was made illegal in both Catholic and Protestant
cities. It was still practiced, of course, as was concubinage,
especially between European settlers in America and their female
slaves. But monogamous marriage remained the triumphant cultural
ideal.
</P>
<P>
   According to religious teaching and secular law, the wife was
``subject'' to her husband, and her property was under his control.
He was to rule her justly and not be cruel. Moderate beating was
permissible, though some Protestant pastors preached against using
it at all, and Ashkenazic rabbis disagreed about whether it was
grounds for divorce. Divorce was not an easy out: A single woman
with children could scarcely survive. Marriage was a frame that
most women accepted, hoping for affectionate unions.
</P>
<P>
   What we today would call lesbian couples lived as married
partners in the 17th and 18th centuries, one cross-dressing as a
man. Protofeminists chronicled abuses in marriage, but did not
reject the notion of ''subjection'' outright until the 18th
century. A 17th-century male feminist said that wives should defer
to their husbands not because the men were truly superior, but to
keep the peace.
 &UR; Nine Babies, Three Adults &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   More worrisome to women than subjection was procreation. For
most of the millennium, the pattern was many births, many deaths.
Given the poor food and poor health, it was not always easy to get
and stay pregnant. Many infants, even among the wealthy, died at
birth.
</P>
<P>
   In 17th-century France, a long-lived peasant mother might bring
nine children to term; half might survive till age 5, and she could
rejoice if two or three reached adulthood. Under these
circumstances, the local midwife was consulted much more often for
medicines to conceive than for those to abort.
</P>
<P>
   Only in the late 17th century, when a better food supply in
Western Europe allowed more children to survive, did couples start
to limit the number of their children.
</P>
<P>
   The model of man over woman had some effect in every sphere,
forcing women to find means to cope or resist. Female wage earners
were paid less than men; the women improvised new ways to stitch,
smuggle, peddle or beg. Male surgeons began to deliver babies in
the wealthy families in the 17th century. Midwives defended their
female turf in the village, claiming their dexterous hands would do
better than the surgeon's forceps.
 &UR; Does `Man' Include Woman? &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Since the days of Hildegard of Bingen, women had tried for a
larger role in religion. The witchcraft prosecutions that swept
Europe and then New England in the 15th through 17th centuries
threatened that initiative. Among the many thousands executed,
women outnumbered men everywhere, at least 4 to 1. To rulers and
churchmen seeking control, the sorceress with her pact with the
devil was the symbol of secret revolt. Out of jealousy, infertile
village women even accused other women.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, during the Counter Reformation, energetic women
founded teaching orders that brought instruction to many girls
other than nuns; contemplative orders were reformed by leaders such
as Teresa of Avila. Her autobiography, a profound account of a
woman's interior and mystical life, was read as eagerly as
Augustine's ``Confessions.''
</P>
<P>
   Jewish women followed their own leader in the women's gallery of
the synagogue; one Yiddish prayer visualized women studying Torah
in Paradise. Protestant women expanded their Bible reading, but it
was especially radical sects such as the Quakers who challenged the
limits on women.
</P>
<P>
   Margaret Fell wrote her 1666 tract, ``Women's Speaking
Justified,'' against Paul's admonition that women should keep
silent in church. Women ``led by the Spirit of God'' could preach:
``Christ in the Male and Female is one.''
</P>
<P>
   For centuries, women had been queens, some of whom, such as
Elizabeth I of England, sustained authority by combining
``masculine'' and ''feminine'' styles of rulership. But no woman
served in the law courts or chancelleries of late medieval and
early modern monarchies.
</P>
<P>
   If a woman wanted to fight in the royal army, she had to do so
disguised as a man. Joan of Arc, openly leading soldiers into
battle to save France, was an exception in her day _ and she ended
up burned at the stake.
</P>
<P>
   Most political action of women was taken informally through
conversations and coquetry at court and as sponsors of the salons
that arose in many cities in the 17th century. More open influence
came about through increased literacy and printing.
</P>
<P>
   By the 18th century, women of diverse views were contributing to
the abundant pamphlet literature on public affairs. The English
historian Catharine Sawbridge Macaulay published tracts defending
authors' copyright, frequently elected parliaments and the rights
of the American colonies.
</P>
<P>
   As for the illiterate women of the lower classes in England,
France and the Netherlands, their only lever of protest was joining
in street riots.
</P>
<P>
   All these forms of political action came together in the French
Revolution, and some new ones were added as women made public
political speeches and joined the army openly. The new philosophy
of rational natural rights placed all men on an equal footing in
regard to citizenship and the law.
</P>
<P>
   But did ``men'' include women? The French playwright Olympe de
Gouges insisted that it did in her ``Declaration of the Rights of
Woman,'' in 1791, as did Mary Wollstonecraft the following year in
``A Vindication of the Rights of Woman.'' Others did not want women
to have so much of a share in political life.
</P>
<P>
   Men of the revolution said that women should stay home and rear
their sons to be good citizens. Even evangelical women encouraged
their sisters to seek reform through religion and leave matters of
state to men.
</P>
<P>
   It would be the new American republic where the issues of
women's status would play out most vigorously over the next
century.
 &UR; `The Slavery of Marriage' &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When enlightenment ideas came to America, the debate about
women's rights found a new context, since the most powerful form of
social hierarchy there was not gender but race. And the American
Constitution, by dispensing with hereditary rank and monarchical
institutions, immediately granted women a new role: teaching
republican values to young Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The new republic opened many avenues to women: social, economic,
political, educational and religious. Evangelical Christianity made
the home, not the church, the site of religious instruction.
</P>
<P>
   As women increasingly assumed this responsibility, they also
began teaching outside the home and stressed the need for women's
schools. In the first half of the 19th century, Emma Willard's Troy
Female Seminary and Catharine Beecher's Hartford Female Seminary
became thriving institutions, followed by Mary Lyon's Mount Holyoke
Female Seminary.
</P>
<P>
   By midcentury, it was clear that tax revenues should be spent to
educate girls as well as boys, at least in New York and New
England. By the 1870s, many public universities admitted women, and
elite women's colleges such as Smith and Wellesley were
established. In 1894, feminist donors to Johns Hopkins Medical
School used their gifts to compel the admission of women.
</P>
<P>
   Still, far into the first half of the 20th century, many
professional schools continued to bar women, and when they were
admitted, discrimination drove them to lower-status professional
fields. Female doctors were steered toward public health, lawyers
to social work, language scholars to library cataloguing,
scientists to high-school teaching.
</P>
<P>
   Within the white middle-class family, education and religious
responsibility for children improved women's status through the
19th century. By the 1830s, magazines analyzing life from a woman's
point of view began to flourish in North America.
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, female writers of philosophical insight, from George
Eliot to Virginia Woolf in the early 20th century and on up to
Simone de Beauvoir, steadily clarified women's issues. But mostly,
wives were still considered their husbands' subordinates.
</P>
<P>
   American feminists wishing to convey their critique of marriage
often did so through the lens of slavery, the most volatile public
issue of the mid- and late 19th century.
</P>
<P>
   ``The investigation of the rights of the slave has led me to a
better understanding of my own,'' wrote Angelina Grimke, a Southern
abolitionist. ``I have found the Anti-Slavery cause to be the high
school of morals in our land. ... Now if rights are founded in the
nature of our moral being, then the mere circumstance of sex does
not give to man higher rights and responsibilities than to woman.''
</P>
<P>
   Though they didn't participate in elections, American women
believed that they had access to the political system through the
right to petition Congress. But as the conflict over abolition
escalated, it became clear that women's petitions were not being
heard. The right to vote was moved to the top of the list.
</P>
<P>
   Female reformers such as Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Anna Howard
Shaw combined spellbinding oratory with noisy street politics.
Stanton was well known, for instance, for her lecture ``The Slavery
of Marriage.''
</P>
<P>
   The argument for suffrage then became more expedient: White
women's votes would balance those of newly enfranchised black males
and immigrants. The majority that ratified the 19th Amendment in
1920 was built on these racist grounds.
 &UR; New Experts in Mothering: Men &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, biological science was replacing theology as the
language for discussing the differences between women and men. The
popularity of Darwinian thought and the discovery of the endocrine
system anchored the discussion firmly in science. Nor were such
discussions purely theoretical, for by the 1920s women and men
began to inhabit the same workplace.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the young women taking clerical jobs in corporate
offices were considered little threat, for it was thought that
their hormones would drive them to maternity and service rather
than wealth and power.
</P>
<P>
   The new economic forces at work in America radically altered the
role of women as workers, mothers and wives. Industrialization had
created jobs for women in factories and textile mills in the
mid-1800s. At the same time, the fruits of industrialization _
mass-produced clothing and foods _ gave middle-class mothers a new
role: manager of household consumption.
</P>
<P>
   But many female responsibilities were subject to male guidance
at the turn of the century. In the new field of child studies, male
experts such as G. Stanley Hall even tried to make mothering a
science.
</P>
<P>
   Isolation made mothers willing recipients of such expertise. The
middle class had begun its flight from the city in the mid-19th
century, and by its close servants were being replaced by new
labor-saving household equipment. So suburban women were alone with
their children.
</P>
<P>
   Whereas in the 18th century the family was a partnership for
spouses and children, the 20th-century family became based on
intimacy. Greater life expectancy meant that marriages lasted
longer, well past a woman's childbearing years. As infant mortality
declined, the family became more child-centered, and private
insurance and pensions, as well as governmental assistance, made
older parents less dependent on working children.
</P>
<P>
   The emotional tone of marriages also changed with the rise of
the corporation and the profession. Increasingly, the vocations of
middle-class men excluded their families. This prompted a movement
for more accessible divorce, along with longer marriages, increased
mobility and the growing ideal of emotional and sexual fulfillment
between spouses.
 &UR; Not-So-Equal Rights &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sigmund Freud and other pioneers of psychology profoundly
affected the status of women by arguing that an acceptance of
gender difference was a prerequisite for mental health. From the
1920s through the 1970s, women with political, scientific or
intellectual interests were stigmatized as neurotic, while men
involved in the more ``feminine'' realms such as the arts were
considered less than fully male.
</P>
<P>
   The family dynamic laid out by Freud, based on latent erotic
attachments, encouraged sons to overcome their mother complexes by
becoming strong and independent. Daughters, meanwhile, were
encouraged to replace their love for their fathers by finding a
male romantic partner rather than by developing an independent
self.
</P>
<P>
   In time, however, feminist interpretations of difference
developed. In the 1970s, Nancy Chodorow reworked Freud's Oedipal
system to point out that the strongest erotic gratification a
female infant receives comes from a same-sex relationship with her
mother, raising questions about the inevitability of female
dependence on males.
</P>
<P>
   In the political sphere, meanwhile, female voting didn't change
party power structures, and women began developing parallel
institutions such as the National Woman's Party, in 1916. Its 1923
drive for an equal-rights amendment failed, just as its successor
failed in the 1970s, partly because Americans, including women,
remained resistant to the idea of a woman as president.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, feminists created parallel structures to support
female candidates, including Emily's List (Early Money Is Like
Yeast). Where once the rare women elected to public office were
typically the widows of male officeholders, the election of women
became unremarkable, though even now they comprise only a fraction
of Congress and high state officials.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s, feminists began to focus on changing the
composition of high-status professions. Once access to graduate
education was won, feminist scholars pushed to change patterns of
research and teaching so that women were no longer regarded as a
failed model of the male norm, but as a norm themselves.
</P>
<P>
   In so doing, they helped ignite the culture wars of the 1980s
and '90s. And by the end of the '90s, women constituted 60 percent
of college graduates. Even so, on leaving school they still face
the continuing reality of the glass ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   Inflation, rising economic expectations and women's quest for
professional equality after World War II produced the reinvention
of the nanny _ a movement promptly challenged by the argument that
only birth mothers could care effectively for their children. A
successful dual-track life as mother and professional, therefore,
required heroic energy or a flouting of this conventional wisdom.
</P>
<P>
   Two careers within one family often meant a commuter marriage,
which may have seemed new but which echoed the old aristocratic
pattern: Spouses parted by attendance at court and by journeys to
distant estates or remote colonies. But now there is a big
difference: A woman's property and income do not necessarily belong
to her husband.
</P>
<P>
   While feminist interpretations of gender difference gained favor
in the 1970s, and while lesbian feminists argued in the 1980s for
difference with a difference, claiming the superiority of same-sex
relationships, a strong backlash arose in conservative quarters.
This was marked not only by a denigration of feminism but also by
an elevation of macho versions of male power and fresh assertions
of difference. Such arguments were once again located in theology
by Christian, Jewish and Islamic fundamentalists.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, new debates about gender difference emerged in brain
research. While female and male synapses might fire the same way,
doubters insisted that there must surely be a difference in the
circuitry. Questions about differences in wiring are a new form of
debate that goes back to the medieval question about whether women
have souls.
 &UR; The New Terrain &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So what has happened to women over the past thousand years?
Western women and their children have made astonishing gains in
health and life expectancy, though most of their non-Western
sisters have not yet shared those benefits. The scope of women's
work has expanded vastly, much of it paying well enough so that
women with children can survive.
</P>
<P>
   Women in the West have secured access to education beyond the
wildest dreams of their medieval counterparts. Women's athletic
prowess has captured public imagination, and a female general is no
longer a novelty.
</P>
<P>
   But what of the mixed outcomes? Feminist spirituality today
provides a powerful leaven within some Christian, Jewish and
Islamic communities, but others still forbid female participation,
and the loss of the institutional structure once provided by female
religious orders has shrunk the territory controlled by women. The
reduced number of women's colleges has had a similar effect.
</P>
<P>
   Women's reproductive lives, though, are now managed by
technologies subject to male control. The ability to detect the sex
of a fetus can result in higher abortion rates for female infants,
whereas in medieval society the girl babies at least had a chance
to be born. Sexual freedoms have enlarged the sphere of pleasure,
but with them have come unresolved problems about sexual behavior .
</P>
<P>
   What will be the new terrain for addressing the issues of
likeness and difference? What new strategies will women develop to
dismantle exclusively male hierarchies? The cognitive sciences will
most likely inherit the role of theology in arguing about
differences between male and female.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the global rise of religious fundamentalism will counter
women's efforts to secure equal footing. And among women worldwide
there will remain stark differences about how to achieve a better
life.
</P>
<P>
   But argument _ and laughter _ about the relationship between
women and men will never end. Our physical bodies are cultural
texts that are constantly revised, and no single formulation of the
relationship between the sexes can last.

 A Panel Moderated by MICHAEL WEINSTEIN  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 c.1999 Michael Weinstein  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the subject is women's economic progress, it's easy to get
lost in the controversies of the moment.
</P>
<P>
   So The New York Times Magazine convened six experts to consider
how that progress has played out over a longer stretch of history.
They began by examining the transformation in the lives of working
women, then looked at the power of women as consumers and finally
appraised how well (or poorly) the economy has adapted to women's
needs and desires.
</P>
<P>
   The conversation was moderated by Michael Weinstein, an
economist who writes the Economic Scene column in The New York
Times. The panelists:
</P>
<P>
   _ Victoria de Grazia, professor of history at Columbia
University and author of ``The Sex of Things: Gender and
Consumption in Historical Perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Claudia Goldin, professor of economics at Harvard University
and author of ``Understanding the Gender Gap: An Economic History
of American Women.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Jacqueline Jones, Truman professor of history at Brandeis
University and author of ``American Work: Four Centuries of Black
and White Labor.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Juliet B. Schor, economics lecturer at Harvard and author of
``The Overspent American: Why We Want What We Don't Need.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Marta Tienda, professor of sociology and public affairs at
Princeton University and author of ``The Hispanic Population of the
United States.''
</P>
<P>
   _ William Julius Wilson, Geyser University professor at Harvard
and author of ``The Bridge Over the Racial Divide: Rising
Inequality and Coalition Politics,'' to be published this fall.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A Woman's Place Is in the Workplace &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MICHAEL WEINSTEIN: How far have women come over the past century
or so? How would the economic circumstances of, say, a 20-year-old
woman living in the United States 100 years ago be different from
her counterpart's today?
</P>
<P>
   CLAUDIA GOLDIN: Typically, she would have spent a lot of time
working alongside and learning from her mother. One of the profound
changes in the 20th century was the movement of young women from
being ``at home'' to being ``at school.'' I'm referring to the
large movement of young women first to high school and then to
college.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of working outside the home, if you were a young woman
in rural America and had gone to school beyond eighth grade, you
would probably have become a teacher for a while. In cities, we
would find the women described by the Progressives as the pitiable
young factory women _ those of O. Henry's New York stories _ about
half of whom worked for piece rates. By the 1920s, young women
would be working in retail sales and in offices.
</P>
<P>
   VICTORIA DE GRAZIA: One of the biggest changes in women's lives
is their capacity to control their fertility. Efficient
contraception was almost unimaginable 100 years ago. The risk of
pregnancy, not to mention the hardship of childbearing, enormously
determined how women lived.
</P>
<P>
   MARTA TIENDA: There is also the issue of how family arrangements
constrained women. Even as recently as 15 or 20 years ago in the
Southwest, the idea of women moving out of the parental household
and living alone was unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
   GOLDIN: But women did move out of the parental household, and
their stories gave rise to the literature of Dreiser and O. Henry.
They wrote about the young women who moved off the farm into the
boarding houses that filled New York City and Chicago. Carroll
Wright, the great early-20th-century labor statistician, studied
the young women who lived alone and worked in manufacturing and
who, to him, faced an increased risk of becoming prostitutes.
</P>
<P>
   JACQUELINE JONES: One of the dramatic changes in the last 100
years is that most white women _ I'm uncomfortable limiting this
discussion to white women _ today believe, and rightly so, that
they'll probably work for wages after marriage.
</P>
<P>
   WILLIAM JULIUS WILSON: Let me shift the focus to black women.
Noncollege black women had very little chance during the first half
of this century to take a job other than as a domestic servant.
After 1960, demand increased for clerical and service workers.
Black women were able to take those positions, so much so that by
1980, only a small percentage of black women were domestic
household servants.
</P>
<P>
   But, ironically, just as blacks and Hispanics started to move
into those clerical positions, changing demand began to reduce
opportunities as bank tellers, typists and so on. Now, folks who
don't have college degrees face a new challenge because the areas
that were opening up are starting to close. Yet it's far better
then it was.
</P>
<P>
   GOLDIN: Let's talk about occupations 100 years ago. You could
hardly find an occupation in which both men and women did the same
job. Many industries excluded women, perhaps because they were
unionized or because they involved work in dirty and hot places
like iron foundries and steel mills, or in disgusting places like
slaughterhouses.
</P>
<P>
   Being part of the labor force was not considered progress for
much of our history. Progress was having enough money to liberate
your wife from the dirty, disgusting work of the factory, so she
didn't have to be at risk of sexual advances and injury. The aim
was not to preserve a patriarchal system but to create a better
family life, a kinder life for women.
</P>
<P>
   WEINSTEIN: Victoria, did you want to say more about family
structure?
</P>
<P>
   DE GRAZIA: A century ago, the role of women's unpaid household
labor in maintaining the family was simply huge. Take into account
the primitive equipment. Consider the difficulties of carrying
provisions from the market. Think of the time involved in cooking,
which meant getting coal or hauling wood.
</P>
<P>
   But even with new equipment, there has still been more ``work
for mother,'' as standards of hygiene and nutrition and the quality
of caring for children have been raised. That suggests the
question: Has there been real progress or only a change in how
women work in the household?
</P>
<P>
   JONES: Can I add a couple of points about changes? One is that
100 years ago, women played very small roles in labor leadership
and in fact, there were very few unions composed of women. Today,
obviously, women are in the forefront of union organizing because
of the shift in the economy and the importance of the service
sector in particular.
</P>
<P>
   Another point is that 100 years ago, modern jobs went only to
whites. The conventional wisdom said African-Americans should not
work machines.
</P>
<P>
   TIENDA: If you just compare white and minority women between
1960 and the early 1970s, the occupational distribution of black
and white women converged. But since 1980, the trend has reversed.
Asian women, with their higher college-completion rates, have
benefited from the increased demand for skilled labor, but black
and Hispanic women have fallen back.
</P>
<P>
   GOLDIN: Many people think that the late 1960s, with the revival
of feminism, was also the beginning of women's increase in
labor-force participation. That is not the case. Among married
women, labor-force participation rates rose 10 percentage points
per decade for each 10-year period from 1940 to 1990. So today, the
rates are over 70 percent for all women age 25 to 64, and a little
over 80 percent for women who have bachelor's degrees, rates that
are rapidly approaching those of men.
</P>
<P>
   JULIET SCHOR: That's misleading. You don't want to give people
the impression that 100 years ago women weren't working. They were
not officially in the labor force.
</P>
<P>
   GOLDIN: Let's go beyond labor-force participation rates and look
at what has happened to earnings. The mantra in the '60s was 59
cents on the dollar _ that was the button many of us wore then,
meaning that for every dollar the average man earned, a woman
earned 59 cents. It stayed that way through the 1970s. Then,
suddenly, it began to zoom so that now, women are earning more like
70 to 75 cents to the male dollar, even 80 to 85 cents when
corrected. For young people with college degrees, there's virtual
parity.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, who's doing the work at home? Here you won't find
numbers that make us feel good. In a 1968 survey, husbands claimed
to work on average 125 hours a year in housework, not including
various child-care tasks. That amounts to a little more than two
hours a week. By 1991, husbands claimed to do more than three times
that amount _ about seven hours a week.
</P>
<P>
   But wives in 1968 did nearly 39 hours per week and in 1991 did
about 25 hours. In other words, there has been some narrowing, but
only some.
</P>
<P>
   The question is: Have women come a long way in the 20th century?
The answer is unequivocally yes. They have enormously narrowed the
gap in labor-force participation rates and in earnings.
Occupational segregation has also decreased and so have hours of
housework, enhancing the ability of college-graduate women, for
example, to do the ultimate _ combine career with family.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there are lots of qualifications. Few women actually
achieve both career and family. Women now become doctors at nearly
the same rate as men, but they become family physicians, not
surgeons.
</P>
<P>
   TIENDA: The progress cited by Claudia has been uneven.
Labor-force participation of Puerto Ricans has actually declined
over a 20-year period. Participation of black women has not kept
pace with whites.
</P>
<P>
   GOLDIN: Yet despite the qualifications, women have come a long
way. They have gained independence, dignity, respect, greater
bargaining power at home, freedom, ability to socialize and have a
life apart from family _ I think that's extraordinarily important _
and of course, the ability to divorce.
 &UR; Women's Consumption: Might or Myth? &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WEINSTEIN: We've been talking exclusively about women at work or
home. But how about their role as consumers?
</P>
<P>
   GOLDIN: A role we love.
</P>
<P>
   WEINSTEIN: Is it not true that the more women earn in their own
right, the more discretionary income they control, the more the
economy will bend toward their needs and tastes? And is consumerism
a trap or a route toward further liberation?
</P>
<P>
   SCHOR: Much of what women used to do was buy for their family.
Mrs. Consumer felt that she, in effect, brought income into the
household by saving money through smart purchasing.
</P>
<P>
   DE GRAZIA: The identification of women with consumption has
been, as in the 19th century, in part metaphoric. Anything fickle
was identified with women, and consumption habits were fickle;
therefore, women were consumers. Then, as families' disposable
income rose, advertising and other media exaggerated the sexual
division of roles: Men were producers, women consumers. The image
that consumption is natural to women has, rightly, been very much
contested by feminists.
</P>
<P>
   JONES: I think all this talk about women as consumers loses
sight of the fact that about 14 percent of households are poor. In
Boston, the self-sufficiency index for a single head of household
and two kids is nearly $40,000 a year, about three times the
official poverty level. Yes, she has enough money to buy cosmetics,
but not enough to fit the stereotype of women who wield a great
deal of economic power. She's buying the necessities for her
family.
</P>
<P>
   DE GRAZIA: The question comes down to whether massively
increased private consumption gives women choices, whether it
empowers women in particular. That would be to say that consumption
is a mainly female activity, that the more women consume, the more
they make choices, the more power they have to make the economic
world go round.
</P>
<P>
   This argument has to be unpacked. Consumption means many things.
There is social consumption, meaning the significant public
expenditure on goods such as Social Security, education, health
care and other goods that we need to be effective private
consumers. Women have not been able to play a very organized role
in shaping the allocations of government budgets on these kinds of
consumption.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, with the recent attacks on social programs, one can
speak of a lessening of women's role in shaping consumption. As for
private consumption, the realm of discretionary spending of women
in families is really very small. The media highlight the spending
habits of the young, the beautiful and the very rich. The important
point is that there is no sign, statistically, that women have
significant powers when viewed against this entire range of
consumption.
</P>
<P>
   JONES: I find the idea of consumer as an agent of social change
to be oxymoronic. The way consumption is practiced in this country
is a deeply conservative force. I look at mass advertising, the
engine that drives consumption, and the message that comes across
is divisive and mean-spirited: You will look young, you will look
pretty, you will attract a man, you will outdo your neighbor. These
impulses will not lead to radical change, but in fact will keep
people stuck in a past that's based on the power of physical
appearance and the power of gender.
 &UR; Detours on the Mommy Track &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WEINSTEIN: Let's move on to our third question: How has the
economic system accommodated women who want to pursue a career as
they rear their children?
</P>
<P>
   GOLDIN: By my calculations, less than 20 percent of
college-graduate women born between 1944 and 1954 actually achieved
both career and family by their early 40s.
</P>
<P>
   SCHOR: We are at an unusual moment in history, in which the idea
of a nonpatriarchal society _ the idea of equality _ has made
tremendous inroads. The idea that men and women should have
egalitarian marriages and share parenting and housework is a vast
departure. That we are asking these questions indicates a
tremendous revolution in the last 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   WEINSTEIN: Are there groups that the revolution has skipped?
</P>
<P>
   TIENDA: Many immigrant groups. The Latino and Asian populations
are two of the most traditional groups, where the women's movement
still lags behind.
</P>
<P>
   JONES: Here's a good example of the unevenness of development.
Take an upper-middle-class suburban couple, where both the husband
and wife have high levels of education. We find these women worked
when they first got their degrees, and when the kids started to
come, they decided to stay home. The husband becomes the sole
breadwinner.
</P>
<P>
   She's taking care of the house and the kids and she's dependent
on him for the money to run the household, and I think with that
economic dependence comes the real vulnerability. The household
might be at the vanguard in socioeconomic status, but I think in
certain respects, it's very traditional.
</P>
<P>
   WEINSTEIN: Is there a barrier society needs to dismantle, or are
these decisions worked out well within the family?
</P>
<P>
   SCHOR: The major barrier is the structure of jobs. We have not
been able to make good jobs compatible with child-rearing roles.
The labor market is inflexible.
</P>
<P>
   TIENDA: Because we rely on other women to take care of our
children, two women can enter the labor force for every one that
takes on a new job. When women go to work, we buy child-care
services, more takeout food and other services, all of which are
driving economic growth in a profound way. It also means that we
are fueling stratification. But there are real costs, studied by
psychologists, to children who have limited exposure to their
parents.
</P>
<P>
   WILSON: You know, Marta, I was thinking not only about the cost
to children along the lines you're pointing out, but when you look
at the low-income families we are now pushing into labor markets,
there's no basic support. Employers are just waiting to fire them
if they don't show up for work consistently on time.
</P>
<P>
   We don't realize how difficult it is for mothers who do not have
basic child-care support. When their child gets sick and the mother
stays at home to care for the child, the next thing you know, her
job is in jeopardy. This increases stress on the mothers,
threatening their interaction with their kids.
</P>
<P>
   DE GRAZIA: Either our criteria for judging progress are too
narrow or we are too focused on our own culture. If the convergence
of male/female labor-participation rates is the standard, then we
would have to recognize the achievement in the former Soviet bloc,
where women were medical doctors and engineers, not to mention
tractor drivers.
</P>
<P>
   Juliet has written amply on the lack of leisure in the U.S. If
leisure is regarded as a kind of restoration, of community life and
family life, rather than the opportunity to work or spend more,
then we would have to look at European social-democratic
experiences as models. What does it mean to society when child care
is inadequate, as it is in ours? Insofar as we have decent
services, they are privatized and discriminate against women in
lower income classes.
</P>
<P>
   WEINSTEIN: Roll the tape forward 20 to 40 years. Can you imagine
these gender differences disappearing?
</P>
<P>
   JONES: You start in the home where things have not changed that
much. There is still ``women's work.'' And until that whole notion
disappears, until child care and the drudge work are shared equally
by men, all else is secondary. What happens in the home conditions
what women do in the workplace and the constraints they face. We're
not sitting around talking about whether men can combine work and
family.
</P>
<P>
   GOLDIN: The playing field is most unlevel inside the home. Let
me throw this back another generation. It's the young son who
should be taught to wash the dishes and to make his bed and his
sister's bed. He needs to be taught to work in the home and to
treat that work as respectful, dignified and communal. Until that's
done, we will continue to reproduce generations of good men and
women who attempt to go on the same path as equals in the labor
market, yet who diverge when they enter the front door.
</P>
<P>
   WILSON: It seems to me that we should try to talk about
generating ongoing national dialogues. This should become a major
public issue that would be discussed in the media, taken up by the
president and other leaders. That way we can increase our
consciousness as well as our conscience about these things. If we
just lay back and hope some evolutionary process will work itself
out, we could be in the 22nd century before significant changes
take place.
</P>
<P>
   DE GRAZIA: I am skeptical that single families have the power to
socialize their offspring to do away with gender inequality in the
home, much less the workplace. Too many social trends undermine
them.
</P>
<P>
   SCHOR: A big part of women's problem is they entered a male
economy, a male work culture, an economy structured to meet the
situations of men. Until the workplace changes to accommodate the
fact that we are now a society in which men and women participate
full time, we will not achieve the goal of equality.
</P>
<P>
   WILSON: I fight pessimism all the time. But I'm going to be a
little bit optimistic here. I have in mind a coalition: whites,
African-Americans, Hispanics, Asians, Native Americans who will
start to demand a serious national debate on the need for social
and family supports to mute or cushion the effects of economic
changes. We're beginning to see some of that already with
increasing talk of child care.
</P>
<P>
   And there's research to suggest that if you can reduce
child-care costs, it can increase women's labor-force
participation, improve the types of jobs they could get and could
ultimately result in a reduction in gender inequality. So I'm going
to put on my optimistic hat and say I think that the eventual
deveopment of this progressive coalition will have many positive
effects, including reduction of gender inequality.

 WOMEN in FICTION: FIRST PERSON FEMALE  
 For release: May 16 or thereafter  
 By JIM HARRISON  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 c.1999 Jim Harrison  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Why did I think I might be able to write in the voice of a
woman?
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who knows a novelist or poet very well has probably
figured out that they are not dealing with a true intellectual.
</P>
<P>
   Intellectuals have a compulsion to be right and this urge is
inimical to what John Keats called ``negative capability,'' the
capacity a poem or novel must have to keep afloat a thousand
contradictory people and questions in order to create the parallel
universe of art. Rationality, to borrow from Foucault, may be an
inferior level of discourse.
</P>
<P>
   This is a very high-minded thing for me to say, keeping in view
the recent moment when my wonderful mother, who is 84 and of 100
percent Swedish derivation, said, ``You've made quite a living out
of your fibs.''
</P>
<P>
   She and her four sisters grew up on a small, poor farm in
northern Michigan with a rather strong and domineering father.
However, all of the daughters became rather strong and domineering
themselves, with not a weak sister in the lot. God pity the man,
and hopefully He did, who ever tried to pull a fast one on these
women.
</P>
<P>
   At this point I somehow remember that there is a reason I'm not
supposed to call them ladies. They were not averse to having a good
time and neither were their husbands who, though they all fished
and hunted strenuously, would never describe these particular
activities as ``manly.''
</P>
<P>
   That idea seemed to derive from writers of city origin such as
the tortured Hemingway, who, though a very great writer, seemed to
suffer from a prolonged struggle with his manhood. Faulkner was a
bit more nonchalant and colorful on the subject, what with his
lifelong fascination with the ``pelvic mysteries of swamps.''
</P>
<P>
   So I have often wondered about the peculiar female umbrella I
grew up under and what particular effect it had on my work, what
drove me to write in a female voice in most of ``Dalva,'' all of
the novella ``The Woman Lit by Fireflies'' and a large portion of
my most recent novel, ``The Road Home.''
</P>
<P>
   I could always ask the analyst I've been visiting in New York
City for more than 20 years, but I never have. That would be poking
needlessly around the sacred veil of art herself.
</P>
<P>
   The answer is always in the entire story, not a piece of it. As
the Acoma poet Simon Ortiz says, ``There are no truths, only
stories.''
</P>
<P>
   And on a wretchedly therapeutic level there's the idea that my
capability to write as a woman saved me from death by drugs and
booze, in that manliness in our culture can paint you into a corner
where the only thing left to do is eat road kill and bite the moon.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the late '70s the character of Dalva came to me in a
dream. This is not the sort of thing that is fashionable with
literary critics, but then they have their lives and I have mine.
In fact she appeared several times in dreams. At first her voice
was beyond my ability to hear, as if I were indeed deaf or could
hear only the rhythm of modulations, but by strong inference her
dream language seemed to say, ``Listen to me now, I've been waiting
for you a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it takes a culture as slippery and venal as our own to
discount the dream life that was so vital to people for 30,000
years.
</P>
<P>
   Dalva appeared at a time of great emotional stress, after I had
taken a very long nondirectional car trip, fixing on the
particularly unknown state of Nebraska _ a place that had always
fascinated me as a last locale for the collision of our own and
native cultures that ended in South Dakota at Wounded Knee in 1890
but still survives in vital remnants to the extent that if you're
blind to it in our past, you're liable to be blind to it in the
present and future.
</P>
<P>
   My grand historical scheme dissembled in the imaginary life of
this woman, who herself was part Lakota, whose father, grandfather
and great-grandfather had truly lived our history, and she,
finally, no less than they, not as a pawn but as a particularly
vivid human being.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the raw meat on the floor, the mystery, is how to
manage to convincingly enter another's voice. At 19 I was a poor
scholar indeed, but I owned most of the Bollingen volumes of the
collected work of Carl Jung. Rather than study the text I mined it
for my own purposes, though it would be a couple of decades before
I had the wit to use the material.
</P>
<P>
   One very troubling idea was Jung's question of what we have done
with our twin sisters that the culture forces us to abandon at
birth. This is a reduction, but then I'm a novelist and poet, and
I'm talking about fiction, not accuracy. But perhaps in my work in
the voice of a woman, I was trying to revive this ghost that the
culture steals from us.
</P>
<P>
   An additional source was my sometimes casual but lifelong study
of the roots of American Indian culture. This is scarcely an
abstraction in northern Michigan, where the closest reservation is
only a half-dozen miles from our farm and the mixed bloods abound.
Again, this was not a scholarly impulse but a search for fuel, for
answers to our behavior that seemed not to exist in white culture.
</P>
<P>
   A pervasive theme in many native cultures is the freedom of
shape changing, where the man or woman becomes a coyote, a bear, a
wolf, a bird, a flower, tree, creek, rock, wind. This is somewhat
more attractive to a loony young writer than an MBA, much less an
MFA, and I unwittingly traveled these dangerous waters most of my
life. The merest suggestion of emotional limits drives me into a
sodden funk.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Road Home,'' Dalva can say things, simply enough, that
a male character can't, and in areas I can't bear to be voiceless.
Talking about loutish cowboys, one of whom she errantly loved, she
says: ``By the first midnight in a Hardin bar it occurred to me
that these people made Brooklyn Sicilians look like English
gentlemen. There's a terrible illusion that the grandeur of
landscape contributes to grandeur of personality.'' I have too many
cowboy friends to say such a thing, but Dalva was up to it.
</P>
<P>
   I tend to think of art as essentially androgynous and that
gender is a biological rather than a philosophical system. I doubt
that there is an intelligent straight man who hasn't at times
envied the seeming emotional latitude of either women or gay
friends.
</P>
<P>
   On a perhaps comic level for a novelist, once you have decided
to make this emotional latitude your own, you have already
committed your act of hubris. You are way up there on the high
board, and now you will discover if the pool is empty or full.
</P>
<P>
   On an almost absurd level I thought once that since I'm blind in
my left eye, I'm missing half of life _ and if I'm writing only as
a man, I'm cut in half again. Being down to a scant quarter isn't
enough to sustain my life.
</P>
<P>
   The pool appears to have been full, but in literary matters the
jury is out for a great deal longer than writers might wish. Dalva
began her public life rather slowly but is still thriving 10 years
later. Clare, in the novella ``The Woman Lit by Fireflies,'' has
even been included in a feminist anthology.
</P>
<P>
   Clare's situation was scarcely unique though not often noted. A
young woman marries a liberal, high-minded young man. She retains
her ideals but watches his degenerate, deliquesce, until she can no
longer bear it and abruptly leaves.
</P>
<P>
   Dalva's reappearance in my recent ``The Road Home'' did quite
well, especially in France, where the novel first was published and
marked my first appearance on a national best-seller list. I have
no specific ideas on why my work has done this well in France.
</P>
<P>
   Of the hundreds of letters and reviews, there have only been two
real objections to my writing in the voice of a woman.
</P>
<P>
   This surprises me, though I thought that many of the
political-minded might think of me as beneath contempt or
essentially harmless, or that possibly women might prefer stories
to politics, or that a literary novel rarely raises anyone to anger
unless there is unpardonable sexual mayhem.
</P>
<P>
   And maybe I could describe the cages in which my heroines lived
because as a male I unconsciously helped to build these cages.
Dalva was free to be an inordinately strong woman partly because I
have known a number of them, easily as many as the inordinately
strong men I have known. You have to look more closely, because men
have generally defined the terms of strength.
</P>
<P>
   If you can agree with the notion of the twin sister you
abandoned at birth, the almost intolerable problem is access to her
mind. It is here that we deal with aspects of the creative process
that appear decidedly nonrational. If many of the culture's
presumptions about women are wrong, and they are, you must
certainly abandon any habituation and conditioning if you want the
slightest access.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly enough, the first presumption your mind must demolish is
that women lack the latitude of individuality of men. This is not
the less difficult for being so obvious. I suspect that the source
of so much feminine anguish in political and social terms is the
same for anyone who is purposefully misunderstood. From birth to
death someone is always yelling a name in your face that is not
your own.
</P>
<P>
   After ``Dalva,'' ``The Woman Lit by Fireflies'' and ``The Road
Home,'' I'm willing to give up the quest, but then in an interview
I once said that I didn't want to write about ``nifty guys at loose
ends,'' the fodder for so much of our postmodernist fiction.
</P>
<P>
   Men and women alike as writers may wander lonely as a cloud, or
simply scratch their tired ironical behinds, quite unmindful that
the neofascists hope to make us only workers in a theme park for
the convenience of the global economy.
</P>
<P>
   To show how confused the unconscious well out of which a writer
draws material can be, it occurred to me while writing this that
whether it is Clare in ``The Woman Lit by Fireflies'' or Dalva
herself, perhaps I am trying to revive the presence of my beloved
sister, Judith, who died with my father in an auto accident when
she was 19.
</P>
<P>
   We used to talk about Dostoyevsky and Rilke, Modigliani and
Gauguin, while burning red candles and listening to Berlioz. Who
knows? In fiction I try to make life live itself. Judith was an
indomitable young woman, and it is very likely indeed that this
still-living spirit contributes to my efforts, however short they
fall.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the perception of reality in a culture is
consensual, and so it must be if its peculiar civilization is to
function. You have to excuse all the question marks thrown in by
the artists, whether they are poets, painters, composers, novelists
or sculptors.
</P>
<P>
   Their calling from the beginning has been to maintain the
vitality of the human spirit whether by saying no in thunder or
assuming a voice not of their own sex.

 LISTENING to MEN, THEN and NOW  
 For release: May 16 or thereafter  
 By DEBORAH TANNEN  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 c.1999 Deborah Tannen  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A woman and a man meet at the end of the day. He asks how her
day was, and she replies with a long report of what she did, whom
she met, what they said and what that made her think and feel. Then
she eagerly turns to him:
</P>
<P>
   She: How was your day?
</P>
<P>
   He: Same old rat race.
</P>
<P>
   She: Didn't anything happen?
</P>
<P>
   He: Nah, nothing much.
</P>
<P>
   Her disappointment is deepened when that evening they go out to
dinner with friends and suddenly he regales the group with an
amusing account of something that happened at work. She is cut to
the quick, crestfallen at hearing this story as part of an audience
of strangers.
</P>
<P>
   ``How could he have said nothing happened?'' she wonders. ``Why
didn't he tell me this before? What am I? Chopped liver?''
</P>
<P>
   The key to this frustration is that women and men typically have
different ideas about what makes people friends. For many women, as
for girls, talk is the glue of close relationships; your best
friend is the one you tell your secrets to, the one you discuss
your troubles with.
</P>
<P>
   For many men, as for boys, activities are central; your best
friend is the one you do everything with (and the one who will
stick up for you if there is a fight).
</P>
<P>
   As the millennium approaches and commentators examine how our
lives have changed in the last thousand years, I find myself
wondering about the change in relations between the sexes. Clearly
there has been a transformation.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, the woman was deferential, subordinate. Now we are
not trying to be partners in a societal arrangement with a clearly
defined separation of labor, but rather hoping to be each other's
best friends.
</P>
<P>
   Yet at least two aspects of women's and men's relations have
endured _ our differing expectations about the importance of talk
in intimacy, and the tendency of women to take the role of listener
in conversation with men.
</P>
<P>
   In the absence of tape recordings from earlier times, we can
look to conversations in literature. For a glimpse of how a
16th-century couple might have talked to each other, I turned to
Shakespeare _ and my earliest memory of his plays.
</P>
<P>
   When I was at Ditmas Junior High in Brooklyn, my classmates were
all atitter: Our teacher had us reading ``Julius Caesar'' aloud
and, having read ahead, we knew that the next day some poor girl
would have to stand and read a passage in which Brutus' wife uses
the word ``harlot.''
</P>
<P>
   Susan Ehrlich had the bad luck to be chosen, and I can still see
her, tall and brown-haired, reading, ``Portia is Brutus' harlot,
not his wife.''
</P>
<P>
   Revisiting those lines today, what strikes me is how similar the
sentiment is to what I hear from contemporary women. Portia wants
to be Brutus' best friend _ and her idea of what this means is very
similar to ours.
</P>
<P>
   Waking up to discover that her husband has left their bed, she
finds him pacing, and implores him to say what is worrying him.
Like the modern woman who feels that best friends tell each other
secrets, Portia pleads:
</P>
<P>
   Within the bond of marriage, tell me, Brutus,
</P>
<P>
   Is it excepted I should know no secrets
</P>
<P>
   That appertain to you? Am I yourself
</P>
<P>
   But, as it were, in sort or limitation,
</P>
<P>
   To keep with you at meals, comfort your bed,
</P>
<P>
   And talk to you sometimes? Dwell I but in the suburbs
</P>
<P>
   Of your good pleasure? If it be no more,
</P>
<P>
   Portia is Brutus' harlot, not his wife.
</P>
<P>
   A similar sentiment emerges in an even more distant conversation
_ in the Arabian romance of the Bedouin hero Antar, believed to
have been written between 1080 and 1400. In one episode, a
character named al-Minhal, escaping a king he has wronged, comes
upon a ruined castle inhabited by a female demon named Dahiya. She
gives him shelter, feeds him, falls in love with him and wins his
love by her attentions, which include her conversation.
</P>
<P>
   Sounding rather like Portia, Dahiya says: ``I want you to be my
companion and to be my lord, and I will be your wife. Disclose to
me what is in your heart. Do not believe that I will ever let you
go. Open your mind to me for I have need to know your thoughts.''
</P>
<P>
   They are married on the spot and, we are told, ``Long was their
companionship, and they loved each other dearly.''
</P>
<P>
   I am not suggesting that relationships between women and men
were the same then as now. But it's intriguing to think that what
women regard as intimacy, talking about what's on your mind, has
been a common thread right through the millennium.
</P>
<P>
   There's another, related pattern that seems to have endured. It
too is evident in the case of the husband who can't think of
anything to tell his wife but comes up with an amusing story to
entertain a dinner gathering. To her, it's a failure of intimacy:
If we're truly close, I should hear everything first. To him, I
think, the situation of being home with someone he feels close to
does not call for a story performance.
</P>
<P>
   This creates a paradox. Many women were drawn to the men they
fell in love with because the men told captivating stories. After
marriage, the women expect that the closer they get, the more the
men will open up and tell. Instead, to their deep disappointment,
after marriage the men clam up.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, looking at how boys and girls are socialized
provides a key. Boys' groups are hierarchical; low-status boys are
pushed around. One way boys earn and keep status is to hold center
stage by verbal performance _ boasting, telling jokes or recounting
mesmerizing stories. And this seems to work well in winning maidens
as well.
</P>
<P>
   This aspect of storytelling can be seen as far back as
``Beowulf,'' that Anglo-Saxon saga, usually dated to the eighth
century. The hero, a member of a Swedish tribe known as the Geats,
wins the attention of Wealhtheow, queen of Hrothgar, who is serving
beer to a gathering of men:
</P>
<P>
   (ital) Beowulf spoke, the son of Ecgtheow: ``I resolved, when I
set out on the sea, sat down in the sea-boat with my band of men,
that I should altogether fulfill the will of your people or else
fall in slaughter, fast in the foe's grasp. I shall achieve a deed
of manly courage or else have lived to see in the mead-hall my
ending day.'' These words were well-pleasing to the woman, the
boast of the Geat. Gold-adorned, the noble folk-queen went to sit
by her lord.(end ital.)
</P>
<P>
   Boasting, my colleague Catherine Ball tells me, was a customary
male activity in the Anglo-Saxon mead-hall, so it is not surprising
that Wealhtheow was well pleased, even though the exploits Beowulf
boasts of have not yet taken place. (In fact, he sounds a little
like Cassius Clay predicting what he will do to Sonny Liston.)
</P>
<P>
   This scenario _ a woman wooed by a man's boasts of exploits in
battle _ brings us back to Shakespearean icons: Desdemona and
Othello. As Othello tells ``how I did thrive in this fair lady's
love,'' he explains that she became entranced when she heard him
telling ``the story of my life'':
</P>
<P>
   (ital)Wherein I spoke of most disastrous chances:
</P>
<P>
   Of moving accidents by flood and field,
</P>
<P>
   Of hair-breadth scapes i'th' imminent deadly breach;
</P>
<P>
   Of being taken by the insolent foe. ...(end ital)
</P>
<P>
   And so on, until:
</P>
<P>
   (ital)My story being done,
</P>
<P>
   She gave me for my pains a world of kisses. ...
</P>
<P>
   And bad me, if I had a friend that lov'd her,
</P>
<P>
   I should but teach him how to tell my story,
</P>
<P>
   And that would woo her.(end ital)
</P>
<P>
   As we know, he wooed her himself with his own story.
</P>
<P>
   In our era, the tactic of wooing by verbal performance takes a
funny turn. Etiquette books of the '50s instructed young women to
be good listeners if they wanted to win their men, and you need
only look around a restaurant to see many women attentively
listening to talking men.
</P>
<P>
   In place of battle yarns, what I hear, over and over, is that a
woman fell in love because ``he makes me laugh.'' That's why
Michelle Pfeiffer said in 1992 she picked a particular boyfriend,
and why Joanne Woodward fell for Paul Newman.
</P>
<P>
   I don't hear the same explanation from men as to why they fall
in love. What I hear is the corresponding one, as for example when
Woody Allen said of his relationship with Soon-Yi Previn: ``She's a
marvel. And she laughs at all my jokes.''
</P>
<P>
   We seem to have a situation of ``plus ca change.'' Even as
relationships between men and women have changed, our contrasting
expectations about the meaning of closeness still cause confusion
and disappointment. And though the performance has shifted from
heroic tales to amusing entertainment, more often than not the
apportionment of roles has stayed the same: Women are the audience
and men are the show.

   BRIDGEPORT, Conn. _ As long as a member of Congress keeps a
place back home, the exact address is usually of little moment. But
when Rep. Christopher Shays moved 20 miles up Interstate 95 last
week, it was treated as a seismic political event in Fairfield
County.
</P>
<P>
   Shays left a large house in Stamford, a magnet for corporate
headquarters, and bought a snug colonial in Bridgeport, the poorest
part of his district in this richest county in the richest state in
the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Bridgeport is Connecticut's largest city, but no congressman had
lived there in more than 100 years. Shays said the reason for his
move is simple: he needed a lower house payment so he could pay the
tuition bills for his daughter, Jeramy, a freshman at Principia
College in Illinois, his alma mater. But in Bridgeport, his choice
is being treated as proof that a city that barely escaped
bankruptcy in the early 1990s is rebounding.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe now people won't be afraid to come into Bridgeport,''
said Jerry Swatt, a computer programmer and 30-year resident who
believes that his city's long decline is over.
</P>
<P>
   The move is in keeping with the reformist reputation of Shays,
53, a moderate Republican who has led a drive in the House to
change the way campaigns are financed and who agonized publicly
last year over whether to impeach President Clinton. Eventually, he
broke with his party and became one of five Republicans to vote
against impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   All the hubbub about the move is a reminder of the complications
of representing the 4th District, which is mostly composed of
white-collar commuter enclaves but also includes a few fallen
industrial areas. The district includes both New Canaan, with a
median family income of $110,000 a year, and Bridgeport, where that
figure is $33,000.
</P>
<P>
   Many Connecticut politicians see the move as the first step in a
race for governor, which Shays has said he might pursue in 2002 if
Gov. John Rowland, a fellow Republican, does not seek a third term
and if Lt. Gov. Jodi Rell is not interested in succeeding him.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as I've been in politics, I've said I would love to
run for governor, if that works out,'' Shays said. ```If that works
out' is a giant escape clause. I may have that opportunity, but I
love what I'm doing.''
</P>
<P>
   That raises the possibility of a cross-town governor's race,
since a likely Democratic candidate four years from now is
Bridgeport Mayor Joseph Ganim. Asked about his new constituent,
Ganim, 39, said with a smile, ``I've never objected to the idea of
having a governor from Bridgeport.''
</P>
<P>
   Given the symbolic freight carried by Shays' moving van, it
seemed fitting that he wore a Peace Corps T-shirt as he puttered
barefoot amid the boxes in his new $490,000 house, which is about
half the size of the home in Stamford that he sold for $835,000.
</P>
<P>
   Shays jokes that his wife, Betsi, accuses him of choosing
Bridgeport ``to be closer to Home Depot,'' but he said it really is
part of the lifelong curiosity that took them to Fiji with the
Peace Corps.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you can get people to come back into your urban areas
and identify Bridgeport as a positive place, it helps all of us,''
he said. ``I have a community where the wealthiest care about the
poorest. The wealthy in my district don't want the poor to live the
way they're living, but they don't think the solution is government
handouts.'' Instead, he said, they want improved schools and
programs that encourage work.
</P>
<P>
   He recalls that within a few hours one day, he counseled a
prostitute with AIDS at a public housing development in Bridgeport,
then drove to a polo match in Greenwich that was held to raise
money for people with AIDS. He said that in Bridgeport, he meets
children who live two miles from Long Island Sound but have never
seen the water, and children whose parents tell them to hide in the
bathtub to escape gunfire.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best thing I can do for someone in Greenwich is get out of
the way,'' Shays said, sitting on his deck to escape the racket of
the workers sanding the floors inside. ``The urban centers are
where our challenges are and our diversity is, and that diversity
excites me. I believe that Bridgeport is a city on its way back in
a big way, and I'm saying I have a lot of faith in Bridgeport.''
</P>
<P>
   Shays, who lives on a waterfront lot that is among the nicest in
the city, said he has enjoyed seeing ``kids working with their moms
and dads on the front lawn _ they don't have a lot of lawn
service.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he maintains that his move is ``not a gesture _ it's an
investment,'' Shays is not averse to engaging in political theater
to draw attention to his centrist views. During the impeachment
debate, he drew international coverage with a town meeting that
lasted until 2 a.m., and demanded _ and got _ a private audience
with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The motives seem unimportant, though, to Bridgeport's citizens
and officials. At a picnic that Ganim held last week during opening
day for the Bridgeport Bluefish, a minor-league baseball team, even
Democrats said they were excited about the arrival of the Shayses.
``We need the help,'' Councilwoman Lydia Martinez said.
</P>
<P>
   The team, egged on by cheers of ``One fish, two fish, let's go,
Bluefish,'' plays at Harbor Yard, a park that opened last year on
the site of a former valve factory. City officials see Harbor Yard
as the first success in a renaissance that they hope will include a
million-square-foot mall, a hockey rink and a basketball arena.
Now, they've landed a congressman.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to convert him,'' said Councilman Michael Marella.
``Sign him up as a Democrat!''

OUTDOORS: PURSUING THE EVERGLADES' ELUSIVE BABY TARPON 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By STEPHEN C. SAUTNER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   EVERGLADES NATIONAL PARK, Fla. _ Somewhere among the endless
mangrove forests and sawgrass prairies of North America's last
tropical wilderness lies a brackish-water creek filled with baby
tarpon _ fish in the 5- to-30-pound range that have perhaps never
seen a fly. I found this out last year from a fishing guide I met
in the Florida Keys who had returned from a sort of busman's
holiday.
</P>
<P>
   He described the creek as rarely fished and ``just loaded'' with
tarpon, two attributes that quickly placed it high on the
``must-fish'' list. When he explained how it could be reached by
canoe, it grabbed top billing and finally forced my recent trip to
south Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it was Van Campen Heilner's classic story ``The River of
Thrills,'' about fishing in the jungles of Cuba, that had me
convinced that the proper way to catch a tarpon was not from a
bridge or even poling along a flat, but from a tiny boat in a
lonely, mangrove-lined creek. It sounded as pure as fishing for
striped bass in a pounding November surf or casting a tiny dry fly
to rising trout on a Pennsylvania spring creek. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Before I headed into the Everglades, I had spent a few nights
priming myself by wrestling with monster-size tarpon on heavy
spinning tackle from a roaring cut in Marathon Key to the south.
Some of those fish were true brutes of up to 100 pounds, but they
seemed almost phantomlike, jumping in the shadows cast by the
nearby Overseas Highway before easily breaking me off.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with nothing but an eight-weight flyrod and a box of tarpon
streamers, I silently paddled a canoe through a long canal lined by
an impenetrable wall of foliage draped with Spanish moss. From what
the guide told me a year earlier, my destination lay about four
miles ahead. Calls of pig frogs and the squawk of an occasional
heron had replaced the din of highway traffic. Heilner would have
been proud, I thought.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the canal a few tarpon rolled on the surface. I stopped
and briefly cast for them but remained distracted by the lure of
the creek. After all, this was where real fishing guides went on
their days off. I left the fish behind and continued on.
</P>
<P>
   The canal emptied into a bay about a mile wide. Rafts of
wintering coots splashed and chattered noisily on the surface of
the brownish water. I turned left as the guide had said and headed
along the shoreline.
</P>
<P>
   A few hundred yards ahead, a white stake marked the mouth of the
creek, which turned out to be part of the network of canoe trails
that crisscross much of the Everglades. As I paddled closer, the
entrance seemed impossibly small, just a tunnel in the mangroves
not even 10 feet wide. But I glided in anyway, feeling as though
the Everglades had just swallowed me without a trace, canoe and
all.
</P>
<P>
   It was otherworldly in there _ dark, humid, close. Huge orb
weaver spiders hung from webs strung across the aerial roots of
mangroves inches from my head. A lone Louisiana heron seemed to
stare down at me from its perch in disbelief. The creek itself
actually appeared to be getting smaller. It twisted along at
impossible angles, sending the canoe bumping from one bank to the
other. Fly-casting in such a place remained impossible.
</P>
<P>
   Then, the first mosquito arrived, followed by another, then a
few hundred more. And although I'm sure that Heilner, a pioneering
angler who had fished throughout much of the tropics, would have
continued on, I had quickly seen enough. I managed to turn the
canoe around, and somewhat frantically, bushwhacked my way back
into the bay.
</P>
<P>
   Did I take a wrong turn, or had I become the victim of a guide's
joke, played on a nonpaying customer trying to glean a couple of
free tips? If it was a hoax, maybe I could pass it on to another
fisherman, a sort of Everglades-style snipe hunt.
</P>
<P>
   By now I had already made my way back to the mouth of the canal.
Another tarpon rolled in front of me, one of just a handful I had
spotted during the day. Exasperated, I halfheartedly stripped out a
few yards of line, shooting a bright green streamer beneath an
overhanging branch. I stripped twice, felt a hard take and watched
dumbfounded as a tarpon of about 20 pounds threw itself from the
surface, rattling its gills and crashing back into the dark water.
</P>
<P>
   The fish jumped again and again, shining silver and purple
against the dark green of the mangroves. Each time it leapt, I
lowered the rod, giving it slack so it couldn't break the line.
Even though this was the first good-size tarpon I had ever hooked
on a flyrod, I had run the moment through my head so many times
that it all felt well rehearsed.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually the tarpon tired. It rolled on its side next to the
boat staring at me with its huge eye. I reached down to remove the
hook, but the fish would have none of it. It unleashed with a final
crazed leap, throwing the fly back into the canoe.
</P>
<P>
   And although none of this happened on the creek that I had
dreamed about for the past year, for the moment just knowing that
such a place might exist in the vastness of the Everglades seemed
as satisfying as if I had already been there.

INTERPRETATION OF TITLE IX IS SUBJECT OPEN FOR DEBATE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.J., Pa., Fla.)   (bl)  
 By STEVE POPPER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   BLAIRSTOWN, N.J. _ The lights dimmed in the small theater at
Blair Academy on Tuesday night and a video clip began from the
television show, ``20/20.''
</P>
<P>
   In the clip, a discussion of Title IX, the law that was enacted
27 years ago to prevent sexual discrimination in educational or
athletic programs, a coach at Merritt Island (Fla.) High School
detailed some of the maneuvers that had taken place at his school
to be in compliance under the law.
</P>
<P>
   One example, which involved shutting off an electronic
scoreboard for the boys' baseball team because the girls' softball
team didn't have one yet, drew nervous laughter from the crowd in
the theater.
</P>
<P>
   When the lights came up again and discussion evolved at the
gathering, a forum on Title IX, there was little disagreement that
something had gone awry in the interpretation of Title IX. This
consensus was despite the differing constituencies represented by
the panel.
</P>
<P>
   The moderator of the forum was Roger Reina, the president of the
National Wrestling Coaches Association and the head coach at the
University of Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   Reina was joined on the panel by three speakers:
</P>
<P>
   _ Leo Kocher, the board president of the National Coalition for
Athletics Equity, as well as the head wrestling coach at the
University of Chicago and a member of the Joint Task Force to
Protect Wrestling.
</P>
<P>
   _ Ruth Gibbs, the head softball coach at Muhlenberg College in
Allentown, Pa., a founding member of the state tournament for
women's basketball in New Jersey. Gibbs is also a member of the New
Jersey State Interscholastic Athletic Association's transfer
committee to develop rules for female athletes following the
passage of Title IX.
</P>
<P>
   _ T.J. Hartford, the founder and president of Boston Terriers
United for Football, a nonprofit organization aimed at having
football reinstated as a varsity sport at Boston University.
</P>
<P>
   Title IX, which was originally enacted in 1972, added a
three-pronged test for compliance via a 1979 ruling by the
Education Department through the Civil Rights Office. Under this
test, schools have not only added opportunities for women, but in
an effort to move into compliance with the rule, which calls for
proportionality in college athletic programs, have also cut many
men's sports. Reina said that for every female opportunity gained,
3.4 male opportunities are lost, and between 1993 and 1997, 320
National Collegiate Athletic Association men's athletic programs
have been eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Title IX is a great law,'' Reina said. ``It's really an
interpretation and enforcement problem. It's not a law at all. Some
argue that it's a gender quota, which is a violation of federal
law.''
</P>
<P>
   Gibbs added: ``I don't believe there is any reason for programs
to have to be dropped to fill quotas. I don't believe that this law
initially meant that. If we approach this with sheer logic, where
the interest is, the schools should provide opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   Kocher said the problem cannot be solved in legal battles, so
his group is trying to spread the message of what it thinks is an
inequity. He cited as the example of Boston College's decision to
eliminate the men's lacrosse, water polo and wrestling programs,
which each had no scholarships and part-time coaches but were
eliminated to bring the school into compliance with the
proportionality test.
</P>
<P>
   ``The opportunity for females was made by society, not by law,
25 years ago,'' Kocher said. ``Society saw that it was not right. A
law was passed, and now it has been twisted by bureaucrats. It
gives females opportunities by deposing males. Schools are in a
bind, and one way to be proportional is to get rid of male
athletes. That's what's happening, and that's why there is a howl
and scream. Schools are trying to make themselves lawsuit-proof.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody who's looked at the problem closely realizes that the
three-prong test is where the problem lies. People suggest that the
interpretation should be reworked.
</P>
<P>
   ``But they,'' Kocher said, referring to those who think Title IX
need not be reworked, ``have pretty powerful allies _ the National
Organization for Women, the Women's Sports Foundation. The
government doesn't want to be seen as anti-women. Until people are
aware, there is not going to be change.''
</P>
<P>
   Reached at her office, Donna Lopiano, the president of the
Women's Sports Foundation, agreed with the panelists that schools
should not use Title IX as a cover to make budget cuts that slash
programs. But Lopiano said the blame for the problem goes to
schools' unwillingness to make football programs share the budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at the reality of it,'' Lopiano said. ``Starting from a
much bigger budget, men's athletics operating costs grew by 139
percent in the last five years. Women, over the same period, grew
by 89 percent. I think it's absolutely unethical to cut men to
comply with an anti-discrimination law. But to blame that on Title
IX is an absolute smoke screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way that schools can tackle this is to provide
finances, by raising money or reducing expenditures. But look at
the numbers and you see the football monster is growing. You can't
do anything for women or for men's programs like wrestling and
gymnastics that are being cut until you slow down the money that
football spends.''

<P>
   FORT DIX, N.J. _ Selim Berisha sat in a barracks carefully made
safe for old people and children, with pictures of murder running
through his head.
</P>
<P>
   On March 28, a holy day for Muslims, he recalled, the Serb
police and paramilitaries spilled into his neighborhood in
Pristina, the capital of Kosovo. They beat Albanians in the streets
and fired in the air and at houses. As the bullets shattered his
windows, Berisha, a 63-year-old taxi driver, hid in his cellar with
his family and neighbors _ 50 people in all.
</P>
<P>
   In the morning, they found a neighbor who had not made it to
shelter. He lay dead in his yard, his remains set upon by dogs.
``We buried him, and we escaped into the woods,'' Berisha said.
</P>
<P>
   Berisha was among the first Albanians from Kosovo who came to
Fort Dix to begin new lives, separated by thousands of miles, but
little time, from the loss of their homes and their worlds.
</P>
<P>
   In less than a week, Fort Dix has been transformed from an Army
base into a kind of sprawling Ellis Island, gearing up to be the
gateway to America for almost 20,000 Albanian refugees. The
military has named the relief operation Open Arms, and government
agencies have displayed a certain sensitivity to both the refugees
and to public relations.
</P>
<P>
   Almost overnight, swing sets and playhouses sprouted on the
base, and by Friday morning, the smiles of toddlers blossomed like
so many daisies at the playhouse windows. Signs in English and
Albanian lined the walls, one bare room had been turned into a
chapel, and officials made a point of not serving pork to the
Albanians, most of whom are Muslim.
</P>
<P>
   Soldiers were ordered to say ``dining facility'' instead of
``mess hall,'' and to call the place where the Immigration and
Naturalization Service fingerprints and photographs refugees upon
their arrival a ``welcome center.''
</P>
<P>
   Terry Wade, a staff sergeant from Fort Bragg, N.C., who helped
prepare the base, observed: ``We're kind of running this like a
hotel system. Welcome to the HoJo.''
</P>
<P>
   But 4-foot-tall wooden fences have also gone up over the last
week at Fort Dix, for the heart of Ellis Island was always
immigration screening. The fences are guarded by military police,
and the final authority over the refugees lies with the immigration
service.
</P>
<P>
   While the children play gleefully, as if Fort Dix were a
miniature Disneyland, their parents and older siblings remain
shaken by all they have seen and lost.
</P>
<P>
   Ilir Hoxha, a 45-year-old music producer, said he missed the
home he built for his family, a four-room house with two bathrooms
in Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks ago, he was standing by the open door of that house
with his son, Arben, 20, when the Serbian police approached. They
forced Hoxha's wife and teen-age daughters outside and put a gun to
his throat, demanding German marks.
</P>
<P>
   Hoxha said he had none; indeed, he had been out of work for 10
years, since Serbs began choking the Albanian economy and culture.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbian police gave his family ``half a minute to get out,''
he said. Armed police officers stood on both sides of the road. The
family marched 40 minutes to the train station, staring straight
ahead. Asked what might have happened had she looked at the police
as she was climbing onto the train, Hoxha's 17-year-old daughter,
Arbreshe, said only, ``If ...,'' and burst into tears.
</P>
<P>
   The family sat at a picnic table in Doughboy Field at Fort Dix,
historically a place of transformation, where generations of boys
were turned into soldiers. As Hoxha told the family's tale, his
children and his wife, Hysnije, stared at the grass, as if
transfixed. Hoxha worried about a sister who remained behind. ``The
situation there is very dangerous,'' he said. ``They don't have
anything to eat or drink.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoxha has no relatives in the United States, and said the family
had no preference for living in one part of the country over
another. ``New York,'' Arbreshe whispered, and smiled. Her father
said he wanted most to return home, if he could only raise his
family in peace.
</P>
<P>
   The soldiers here appear genuinely touched by the refugees,
charmed by the children and moved by the adults. Early Thursday
morning, some 12 hours after they had completed their 13-hour
journey from Skopje, Macedonia, the refugees were finally getting
to bed after an initial screening by the immigration service and a
greeting from Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   A mother approached Spc &UR; . &LR;  Kenneth Sollano, 22, of Opp, Ala. She
laid her head on folded hands and tried to explain that her little
daughter could not sleep. The soldier handed her a doll, which the
toddler hugged as she finally dozed off.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the uniforms and the lack of freedom to move, the
compound at Fort Dix is far different from the overcrowded tent
camps of Macedonia, where the threat of disease looms and resources
are stretched. Perhaps afraid the scarcity might return, children
at the base cafeteria on Friday afternoon piled trays tall with
soup and heaps of spaghetti and meat, and many slices of bread.
</P>
<P>
   Wade said that some of the refugees did not know how to say
``thank you'' in English but expressed their gratitude in other
ways. ``I gave a little 2-year-old a stuffed toy, and he looked at
me and put his hand over his heart,'' Wade said. Adults, eager to
help, tried to pick up brooms and sweep.
</P>
<P>
   ``It put chills on me,'' Wade said, ``that I could do some good
for these people.''

</P>
<P>
   Mehde Shehu, 39, an Albanian who came here from the Albanian
Assistance Center in the Bronx, said the refugees, many of whom
were farmers, valued self-reliance. ``They should let them work in
the fields there, they would make them beautiful,'' Shehu said. He
had come to Fort Dix to see if he could talk to the refugees, but
was being kept at arm's length by officials after he tried Thursday
to pass a newspaper to a refugee.
</P>
<P>
   Though the plight of the Kosovar Albanians has touched a chord
in many people, so much that a phone line set up in New Jersey to
channel offers of help jammed Thursday night, immigration officials
are controlling access to the refugees.
</P>
<P>
   A day after the refugees arrived, a 14-year-old, Hassan Maliqi,
ventured to the gate to greet reporters and photographers. But
almost immediately, he was shooed back and surrounded by 13
soldiers in uniform, for while the compound is being called a
``village,'' it is really a ``containment area,'' one reserve
officer blurted out.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor of nearby Wrightstown, Jozsef Farago, a refugee from
the Soviet crackdown in Hungary in 1956, wanted to invite the
refugees to a picnic on May 15 to celebrate the centennial of the
Wrightstown Fire Department. He also encouraged families to help
the refugees however they could, perhaps just by inviting a family
over for an afternoon barbecue to show they cared. But the refugees
are not being allowed to leave the grounds, and for the moment,
Farago said, he has been told not to be so helpful.
</P>
<P>
   While here, the refugees are being screened and treated for
medical problems, while the immigration service tries to do
background checks and check for criminal records. They will also be
interviewed by asylum officers, who normally must ascertain that a
refugee indeed faces danger if he were to return to his home
country.
</P>
<P>
   In this instance, noted Carl Rusnok, an immigration service
spokesman from the Philadelphia office, that conclusion appears
obvious at the outset.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the refugees were expected to stay here for about
two weeks, until private nonprofit resettlement agencies find
apartments for them to rent. The agencies are also to help them
assimilate to the United States, enrolling the children in schools
and helping the parents find work.

   SOUTH BRUNSWICK, N.J. _ Last fall, town officials wanted to put
a full-time plainclothes police officer in South Brunswick High
School. The hope was that students would get to know the police a
little better and everyone would be a little safer. But some
seniors objected on principle, and the idea was shelved.
</P>
<P>
   Now there are two full-time officers in South Brunswick High, in
uniform, and their squad cars are parked conspicuously in front. In
this season of concern about school violence, nobody asked the
students about them, or about keeping more school access doors
locked or the new ban on wearing long coats or carrying backpacks
in school between classes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt so badly when I got on the school television and told
the students that times have changed,'' said principal Thomas
Kietrys. ``But the school is completely air-conditioned and there
is no reason to wear coats indoors, and they have lockers for their
books.''
</P>
<P>
   Kietrys' announcement came on a Friday in April, the day after
his school was closed because of a rumor about a bomb. As in so
many similar threats and near-threats that schools have been
getting since the school killings in Littleton, Colo., the police,
aided by bomb-sniffing dogs, discovered no explosives.
</P>
<P>
   But what the scare left behind is the sense, as the principal
said, that times have changed for the worse, even in a place like
South Brunswick, whose new, $51 million postmodern high school sits
in rolling countryside that is rapidly giving way to housing
developments, and looking for all the world like any prosperous,
fast-growing exurban school in California or Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   The students show a kind of hip skepticism about the new rules,
but with an underlying edge of concern. One, Nick Komadis, puts the
school authorities' ban on coats and backpacks down to a fear of
lawsuits, not a concern for safety, and others seem to agree with
him. So now students passing through the halls between classes
carry their books in see-through plastic bags, or _ as a mute
protest, apparently _ in plastic milk crates. The changes, some of
the seniors said, serve only to remind them of the danger.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look out the window right now and I see a cop car, and that
doesn't make me feel safe,'' said Sherine Aboelezz, a senior who is
headed to Rutgers and who plans a career in international law and
diplomacy. ``All the police and all the hall monitors and locked
doors can't stop everything that can happen, because if a person
isn't scared of getting caught by a teacher or the principal, he's
already at a certain level of `I don't care,' where having the
police aren't going to stop him.''
</P>
<P>
   And the backpack rule?
</P>
<P>
   ``Every student is against that rule,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Nick, who is also going to attend Rutgers, said, ``My take on it
is, they wanted to do it all along, and this was a justification.''
Nick has heard that besides banning backpacks, other schools are
making girls carry see-through purses. This brings a murmur of
objections.
</P>
<P>
   ``Girls carry things we don't necessarily want everyone to
see,'' said Stephanie Bergman, who is going to Ohio State, and
wants to be an astronaut.
</P>
<P>
   The seniors have a kind of luxury in their griping that is
missing from Kietrys' view of things. His school is built for 2,200
students and he knows from the district's elementary school
enrollment that it will hit 3,000 in four or five years. Families
are moving into the new housing rising across Ridge Road every day
and into dozens of other subdivisions in the township, bringing
strangers to South Brunswick with each moving van.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are rapidly changing, and that is one of our challenges,''
the principal said. ``We're not a little town where everybody has
known each other for years and years and years, and one of my jobs
right now is to make a big school feel small.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet South Brunswick High, as Kietrys put it, has lost its
innocence about violence, and whatever their disagreements about
the police and backpacks, some of the students sense it, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sooner or later, there's going to be another incident,'' Nick
said. ``Sooner or later it's going to happen, and basically, it's
all about how lucky you are that it doesn't happen where you are.''

DIALLO CASE FOCUSES ON TIME OFFICERS TOOK TO FIRE 41 SHOTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By KEVIN FLYNN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Investigators reviewing the shooting of Amadou Diallo
are focusing increased attention on how long it took the four
police officers involved to fire 41 bullets at him, law enforcement
officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing the duration of the barrage could help determine whether
and to what degree the officers were reckless in firing so many
times at Diallo, an unarmed West African immigrant, in the
vestibule of his Bronx apartment building Feb. 4.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators are trying to enhance the audiotapes of telephone
calls to 911 about the shooting to see if any gunfire can be heard,
one official said. The sound of gunfire in such a phone call, whose
time could be determined, could help prosecutors establish how long
the shooting took.
</P>
<P>
   One caller to 911 has told investigators that she held the phone
toward the street during the incident so the police operator could
hear the shots. She called at 12:41 a.m., about 14 seconds after
the first call to 911 reporting the shooting, officials said. But
gunfire cannot be heard on the tape of the woman's call, and she
never told the operator that she was holding up the phone, one
official said.
</P>
<P>
   The officers, who have been charged with second-degree murder,
have said they thought Diallo was reaching for a weapon when they
confronted him just inside the front door of his building on
Wheeler Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Several people who live nearby have told investigators that they
first heard three shots that night, followed by a short pause, and
then a volley of gunfire as all the officers apparently began
shooting. Two of the officers fired 16 times. One shot four times
and a fourth fired five bullets. A total of 19 of those bullets
struck Diallo.
</P>
<P>
   The 9-mm weapons used by the officers can fire 16 rounds in 5 to
10 seconds, according to firearms experts. The officers' lawyers
maintain the shooting was lightning-quick: that the officers had no
time to catch themselves after at least one mistook Diallo's black
wallet for a gun.
</P>
<P>
   The Bronx district attorney's case is based on the theory that
the officers clearly had the time and the opportunity to recognize
their mistake before firing some of the shots.
</P>
<P>
   A central dispute in the case, which may have some bearing on
the duration of the shooting, has been over the officers' assertion
that Diallo continued to stand even after being hit by 19 bullets.
One lawyer acknowledged this week that a shot might have struck
Diallo as he was falling.
</P>
<P>
   The Diallo family's lawyers have dismissed the officers'
version, pointing to an autopsy by their own pathologist that
indicates Diallo was knocked down and paralyzed quite early in the
barrage by a shot that ruptured his aorta and perforated his spine.
They have argued that, based on bullet trajectories, at least two
shots were fired after Diallo fell, including one that went through
the sole of Diallo's right sneaker.
</P>
<P>
   Several forensic experts said that the shorter the time span of
the shooting, the less contradictory these versions become.
</P>
<P>
   If the shooting truly occurred in a matter of seconds, then even
if one of the first bullets caused him to fall, many others might
have struck him simultaneously or as he fell, an event that often
takes as long as two seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both versions could be right,'' said Dr. Henry Lee, a
prominent forensic scientist. ``The shooting can be very rapid, and
because it is a dynamic situation, no one can predict what really
can happen'' under such circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   The officers have given only a sketchy account of what happened
that night. Although several people have told investigators they
saw some of the shooting or its aftermath, no one besides the
officers has said they saw everything.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the physical evidence has taken on added
significance. Police investigators and the FBI have painstakingly
collected ballistic evidence and traced bullet trajectories using
lasers and computer models.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, two of the 41 bullets were not recovered until 11
days after the shooting, according to police records. One bullet
was found in a closet in Diallo's apartment after it had pierced a
door and two walls. A second bullet was found in the frame of the
building's front door, not far from where other bullets were
recovered.
</P>
<P>
   Several forensic experts said the delay in recovery was trivial,
but Marvyn Kornberg, a lawyer for one of the four officers, Sean
Carroll, said it raised questions about the thoroughness of the
evidence-collection process.
</P>
<P>
   Another point in question is how dark it was in the vestibule
when the officers reportedly mistook Diallo's wallet for a gun.
Photographs taken that night show the vestibule was well-lighted by
two fixtures. Neighbors said the lights were routinely on at night.
</P>
<P>
   Another small mystery is whether two holes in the top of the red
ski hat Diallo wore that night were created by bullets. Crime scene
photographs show the hat resting snugly on Diallo's head, but an
autopsy by the city medical examiner found no wounds there.

SOFTWARE CITED IN N.Y. AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL FAILURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Thursday morning's failure of a new air traffic
control computer in Ronkonkoma, N.Y., which delayed thousands of
passengers, was caused by a local software flaw and should have no
effect on a nationwide replacement program, Federal Aviation
Administration officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The new computers, like the old, send flight plans to printers,
so the air traffic controllers will have a paper backup giving
vital information for each plane, including its origin and
destination, in case of radar failure. But the new computers were
not sending messages properly to 4 of the 40 printers at the New
York Air Route Traffic Control Center, and that caused the
computers to stop processing data, said FAA spokesman Eliot
Brenner. Information on the malfunction has been distributed to the
19 other centers where the new equipment is being installed, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA has been planning for several years to replace the old
computers, but has sped the program to finish before the end of the
year, to avoid having to upgrade the old ones. Among the problems
with the old computers is that unless their programming is changed,
they will treat the year 2000 as if it is 1900, and will fail to
insert a leap day on Feb. 29.

REACTION SPLIT ON TIME LIMIT   FOR KILLER'S DEATH SENTENCE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ANDY NEWMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A New Jersey judge's unprecedented _ and largely symbolic _
imposition of a five-year deadline on the state to execute a newly
condemned man drew astonishment from legal experts Saturday, even
among those who oppose the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Some applauded the judge, Reginald Stanton of Superior Court,
for sending a message to higher courts that the appeals process for
death sentences is glacially slow and should be overhauled. But
others said that if the escape clause is upheld, which is unlikely,
it would only make the system less efficient, not more. One of the
defendant's own lawyers said she did not know what to make of the
ruling.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, after a jury in Newton sentenced Thomas J. Koskovich
to death for his role in the 1997 killings of two pizza
deliverymen, Stanton ruled that the sentence must be changed to
life in prison if Koskovich, 21, is not executed within five years.
</P>
<P>
   The judge who has been on the bench since 1975 and is the chief
Superior Court judge for Sussex and Morris Counties, admitted he
had no authority to make such a ruling, since New Jersey law gives
the trial judge no latitude to overturn a jury's death sentence.
But he said he wanted to put the nation's legal system on notice
that delaying executions can amount to cruel and unusual punishment
for people on death row.
</P>
<P>
   David A. Ruhnke, a New Jersey defense lawyer who has tried a
dozen capital cases, said that the years it can take for a
death-penalty case to work its way through the system are not
wasted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suppose he's making a statement on how long it takes to
review death verdicts, but the answer to that is that it should
take a long time,'' Ruhnke said. ``I don't think that putting a
five-year deadline on it is good for Koskovich or is good for
capital jurisprudence itself.''
</P>
<P>
   In making his ruling, Stanton said: ``It may be that we would be
well advised to join most of the civilized countries of the world
in abolishing the death penalty. But if we are to have a death
penalty, then we should have the skill, the courage, and the
decency to carry out the death sentences in a reasonably
expeditious manner.''
</P>
<P>
   In cases around the country, the judge noted, executing a
condemned prisoner takes an average of 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   But James S. Liebman, a professor at Columbia Law School who
specializes in the death penalty and who, like the other experts
interviewed about Stanton's ruling, had never heard of a similar
decision, said that the judge's order, if upheld, would have ``the
perverse effect of aggravating exactly the problems that lead to
delay in the first place.''
</P>
<P>
   Already, he said, prosecutors try to cut corners and withhold
from the defense mitigating evidence that might lead a jury not to
impose a death sentence, or might provide the basis for an appeal
of a death sentence, and already defense lawyers stall as much as
they can after a death sentence is imposed, simply to prolong their
clients' lives.
</P>
<P>
   It would be more effective, Liebman said, for a judge to order
both sides to proceed in good faith. ``An interesting order would
be for the court to say, `State, I want you to agree to turn over
your entire file to the defendant immediately, and defendant, I
want you to agree to file the papers expeditiously,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Pamela Brause, one of Koskovich's state-appointed lawyers, said
she was puzzled by the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't exactly know what we think of it,'' she said. ``It
cuts both ways. In Koskovich's case, if the courts agree that the
judge could do this, it could end up being a huge benefit because
there's no way we could finish this in five years as the system
stands now.''
</P>
<P>
   People sentenced to death in New Jersey have an absolute right
to appeal their cases to the state Supreme Court, a process that
Ms. Brause said takes at least a year. If the verdict is upheld,
the state Supreme Court is then required to review the sentence to
see if it is warranted. If the sentence still stands, the defendant
can appeal to the federal courts.
</P>
<P>
   But if a five-year deadline became the law of the land, Ms.
Brause said, it could lend ammunition to those looking to restrict
the rights of capital defendants.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this policy became adopted then they would start looking to
restrict appeals,'' she said. ``There's people on the other side
who are talking about speeding up the process and they mean speed
up the process and kill people.''
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey has not executed anyone since restoring the death
penalty in 1982, and there are currently 15 prisoners in the state
on death row, including Koskovich.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Curtis, a Yale Law School professor and an expert in
prisoners' rights, said that the judicial system needed more judges
to speak their minds as Stanton has.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think voices of judges coming from below, telling the courts
of appeal and the Supreme Court what they think, is a tremendous
asset to the development of law,'' Curtis said.
</P>
<P>
   He added that one of the most noteworthy things about the
judge's quixotic ruling is that it there did not seem to be much
that prosecutors could do to appeal it for now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing has really happened yet,'' he said. ``They haven't not
executed him within five years. So a court might say, `There hasn't
been a delay amounting to five years. When it happens we'll talk
about it. If you execute him within five years, it's moot.'''

PITCHING-POOR CLUBS LOOK TO LESS-IS-MORE TACTIC
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lou Piniella did not sleep well Friday night. ``When you get
your butt beat, your mind starts working overtime,'' the Seattle
manager said Saturday, referring to the Mariners' 10-1 loss to the
Yankees the night before. ``That Energizer bunny kicks in around
2:30 in the morning. You keep searching for solutions.''
</P>
<P>
   As he lay awake at the Mariners' New York City hotel, Piniella
seized upon an idea: he would try to ease his pitching problems by
eliminating one starter and going with a four-man rotation.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was one of my brainstorms about 4 in the morning,'' he
said, showing no apparent effects of his lack of sleep or abundance
of thinking. ``Now, at 4 in the morning it seemed to work for me.
Whether it works at 7 o'clock at night or 1:30 in the afternoon,
I'm not sure.''
</P>
<P>
   With the lack of decent pitching all around baseball, both at
the back end of the starting rotation and in middle-innings relief,
it is curious that more managers don't adopt the four-man rotation.
Some teams have trouble finding a capable fourth starter, let alone
a fifth, so why not reduce the risk teams take with pitchers who
aren't ready to fill the starting role?
</P>
<P>
   Johnny Oates has done it in Texas. Since the Rangers were in New
York on April 20, Oates has used four starters _ Rick Helling,
Aaron Sele, Mark Clark and Mike Morgan. He doesn't plan to play the
rest of the season with only those four starters, but he'll go as
far as he feels he can.
</P>
<P>
   The only problem for the Rangers has been that they haven't
fared any better with four starters than they did with five in the
first three weeks of the season. With a five-man rotation, they had
a 7-7 record. With four, they had an 8-7 record entering Saturday's
game.
</P>
<P>
   Most teams have the kind of pitching problems the Mariners and
Rangers have had. The Yankees are one of the few who do not. The
Yankees, in fact, have encountered the opposite problem: they have
too many starters.
</P>
<P>
   After Hideki Irabu pitched seven strong innings against the
Mariners on Friday night, the Yankees have to decide whether to use
Irabu or Ramiro Mendoza in the rotation after Roger Clemens returns
from the disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens is eligible to do that Thursday, but indications are he
may take a few extra days to make sure his left hamstring is sound.
If he isn't ready Thursday, Irabu can start that game, giving the
Yankees additional time to make the choice between him and Mendoza.
</P>
<P>
   Piniella can only dream about such a problem. The AL West is
waiting for one of its four teams to establish dominance over the
other three, but no one has enough pitching to stake that claim.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a long year already and we just got started,'' Piniella
said, then, discussing his pitching staff, added: ``We started with
a $16 million pitching payroll and we lost four and a half million.
We're playing with an $11.5 million payroll. Kevin Brown makes $15
million a year himself. Randy Johnson makes $13 million.''
</P>
<P>
   Injuries have knocked out two of the Mariners' veterans for the
season. Butch Henry, who made four starts, has a torn labrum in his
left shoulder, and Mark Leiter, who relieved in only two games, has
a torn rotator cuff.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had Leiter, we would've won two or three more games,''
Piniella said.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners have suffered other key injuries as well. Carlos
Guillen, the rookie second baseman acquired in the Johnson deal
with Houston last July, is lost for the season with a torn knee
ligament, and Alex Rodriguez, the super shortstop, has been out
with torn knee cartilage since the first week of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez's return, which Piniella said may come Friday, will
help immeasurably, but it won't improve the pitching staff, which
is the worst in the league with a 6.37 earned run average, 319 hits
allowed and a .307 opponents' batting average.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're sorting out who can pitch and who can't,'' Piniella
said. ``We're finding out painfully. We've found a few who can
pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   Not enough, obviously. Certainly not enough to enable the staff
to make good on a pledge Stan Williams, the pitching coach, made to
his boss.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Steamer told me coming out of spring training,'' Piniella
said, ``that his goal was to get our ERA under four. I told him
last night if you get it under six, I'll be happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Piniella called Williams into his office in the visiting team's
clubhouse at Yankee Stadium for a meeting about the four-man
rotation idea. They brought in Jeff Fassero and Jamie Moyer, their
two veteran starters, and discussed the plan with them.
</P>
<P>
   When the meeting was over, Piniella pronounced: ``We're going to
try it. We have some days off through the 10th of June, so it makes
it easier.''
</P>
<P>
   Freddy Garcia, Saturday's starter, and Mac Suzuki, who made his
second start Friday night, will join Fassero and Moyer in the
five-week experiment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll plug along,'' Piniella said. ``Or is it plod?''
</P>
<P>
   Then he paused and grinned, an obviously humorous thought
percolating in his fertile brain.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it works,'' he said, ``it might get me manager of the
month.''

COAST TO COAST TO COAST FOR CALICHMAN OF THE REVOLUTION 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   One year ago at this time, life could not have been better for
Dan Calichman. He was the captain of the Los Angeles Galaxy, a
perennial Major League Soccer power, and he loved his teammates and
the surrounding environment.
</P>
<P>
   But that rosy picture changed drastically on May 7, 1998, when
Calichman inadvertently collided with Marcelo Balboa during a game
against the Colorado Rapids, breaking his right leg.
</P>
<P>
   Calichman underwent successful surgery on May 9 at the Kerlin
and Jobe Orthopedic Clinic in Los Angeles. Instead of putting a
cast on his right leg, Ronald Kvitne inserted a rod through the
broken bone. Calichman was able to start his rehabilitation only a
few days later.
</P>
<P>
   ``Breaking your leg is always a serious injury,'' Calichman
said. ``It's not as serious as tearing your ACL, but you have to
mend the bone and rehabilitate the muscles around the break to get
back into game shape.'' He was referring to the anterior cruciate
ligament.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the injury, Calichman had played in eight games
for Los Angeles. The Galaxy finished the 1998 season without
Calichman with a 24-8 record and first place in the league's
Western Conference. The Galaxy was then eliminated in the second
round of the playoffs by the eventual league champion, the Chicago
Fire.
</P>
<P>
   After the season ended, Galaxy coach Octavio Zambrano decided
that Calichman, 31, no longer fit into the team's plans and traded
his stalwart defender to New England for draft picks on Dec. 30.
</P>
<P>
   Calichman, who played in 60 games in his first two seasons with
the team, felt his injury was a convenient excuse for the trade,
noting that Zambrano wanted to start a youth movement in Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, featuring younger players, the Galaxy got off to
a disappointing 2-3 start. Management counseled a win-now
mentality, and on April 22, Zambrano was dismissed although his
career record with the Galaxy was 39-18. The former UCLA coach,
Sigi Schmid, replaced Zambrano.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, New England (2-3) and coach Walter Zenga welcomed
Calichman warmly. And his anticipation grew after the Revolution
acquired two more accomplished veterans, forward Giovanni Savarese
on Jan. 20 and midfielder John Harkes on Feb. 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of talented players here in New England,''
said Calichman, who has started and finished all six games this
season before Saturday night's home game against the Miami Fusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is that there isn't a lot of chemistry right now
between the guys. That takes time to develop. The talent will
always be there, but good chemistry will always equal success.''
</P>
<P>
   Calichman calls Zenga, who played on the Italian national team,
a players' coach. As the Revolution goalie, Zenga is also the
league's first player-coach. ``When I began preparing for this
year, Dan Calichman was one of the players I wanted to have on the
Revolution,'' Zenga said. ``I believe he is one of the best
defenders in the league. He has tremendous experience, is a very
intelligent player and is very important on the field and in the
locker room.''
</P>
<P>
   Calichman was named the MLS defensive player of the year in 1996
by USA Today and believes that good defense leads to better
offense. One need look no further back for proof, Calichman said,
than France's victory in last summer's 1998 World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Although Calichman relished the soccer-savvy fans of Southern
California, mostly adults who have been following the game for a
long time, his own roots are in the East.
</P>
<P>
   At Walt Whitman High School in Huntington Station, N.Y., from
1983-86, Calichman played soccer and lacrosse, basketball. A big
sports fan who rooted for the Mets and Islanders, Calichman closely
followed the old New York Cosmos of the North American Soccer
League, often making the journey to Giants Stadium to watch their
home games. Then as a four-time all-American soccer player at
Williams College from 1986-1990, Calichman had nine goals and eight
assists in his collegiate career.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from college, Calichman went to Japan and was
the first American to play for Mazda F.C., which later became
Hiroshima San Frecce, from 1990-93. He came back to the United
States in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Calichman called playing in Japan, where weekend crowds would
reach 50,000, ``a positive experience because I got to play
professional soccer 11 months out of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   Playing in New England, Calichman is looking forward to planting
seeds for the game's future here.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Massachusetts and the bordering states, there is a lot of
youth playing soccer and that correlates to increased popularity,''
he said. ``New England is always up there in attendance. The crowd
is mostly young kids and their parents.''

IT'S NONE OF YOU BUSINESS WHY TUINEI DIED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
FORT WORTH, Texas _ This autopsy report that's due shortly on Mark
Tuinei _ why do you care?
<TEXT>
<P>
   Or to be more blunt...
</P>
<P>
   Frankly, my dear, it's none of your damn business, or mine.
</P>
<P>
   A grieving wife and grieving family will know the results. And
if they want to privately inform grieving friends, so be it. The
Plano police have a death investigation to complete, making them
obviously the first to know.
</P>
<P>
   But unless the autopsy indicates that a crime might have been
committed by unknown persons, why can't Mark Tuinei rest in peace?
</P>
<P>
   Of course, open-record laws in this state will give the gawkers
and the parasites and the slimy sector of the local media the
opportunity to kick around a dead man. If, that is, the autopsy
shows Tuinei was involved in something he shouldn't have been,
resulting in his own death.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday was one of those days when you wonder whatever happened
to common decency. Tuinei was a public figure, he was found dead
under strange circumstances, so, therefore, it's a large story.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't do any public polls, but it seemed to me many more
people had a powerful lust to learn why Tuinei died instead of a
sadness over the tradegy of a 39-year-old good guy being found
lifeless in the driveway of his Plano home.
</P>
<P>
   Dale Hansen said it right that night on TV:
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why he died. I don't know how he died. And I
don't care. ... I'm one of the lucky ones. I saw Mark Tuinei
live.''
</P>
<P>
   The public worship of jocks around here has long been
documented, and thank goodness for that. It has kept many of us
from ever having to hold a real job.
</P>
<P>
   But on behalf of Tuinei, let it be said he represented as a
player everything an adoring Cowboys fandom should want in its
heroes.
</P>
<P>
   Tuinei was a massive offensive talent who contributed greatly to
the winning of Super Bowls. In his quiet, friendly way, he did so
without an ounce of ego ever showing. In the good times and bad,
Tuinei was always a steady force, durable enough to constantly play
through pain and injuries for 15 long seasons.
</P>
<P>
   In a Valley Ranch locker room that became divided at times,
Tuinei was always a bridge to all groups. He was the most popular
player among teammates on the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   When image trouble dropped on the franchise like a nuclear bomb,
Tuinei's name was never linked to any of that. But yes, he had been
enrolled at one time in the NFL's substance-abuse program.
Actually, he was one of the original NFL players to be red-flagged.
Something about alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   To Tuinei's credit, however, he not only earned his way off the
substance-abuse list, he became privately known to league officials
as a prime example of how the NFL hoped the program would work. Not
that it always does, as other cases at Valley Ranch keep reminding
us.
</P>
<P>
   Tuinei did freely admit to growing up in Hawaii more street
tough than even football tough. He was kicked off the team at UCLA,
returned to the islands to play for the University of Hawaii and
did a three-month jail term there for assault.
</P>
<P>
   But once he arrived in Dallas as a Cowboys free agent in 1983,
Tuinei attempted to take his life to another level.
</P>
<P>
   What caused Mark Tuinei to die at age 39? Don't know. Like Dale
Hansen, don't care. I just wish there were more like him. I'm just
sorry he's dead.
</P>
<P>
   If that autopsy report brings ``bad'' news, and particularly if
current Cowboys are implicated in any way, some in the media will
rejoice. Hey, it's a hot story. It's another Cowboy-gone-bad
episode. And yes, the image disaster boils over again.
</P>
<P>
   One year after his retirement from the NFL, Tuinei may have
killed himself with whatever he was doing into the wee hours of
Thursday morning. That alone is the sickening tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   But this is not about some fool with a toe ache. Or a key player
caught in an Irving motel room with snort and strippers. Or a key
player crashing his Mercedes into a concrete wall at 80 mph. Or a
key player constantly flunking drug tests.
</P>
<P>
   All of that greatly impacted the Cowboys on the field. This
doesn't, but it's much, much more important. This is about dying
far too young.
</P>
<P>
   If the ``why'' part is important to you, then please leave your
name and number after the beep.
</P>
<P>
   Just so I can tell you again it's none of your damn business.

   (NYT7) OXFORD, England -- May 8, 1999 -- LEMBA-JEWISH-GENES-1,
5-08 -- Dr. David B. Goldstein, a population geneticist at Oxford
University, has been trying to create a better genetic signature of
Jewish populations. Goldstein has found a particular set of genetic
mutations that are strongly associated with the priestly caste, not
so common among lay Jews, and very rare among non-Jewish
populations. ``In studying the priesthood, we happened into this
tool for distinguishing Jewish from non-Jewish populations,'' says
Goldstein. (Jonathan Player/New York Times Photo)

KOSOVO-SERBIA, 5-08 -- In Velika Dobranja, an ethnic Albanian
village in Kosovo, Mehmet Llugiqi, 36, and his sister-in-law Minire
brought chairs for visitors. ``No one has bothered us here,'' says
Llugiqi. ``But we don't know what will happen tomorrow.'' Velika
Dobranja is a purely Albanian village set in the Kosovo plains, a
majority-Serb town. A number of the Albanians here speak Serbian,

TOP-RANKED KAFELNIKOV TAKES A BREAK FROM THE STRESS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is not much reason to pity the best men's professional
tennis players, for whom the airport lounges and hotel suites begin
to run together in a gilded blur. But last week, an exception could
have been made for Yevgeny Kafelnikov.
</P>
<P>
   His dream had finally become reality. He was No. 1 in the world,
the first Russian to reach that position. But the timing was
rotten.
</P>
<P>
   The computer said he was supposed to be the toughest man to beat
in tennis, but the truth is, he could not win a match.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a double-edged sword,'' said Larry Stefanki, the
Californian who is Kafelnikov's coach. ``As an athlete, you're
stuck in the mode of how you are playing, and so Yevgeny's
overjoyed and excited in one way and quite depressed in the other.
He feels so bad for not playing well, and I'm just trying to get
him to focus on the big picture. To get to No. 1 is an unbelievable
accomplishment. I've had to literally shake him, and say: `Wake up.
Life's too short. Enjoy this moment.'''
</P>
<P>
   Kafelnikov put himself in position to reach the top by winning
the Australian Open, the year's first Grand Slam event. But he has
now lost six matches in a row, and instead of starting his reign
last week as planned on clay at the Super 9 event in Hamburg,
Germany, he withdrew with what officially is a viral infection and
what unofficially is burnout.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel a little bit weak, mentally and physically tired,''
Kafelnikov said after losing in three sets to Richard Fromberg in
his error-riddled opening match at the Czech Open in Prague two
weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's healthy, just mentally fried,'' Stefanki said. ``He
hasn't had a week off since Australia, and after a while, you get
like a mouse on a treadmill.''
</P>
<P>
   That is, of course, not the way Stefanki would have planned it.
Since Kafelnikov became a force on the men's tour in 1994, some of
his advisers have been trying to get him to tame his schedule and
conserve his resources for big events.
</P>
<P>
   But until now, the tall and graceful Russian has done little
more than pay lip service to the concept, and it remains unclear
whether his post-match comments in Prague _ ``I should probably
change my schedule and devote more time to rest'' _ represent a
genuine shift in philosophy or just another despondent jerk of the
knee.
</P>
<P>
   Kafelnikov has long believed that he needed a lot of matches to
be at his best, and though his neocapitalistic instincts have
certainly been a factor, it has not just been about the money. It
has also been about keeping busy for fear of losing his edge.
</P>
<P>
   Stefanki, a relentlessly upbeat sort who began coaching
Kafelnikov this season after helping Marcelo Rios of Chile reach
No. 1 last year, is hopeful but uncertain that his new pupil can
evolve.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yevgeny is just one of those guys who has to reach conclusions
on his own time, to learn by his own mistakes and own decisions,''
Stefanki said. ``It takes him a little bit longer to get a clue. He
just doesn't realize how important it is to have the desire and be
a little bit nervous to play instead of just showing up.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Of course, without a surplus of desire, there is no way
Kafelnikov could have made it this far.
</P>
<P>
   Massive change is part of the package in professional tennis,
but while middle-class youths like Pete Sampras and Carlos Moya and
Richard Krajicek have seen their lives altered radically, none had
to negotiate political upheaval before they turned professional.
Kafelnikov did.
</P>
<P>
   His father, Alexander, once played volleyball in the Soviet
First Division for the powerful Red Army club in Moscow, but
Kafelnikov grew up in more mild southern climes in Sochi, a resort
town of several hundred thousand inhabitants on the shores of the
Black Sea where the fishing and tennis are good year-round.
</P>
<P>
   He was raised in a system where talent was identified and
nurtured early by the state, but shortly after turning 17 in 1991,
Kafelnikov was operating in a void. Where once there had been a
stable of national coaches and ample support for training, there
was only uncertainty in the wake of the dissolution of the Soviet
Union.
</P>
<P>
   But Kafelnikov, long considered less promising than his former
Soviet teammate Andrei Medvedev, had two things in his corner
amidst the tumult. First, he had played well enough as a junior to
attract a small amount of seed capital from International
Management Group. Second, he had the support of Anatoly Lepeshin,
the former Soviet junior coach who decided to remain based in
Moscow and cast his lot with Kafelnikov instead of selling his
skills abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Kafelnikov could serve better for a man of his height _ 6 feet 3
inches _ but he returns serve beautifully and is a fluid force from
the baseline, able to read the flight of the ball quickly and
handle the rhythm of a high-velocity ground-stroke exchange as well
as Andre Agassi in his prime.
</P>
<P>
   With Lepeshin's moral and technical support, Kafelnikov quickly
emerged from the satellite and challenger circuits and nearly upset
Sampras in the second round of the Australian Open in 1994. Little
more than two years later, he beat Sampras en route to his first
Grand Slam singles title at the 1996 French Open. He then dropped
back again, but after an emotional year in which he split with
Lepeshin, got married and celebrated the birth of his first child,
he has replaced Sampras as No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble is, he has done it more by default than domination.
Sampras skipped the Australian and has played abysmally of late by
his standards. And though the ATP Tour's soon-to-be-scrapped
ranking system only counts a player's 14 best results during a
year, it is self-evident Kafelnikov has not had a result worth
counting since February.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sad that people are focusing on that instead of his play
the last 12 months,'' Stefanki said. ``He started the year
tremendously, and I'm just trying to keep him from being gutted by
all this.''

WEAPONS-SUPPLY OFFICE WAS TARGET, ALLIANCE AIDES SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ NATO officials said Saturday they had intended to
strike a Serb weapons-supply office when they accidentally bombed
the Chinese Embassy in Yugoslavia Friday night, killing at least
three people.
</P>
<P>
   NATO Secretary General Javier Solana apologized for the ``tragic
mistake'' but vowed more assaults until Yugoslavia withdraws its
forces from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Major General Walter Jertz, a NATO spokesman, said military
planners believed the embassy building was Yugoslavia's
``directorate for supply and procurement.'' Neither NATO nor US
officials would say how the mistake was made _ or which country
made it _ but one possibility was that planners were working from
outdated maps.
</P>
<P>
   The bombing, the latest of at least seven incidents in which
NATO forces attacked non-combatants, brought new complications to
the diplomatic efforts to find a peaceful ending to the war.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's foreign minister canceled a trip to Britain to discuss
a proposed peace plan. But Russia's Balkans envoy, Viktor
Chernomyrdin, pressed forward with a visit to Germany to discuss
the plan with Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder.
</P>
<P>
   That peace plan, drafted last week by Russia and the Group of
Seven industrialized nations, is considered the best hope at the
moment for ending the war. Chernomyrdin is expected to arrive
Sunday in Belgrade, the Yugoslav capital.
</P>
<P>
   The aid of Russia _ a traditional ally of Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic _ is considered central in negotiating a peace
plan. China has the power to block the G-7 and Russian proposal,
which calls for UN-approved peacekeeping forces in Kosovo. As a
member of the UN Security Council, China can veto that approval.
</P>
<P>
   Western leaders offered condolences to the victims of the
embassy bombings, but vowed to continue NATO's bombing campaign.
</P>
<P>
   NATO chief Javier Solana, at alliance headquarters in Brussels,
offered ``sympathy and condolences'' to the victims of the bombing
and to the Chinese government. ``But I think it's appropriate at
this very moment also to say that NATO will continue to pursue its
goal _ and its goal is none other than to stop ethnic cleansing and
to ensure that Kosovars can return to their homes,'' Solana said.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo is a province of Yugoslavia, but NATO nations have said
Western interference is necessary because of atrocities that
Milosevic's forces have committed against the ethnic Albanians who
live in Kosovo. Milosevic, a Serb, has been trying to force ethnic
Albanians from the province. At the same time, an armed movement of
ethnic Albanians has been trying to restore autonomy to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The bombing came during what NATO officials called the most
intensive raid yet on Belgrade since airstrikes began March 24. In
addition to the Chinese Embassy, NATO warplanes struck a
presidential command bunker and a hotel that is believed to house a
paramilitary group called the Arkan Tigers, which has been accused
of atrocities in Kosovo, Bosnia, and Croatia.
</P>
<P>
   The embassy bombing came just hours after NATO planes struck a
hospital grounds and residential neighborhood in Yugoslavia's
third-largest city, Nis, reportedly killing 15 and injuring 60.
Jertz, the NATO military spokesman, Saturday said that attack had
been aimed at Serbian aircraft parked at the Nis airfield, as well
as air defense systems and support vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once again, of course, civilian casualties were never
intended, and NATO regrets the loss of life and injuries
inflicted,'' Jertz said.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, NATO planes have also struck a passenger train
and have killed people in a residential section of the Aleksinac,
south of Belgrade. A convoy of ethnic Albanian refugees in Kosovo
was also bombed, leaving a reported 64 people dead.
</P>
<P>
   NATO has said it has taken care to avoid killing non-combatants,
but that civilian casualties were always possible. ``There's no
such thing as clean combat,'' Kenneth Bacon, the Pentagon
spokesman, said Saturday. ``We have the best pilots in the world.
We have the best weapons in the world. We have the best-planned
missions. We have the best-trained forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there is no way to avoid collateral damage or unintended
consequences when weapons are employed to solve what might have
been solved diplomatically.''
</P>
<P>
   In other developments Saturday:
</P>
<P>
   -- More than 5,000 refugees arrived in Albania from Kosovo, the
United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees reported. Kosovars
seeking refuge in Albania total more than 407,000, with refugess to
all nations topping 718,000 since March 1998.
</P>
<P>
   -- Ibrahim Rugova, Kosovo's leading ethnic Albanian moderate,
flew to Bonn from Rome to meet with Chernomyrdin before the Russian
envoy heads on to Yugoslavia this morning. Rugova was also to meet
separately with Schroeder and with Carl Bildt, a former Swedish
prime minister who was recently named as UN Secretary General Kofi
Annan's envoy to the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, anger was the primary emotion among the Chinese
community in the United States after the embassy bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Hsueh, host of ``Chinese American Voice'' radio show in
New York, said his lines were flooded with callers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course they are angry about this,'' Hsueh said. ``There
have been too many mistakes, too many errors in this invasion.
People are asking, `Why such a big mistake?' ''

TRANSFERRING   A CO-OP   TO A TRUST
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By JAY ROMANO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Buying a home is one of the most significant
investments of a lifetime. So when homeowners start thinking about
estate planning, a major issue is what will become of that
investment.
</P>
<P>
   While owners of houses and condominiums can usually do whatever
they want with their property, co-op shareholders usually cannot.
</P>
<P>
   One difficult issue facing co-op boards today, lawyers say, is
whether shareholders should be permitted to transfer ownership of
their shares to trusts _ legal entities set up to contain assets.
Such trusts are frequently used in estate planning.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Shenkman, a Manhattan tax lawyer, said there are two
types of trusts that most frequently raise questions for co-ops:
the Qualified Personal Residence Trust, or ``QPRT'' (pronounced
``Cue-pert''), and the revocable living trust.
</P>
<P>
   A Qualified Personal Residence Trust, Shenkman said, makes it
possible to save money on gift and estate taxes by allowing a
homeowner to reduce his estate by transferring a principal
residence and up to one vacation home to a trust for a specified
period of time.
</P>
<P>
   At the term's expiration, he said, the trust transfers the
property to a beneficiary _ typically someone who would have
otherwise ended up with the property by inheriting it.
</P>
<P>
   The savings result because the value of property in a Qualified
Personal Residence Trust is discounted, for tax purposes, to an
amount significantly lower than its market value.
</P>
<P>
   And while the property is still subject to gift and estate
taxes, those taxes are reduced or even eliminated because they are
based on the discounted value assigned to the property at the time
the trust was created and do not reflect any subsequent increase in
value.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Shenkman said, a $1 million property placed in a
15-year Qualified Personal Residence Trust by a 60-year-old
homeowner would be valued for tax purposes at only $275,180, and
would remain at that level even if the value of the property
increased over the 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   The catch with a Qualified Personal Residence Trust, however, is
that the discounted value is applied only if the grantor _ the
person who created the trust _ outlives the term of the trust and
the property is transferred to the trust's beneficiary. If the
grantor dies before the term ends, Shenkman said, the property is
taxed as part of the estate like any other asset.
</P>
<P>
   The benefits of a Qualified Personal Residence Trust are
accompanied by certain risks: a grantor who outlives the trust must
also ensure that the beneficiary will allow him to remain in
occupancy after the beneficiary takes title. With houses and
condominiums, Shenkman said, such risks are the sole concern of the
property owner. With a co-op, however, any risks are the concern of
all shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Siegler, a Manhattan lawyer who specializes in co-ops
and condominiums, said that for several reasons, co-op boards are
skittish about allowing shareholders to transfer their shares to a
QPRT. For example, he said, once the shareholder transfers
ownership of the shares to the trust, it is the trust _ a legal
entity that has no assets other than the shares themselves _ that
is now responsible for paying maintenance fees and abiding by the
proprietary lease.
</P>
<P>
   And if the QPRT is successful _ that is, if the grantor outlives
the trust and the shares pass to the beneficiary _ the co-op
corporation then finds itself with the former shareholder as a
subtenant in the apartment and the shareholder's beneficiary _ who
may or may not be financially acceptable to the co-op _ as the
legal owner of the shares.
</P>
<P>
   The situation gets even murkier if the beneficiary decides he
wants to evict the grantor and occupy the apartment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The decision to permit a trust to own co-op shares and
proprietary leases is a policy decision,'' Siegler said. ``In
recent years, more sophisticated boards have been permitting such
transfers. But some boards have determined that nonindividual
ownership of co-op apartments is inconsistent with the basic co-op
housing principle of owner occupancy.'' Such a determination is
final; if the board says no, the shareholder cannot transfer the
shares.
</P>
<P>
   Saul Simon, a lawyer and financial planner in Edison, N.J., said
that concerns are also raised when a shareholder requests
permission to transfer shares to a revocable living trust.
</P>
<P>
   Such trusts are primarily used to provide people with greater
control over assets in the event of a disability and greater
privacy when assets are transferred upon death. Generally, Simon
said, a revocable living trust is a repository for all of an
individual's assets. When the grantor dies, the assets are
automatically transferred to the beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, Simon said, a revocable living trust is a substitute
for a will. In some cases, he said, it is somewhat easier to deal
with than a will because unlike wills, trusts do not have to be
probated.
</P>
<P>
   And that, he said, can be an advantage for people who want to
keep the contents of their estate private; when a will is probated
it is generally filed in the public record. The transfer of trust
assets, however, can remain confidential.
</P>
<P>
   A living trust may also be useful for people who have
established residence in another state but still own an apartment
in New York. Putting the apartment in a revocable living trust, he
said, will eliminate the necessity for probate in New York if the
only asset in the state is the apartment.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Still, co-op lawyers say, most of the concerns about QPRTs also
apply to revocable living trusts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some co-op boards have a knee-jerk reaction to trusts and say
`no' without even knowing why,'' said Arthur I. Weinstein, a
Manhattan lawyer who is vice chairman of the Council of New York
Cooperatives and Condominiums.
</P>
<P>
   Weinstein said that such reactions are not entirely unwarranted,
that there are indeed concerns that must be addressed before a
co-op can consent to the transfer of shares to a trust of any kind.
Nevertheless, he said, such concerns can usually be adequately
addressed.
</P>
<P>
   For example, he said, one concern with either a revocable living
trust or a QPRT is that a shareholder who has been approved by the
board is asking to transfer his shares and proprietary lease to an
entity with no relationship with the board.
</P>
<P>
   And while that difficulty may be surmounted by requiring the
original shareholder to sign a personal guarantee to ensure the
continued payment of maintenance charges, such a guarantee may be a
cause of concern for the board if the original shareholder has
divested himself of all assets by transferring them to a revocable
living trust.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing to do in that situation is to collect a maintenance
escrow in an amount sufficient enough to make the co-op
comfortable,'' Weinstein said, adding that a requirement for a full
year's advance maintenance would not be unreasonable.
</P>
<P>
   It is also necessary for any shareholder who wants to transfer
shares to either kind of trust to sign a new agreement with the
co-op making the shareholder subject to the terms of the
proprietary lease when he becomes the trust's subtenant. The trust
itself must agree, in writing, Weinstein said, that it will not
sublet the apartment to anyone other than the original shareholder.
</P>
<P>
   The co-op should also insist on receiving a legal opinion from
the shareholder's lawyer _ thereby injecting another responsible
party into the process and providing additional protection for the
co-op.
</P>
<P>
   And finally, Weinstein said, the co-op should make the
shareholder responsible for any legal expenses incurred by the
co-op for reviewing the necessary documents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Permission to transfer shares to a trust is often economically
important to a shareholder,'' Weinstein said. ``And while there are
problems that may have to be addressed, those problems are usually
solvable provided the shareholder is willing to cover the cost of
solving them.''

HOLTZ PAYS PRICE FOR ANGELS' INJURIES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Angels manager Terry Collins looked at his roster
Friday night after catcher Matt Walbeck was knocked woozy in a
home-plate collision in the seventh inning.
</P>
<P>
   There were two names on the list, the same two names that were
there to begin the game -- Charlie O'Brien and Tim Unroe. With Tim
Salmon (sprained left wrist) and Randy Velarde (stiff lower back)
unavailable but still on the active roster, Collins' choice of
reserves was limited.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday he did something about it, as the Angels sent reliever
Mike Holtz to triple-A Edmonton and called up infielder Dave
Silvestri. Silvestri, who can play second, third and shortstop, was
hitting .439 (29 for 66) with one homer, seven doubles and 12 RBIs
in 16 games for Edmonton. He began the season playing for Durham,
the Tampa Bay Devil Rays' triple-A club before being released.
</P>
<P>
   Holtz was 1-1 with a 1.42 ERA, but simply had not been getting
enough work lately because the club was carrying 12 pitchers. He
had pitched twice in the past 10 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was surprised a little bit,'' Holtz said of his demotion.
``But you learn in baseball to expect the unexpected. Now I've got
to go there and bust my (rear) to get back. I just need to go
pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``There haven't been too many situations that dictated me being
in there. I don't think it's because I've pitched that poorly.''
</P>
<P>
   Holtz spoke with his wife, Kristie, outside the Angels clubhouse
quietly for about 30 minutes before talking with reporters Saturday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``My main concern is my wife,'' Holtz said. ``She's pregnant
(due in August) and I don't want her worried about things like this
right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins said Silvestri, 31, will start today's game, but he
didn't say at which position.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston Herald seemed to get a little loose with the truth in
its gossip column in Friday's editions. The column said that 25
strippers from ``The Foxy Lady'' -- a club Mo Vaughn visited while
he played in Boston -- would be sitting behind the Angels dugout
for Friday's game.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, there were a few women behind the dugout who held
signs like the one that said: ``Mo, We Miss You. The Foxy Lady.''
</P>
<P>
   The column also said Vaughn would leave after Friday's game with
the women to go to a club called ``The Rack. However, Vaughn left
Fenway Park Friday with family members.
</P>
<P>
   Five weeks into the season and only one Angels starting pitcher
-- Omar Olivares (3-3) -- has more than one victory. Chuck Finley,
Tim Belcher and Steve Sparks each are 1-3; Ken Hill is 1-1. ...
Despite a sub-.500 record, the Angels went into Saturday's game
ranked relatively high in team statistics -- they were No. 6 in
team batting (.272), No. 5 in team pitching (4.62 ERA) and No. 4 in
team fielding (.982).
</P>
<P>
   The Angels and Red Sox play the final game of their three-game
series today at 10:05 a.m. at Fenway Park. Hill (1-1, 3.44 ERA)
will start for Anaheim against Boston's Mark Portugal (2-1, 4.45).

IN THE BEGINNING, IT SEEMED SO SIMPLE ... 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By TRISH HALL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Eventually, it took two and a half years, tens of thousands of
dollars and endless hours of effort. But it started with a very
simple idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to go down the spiral staircase at 3 in the
morning,'' says Greg Frank. He and his wife, Christine
Alloggiamento, live in an Upper West Side duplex condo apartment
whose master bedroom was built some years ago on the top floor of
the building. It is blessed with dazzling light and views, but it
stood alone up there. A trip to the bathroom in the middle of the
night required an encounter with a spiral staircase, a popular
space saver but hardly a comfortable path to traverse in a
somnolent state.
</P>
<P>
   So they decided to build a bathroom next to their bedroom, a
bathroom that would take up part of their wraparound deck. And
since they were going to be building a new structure anyway, they
figured it might as well have great views and a Jacuzzi, the wading
pool of choice for affluent adults.
</P>
<P>
   In the suburbs, it would be considered a basic bath. In the
city, it became a major production. They are both bankers, with
limited experience in design or construction. If they had been
really unlucky, they would have had trouble with their architect,
or their contractor, or both. Fortunately, they found an architect
they liked, John Lee, and hired as their contractor Frank's cousin,
Marion Smit.
</P>
<P>
   Their problems lay elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   In December 1996, they began work. An expediter investigated the
relevant rules, because they needed not only a building permit but
_ because the building is in a historic district _ approval from
the Landmarks Preservation Commission. Their architect drew up a
number of plans, giving them options, and they chose one, a design
that used a curved wall made of glass block to provide both privacy
and light.
</P>
<P>
   Their first effort to gain landmarks approval went nowhere,
because the commission mistakenly thought their building was a
co-op, a situation that would have required the correction of any
violations in the building before their work could proceed. They
reapplied, and after some time were informally rejected, because
their plan was not in keeping with the building. So Lee drew up a
whole new design, this time dropping the curves in favor of
something quieter. The local community board also evaluated the new
plan, with one member disapprovingly comparing their future
bathroom to Disneyland, saying it would look like a glowing candle
on top of the building.
</P>
<P>
   By July 1997, after many phone calls and many visits to the
relevant agencies, they had approval from the community board, the
city and the landmarks commission, and in August, after a delay
necessitated by their contractor's prior commitments, work began.
</P>
<P>
   And began, and began and began. Because ultimately, almost every
object they needed was damaged, shipped incorrectly, installed
incorrectly or shipped late. Not the kind of people to spend money
without paying attention, the couple met continually with the
architect. ``We would have these amazing marathon meetings starting
at 7, eating potato chips and drinking soda,'' said Lee. ``Everyone
was in a coma.''
</P>
<P>
   But most of all, they were trying to make sure they were getting
what they wanted, and what they had paid for.
</P>
<P>
   Take, for instance, the windows. When the windows were
installed, they were all scratched. When Ms. Alloggiamento called
the company, she recalled, ``the person who answered the phone said
the windows always arrive scratched.''
</P>
<P>
   The company kept insisting the windows were fine, and the
ultimate supervisor never seemed to be around. ``I had to march in
there and insist on talking to the guy,'' said Lee. ``I thought he
was hiding in there, and I was right.''
</P>
<P>
   They had to demand more new windows, and then more new windows,
until finally they ended up with their fourth set, and only then
did they have windows that were not scratched, and windows that
opened and closed properly. Of course, in the process of reaching
that goal, the people who were fixing the windows sliced into the
marble on the tub, so that had to be fixed.
</P>
<P>
   Or, take the floor. They wanted slate tiles from Italy. They
didn't anticipate that the boat would take six weeks to get here,
and then have trouble unloading because the correct papers weren't
on board.
</P>
<P>
   When the tiles did make it to the Upper West Side, and the
contractor began putting them down, she couldn't believe what she
was seeing. They were different colors, and different heights. So
they had to wait nearly two more months for another shipment from
Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Or, take the marble-topped Jacuzzi. They went to the trouble to
visit the stoneyard to pick out a large piece of Carrara, and pay a
premium for it, so they would end up with a continuous top with no
visible lines. When it was installed, however, they came home from
work and discovered that they had, instead, a seam. ``We
contemplated taking it out,'' said Frank, ``but fortunately, we
came to our senses.'' Insisting on perfection, he said, would have
meant that ``this would have gone on forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheerful, positive people, Frank and Ms. Alloggiamento don't
want to sound negative about the experience, which had plenty of
other glitches too numerous to detail, including a budget that rose
from $40,000 to $80,000. Construction of their bath was completed
about a year ago, giving them a rooftop aerie that is lovely during
the day and hauntingly beautiful at night. And, a few weeks ago,
they received papers from the city certifying that the plumbing
inspection had been completed, finally putting an end to the long
process.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether they have any advice for those who come after
them, they do put it simply and clearly: Be very specific about
what you want, and no matter how small the detail or the request
may seem, put it in writing.

PATCHWORK ANGELS BAFFLED AGAIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Pedro Martinez is one thing. But Juan Pena?
</P>
<P>
   The Angels offense could be excused for not hitting the Red Sox
ace, who shut them out for eight innings Friday.
</P>
<P>
   But Pena, 21 and making his major-league debut, was just as
effective, holding the Angels to one run and three hits in six
innings in the Red Sox's 6-1 victory Saturday afternoon before
29,385 at Fenway Park.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Angels' third loss in a row, their fourth in five
games on the road trip, and the fifth in the last six overall. They
fell five games under .500 (13-18) for the first time this season.
</P>
<P>
   In their defense, the Angels aren't exactly putting out a lineup
that resembles Murderers Row. Tim Salmon and Randy Velarde are the
latest injury victims, joining Jim Edmonds and Gary DiSarcina on
the sidelines.
</P>
<P>
   In their places are players like Tim Unroe, Jeff Huson and Andy
Sheets.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have guys that are utility players and you're asking them
to pick up the slack for the No. 4 hitter,'' said Salmon, who has a
sprained left wrist and hopes to return this week for the series
against the Yankees in New York. ``The bottom line is if you don't
have the horses, you're not going to win. You can get on guys all
you want, but shoot, it comes down to talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys are the guys we've got. They weren't intended to be
in there for an extended period of time. A perfect example is
Orlando Palmeiro. He's a great fourth or fifth outfielder off the
bench. All of a sudden, he's taking over for me.
</P>
<P>
   ``How much can you sustain? How many injuries can you afford to
have before it shows? I think we've seen it.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past six games, the Angels are hitting .180 (35 for 194)
and have scored nine runs (1.5 per game). Saturday, their only run
scored on a two-out double to right-center by Darin Erstad in the
third inning.
</P>
<P>
   After that, their offense consisted of a single by Matt Walbeck
in the fifth, a single by Mo Vaughn in the sixth and a single by
Unroe in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Pena struck out eight and reliever Derek Lowe (second save)
struck out three in three innings. Combined with 17 strikeouts (15
by Martinez, two by Tim Wakefield) in Friday's game, the Angels
have struck out 28 times in two games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm all done using injuries as an excuse,'' said exasperated
Angels manager Terry Collins. ``We've got big-leaguers.
Big-leaguers make adjustments, I don't care who they are. We've got
all the stats in the world of how to hit the other team, we're just
not doing it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what to say. I listen to (hitting coach) Rod
Carew talk about approaches, but he's talking to the wall. We're
striking out eight times a game (actually 9.6 Ks per game on the
trip) _ that's ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   Approached after the game, Carew said: ``I have no comment,
absolutely nothing to say.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have the answers,'' Collins continued. ``We're putting
the best players out there we've got. I don't mean any disrespect
to the other teams' pitchers, but geez, every night we're talking
about how good the other team's pitcher is.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels pitcher Saturday was Tim Belcher (1-3), who managed
to get through the fifth inning, which has given him trouble.
Problem was, he couldn't get out of the sixth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Belcher, who allowed four runs in the sixth, gave up six runs
and 11 hits in 52/3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not a lot new to say,'' said Belcher, who actually
lowered his ERA from 9.96 to 9.89. ``Dig up your notes from five
days ago. It's the same (stuff), you know?''
</P>
<P>
   The big blow in the sixth was Jose Offerman's two-out, two-run
single that turned a 3-1 game into 5-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``With first base open, I thought he'd make pitches that would
get him through that inning,'' Collins said. ``Especially after
having an easy fifth. His strength, confidence and adrenaline were
building up. But he got a ball up.''

DRAFT VS. SCHOOL DAZE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   We are here on the Day of the Mother to evict the mother-in-law
of sports-journalism commandments.
</P>
<P>
   Please hold for the commandment. OK, here's the commandment:
Stay in school!
</P>
<P>
   Commandment update: Stay in school ... unless leaving school can
provide you with more Benjamins than an illegal fireworks stand
below the Mason-Dixon line.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the deal. Demonstrating a bruised morality that's not
available in any store, the career counselors of sports journalism
have begun their annual caterwaul. Basketball players are leaving
college early to begin compensated lab work in the NBA, and our
brothers and sisters don't like it.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball players skip college for much less money every year,
but this exodus doesn't seem to be twisting anyone's conscience.
</P>
<P>
   So why the gnashing of teeth over enterprising basketball
players? Why are high horses being saddled because Duke freshman
Corey Maggette is having trouble choosing between two million NBA
scoots or another season with Mike Krzyzewski? Maggette, for those
of you with poor reception in the cave, is a 6-foot-5 small forward
with shooting-guard aspirations and more athleticism than a stray
cat.
</P>
<P>
   He averaged 10 points for Duke this past season, but wasn't a
starter because he's as raw as Eddie Murphy doing stand-up on
cable. Maggette also invites skepticism with his jump shot, an
unorthodox baby that makes the kid from Chicago look like an
accountant aiming a memo at the wastebasket. But after a year in
the Coach K empire, why does that remain a problem?
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, if he chooses to enter the 1999 NBA Draft (barring
disaster on the personal-tryout tour), Maggette could be chosen
among the top six picks. One explanation is the annual indictment
of the draft pool; this year, the sharpies think the available
talent is weaker than a Dennis Rodman alibi. Another excuse for
Maggette's popularity is that astonishing ability to run fast and
jump high.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he comes out,'' said one league scout who agreed to
surrender anonymity in exchange for the pleasure of immediately
killing us, ``teams picking five or six will be scared to death to
pass him up.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, most NBA talent hounds would prefer having every player
exhaust his college eligibility before entering the draft. That
way, there's less risk, and teams don't have to spend millions
developing a prospect. College coaches can do the dirty work while
their athletic department eats the bill.
</P>
<P>
   However, everyone in pro sports wants an edge, which is swell,
because many athletes are ready to perform at an early age. And it
could be argued that the best place to prepare for an NBA career is
the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   As an example, we give you Kevin Garnett.
</P>
<P>
   You may recall that KG and his shaky high school transcript
completely skipped college. But had he been able to spend three
seasons at Michigan or North Carolina, do you truly believe that in
this, his hypothetical rookie season, Garnett could have led the
Minnesota Timberwolves - after the defections of Tom Gugliotta and
Stephon Marbury - into the post-season?
</P>
<P>
   Do you think two seasons flying on the hyperbole of Dick Vitale
would diminish the ego of 1999 Clippers rookie Kobe Bryant?
</P>
<P>
   If you had the opportunity to be paid $2 million (the going
annual rate, give or take, for the fifth or sixth pick) by leaving
school early, would you turn it down? Remember, you'll never be
able to make up that $2 million loss.
</P>
<P>
   If you answered ``yes'' to any of those questions, we hope you
have to spend the balance of this day with your mother-in-law.
</P>
<P>
   Note: The preceding sermon does not apply to rascals who are
incapable of impressing anyone enough to be drafted.
</P>
<P>
   `Most' wonderful time
</P>
<P>
   The runaway question at this point in the NBA season? The winner
is ``Doesn't Rex Chapman play that photographer in the sitcom `Just
Shoot Me'?'' Finishing second is ``Who in the heck is the MVP?''
</P>
<P>
   Our vote goes to San Antonio's Tim Duncan, because his
shot-blocking presence on defense is superior to Karl Malone's
hack-and-flop technique.
</P>
<P>
   But if we had to nominate one player for future domination, it
would be the aforementioned Garnett. At 7-feet, the 22-year-old KG
had more rebounds, assists, blocks and steals than Malone, while
committing fewer turnovers and scoring just three fewer points per
game. What is missed in the statistical blitz is the versatile
Garnett's competitive fire and ability to defend almost any player
in the league.
</P>
<P>
   However, he must choose a money move in the post, a signature
shot that will hike his field-goal accuracy above the current 46
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Our rookie of the year is Toronto's Vince Carter, who has his
own TV show. You may have heard of ``SportsCenter.''
</P>
<P>
   Guilty of being this season's most-improved player is Houston's
Othella Harrington. Eric Snow deserves mention, but the improvement
has more to do with getting minutes than improving his skills.
</P>
<P>
   The coach of the year is Philly's Larry Brown, but in honor of
Larry tradition, we reserve the right to alter this decision.
</P>
<P>
   Weakly draft update
</P>
<P>
   According to league sources who weren't crossing their fingers,
Rhode Island's Lamar Odom is leaning toward skipping the NBA for
another season of college ball.
</P>
<P>
   Odom, a 6-9 fast-break entrepreneur, could be the first pick
this summer. But his mentor, Jerry DeGregorio, recently was
elevated from assistant to head coach at Rhode Island after Jim
Harrick left for Georgia. Regardless, we'll be stunned if Odom
stays.
</P>
<P>
   According to snitches in the Baron Davis camp, UCLA's sophomore
point guard still is expected to enter this summer's draft (he has
another week to make this claim). Davis' agent decision should be a
slam dunk. Take Arn Tellem and give the points.
</P>
<P>
   Yao Ming, the 18-year-old center from China, may enter the '99
draft, after all. Ming - listed at 7-6, but closer to 7-3,
according to eyewitnesses - has signed with an outfit called
Evergreen Sports. Ever and green. Perfect.
</P>
<P>
   If he makes the move, Ming could be the first legit center
selected.
</P>
<P>
   Shot-clock violations
</P>
<P>
   Unless the Lakers pull the plug on Kurt Rambis, expect Phil
Jackson to follow the less-political path of spiritual adjunct to
presidential candidate and Knicks teammate Bill Bradley. ...
Jackson recently skipped an exploratory meeting with the New Jersey
Nets, who were very impressed with the performance of interim coach
Don Casey. Nets players, by the way, are wild about ``Case.'' ...
If the Utah Jazz manage to win the championship in Salt Lake City,
would it be unlawful to chase whine with champagne?

BATTLE LOOMS OVER HORSE RACING'S FUTURE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRANK C. GIRARDOT  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD -- The new owners of Hollywood Park hope that some
portion of horse racing's future resides on ``The Track of Lakes
and Flowers.''
</P>
<P>
   In a fast-paced world of 24-hour instant sports and
entertainment options, the snail's pace of a day at the track has
become an antiquated relic of simpler times.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, that relic became an harbinger of things to come.
Churchill Downs -- best known for hosting the Kentucky Derby --
said it would purchase Hollywood Park race track and casino, a
237-acre complex, for $140 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
   It could mark the beginning of a battle for domination of the
American horse racing industry that pits the corporate owners of
Hollywood Park against the corporate owners of Santa Anita in
Arcadia. The two companies are locked in a struggle for control of
what some analysts believe will be a $10 billion industry in the
next decade.
</P>
<P>
   If both companies have their way, horse racing in the next
century will be a 24-hour interactive event, featuring in-home
betting on cards from around the world. They believe the changes
will increase profits while bringing excitement and new customers
to an age-old game.
</P>
<P>
   Churchill Downs will add Hollywood Park to its growing roster of
racetracks and off-track betting parlors around the country. Those
tracks include Calder Race Course in Miami and namesake Churchill
Downs in Louisville, Ky. The off-track betting parlors (known as
OTB) are sprinkled throughout the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   But, ownership of Hollywood Park means that Churchill Downs will
be able to supply some 800 racetracks and OTB facilities around the
country with top-quality thoroughbred racing programs for most of
the year, according to Thomas Meeker, the president and Chief
Executive Officer of Churchill Downs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think as we move down the road we hope to create a product
that is much like ESPN is to cable operations,'' Meeker said. ``If
you are an OTB operator in Sheboygan, or wherever it might be, you
will not be able to deliver your simulcast product unless you have
the Churchill Downs simulcast network as part of your package.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's our objective.''
</P>
<P>
   The sale of Hollywood Park completes a cycle on the Southern
California horse racing scene that began with Canadian entrepreneur
Frank Stronach's purchase of Santa Anita for $126 million in
December.
</P>
<P>
   While both groups had bid on the Arcadia track, Stronach won
largely because Churchill Downs couldn't raise enough cash for the
purchase. Thanks to a series of other buys that allowed Churchill
Downs to increase its corporate line of credit from $50 million to
$250 million in a little under a year, Meeker's corporation was
able to outmaneuver and outbid Stronach for the Hollywood Park
property.
</P>
<P>
   Stronach conceded as much in a recent interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wanted too much,'' he said of Hollywood Park. `'I
couldn't see paying that.''
</P>
<P>
   A rumor circulating on the racing scene indicates Stronach is
now interested in purchasing the Gulfstream Park race track in
Hallandale, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Santa Anita Vice President Rick Cowan said there was no
foundation to the rumor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no knowledge of that at all,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   If Stronach were to buy Gulfstream, he would control the two
premier winter horse race meets in the country. Meanwhile,
Churchill Downs would have control of the top spring and early
summer meets -- at Hollywood Park and Churchill Downs.
</P>
<P>
   In the short term it could drive up the price of race tracks
around the country. In the long term it could be the end of smaller
venues that run cheap horses.
</P>
<P>
   None of these machinations is occurring in a vacuum.
</P>
<P>
   Instead this is all going on in the shadow a full-scale effort
by the National Thoroughbred Racing Association to get horse racing
back into the mainstream of American sports. Part of that effort is
linked to the planned July launch of TVG, an interactive betting
network that will start cropping up on cable systems throughout the
country.
</P>
<P>
   TVG will allow anyone with access to cable television and a
telephone to place bets on races from around the country. The money
will be part of the overall mutual pool at any given track.
</P>
<P>
   A similar option is already available in some states on the East
Coast, notably Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   Churchill Downs and Fox Television are providing some financial
muscle for the fledgling TVG network, based in Santa Monica. But
some say that Stronach has already kicked them in the teeth.
Instead of feeding his signal to TVG during the just-concluded
Santa Anita spring meet, Stronach opted to broadcast on the
Internet via youbet.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's our signal to market,'' Cowan said. ``And what we charge
for it is based on supply and demand.''
</P>
<P>
   What happens next?
</P>
<P>
   For Cowan, ``It's a hard question to answer right now,'' he
said. ``We're planning and strategizing for the next steps. We're
lucky to have a visionary like Frank Stronach.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Hollywood Park and Churchill Downs, R.D. Hubbard, who
sold the track and surrounding property, had a prediction.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a lot of changes in racing over the years; you
are going to see a lot more in the near future,'' Hubbard said.
``In my opinion the company that is going to lead the way is going
to be Churchill Downs.''

CLINTON ORDERS JOB RELIEF IN AFTERMATH OF TORNADOES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to update; some material repeats, but substantially new.)  (lh) 
 By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEL CITY, Okla. _ Clearly shaken by the extent of the damage
here from last Monday's tornadoes, President Clinton Saturday
promised the families who had lived in one devastated neighborhood
that the federal government would temporarily hire thousands of
Oklahomans who had lost their jobs in businesses that were
destroyed by the storms.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have to make up these jobs,'' the president said,
standing in what was once the driveway of a flattened brick house
and sweeping out his arm to point out the destruction around him.
``There's a lot of work that needs to be done here.''
</P>
<P>
   The jobs will be on construction crews and relief teams.
</P>
<P>
   Taking a detour from what was scheduled to be a political
fund-raising trip to Texas, Clinton flew over the area in a
military helicopter with Gov. Frank Keating and James Lee Witt,
director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
</P>
<P>
   Then, with several members of Oklahoma's all-Republican
congressional delegation, he walked through a leveled subdivision
of one-story houses in this suburb south of Oklahoma City.
</P>
<P>
   In the driveway of the wreckage at 4212 Angela Drive, where
David and Catrina Haider and their two children had lived, Clinton
told several hundred families that he was familiar with tornado
damage from his years as governor of Arkansas but that Saturday was
a new experience for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the most devastating tornado I've ever seen,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Haiders _ he is a technician for America Online, she works
in a check-processing center _ said they rode out the storm huddled
in a closet as their house collapsed around them.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton told them and their neighbors on Angela Drive that he
hoped they would consider tornado safety when they rebuilt their
houses, and he noted that the law allows part of federal emergency
loan money to be used for this purpose.
</P>
<P>
   ``For goodness sake,'' he said, ``build a safe room in your
house.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he would support money for a national weather
center at the University of Oklahoma, where he hoped research could
be done into how to ``deflate the strength of some of these very
powerful tornadoes before they hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, on the helicopter tour, the president seemed stunned by
the destruction. ``It's frightening,'' he said to Keating. ``It
didn't matter what room you were in. You can't imagine the power of
these things.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton told the governor that when he was growing up in
Arkansas, most houses had storm cellars, but few houses in Del City
have them today. He suggested that perhaps housing codes should
require them.
</P>
<P>
   The tornadoes killed 46 people and injured hundreds more in
Oklahoma and Kansas, with suburban areas around Oklahoma City the
hardest hit. About 12,000 homes were destroyed in the two states.
The list of the missing, which at one time numbered about 100
people, has been narrowed to four, and rescue workers said that
they may never be found.
</P>
<P>
   In his weekly radio address Saturday, Clinton said he had
instructed the Labor Department to spend more than $12 million to
provide temporary jobs for 3,500 men and women whose jobs were lost
in the tornadoes.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll be able to feed their families by rebuilding their
communities,'' the president said.
</P>
<P>
   He also said he would ask Congress for an additional $372
million for the Federal Emergency Management Agency to pay for
disaster relief.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton alluded to the political fault line that he believes
divides Democrats from Republicans, who favor reducing the
influence of government. ``The federal government,'' the president
said, ``has the responsibility to provide individuals with the
tools they need to improve their own lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton flew here from Texas. After returning to Washington
Thursday night from meetings with allies in Europe on the war in
Yugoslavia, he spent Friday at political fund-raising events in
Houston and Austin that were expected to raise a total of $700,000
for the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, he departed from his standard political speech to talk
about the tornadoes in Oklahoma. At a lunch in Houston, where
supporters donated $20,000 per couple, he said:
</P>
<P>
   ``This maybe belongs more in a sermon on Sunday than a political
speech, but the lesson is, no matter how well America does, a
little humility is always in order. We are not in full control. And
we have to be sensitive about this, especially here in this part of
the country. We have to do more to try to prepare ourselves for
these storms, and we have to do more to try to minimize their
impact when they occur.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, at a poolside Mexican dinner at a supporter's home in
Austin, the president brought up the storm again. He said: ``I'm
thinking about what we can do to try to prepare better for the next
one. I'm thinking about what we can do if we know we're going to
grow and expand in areas that have been tornado alleys _ what we
ought to do to build houses that will do a better job of
withstanding them or have quicker escapes to places that will be
safer.''

Some free advice for Rangers' new president 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
FORT WORTH, Texas _ Jim Lites is new to baseball, so before he
fouls everything up, we should give him a short primer on what he
needs to know as the Rangers' president. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's the least we can do. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Attend: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ruben Mateo for Curt Schilling? No. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Doug Melvin knows what he's doing. If he needs your help, he'll
call. He'll also let you know if a new manager is needed. Right
now, definitely not. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Scouting and player development have to be the foundation of the
franchise. Remember, nobody outspends George Steinbrenner.
Baltimore's Peter Angelos tried and failed miserably. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Pick up a geography book. Locate the Dominican Republic and
Venezuela. Plan a short vacation down there to meet some very
important people. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You are against the DH. Got that? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You're allowed to make up your own mind on interleague play and
realignment. But remember, we don't need another round of playoffs.
Think pennant race. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When in doubt, bet the red dot. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ruben Mateo for Kenny Rogers? No. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   No advertisements on uniforms. Baseball does not _ repeat, does
not _ need more revenue. There is plenty of revenue now; it just
needs to be shared more equally among ballclubs. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Spend some time with Astros president Tal Smith. Listen to him.
He has been around. Introduce yourself to Sandy Alderson, Major
League Baseball vice president in charge of baseball operations.
Talk to Pat Gillick, now retired but one of the best general
managers ever. Other owners you should talk to include John Moores
(San Diego), Jerry McMorris (Colorado), Bill DeWitt (St. Louis),
and Andy MacPhail (Cubs). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Don't listen to Angelos, Steinbrenner, Jerry Reinsdorf (White
Sox), Claude Brochu (Montreal), anybody who owns the Mets, or
Rupert Murdoch's errand boys. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Don't panic if you sometimes can't understand what commissioner
Bud Selig is saying. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The grass here occasionally turns brown in the summer. A Zamboni
won't help. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Don't be afraid to take a player to salary arbitration. They
deserve firsthand knowledge of an issue so vital to their union.
Don't worry if you offend them. It's almost impossible not to. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Remember, most players care less about state income tax,
annuities or deferred payments. They just want more money than the
next guy. That's what they mean by market value. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Union chief Don Fehr could care less who you are or what you've
done in hockey. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Don't overlook Maui, Tahiti or the U.S. Virgin Islands as
potential spring-training sites. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Convincing the players to accept a salary cap is hopeless. Stay
off that bandwagon. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If people suggest abolishing the amateur draft, listen to them.
Smart teams will have the upper hand and Major League Baseball will
be forced to spend more money on this country's amateur programs. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   See if you can do something about the service at the Front Row
Grill. It can be infuriatingly slow and erratic. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ruben Mateo for Roger Clemens? No. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
\Nsubheds:Yankees vs. Cuba &QL; 
Several New York Yankees watched the Baltimore Orioles get trounced
by Cubans on Monday and were openly angry at the way they played. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``They embarrassed everyone the way they played,'' pitcher
Mariano Rivera said. ``To get beat like that, it was embarrassing.
I don't even know why they even agreed to the game. I saw
\RAlbert\S Belle, standing there, taking pitches. That's not him.
You could tell the Orioles weren't interested.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There are reports the Yankees want to play the Cubans next year,
and pitcher David Cone is practically begging for it. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I would try to win that game as hard as any game I've ever
played in,'' Cone said. ``I would love to pitch against them.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Said Tino Martinez: ``We obviously have better teams and better
players. But right now, they've got to be thinking they can play at
our level.'' &QL; 
\Nsubheds:Short hops &QL; 
A high-ranking baseball official is supposedly saying Mike
Prentice's $75 million bid to buy the Royals won't pass because the
group has too many investors. That doesn't seem likely. Baseball
would welcome with open arms anybody willing to invest in a
small-market team these days. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After going 1-for-11 in a three-game series against the Mets,
frustrated Giants third baseman Charlie Hayes called Orel
Hershiser, Allen Watson and Masato Yoshii the ``three worst
starters we've faced all year.'' Said Watson, ``He must be the
worst third baseman we've faced.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Seattle's Lou Piniella saw in USA Today the odds were 6-1 he
would be the first manager fired. Said Piniella, ``I opened the
season at 10-1. I lose a couple of veteran pitchers, my odds went
down.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The latest report is the tumor in Braves first baseman Andres
Galarraga's back has been reduced 75 percent. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It is bad enough the Marlins went 2-11 on their recent
homestand. But it's worse that Milwaukee pitcher Scott Karl, after
a 2-0 shutout, said, ``No offense to the Marlins, but if we played
here 162 games, we'd be looking at the postseason.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Twins reliever Rick Aguilera, who has a no-trade clause, has
apparently changed his mind and now says he would be willing to be
traded to the Cubs and be a setup reliever for Rod Beck. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Pirates general manager Cam Bonifay said he won't trade
outfielder Jose Guillen, even though Guillen was demoted to the
minors last month. Bonifay said a number of teams have called. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Bohanon quiets critics &QL; 
with his best start ever &QL; 
 &QL; 
Colorado's Brian Bohanon is 5-1 with a 3.83 earned-run average
after losing to Philadelphia yesterday. Perhaps it should be
pointed out that four of those five victories were on the road, not
at Coors Field. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But Bohanon's start is the first sign that those of us who
criticized the Rockies for giving him $12 million over three years
might be off-base. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Might. Let's not draw any conclusions yet. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He still has never won more than seven games in one season. He
still could have his tenuous confidence take a beating after
extended duty in Coors. However he is pitching quite well. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I had my critics going in, but now hopefully I've shut them
up,'' Bohanon said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hard to believe it's been 12 years since the Rangers made him
their No. 1 draft pick in 1987, one year after doing the same with
Kevin Brown. Makes you want to take another look at Jonathan
Johnson or find out whatever happened to Dan Smith. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bohanon has learned how to pitch. His best fastball is mid-80s
but he knows how to spot his assortment of junk. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Manager Jim Leyland, who pushed for Bohanon over Todd
Stottlemyre, said, ``Hey, we didn't expect him to be 5-0, but we
thought we'd get a good pitcher.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Randy Johnson recorded his 2,400th strikeout Wednesday and passed
Sandy Koufax for ninth place in all-time strikeouts by a
left-handed pitcher. The top ten, left-handed and right-handed. &QL;

HILLARY CLINTON APPEALS FOR GUN CONTROL LOBBYING 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Stepping up the Clinton administration's campaign
against gun violence, Hillary Rodham Clinton used an emotional
White House ceremony Saturday to call on Americans to press
Congress to ``buck the gun lobby'' and pass several gun control
measures.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's event, pegged to Mother's Day, which is Sunday, was
held in the formal East Room of the White House and featured three
parents of children killed or wounded by gunfire. They included Tom
Mauser, whose son Daniel was killed last month in the shooting
rampage in Littleton, Colo. His story of waiting for word about his
son's fate brought Mrs. Clinton nearly to tears as she took the
podium and gravely addressed an audience of other parents who had
lost their children in shootings.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate is to begin debate this week on a number of gun
control measures, some of which mirror proposals offered recently
by President Clinton. ``The senators need to hear from all of us,''
Mrs. Clinton said. She urged voters ``to give them the
encouragement to do what they know is right and to remind them that
there are many, many millions of American voters and citizens who
will stand behind political leaders who are brave enough to buck
the gun lobby, wherever that may take us, so that they will vote
for the measures that we know will save lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton was as careful as her husband has been to say that
there are many causes of violence and that parents need to take
responsibility for their children's behavior. But Mrs. Clinton, who
is considering running for the Senate from New York, where gun
control is popular, has also been more forceful than the president
in directly taking on the powerful gun lobby in the aftermath of
the Littleton killings.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast with her remarks Saturday, for example, the
president, speaking at a fund-raiser in Houston Friday night, said
that while he was pressing for more gun control laws, ``I hope we
can avoid yet another big fight in Washington between the NRA and
others.'' He has said in the past that the association's campaign
against certain lawmakers who supported his gun control measures
had cost Democrats control of the House in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Still, a split between the National Rifle Association and
``others'' _ including its traditional allies _ is looming.
Spokesmen for the American Shooting Sports Council and the National
Shooting Sports Council, which represent gun manufacturers, say
they have agreed in principle to back five of President Clinton's
proposals to clamp down on access to guns, although they are
waiting to see the exact language.
</P>
<P>
   The five proposals would: raise the age limit for possessing a
handgun to 21 from 18, while still allowing exemptions for hunting,
employment and ranching; extend background checks to those who buy
guns at gun shows, provided that the records are eventually
expunged; ban juveniles who are convicted of violent felonies from
ever owning a gun; prosecute parents if they recklessly or
negligently allow a gun to fall into the hands of children who use
it to commit a crime, and expand the government's gun tracing
program, underway in 35 cities, to 75 cities.
</P>
<P>
   The move signals a breach within the powerful firearms community
over tactics as the manufacturers take steps to try to appease
public officials and tamp down the trend among cities to sue gun
makers to recover the medical and social costs of gun violence.
</P>
<P>
   Such a split within the pro-gun community could isolate the
rifle association and help gun opponents portray it as an extremist
organization, although whether it undermines the association's
political hold on lawmakers remains to be seen. The White House
seems to be trying to take advantage of that possible opening,
scheduling a conference on violence for Monday and inviting the gun
makers but not the high-profile officials of the rifle association.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The five proposals emerged from discussions last year between
the gun industry and the U.S. Conference of Mayors. The industry
has been working with several of the mayors, notably Ed Rendell of
Philadelphia, to try to show a good-faith effort to reduce youth
access to firearms. So far, Philadelphia has held off from joining
seven other cities in filing potentially expensive law suits
against the gun manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   After the rampage in Littleton, the largest mass murder in an
American school, Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., called for a White
House summit on youth violence. Robert Ricker, executive director
of the American Shooting Sports Council, wrote to Lieberman saying
his group wanted to participate in such a summit and would support
certain restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton then announced a package of anti-gun measures, many of
which had been advanced by the mayors. In bits and pieces, Ricker
and Robert Delfay, president of the National Shooting Sports
Council, backed some of those proposals, although they, with the
rifle association, still oppose two that the administration
considers vital _ restricting handgun sales to one a month per
person and reinstituting a waiting period before a gun can be
bought.
</P>
<P>
   The White House then set a summit for Monday on youth and
violence. In preparation, Bruce Reed, Clinton's domestic policy
adviser, invited Ricker and Delfay to the White House, and they met
for 90 minutes last Tuesday to discuss the legislative proposals.
Also at the meeting was Paul Jannuzzo, general counsel for Glock
Inc., the pistol maker.
</P>
<P>
   ``For purposes of the Monday meeting, we are concentrating on
just those issues where we have been able to potentially agree,''
Ricker said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Pointedly not invited to Monday's seminar were the figures most
identified with the National Rifle Association _ Charlton Heston,
the association's president, and Wayne LaPierre, executive vice
president. Instead, the White House invited a member of the
association's board, Bill Brewster, a former Republican congressman
from Oklahoma and now a lobbyist in Washington. Reed described
Brewster, who has gone duck hunting with Clinton, as ``an old
friend of the president's.''
</P>
<P>
   The rifle association is planning its own event on Monday to
discuss its legislative agenda. This consists primarily of calling
for better enforcement of existing laws.

RANGERS' JUAN GONZALEZ WOULD LIKE A SHORT PORCH OF HIS OWN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SIMON GONZALEZ 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Let others be like Mike. Juan Gonzalez wants to be like Hank and
Ted.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez joined baseball Hall of Famers Hank Greenberg and Ted
Williams when he won his second American League most valuable
player award last year. Now the Rangers right fielder wants to be
like them in another way. He wants the fences moved in.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez happened to mention, as part of his off-and-on
negotiations for a contract extension, that the deep, 390-foot
power alley in left-center field at The Ballpark in Arlington costs
him home runs. It might make him more inclined to sign an
extension, he said, if the fences were moved in.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's talked to me about that in the past, but I have told him
that I don't think it's going to happen,'' said Tom Schieffer,
former club president who is now a consultant for the team. ``While
I'm sure that Juan loses some home runs in this ballpark, I know
that our pitching staff saves a lot of home runs because they're
caught in the outfield. We really need to help pitching more than
we need to help power hitters.''
</P>
<P>
   So much for being like Hank and Ted.
</P>
<P>
   In 1940, the Boston Red Sox did move the fences in for Williams.
In 1947, the Pittsburgh Pirates did it for Greenberg, too.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, tinkering with the dimensions to suit a particular
player, team or playing style is almost as much a part of baseball
tradition as draping the bunting on Opening Day.
</P>
<P>
   The most famous examples of a team doing it to suit a particular
player involved Williams and Greenberg.
</P>
<P>
   Williams arrived in the majors in 1939 with a smooth, powerful
left-handed swing. He also arrived to find fences that were 332
feet away to the right-field foul pole and 405 feet away in
right-center at Fenway Park.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox shortened the distance for the 1940 season by
building bullpens in front of the fence. The right-field foul pole
was put at 304 and right-center was 382.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were built to help Ted pop some into the bullpen,'' said
Phil Lowry, author of Green Cathedrals, a book about ballparks.
</P>
<P>
   The bullpen area became known as Williamsburg, but it didn't
immediately help its intended beneficiary. Williams actually
dropped from 31 homers in '39 to 23 in '40. However, he hit 37 and
36 the next two seasons and went on to hit 521 home runs in his
Hall of Fame career.
</P>
<P>
   The Pirates tried a similar thing for Greenberg in 1947.
</P>
<P>
   They purchased the right-handed slugger after he hit an American
League-leading 44 homers for the Detroit Tigers in 1946. The
left-field foul pole at Forbes Field was 365 feet from home plate,
so the Pirates erected a short fence constructed of chicken wire in
front of the scoreboard, shortening the distance to 335 feet.
</P>
<P>
   The area was named Greenberg Gardens, but its namesake didn't
take advantage. Greenberg hit just 25 homers _ his lowest total in
a full season in the majors _ and retired after the season.
</P>
<P>
   However, another right-handed slugger thrived. Ralph Kiner led
the National League with 23 homers in '46 and hit 51 in 1947.
</P>
<P>
   Greenberg Gardens became Kiner's Korner, and this time it was an
appropriate name. Kiner led the league in home runs every season
through 1952. Kiner's Korner was dismantled after he was traded to
the Chicago Cubs during the 1953 season.
</P>
<P>
   Sluggers have long benefited from favorable home conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Yankee Stadium, the House that Ruth Built, was built for Babe
Ruth's left-handed power stroke. It opened in 1923 with the
right-field foul pole a mere 295 feet away from home plate, which
is where it stayed throughout his career. It's now at 314 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Fence moving still goes on. Just this year, for instance, Edison
Field became the House Built for Mo.
</P>
<P>
   The fences at the Anaheim Angels home were moved in from 408 to
400 feet in center field, and from 397 to 387 feet in the
left-center power alley. It just so happens that Mo Vaughn, the
club's prize free-agent acquisition, hits a lot of balls to left
center even though he is a left-handed hitter.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn said he didn't ask for the fences to be moved in his
contract negotiations, but it's generally believed to have been a
factor in his decision. The Angels deny it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those alterations are something that was a topic of discussion
throughout last season,'' general manager Bill Bavasi said. ``When
the renovations were taking place, we discussed leaving available
the option of moving the fences forward in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   After the 1997 season, Albert Belle joined Gonzalez in
requesting that fences be moved in.
</P>
<P>
   Belle hit a league-leading 50 homers in 1995 and 48 more in '96,
but when he moved from the Cleveland Indians to the Chicago White
Sox in '97 his long-ball total dropped to 30. In the off-season, he
said Comiskey Park was costing him homers, and said he'd like the
fences moved in. The request was laughed off, and the distances
remain 347 feet to the foul poles and 375 feet to the power alleys,
although the batters' backdrop was changed from blue to black.
</P>
<P>
   Belle's homers were back up to 49 last season, with 29 of them
coming at home, proving that the park wasn't really to blame.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Comiskey is not a hitters' park, unlike the one Belle
plays in now.
</P>
<P>
   In this past off-season, Belle signed with the Baltimore
Orioles, who play at cozy Camden Yards, with a 364-foot power alley
to left-center.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was built to evoke Ebbetts Field, which was a small
ballpark with lots of home runs,'' said Lowry, who was a consultant
when the Orioles designed the park that opened in 1992. ``The
purpose was not to give offense more of a chance. The purpose was
to evoke the old-time style ballparks. Ebbetts Field was a small
ballpark, it was asymmetrical, and that's how we got Camden
Yards.''
</P>
<P>
   The park Belle rose to stardom in, Jacobs Field, was also
designed to be a hitters' park. Opened in 1994, it's dimensions are
325 to the foul poles, 370 to left-center (although a 19-foot-high
wall tends to turn homers into doubles) and 375 feet to
right-center.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was designed with the idea in mind that people like seeing
runs scored and home runs hit,'' said Bob DiBiasio, the Indians'
vice president of public relations. ``We did definitely have that
goal in mind, to have an offensive showing at the ballpark to
generate excitement.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers went the opposite way when The Ballpark opened in
1994. They had a trio of right-handed sluggers in Gonzalez, Jose
Canseco and Dean Palmer, but Schieffer, who oversaw the design,
purposely wanted a deep power alley in left field and a reachable
home-run porch in right.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing we decided was we weren't going to build the
ballpark for any particular player,'' Schieffer said. ``What we
wanted was a ballpark that would be timeless. We wanted it to be
neither a home-run park nor a pitchers' park. We wanted it to be
kind of neutral to the game, and just let the play of the
individuals determine whether it was a home run or a well-pitched
game.''
</P>
<P>
   If Juan wants to be like Ted and Hank, therefore, he'll just
have to keep putting up big numbers _ despite the big ballpark _ to
join them in the Hall of Fame.

GOLF LEGEND BYRON NELSON SHOWS NO SIGNS OF SLOWING DOWN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID A. MARKIEWICZ 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ When some athletes of distinction reach a
certain age, we don't expect to see them in public anymore, or at
least not very often. Their appearances are mostly ceremonial,
owing to their poor health and fatigue, or our own waning interest
in them.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is Byron Nelson. At 87, he not only is active enough
for a man half his age, he is more in demand than ever. That fact
will be seen again this week when his namesake golf tournament, the
32nd GTE Byron Nelson Classic, is held at the Four Seasons Resort
and Club in Las Colinas.
</P>
<P>
   Just consider a recent stretch of commitments Nelson fulfilled
in the weeks before the tournament: There was a trip to Arkansas
where he was inducted into that state's golf hall of fame; a flight
to Los Angeles where he appeared at a charity golf tournament; a
several-days-long, golfing-and-cowboy art event in Kerrville, where
he has a second home; plus numerous corporate golf outings in
between.
</P>
<P>
   The man they call Lord Byron is so popular and so willing to
accommodate this demand for his presence that when he doesn't show
up, people worry and wonder why.
</P>
<P>
   This is a source of some amusement to the man himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a funny thing,'' Nelson said last week while sipping an
orange and cranberry juice in the grill above the TPC course where
his tournament will be played. ``Because of my age, I guess, if I'm
wanted to be somewhere and I'm not, they get in touch with Peggy
\Rhis wife\S and say, `Why, is he all right?' ''
</P>
<P>
   He is.
</P>
<P>
   ``My health, other than my hip problem,'' Nelson says, ``is as
good as it's ever been in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Good enough to shoot his age on the golf course. Good enough to
have fired a 76 last summer at Cottonwood Valley, the other course
used for tournament play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hit some good shots and some like a beginner,'' he says.
``But I still enjoy playing. The problem is that I haven't had the
time to practice or work on my game.''
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to see why. On this day he already has had to deal
with a problem of downed pecan trees at his Roanoke ranch, the
result of the killer storm that blew hardest through Oklahoma. Then
there was this interview and a photo shoot. And, finally, a
corporate golf event at his golf school at the Four Seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fortunately,'' he says, before going out to hit some balls,
``I have good energy.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson has accomplished much in his career, notably his 11
consecutive victories in 1945, his 52 wins on the PGA Tour overall
and his victories at the Masters, the U.S. Open and the PGA.
</P>
<P>
   But it is the tournament named for him in 1968 that means most,
he says. That's mainly because of the involvement of the members of
the Salesmanship Club of Dallas, which sponsors the event and which
donates tournament proceeds to programs that help at-risk youth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has meant more to me, golfwise, than anything,'' he says.
``The thing of it is, this has been going on for 32 years now. And
I've been involved with this very unusual group of people. I've
never heard or known any one of those men \Rin the Salesmanship
Club\S to say or do anything that would hurt anybody.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, I'm proud of my accomplishments. But those are records
made to be broken. What's happened here won't be broken because
it's permanent.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson's tournament has some permanence as a PGA Tour event
thanks to contractual agreements announced earlier this year. The
longevity of the event _ it is now the 12th oldest on the PGA Tour,
if you count its early days as The Dallas Open _ is amazing, and a
tribute to Nelson, especially considering its humble beginnings.
</P>
<P>
   When the event began in the 1940s, ``The tournament was not
successful,'' Nelson recalls. ``It didn't get very much
publicity.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, after the first three tournaments, won by Nelson, Sam
Snead and Ben Hogan, in 1944, 1945 and 1946, there was a 10-year
period in which there was no Dallas Open. The tournament was
revived and played at Oak Cliff until 1968, when the event was
moved to Preston Trail and renamed for Nelson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was flabbergasted,'' Nelson says of when he was told by
tournament managers that he would be the first player to have a
tournament named after him. ``How could I be more honored than
that?''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson says the tournament's facilities, including a plentiful
supply of hotel rooms, nearby restaurants and a nursery, plus easy
airport transportation and a crack volunteer staff, all help
attract top PGA Tour players who, in turn, lure sell-out galleries.
But PGA Tour pros themselves often cite Nelson himself as the
primary reason they come to Irving every May.
</P>
<P>
   They, like members of the Salesmanship Club, call Nelson a
legend and his tournament a legacy.
</P>
<P>
   It is a mantle Nelson wears responsibly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something you think about,'' he says, referring to his
image. ``It makes you realize how careful you have to be, the
things you say and do.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that Nelson doesn't like to have fun with his legend. There
was the time, he recalls, when he sawtwo men observing the
larger-than-life bronze statue of him at the TPC course.
</P>
<P>
   ``I walked up to them and said, `So, do you think that looks
like me?' Well, you never saw two fellas ... it was like they saw a
ghost. Then, they turned around and looked and said, `Yeah, it
does.' '' nn

Spurs realize Minnesota offers daunting challenge during
first-round matchup
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By TERRY BLOUNT &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ As the hottest team in the NBA, the San Antonio
Spurs are expected to use and abuse the Minnesota Timberwolves in a
warm-up series to set up bigger and better things yet to come in
the NBA playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The opening-round series that starts today in the Alamodome
sounds easy enough for the top seed in the Western Conference, but
these pesky Wolves haven't exactly been easy pickings for the Spurs
this season.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota was 2-2 against San Antonio this year. The Spurs
easily defeated the Timberwolves 95-79 at the Alamodome on April
14, but Minnesota's leading scorer Kevin Garnett and point guard
Terrell Brandon did not play in that game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Minnesota is a very athletic team and they're tough,'' said
Spurs forward Tim Duncan. ``We had some problems with them this
season, but most of those games came early. We are playing a lot
better now than we were then.''
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs (37-13) were 1-2 against Minnesota in the first 14
games of the season when San Antonio went 6-8. The Spurs are 31-5
since the slow start.
</P>
<P>
   But this is a different Minnesota team than the Spurs have seen,
starting with Brandon. Stephon Marbury was traded to New Jersey at
midseason, leaving the Wolves in a transition period with Brandon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime you bring in a great player like Terrell, it takes a
while to get the chemistry working,'' said Spurs guard Mario Elie.
``I think they lost a little of their edge when Marbury left
because he worked well with KG.''
</P>
<P>
   But Garnett also has been adjusting to other new players around
him this year. Forward Tom Gugliotti, a major cog in the team's
success last season, signed with Phoenix in the offseason. Joe
Smith is the other starting forward now.
</P>
<P>
   The trio of Garnett, Gugliotti and Marbury led the Wolves to a
45-37 record last season. But the nucleus of Garnett, Smith and
Brandon was learning about each other on the run while the team
finished 25-25 this year in the lockout-shortened season.
</P>
<P>
   The Timberwolves have had their impressive moments, including
two victories over San Antonio when they held Duncan to a total of
18 points. The MVP candidate averaged only 14 points a game against
the Wolves, who often would double-team him with Garnett and Smith.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've been strong against me,'' Duncan said. ``But hopefully
I can pass off and make them pay if they double team me this
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Duncan and center David Robinson have been the best low-post duo
in the league over the last three weeks. Robinson averaged 20.8
points, 13 rebounds and 2.2 blocks when the Spurs won four games
over the last five days of the regular season to earn the No. 1
seed in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich was concerned about how the
grind of the final week would affect his team, but the playoff
schedule gave the Spurs a much-needed three-day rest for the first
time since the abbreviated season began.
</P>
<P>
   ``After going through that final stretch, we were worried we
wouldn't have anything left for the playoffs,'' Popovich said.
``And we will need all our energy in this series because Minnesota
has the hardest-working team in the league. They are constantly
working on the court.''
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs have some new faces this year who understand about the
work-ethic required in the playoffs. Elie, guard Steve Kerr and
forward Jerome Kersey have played in a total of 296 playoff games,
the same amount as the rest of the team combined.
</P>
<P>
   The veteran trio also has done what the other Spurs have not
done by playing and winning in the NBA Finals. Elie was part of
both Houston championships, Kerr played on three of Chicago's title
years, and Kersey was on a Portland team that reached the Finals in
1990 and 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Elie has been the vocal leader all season for the Spurs, a role
he plans to continue in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told the guys, `It just takes 15 more wins and we're the
champions,''' Elie said. ``We're peaking at the right time. The
guys are feeling good about each other and we like our chances.
This is it. Now you start counting them down.'' &QL;

Based on Derby performance, Menifee should win Preakness 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY MOSS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
FORT WORTH, Texas _ Prairie Bayou finished second in the 1993
Kentucky Derby, but those who studied the race carefully knew his
performance deserved an asterisk in the history books. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   He was so clearly the best horse in the Derby that his trainer,
Tom Bohannan, almost had an anxiety attack getting the 3-year-old
gelding up to the Preakness Stakes, where he blew away the
competition in the second leg of racing's Triple Crown. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A relieved Bohannan explained later that he had never felt such
pressure. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew the only way Prairie Bayou could get beat was if I
screwed him up,'' he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Preakness is seldom that easy, but an important key to
handicapping the race at Pimlico Race Course in Baltimore is always
to accurately decipher the two minutes of hysteria known as the
Kentucky Derby. The best horse often doesn't win the Derby because
of pace or traffic problems, but the Preakness can be a more
form-fitting race. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A close study of the Derby is particularly crucial this year
because, at this writing, a dozen of the 19 starters in last
weekend's Derby are being considered for the Preakness. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the 1993 Derby, Prairie Bayou had a 19-horse field to
navigate, too. He started far back in the pack, then streaked
around seven horses on the Churchill Downs stretch turn despite
racing eight-wide. He was fanned 10-wide into the lane to lose all
momentum, yet still doggedly passed seven more horses in the final
quarter-mile to lose by only 21/2 lengths to Sea Hero, who had
benefited from a brilliant ground-saving ride by Jerry Bailey. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the most dramatic example of Derby misfortune
occurred in the centennial running of 1974. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That year, Little Current came away from the gate last in a
record 23-horse field at Churchill Downs. Along the way, the colt
was bounced and squeezed and jostled. Turning into the stretch, he
was in a hopeless position: 17th place and 171/2 lengths behind the
leader. Yet Little Current passed a dozen horses in the last
quarter-mile and wound up only 61/2 lengths behind winner
Cannonade. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Professional race watchers couldn't get enough of Little
Current. He not only won the Preakness convincingly, but he
captured the Belmont Stakes, too. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A similar trip spoiled Risen Star's hopes in the 1988 Derby; he
also rebounded by taking the Preakness and the Belmont. Snow Chief
faded badly after unwisely pressing a torrid pace in the 1986
Derby, and he, too, won in the Preakness. The list of Derby victims
turned Preakness heroes goes on and on. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This year's demolition Derby yielded mishaps, too, although
perhaps not as many as originally believed. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A videotape of the stewards head-on view of the Kentucky Derby
obtained from Churchill Downs shows that eight horses had traffic
trouble of varying degrees during the race, and others were surely
intimidated by the cramped quarters created by a huge field and a
slow pace. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, however, runner-up Menifee wasn't among the
horses in trouble, as originally believed. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Menifee passed a dozen horses in the stretch, despite being
compromised by slow fractions. But footnotes from the original
Daily Racing Form and Equibase chart reported Menifee was ``checked
in traffic on the turn'' and ``raced behind a wall of horses''
entering the stretch, and the head-on replay doesn't justify that
analysis. Menifee resembled Gale Sayers as he darted between and
among rivals through the long stretch. Although jockey Pat Day was
forced to pick his spots carefully and perhaps delay his closing
run, films show that the colt never had his forward progress
disrupted. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the official chart was revised on Thursday, and both
references to Menifee's traffic trouble were deleted. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Charismatic, a neck ahead of Menifee as the long-shot winner of
the Derby, was three-wide around both turns and somehow remained
clear of any bumping and grinding. So did Cat Thief, Prime Timber,
Worldly Manner and Vicar. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The worst Derby trips clearly belonged to General Challenge,
Adonis, Three Ring and First American. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With any good fortune at all, Adonis and First American almost
certainly will turn in better performances in the Preakness.
General Challenge and Three Ring aren't running. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Listening to post-race commentary from Bob Baffert and jockey
Kent Desormeaux, one would have thought the other filly in the
Derby, Excellent Meeting, had been mugged at gunpoint. She did have
a worse trip than Menifee _ she was crowded at the start and had to
wait briefly while crowded again around the stretch turn _ and she
ran commendably to be fifth. But she actually saved ground around
the clubhouse turn, so her trip was hardly a Shakespearean
tragedy. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Got Even, who ran 14th, was sandwiched from both sides
in the bumping around the first turn. But that doesn't qualify as a
nightmarish trip, either. He held his position despite the bumps
and was simply outrun on the backstretch and the second turn. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After perusing the videotape, it appears that Menifee, who
started from post No. 18, was the best horse in the Derby, not
because of a troubled trip, but rather the pace disadvantage he
nearly overcame. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Because the first six furlongs were run in a slow 1 minutes,
12.52 seconds, the Derby's early leaders should have been too fresh
for Menifee to rush past them in the stretch as he did. That makes
his effort a remarkable one. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Unless Menifee is caught in a bad spot in the expected 14-horse
Preakness field, he should join Prairie Bayou, Risen Star and the
other unlucky Derby losers who gained redemption in Baltimore. &QL;

GALARRAGA OPTIMISTIC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ After three months of chemotherapy, Andres
Galarraga's doctors have told him the tumor in his lower back has
been reduced by 75 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta Braves first baseman, diagnosed with lymphoma in
February, is planning to install a batting cage in his West Palm
Beach, Fla., home this week and hopes to join the Braves on a road
trip soon.
</P>
<P>
   But Galarraga faces two more rounds of chemotherapy and there
has been no talk of him making a comeback this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if it's even fair to speculate on that,'' Atlanta
GM John Schuerholz said. ``He's got cancer and is fighting through
the disease. We're delighted for all the good that is happening,
but I haven't even thought about that. We're just going to keep
hoping he continues to win his fight.''
</P>
<P>
   BIG NAMES
</P>
<P>
   Randy Johnson passed Sandy Koufax in career strikeouts during a
5-1 victory over Cincinnati on Wednesday, getting eight to give him
an even 2,400, which is ninth among lefties in major-league
history. Koufax, whose advice helped Johnson get through some hard
times in his early years in Seattle, finished with 2,396. ``He sent
me a real nice letter then,'' said Johnson, who has struck out at
least 10 batters in 106 games. ``He said something to the effect of
congratulations on passing me, but it's going to be a little harder
passing Nolan (Ryan 5,714). Any time you pass people that you
really admire, that's great.''...
</P>
<P>
   Ken Griffey Jr. stopped by Cinergy Field on Tuesday, an off-day
for the Cleveland-bound Mariners, to take batting practice off his
dad and receive some fatherly hitting advice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody knows my swing better than him,'' Junior said. ``I've
been fighting myself a little.... He usually stays in my head. He's
still the dad and I'm still the little kid.''
</P>
<P>
   BIG MONEY BO
</P>
<P>
   Former Dodger Brian Bohanon, who signed a three-year contract
with Colorado, set a club record by starting the season 5-0. And
all five followed Rockies losses. Bohanon was throwing 80-81 mph in
the spring but has increased that to the mid-80s, and is spotting
his assortment of cutters and off-speed junk.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hear guys all the time who get to second base say, `This guy
doesn't have anything,''' Rockies second baseman Mike Lansing said.
``I go, `How come you're 0 for 3, 0 for 4?'''...
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Bonilla returned to the Mets starting lineup for the first
time in eight games Tuesday night and was booed after going 0 for 4
against the Astros and failing to make a sliding catch on Jeff
Bagwell's looping fly ball in the fourth inning. After an
injury-plagued season with the Dodgers and Florida, Bonilla was
expected to be his old self. Between 1993-97, he averaged 28 home
runs and 101 RBI a year. Now, Bonilla is batting seventh, with a
.153 average and just two HRs and nine RBI....
</P>
<P>
   LOOKING UP
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh catcher Jason Kendall went 5 for 5 against San
Francisco without scoring a run or driving one in, just the eighth
time that has happened since 1970 and the first since Atlanta
Braves shortstop Jeff Blauser did it June 10, 1996. The Giants'
Jeff Kent also had five hits, marking the first time two NL players
had five in the same game since June 3, 1988, when the Dodgers'
Mickey Hatcher and Steve Sax did it....
</P>
<P>
   Phillies Rookie of the Year candidate Marlon Anderson headed
into the weekend hitting just .207 and has made seven errors. But
12 of his 19 hits have been with runners in scoring position,
including a two-run home run in an 11-1 rout of the Padres on
Wednesday. The Phillies are hoping Anderson duplicates what he did
last year when he hit .187 in April at Triple-A
Scranton/Wilkes-Barre, then recovered to bat .306 and lead the
International League in hitting....
</P>
<P>
   CLOSING IN
</P>
<P>
   Tony Gwynn, nearing 3,000 hits, got his first off the Phillies'
Sid Monge on July 19, 1982.
</P>
<P>
   Gwynn got his first hit in his fourth plate appearance and first
baseman Pete Rose, the all-time hit leader, trailed him to second,
saying, ``Don't catch me in one night.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure Pete made the comment to get a laugh, but it had me
thinking,'' Gwynn said. ``Wouldn't it be great to do some of the
things he has done? For a young guy, that comment hit me like a ton
of bricks.''
</P>
<P>
   Monge now works as a rookie-league pitching coach for the Padres
in Arizona and was called in to pitch batting practice in
Philadelphia because the Padres don't have any left-handers on
their coaching staff....
</P>
<P>
   Giants closer Robb Nen was 9 for 9 in save opportunities, but he
allowed three runs in the ninth of a 9-8 loss to Pittsburgh. It
overshadowed Kent's cycle _ the first for a Giant since Robby
Thompson on April 22, 1991 _ and prevented Joe Nathan from becoming
the first Giants pitcher since Juan Marichal in 1960 to begin his
career 3-0.
</P>
<P>
   They are still in first place without Barry Bonds, but there are
warning signs, including a 5.00 ERA, second-to-last in the league,
and 14 errors in seven games entering the weekend, dropping them
from fifth to 15th in the NL.

McCraw's video collection receives two thumbs up
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By DALE ROBERTSON &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   According to Dr. Tom McCraw, the Astros' batting professor,
hitting a baseball is brain surgery _ but without the scalpel and
forceps.
</P>
<P>
   McCraw doesn't teach swinging so much as he teaches thinking.
Although he gives mechanics their due, he believes the key to
smacking the ball where they ain't lies in preparation and
concentration. As you might have noticed, the Astros have been
doing a bang-up job of same recently _ their team batting average
leads the National League by a cushy margin _ so it seems a good
opportunity to take a knife to Mack and see what makes him tick.
</P>
<P>
   Hitting, that's what. He admits he lives to talk hitting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Could go on all night about it,'' he said. ``It fascinates
me.''
</P>
<P>
   First of all, though, it's probably best we clear up something
here. McCraw, 58, is at least as much a student as he is a teacher.
He didn't invent the principles of mind over matter he espouses; he
learned them from those who practiced what he preaches. As a career
.246 hitter, he had to seek the counsel of others.
</P>
<P>
   And he did. Lots of them, with names like Rose, Robinson,
Puckett, Gwynn and Brett, among many, many others.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pete Rose and Frank Robinson were two entirely different kinds
of hitters,'' Mack says, ``but they approached hitting exactly the
same way. They never went up to the plate without a very specific
plan. They always waited for their pitch to hit. They didn't let
the pitcher dictate to them.''
</P>
<P>
   McCraw knows this because he has spent hours talking to these
guys. Not casual conversations, either, mind you, but actual
interviews, replete with instructional films and videotape. His
homemade collection, which he has been building for almost 30
years, is extensive, forming the basis of his Astros curriculum.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Williams, who had a pretty good handle on the subject, got
Mack's own thinking straight when he managed him with the Senators
in 1971. The untimely death of Roberto Clemente the following
offseason inspired the evolutionary process that transformed McCraw
into an expert on a subject he never mastered.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the knowledge that went to the grave with Clemente, all of
it lost forever,'' he said. ``That was a tragedy in its own way,
too. It was then that I started talking to the great hitters,
making a permanent record of what they had to say.''
</P>
<P>
   When he started coaching the year he stopped playing _ 1975 _
his fledgling video collection acquired a practical purpose. He has
been showing the movies to players ever since to help him get his
points across.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mack's tapes might be worth hundreds of thousands of dollars
to a collector,'' said Astros general manager Gerry Hunsicker, who
saw the value in McCraw's methods when both were employed by the
Mets and thus recommended him to Larry Dierker after his hiring as
manager. ``It's amazing what he's put together, and it allows him
to get between the players' ears, which he does as well as any
coach I've ever seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what hitting is all about. It's more confidence than
mechanics and what Mack teaches builds confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   McCraw doesn't treat everyone equally, though. A Jeff Bagwell
doesn't require as much care and nurturing as, say, a Tim Bogar.
For the Bagwell-Biggio-Bell-Caminiti marquee crowd, Mack is just a
glorified consultant, stepping in when needed. They're far more
likely to come to him, than he to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were .300 hitters before I came along,'' he said. ``I
don't mess with them unless they ask me to, although I will look
for little things they might not be aware of. I won't hesitate to
make suggestions.''
</P>
<P>
   Without being overbearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The players listen to Mack,'' Hunsicker said, ``because he
doesn't have an agenda, and he won't try to beat them over the
head. He's an excellent communicator. He makes them want to hear
what he has to say.''
</P>
<P>
   With the younger established Astros, the
Everett-Gutierrez-Hidalgo crowd, McCraw is more of a coach. He
talks to them almost every day. He doesn't give a flip about
sounding repetitious. With the kids, the Glen Barkers and Paul
Bakos, he admits he's inclined to flat-out nag.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to keep saying it,'' he said, ``until they get it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bogar is the resident Mack authority. Bogey has been a disciple
for almost 13 years, since he was drafted by the Mets. While his
.229 average in the majors before this season would suggest McCraw
never has fully gotten through, chances are Bogar wouldn't even be
around if not for the coach's dogged harping.
</P>
<P>
   And Bogey is batting .255.
</P>
<P>
   ``The great hitters do things the right way instinctively,''
Bogar said. ``The rest of us have to always be thinking about what
we're doing, and what usually happens is we start worrying about
our mechanics. Mack tells you, `Forget the mechanics. Have a good
game plan and stick to it.'''
</P>
<P>
   McCraw likes to point out that Robinson claims to have hit at
least 500 of his 586 home runs off fastballs.
</P>
<P>
   ``So why should a Tim Bogar or a Glen Barker be up there
sweating sliders and curves?'' Mack said. ``If a Frank Robinson got
to hit fastballs, they will, too. Be patient. Wait for the
fastball.''
</P>
<P>
   Sounds simple? It is. It just requires a little brain surgery.

More than merely a series is at stake
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By FRAN BLINEBURY &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ Tick tick tick.
</P>
<P>
   It's not a bomb ready to go off. Just the sound of the clock
running out.
</P>
<P>
   On the Rockets. And the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   But the effects could be just as devastating. The loser might
just be left in pieces.
</P>
<P>
   No other NBA first-round playoff series has as much at stake on
both sides as today when NBC's team takes on AARP's team in Game 1
at the Great Western Forum.
</P>
<P>
   It's a battle of the ages. Young and old.
</P>
<P>
   It's a fight against time, for different reasons.
</P>
<P>
   For the Rockets, it's a simple case of the grains of sand
running through the hourglass on their Big Three of Hakeem
Olajuwon, Charles Barkley and Scottie Pippen.
</P>
<P>
   For the Lakers, it's a more complicated matter of youth and
impetuosity and egos and chemistry. Or lack thereof.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets had better win now, because they're getting older _
and not necessarily better _ every day.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers had better win right now, before kid leaders
Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant decide to take their heated
rivalry _ with each other _ to the WCW's Monday Nitro to settle
things in a steel cage match.
</P>
<P>
   There is cause for alarm in both camps.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Rockets are plotting their escape route _ hint:
think rookie backcourt _ and whispering satisfaction with the
on-the-fly season for the sole reason everybody gets along.
</P>
<P>
   Lakers could splinter
</P>
<P>
   Because the Lakers know of the clause in Shaq's seven-year, $121
million contract that allows him to opt out and become a free agent
after this season and the big fella is playing coy on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should I think about something like that, especially
now?'' says Shaq one minute.
</P>
<P>
   Then when somebody points out LA coach Kurt Rambis is under
pressure because his contract runs out after the playoffs, Shaq
says: ``So does mine.''
</P>
<P>
   At 36, 36 and 33, Olajuwon, Barkley and Pippen are running out
of time. At 27 and 20, Shaq and Kobe are running out of patience.
</P>
<P>
   Because of their contracts, a Rockets team that comes up short
will be stuck with each other. Because of their egos, a hoped-for
Lakers dynasty that comes up short might scatter to the winds.
</P>
<P>
   It is safe to say neither the Lakers nor the Rockets expected to
be in their current positions, banging heads in this affair that
will bring a premature end and a label as one of 1999's tremendous
underachievers to one team.
</P>
<P>
   You'll remember that when the Rockets signed Pippen in January,
he rode into town in a white stretch limousine with a police
escort, and team owner Leslie Alexander surely was envisioning
similar triumphant motorcades when he introduced him as ``a guy who
can bring us a championship, many championships.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that was before Pippen often looked as uncomfortable
in the offense as a prisoner in chains and before the Rockets blew
the home-court advantage in this series with losses to Dallas
(twice) and the LA Clippers.
</P>
<P>
   You'll remember the Lakers were coming off a 61-win season when
they made it to the Western Conference finals and supposedly were
more committed than ever to pulling it all together.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that was before the Lakers stumbled out of the
starting gate, got coach Del Harris fired, reached out to wacko
Dennis Rodman for stability, watched him go AWOL, cut him, traded
for sharpshooter Glen Rice, kept right on foundering and were
hammered by 27 and 22 points in back-to-back games in San Antonio
and Houston less than two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Rockets battling time
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets closed out the season with three consecutive wins
and say they finally have discovered the key to playoff success
with a new determination to push the ball up the court and thereby
perform with more energy and emotion at both ends of the court.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no team out there in the playoffs that we can't
beat,'' Pippen says.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can play with anybody,'' Barkley says.
</P>
<P>
   But for how long in the gantlet of five- and seven-game playoff
series they would have to survive to just reach the NBA Finals?
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers responded to their whipping at Compaq Center by
closing the regular season with four straight wins and claim to be
brimming with confidence and reading from the same page of the
playbook, even though Shaq and Kobe hiss at each other like a pair
of tomcats from opposite sides of the locker room.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to be the best team player possible,'' says Shaq,
an obvious crack at the shot-happy Kobe, whom he calls ``Boy
Wonder.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no need for that Party of Five stuff, where you sit
down and talk about life,'' Kobe says. ``It doesn't mean we have to
like each other.''
</P>
<P>
   But how far can you go on envy?
</P>
<P>
   Rockets. Lakers. No more time for excuses.
</P>
<P>
   The clock's running.

   PLANO, Texas _ Mejdija Vraniqi was just 18, the mother of a
6-month-old girl, when she fled Kosovo in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   As ethnic Albanians under Serbian rule, Vraniqi and her husband,
Mustafa, had little freedom and few civil rights. In the Serbs'
eyes, she said, ``We didn't deserve to have better schools.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When I saw my 6-month-baby, we decided to give a better future
to her: freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   She told her mother, four sisters and two brothers that she was
taking a vacation. Then she left, certain that she would return
someday.
</P>
<P>
   ``For 19 years, that was my dream,'' said Vraniqi, of Plano.
``Now I can't do that, because now everybody is refugees.''
</P>
<P>
   Vraniqi's personality is bubbly and radiant. But, like many of
her people, she suffers a broken spirit, a constant aching for her
homeland.
</P>
<P>
   She, her husband and oldest daughter became U.S. citizens in
1986. America, she said, has given her ``everything:'' She has four
beautiful children, a home, a job. But it is not home.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nothing to me,'' Vraniqi said. ``It's not mine. My body
is here. But my soul and my heart, every single day is there.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Vraniqi grieves for the unwanted: the ethnic Albanian
refugees who will begin arriving in North Texas on Sunday. ``I know
they are going to be miserable,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, the major partner in the NATO force that
started bombing Yugoslavia on March 24, agreed last month to take
in 20,000 Kosovar refugees from camps in Macedonia. About 1,000
arrived last week. Most went to McGuire Air Force Base at Fort Dix,
N.J., for processing. Others went directly to relatives across the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Vraniqi, a member of the Albanian-American Cultural Club in
Carrollton, Texas, is helping to prepare for those who will arrive
in the Fort Worth-Dallas Metroplex.
</P>
<P>
   She has organized mostly ethnic Albanian Muslim women in North
Texas to help the refugees by collecting furniture, tables, pots
and pans, baby beds and other items to furnish apartments.
</P>
<P>
   They are also aiding refugees who remain in camps outside
Kosovo. Plano and Richardson mosques have raised more than $6,500
to purchase dried food, toiletries and clothing, which will be
delivered through the Feed the Children organization in Oklahoma
City beginning May 12.
</P>
<P>
   Fort Worth doctors are collecting antibiotics, painkillers, cold
remedies and other medicines. Al Hedaya Islamic School in
Arlington, Texas, has packed 80 bags of clothing.
</P>
<P>
   Vraniqi, a floral shop manager at a Tom Thumb grocery, is eager
to meet the refugees' physical needs. But she wonders how they will
deal emotionally with the loss of relatives, possessions and
culture.
</P>
<P>
   Vraniqi said she misses the mountains, flowers and greenery of
her homeland, and the aroma of fresh-picked tomatoes. Even the
rocks, she said, ``look like marble.''
</P>
<P>
   And every evening, she remembers family tea time. ``We used to
read or crochet or make the doilies _ everybody with two hands
making doilies at 5 o'clock in the evening,'' she said, laughing.
``The neighbors used to come, and you fix them tea. You had so much
love and attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Vraniqi has spoken to relatives only twice since March 30.
</P>
<P>
   When she asked her brother, who escaped Kosovo, about their
mother, he was evasive. ``He said, `Mom, she is at Prizren.' When I
asked more questions about Mommy, he started crying and said, `Mom
is at Prizren.' ''
</P>
<P>
   She believes that her mother is among the many older Albanians
who have chosen to die in their own villages.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mom raised seven children in the same house,'' Vraniqi
said. ``My father died in that house. We got married in that house.
Even if they kick her from her home, she's not going to go. She's
going to die there. She has those seven children's memories. The
grandchildren. She will die by Serbians' guns.''
</P>
<P>
   Vraniqi could have returned to Kosovo, but it would have been a
harsh life for her children, ages 19, 17, 16 and 14. But she may
someday return to her hometown, Prizren, on her own.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will be more happy there in my tarnished land than in some
different country's heavenly place,'' she said. ``As long as I
live, (Kosovo) will be my homeland.''

RODRIGUEZ CLOSE TO RETURNING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Seattle shortstop Alex Rodriguez is expected to
return this week after missing a month recovering from surgery to
repair torn cartilage in his left knee.
</P>
<P>
   Mariners manager Lou Piniella knows Rodriguez is almost ready.
Almost daily, Rodriguez pesters the manager about getting back in
the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alex is close, and he wants to play,'' said Piniella, who has
used six shortstops in Rodriguez's absence. ``We've said all along
that he might be back May 14, but now he wants to play before that.
I talked to our trainer and he says there's a chance we'll get Alex
back Monday in Boston.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez, 23, with youth and determination on his side, has
pushed himself after surgery, and in pre-game workouts Wednesday
looked so good several Indians players watching asked if he was
coming off the disabled list for the series.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez return can't come too soon for Piniella, whose
struggling club could cost him his job. Wednesday, USA Today placed
his odds of getting fired at 6-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``I opened the season at 10-1,'' Piniella said. ``I lose a
couple of veteran pitchers, my odds went down.''
</P>
<P>
   SAME OLD LOFTON
</P>
<P>
   Despite a sinus headache the blurred his vision, Cleveland's
Kenny Lofton went 4 for 5 with a homer and four RBI Monday and has
regained his spot as one of baseball's most feared leadoff hitters.
Compared to last year when Lofton hit .282 in his first year back
with the Indians, he's hitting .358 (38 for 106) with 23 runs,
eight doubles, three triples, three homers, 13 RBI, eight steals,
18 walks and 16 strikeouts....
</P>
<P>
   Red Sox closer Tom Gordon, out since April 18 with an inflamed
right elbow, has been throwing and hopes to start a minor-league
rehab assignment next week. Wednesday's session was disappointing,
but not as bad as the rest of the Boston bullpen, which has blown
six of seven save opportunities and gone 1-5 with a 6.52 ERA during
his absence. The Red Sox are 0-8 in games former Dodger Kip Gross
has appeared....
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles were criticized last winter for giving Harold Baines
a contract extension, but now he is one of the few bright spots
this season. In two innings Tuesday, Baines had an RBI triple and a
grand slam in an extra-inning victory. It came a day after the
embarrassing 12-6 loss to Cuba and started the Orioles on their
first three-game winning streak since last September. Actually, it
has been so bad, the Orioles hadn't won two straight in 38 games.
Mike Mussina is 4-1 this season. The rest of the starting rotation
is 2-11, including Juan Guzman's first victory of 1999 on Wednesday
night....
</P>
<P>
   MORE BAD PITCHING
</P>
<P>
   Tim Belcher, a 14-game winner last year in Kansas City, has been
getting rocked ever since signing a two-year, $10.2 million with
the Angels. He has company. The Orioles' Scott Erickson, who led
the AL in innings, starts and complete games last year, is 0-5 with
an 8.44 ERA....
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago Cubs are interested in Twins closer Rick Aguilera
because of the struggling Rod Beck. Aguilera, who earlier said he
would not waive his no-trade clause unless it was in a deal that
would allow him to remain as a closer, seems to be relenting. It
could be a good fit. Cubs president Andy MacPhail is the former
Twins general manager. He is a former teammate of Cubs GM Ed Lynch,
and Cubs pitcher Kevin Tapani is one of his best friends in the
game....
</P>
<P>
   The Toronto Blue Jays were in first place two weeks ago, but now
they are stumbling. They had a team ERA of 4.03 (64 ER in 143 IP)
when they started out 12-4, which included a 9-1 homestand. But an
11-game road trip through New York (0-3), Anaheim (1-3) and Seattle
(2-2) began a 3-10 slide. The Jays are still the highest-scoring
team in the majors but entered the weekend with an ERA of 5.50 _
7.34 during those 13 games. More bad news: Joey Hamilton, who
signed a three-year, $17 million contract after coming over from
the Padres, had a 19.29 ERA for two starts totaling seven innings
before going down with shoulder problems. Hamilton threw 50 pitches
Wednesday in a simulated game and is expected to start a rehab
assignment Monday....
</P>
<P>
   FINALLY
</P>
<P>
   After a disappointing season last year, Tampa Bay's Fred McGriff
has revived his career. McGriff set a major-league record Friday
night by homering in his 34th ballpark during the regular season, a
two-run shot in the third inning at Jacobs Field. Going into
Saturday, McGriff had homered in four straight games and has eight
homers in his last 10 games. The only other parks he'll play in
this season that he has not homered are The Ballpark at Arlington,
Camden Yards and the Mariners' new park that opens later this
summer.

SOMETHING HAS TO GIVE IN NUNN-GUTHRIE MATCH 
</HEADLINE>
 NOTEBOOK-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ For once, everybody is at risk, even the promoters.
</P>
<P>
   Normally in boxing, the fighters take the risk and everyone else
makes the money, but when former light heavyweight champion William
Guthrie and ex-middleweight and super middleweight titleholder
Michael Nunn go at it Sunday night in Minot, N.D., the men who
promote them, Dan Goossen and Mat Tinley, will be sharing the risk.
</P>
<P>
   Goossen and Tinley, who are partners in a promotional company
called America Presents, direct the careers of both light
heavyweight contenders and thus are well aware that while they
stand to win by the time the night is over, they also stand to
lose. This is not a position promoters often have an interest in
assuming, but here they are, and Goossen claims it is proof they
are different from the boxing establishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having two guys we promote fighting each other is a statement
that we won't hold back one of our guys just because he could kill
off another,'' Goossen said from his office in Denver. ``We've
promised our fighters opportunities, and the way the business is
today, a lot of times the best opportunity has to come from inside
your own organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``As promoters, you might not like that, but it's not a conflict
in our eyes. The winner goes on to better himself and the loser
becomes less valuable. We've promised our fighters an opportunity
even if it's at our expense, which it is in this case. No matter
who wins, we've got a downside here. That's just reality.''
</P>
<P>
   It's also what the 34-year-old Nunn and 32-year-old Guthrie
agreed to accept, in part because both found their careers stalled.
Even when he became a mandatory challenger, Nunn was unable to
force World Boxing Association-World Boxing Council champion Roy
Jones Jr. to fight him. Instead, Nunn had to opt for a fight with
interim WBC champion Graciano Rocchigiani, who won a controversial
split decision last March in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Nunn has pursued Jones and International Boxing
Federation champion Reggie Johnson without any luck. Guthrie laid
off for 15 months after Johnson stunned him with a one-punch
knockout that took the IBF title from Guthrie at a time when he was
believed by some to be a threat to Jones. For his part, Guthrie
(24-1, 21 KOs) still believes he is, but he first must get by Nunn
and prove that the weak training habits that led to his undoing are
behind him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The second you lose, you find out the guy who was carrying
your bag for you isn't carrying it any more,'' Guthrie said from
his home in Delaware. ``I carry my own bags now. I don't need no
entourage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew that night I was no longer world champion. That's the
other side of boxing. The reality check happens right away. You
don't get no season to lose your title. It's not drawn out. It all
happens in one night.
</P>
<P>
   ``After I lost, a lot of people were saying, `See, he's nothing.
Guthrie's nothing.' But a lot of good trainers weren't saying that.
They wouldn't let their fighters in with me. So I was surprised
Nunn gave me this opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to get right back in with Reggie at first, but he
went another way. And Jones never did want to fight me. The day
before I fought Johnson, Jones said there were no fights for him in
the division. He said he couldn't make no money and was moving to
heavyweight. Then I got knocked out and he's been a light
heavyweight ever since. He made plenty of money because the money
was always there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jones talked about me but let me tell you, Roy Jones is not
ever fighting me. But I don't worry about that any more. Nunn is
the break I needed. It's a great opportunity for both of us.''
</P>
<P>
   It is also a double-edged sword for Goossen and Tinley, who know
that bringing back the loser a third time may be almost impossible,
while getting the winner a title shot if Jones unifies the
175-pound championship against Johnson June 5 may be nearly as
difficult.
</P>
<P>
   But Goossen insisted that while his organization might be losing
one contender Sunday night, it is creating another.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe the winner deserves to be the No. 1 or No. 2
contender,'' Goossen said. ``Guthrie was an undefeated champion
until he got hit with a great shot by Reggie. Other fighters have
overcome that. He just has to win this fight and show that he's
decided to pay the price not only to become champion but to stay
champion.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Guthrie wins, he deserves to be No. 1. I feel the same way
about Nunn. In our eyes, the winner is the one true challenger for
Roy Jones at 175 pounds so this is do-or-die for both guys. Neither
is making a great deal of money this fight. It's more risk than
reward for both of them.''
</P>
<P>
   For once at least, you could say the same thing about the
promoters.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jones, meanwhile, is preparing to fight more than Johnson. He
received a threatening letter from attorneys for promoter Don King
last week claiming he had defamed King by his comments following
the draw in the Lennox Lewis-Evander Holyfield heavyweight
unification fight. Jones, who was a commentator on the pay-per-view
broadcast, said, ``Any time Don King is involved, you can expect a
draw to come from somewhere. Ask Pernell Whitaker about the Julio
Cesar Chavez fight. You know something like that was in the air if
he's here.'' Attorney Alvin B. Davis wrote Jones in a letter dated
April 28, ``These allegations are false and defamatory.'' He
demanded Jones prove them or send a letter ``clearly stating that
you had no basis for making the allegations.'' Pensacola attorney
Fred Levin responded May 6 with a letter stating, ``You asked for
any information that Mr. Jones relied upon in making this statement
in order that your law firm could complete its investigation.
Please do not spend a lot of money in your investigation. Simply
get tapes of the Holyfield/Lewis and Whitaker/Chavez fights. We
understand Don King and/or Don King Productions, Inc. promoted both
fights. If Mr. King decides to file suit . . . please provide us
with a list of dates that Mr. King and his staff would be available
for depositions under oath in regard to both fights . . . Finally,
Roy just called me and told me to `circle the wagons.' I guess that
means, `Let's get ready to rumble.' '' Levin sent copies of that
letter to Arizona Sen. John McCain, whose second bill to help clean
up boxing was just sent to the Senate for a vote, and Florida
attorney general Elliott Spitzer. Don't expect to hear much more
from King's attorneys on this . . . Jones is used to not being able
to find an opponent, so he wasn't all that shocked last Thursday
when he turned up in Biloxi, Miss., to hype the Johnson fight and
found no one waiting for him. Johnson did not show for the
scheduled press conference, claiming he was training in Houston.
Jones was less than pleased, but already there was much bad blood
between the two, dating back to the days when Jones's father
trained them both in Pensacola, so what's a little more? Jones
asked his father to drop Johnson, believing he would eventually
have to fight him, and his father's refusal became one of the bones
of contention that led to an ugly breakup in 1992. They have not
worked together since then and seldom speak. Johnson (39-5-1, 24
KOs) is a two-time light heavyweight champion, having won the title
in 1992 and then winning it back last year by knocking Guthrie
cold. Jones said he was not fazed by Johnson's absence, believing
he won't be around long June 5, either. ``I will do a number on
him,'' Jones said. ``Reggie can't beat me.'' . . . Sometimes guys
still get paid for what they do in sports after they do it. That's
the case for Davey Hilton (36-1-3) and Stephane Ouellet (25-2), who
will earn $200,000 each May 28 when they fight a rematch of their
stirring 1998 fight for the Canadian middleweight title. That
night, Ouellet held an insurmountable lead going into the last
round only to be stopped with five seconds left by Hilton, who had
begun to hammer him more and more late in the fight. A $200,000
purse is big money for 99 percent of the world's boxers and 100
percent of the ones fighting on ESPN2's ``Friday Night Fights'' . .
. HBO's ``Real Sports'' is doing a profile on Teddy Atlas's newest
protege, undefeated Elvir Muriqi, an ethnic Albanian whose father
returned to Serbia from New York City to fight for freedom in
Kosovo. Muriqi is 6-0 . . . How sick is this? Danish promoter
Mogens Palle is touting hapless Brian Nielsen for tying Rocky
Marciano's record at 49-0. The IBO champion hasn't fought a guy who
could lick Marciano in his present condition _ which is dead for
almost 30 years. . . . Here's how quickly things change in boxing.
A year ago, Frank Warren was the promoter and chief defender of
World Boxing Organization featherweight champion Prince Naseem
Hamed. Warren was given the sack by Hamed at year's end and now
promotes WBO junior bantamweight champion Marco Antonio Barrera.
When Warren had Hamed, he wanted no part of Barrera and got to
avoid him when Barrera was knocked cold by Junior Jones three years
ago. Then he avoided Jones instead. Now he's pushing HBO to make a
Barrera-Hamed fight that he never wanted before . . . Israel
``Pito'' Cardona has done an admirable job of avoiding IBF
lightweight champion Shane Mosley. He has twice been offered a
title shot but has sought other routes to a title against
less-imposing champions. Now it seems he may have won his gamble
because Mosley is ready to abdicate and move up to 140. If he does,
Mosley's promoter, Cedric Kushner, will push to match Cardona with
Angel Manfredy for the IBF 135-pound title. Cardona then would have
a reasonable shot of winning the title he didn't want when Mosley
held it . . . Well shot Tyrell Biggs is out as Andrew Golota's June
26 opponent in Poland. ``They caught us,'' joked Golota's promoter,
Mike Boorman of Main Events, when asked what happened. Efforts to
substitute Al Cole failed, so the search goes on.

WHAT WILL CELTICS SACRIFICE TO MAKE PLAYOFFS 
</HEADLINE>
 NOTEBOOK-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Maybe the question needs to be changed. Maybe no one
should be asking, ``Will the Celtics make the playoffs next
season?'' The better query might be, ``Which of their top four
players will they trade so they can get to the playoffs?''
</P>
<P>
   It appears more likely that this is a ``when'' situation rather
than ``if.'' In the past few weeks, Rick Pitino has sounded like a
cross between Joe Namath (circa 1969) and a Promise Keeper, nearly
guaranteeing victory and deliverance. The Celtics coach has said
that his team will be improved, dramatically, in 1999-2000.
</P>
<P>
   As you think of those words, look at the Celtics' roster. Look
at the players who have reputations as rebounders around the NBA
block. There is one. His name is Popeye Jones and he happens to
have a left knee that a couple of months ago was the size of Maine.
Jones has had two operations on the knee in less than two years. He
is in for a long summer of rehab, his second consecutive one.
</P>
<P>
   It has been proven that you don't need a dominating center to
win a championship or make the playoffs. But you can't do anything
with a lineup of shorties. Antoine Walker has averaged 9.3 rebounds
in his first three seasons, but the team believes he is more of a
small forward than a power forward. If Pitino didn't feel that way,
he wouldn't have told Walker to develop a ``Scottie Pippen-type''
body. Vitaly Potapenko is strong, but has never been a rebounder.
Tony Battie is not known as a rebounder. Paul Pierce rebounds well
for a small forward, but that's not his full-time gig. What does
all that mean? A trade.
</P>
<P>
   The draft story has been recited here many times, so we know a
new player isn't going to come from there. We'll just say that it's
unlikely the Celtics will be able to keep their semi-protected pick
by coming up with a top-3 choice. And we'll also add that if Corey
Maggette is available with the seventh pick and the Cavaliers take
him, they will like him and Boston will miss him. Unless Boston
gets a Maria Grasso miracle, there will not be enough cash for a
significant free agent. So the only way a rebounder comes is
through a trade.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Pierce is probably untouchable, based on his game and his
secure contract status. Walker says he will ``be here for a long
time'' and that fans ``should get used to me.'' He must know that,
to paraphrase the Scriptures, it is easier for a camel to pass
through the eye of a needle than it is for a rich man to be traded
with a contract like that. Kenny Anderson will be tough to deal
and, even if he weren't, he's still a point guard and the Celtics
would rather have him than Dana Barros. That leaves Ron Mercer.
</P>
<P>
   It is probably not a good idea to trade a 6-foot-7-inch guard
who can make 20-footers just as easily as he can throw down
one-handed alley-oops falling away from the basket, as he did
against the Hornets. But the team thought about a trade _ a lot _
before Mercer's contract extension became an issue. And the only
way they will get rebounding is to acquire it, because it probably
can't be developed.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the team can always keep its top four intact and
remix the rest of the roster. But doing that will not ensure the
playoffs, and that's a problem because this team has to make the
playoffs next season. If it doesn't, fans will remind Pitino that
they expected playoff success. And they'll remind him with his own
words.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There was plenty of speculation last week when M.L. Carr said he
was ``disappointed'' with the Celtics' season and that he found it
``insulting'' that the organization would be mentioned in any type
of analogy with an expansion team.
</P>
<P>
   First, Paul Gaston wanted it known that Carr spoke on his own
and did not consult with the chairman of the board. Carr, now the
team's executive vice president of corporate development, also said
that he was speaking for no one but himself. Some people also
wondered why Carr would be critical of Pitino when Pitino can fire
him. But the truth is that Pitino cannot fire Carr; only Gaston
can. And if that were to happen, it probably wouldn't be the wisest
move for the organization when you consider that Carr has three
years remaining on a deal that he and Gaston brokered in the spring
of '97.
</P>
<P>
   Carr becomes uncharacteristically mum when pressed for specifics
on that renegotiated contract (he had two years remaining on his
original deal when he and Gaston reworked it), but word is that
marketing perks are included in the new contract as well. So,
obviously, if the team were to fire him it would still have to pay
him. And pay him well.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

</P>
<P>
   If I'm David Stern, one thing terrifies me more than anything.
It is not the image of the players in my league. It is not the
dynamics of the next television contract. And it is not the
ownership situation in Charlotte. The most frightening stat for the
basketball present and future is scoring. Quick: Guess how many
teams averaged more than 100 points per game this season. One (the
Kings). The last time that happened, the Celtics had a role player
named Togo Palazzi, the Baltimore Bullets began a season and
decided to disband after 13 games, and the best player in the
Schayes family _ Dolph _ was going for 18 points and 12 rebounds
each night for the Syracuse Nationals. That was the 1954-55 season,
the first season of the 24-second shot clock. We all know that
coaches have obsessive, computer-assisted scouting techniques,
right? Well, let's hope that when the Y2K problem strikes at the
end of the year, only the computers of NBA coaches will be
affected. That way, maybe 114-107 scores can be seen again . . . My
choice for WNBA champion: The previously pathetic Washington
Mystics. The reason is obvious. With the first pick in the draft,
the Mystics selected Chamique Holdsclaw. The former Tennessee
forward won a championship every year in high school and three out
of four seasons in college. She'll be a rookie MVP candidate in the
pros. She'll be the league's Michael Jordan . . . Joe Dumars will
retire whenever the Pistons' playoff run ends. Many will remember
Dumars as an old-school guard, one who could play the position no
matter what you called it _ point guard or shooting guard; neither
was a problem. His last game in Boston, April 27, wasn't great. He
scored a point and had three assists. But after the game, Pistons
coach Alvin Gentry praised him and talked of his impact on the team
. . . Wonder what Craig Ehlo was doing Friday. Probably hiding his
calendar. Friday _ May 7 _ was the 10-year anniversary of The Shot,
Jordan's improbable 18-footer at the buzzer to beat Ehlo and
Cleveland in Game 5 of a first-round series . . . This from Pat
Riley, who hasn't coached a championship team since 1988: ``All
I've done for 11 years is win without winning _ a lot of winning
without any real winning. What I've done for 11 years isn't
winning. I know that. And I'm very frustrated by it. I'm not going
to go to pieces over it. I'll just work harder. The last eight
years, taking two franchises and turning them completely over, has
been very hard. Hard, hard work. I'm getting a little bit
impatient.'' Imagine how he feels this morning, following the
Heat's 20-point home loss to the Knicks Saturday. If Riley wants a
championship this season, his team will have to win in New York,
where the Heat have an all-time record of 3-21 . . . The Lakers,
who will move into a new arena next season with the Clippers, have
already notified the league that they plan to modify their classic
uniforms. And speaking of the move, it is probably more accurate to
say that the second-class Clippers are moving in with the Lakers .
. . Since we are having this very rare Clippers Discussion Moment,
let's also remember to keep people less fortunate than ourselves _
such as Chris Ford _ in our prayers. The 9-41 team Ford coached is
a mess and it will probably get worse since the team's best player,
Maurice Taylor (nearly 17 points per night), is up for an extension
and may not want to sign it. The Clippers actually have a Web site.
On it, visitors are prompted to view the results of the Clippers'
Greatest Moments. Even the great moments are mediocre. The top
five:
</P>
<P>
   --April 16, 1992: Clips secure first playoff appearance in 16
years.
</P>
<P>
   --March 30, 1993: Clips beat Lakers to ``clinch the City Series
for the first time since the Clippers moved to LA.'' Whoa. The
Lakers' record in '93 was 39-43.
</P>
<P>
   --April 28, 1992: Clips defeat Utah in first home playoff game.
They lost the series, of course.
</P>
<P>
   --May 5, 1993: Clips defeat Houston to force fifth game of
playoff series. They lost the series, of course.
</P>
<P>
   --March 13, 1998: Clips blast Raptors with 152 points and 69
percent shooting from the field. The Raptors finished that season
16-66. But the Clippers were better. They were 17-65.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics will certainly tinker with their roster in the
offseason; will there be tinkering with those who talk about their
games, too? The team has Howard David, one of the top play-by-play
radio men in the country, calling games. But the contract of his
partner, analyst Cedric Maxwell, will expire before next season . .
. As usual, I waited until the final hour _ literally _ to fax my
postseason awards ballots to the NBA. I was stumped by the vote for
MVP. I define that award in the simplest terms: Who would you give
the ball to in a tie game; and which player has skills that are
obviously valuable to his team but, more important, the league?
Alonzo Mourning? No way I give him the ball when my team needs a
hoop or free throws. Tim Duncan? Close. Real close. Karl Malone?
Reluctantly, yes. Malone did not deserve to be MVP in '97. And
every time I think of him, I always expect to see Jordan pop up
behind his back, poking the ball away to set up his final hoop
(Malone probably can't forget that Finals moment from Game 6,
either). But Malone's teams win, he is an incredible scorer, and he
consistently gets to the line more than any other player in the
league . . . Chauncey Billups still needs to work on his field goal
shooting (39 percent), but guess who led the league in free throw
shooting? That's right, Billups made 91 percent of his freebies,
missing only 14 the entire season.

WILLIAMS SHOULD SAY BYE NOW, PAY LATER 
</HEADLINE>
 NOTEBOOK-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Just before last month's NFL draft, Leland Hardy, one
of the agents representing Heisman Trophy winner Ricky Williams,
said he would get his client one of the largest contracts in NFL
history. That became unlikely the day the New Orleans Saints gave
up their entire draft to get Williams, and now as talks grind
slowly along, Hardy's best chance is to refuse up-front cash and
take a novel approach to negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Because of a quirk in the NFL's collective bargaining agreement
called the 25 Percent Rule, Williams will be hurt long-term by
being the only player in the Saints' draft _ even though logically
you might think otherwise _ and if he insists on the normal
multimillion-dollar signing bonus, he will be severely hurt
financially over time.
</P>
<P>
   Each NFL team has what is called a rookie pool, which is the
total sum of money the league allots a club to pay its rookies. The
more players or the more top picks, the larger the pool. For
example, New England had two No. 1 picks this year as well as a No.
2 and two No. 3s, so its pool was $3,401,861. Cleveland, which had
the first pick in the draft and extra picks, has a pool of
$5,165,897. San Diego, without a No. 1 choice, was alloted only
$1,618,642.
</P>
<P>
   The Saints, who ended up making the fifth overall selection by
trading their entire draft to Washington, have been allocated
$1,479,185. Out of that, they must pay Williams and whatever rookie
free agents they sign (and there will be many to round out their
80-man roster). Under the rules, the Saints cannot pay Williams
more than their total pool for this year and can give him only a 25
percent raise in base salary from the first to the second year.
After that, they can give him increments equal only to the
difference between his first- and second-year salary (unless they
completely rework the contract).
</P>
<P>
   Because of this, the wisest negotiating course for Williams's
side is to ask for little or no signing bonus and as much money in
first-year base salary as he can get; but that could be a problem
for his agent in the future because other agents would argue to
prospective clients that Hardy had failed to get the most
productive running back in NCAA history a dime up front. That would
be a powerful argument to many college players, even though Hardy
would have done the best thing for his client.
</P>
<P>
   Few college players come into the NFL with anything in their
heads but thoughts of a huge signing bonus, even though they
immediately lose half of it in taxes. It is something they've read
about for years, and with many of them coming from low-income
backgrounds, instant cash is a psychological lure difficult to
overcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``That will be a problem for Hardy,'' predicted Boston-based
agent Brad Blank. ``Players expect to get that bonus. If you tell
them it's an advance against future earnings instead, it doesn't
mean the same to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``For Hardy, it will make it interesting because other agents
will try to use it against him if he does the right thing by his
client.''
</P>
<P>
   If Williams is thinking in the traditional way, he loses,
because every dime he puts into a signing bonus will cost him
significant money over the life of his first contract. Here's why.
</P>
<P>
   Say the Saints signed no undrafted free agents and have their
entire rookie pool of $1,479,185 available. If he signed a
seven-year deal, which is the type New Orleans would like, and
takes a $5 million signing bonus, he could be paid no more than
$764,899.30 in base salary his first year because of the pro-rated
signing bonus. If he received the maximum 25 percent increase in
base pay his second year, it would move him up to $956,124.12. The
difference between his first- and second-year pay would be
$191,224.82. That would be the maximum that could be added to his
base each year for the next five seasons without renegotiation.
</P>
<P>
   That means Williams would have salaries of $1,147,348.90 in his
third year under this model, $1,338,573.70 in his fourth,
$1,529,798.50 in his fifth, $1,721,023.30 in the sixth, and
$1,912,248.10 in the seventh for a total of $14,370,015, including
the signing bonus.
</P>
<P>
   If he were to get a $9 million signing bonus, his base salary
his first year would be only $193,470.80 because the bonus would be
spread over the seven years at $1,285,714.20 per year. If you take
25 percent of his rookie base pay _ $48,367.70 _ and add it to his
first-year salary, it comes to only $241,838.50 the second year. As
you can see, that is a two-year total of $435,309.30 in salary
against a two-year total base of $1,721,023.50 with the $5 million
bonus. His salaries for years 3-7 with a $9 million bonus would be:
$290,206.20, $338,573.90, $386,941.60, $435,309.30, $483,677.00.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, with a $5 million signing bonus Williams's total package
would be $14,370,015 but with a $9 million signing bonus it would
total only $11,370,016. On a per-year average, Williams would be
paid $2,052,859.20 per year with the $5 million bonus and
$1,624,288 with a $9 million bonus.
</P>
<P>
   The higher the bonus, then, the less Williams actually makes.
Hence, he doesn't really need an agent to negotiate his contract,
he needs an accountant, because there's little to negotiate with
the rookie pool and the 25 Percent Rule in place. All Hardy can
fight for is length of contract and as much money in guaranteed
base salaries as he can get.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, if Williams were to ask for no signing bonus and put
all of his money in base salaries he would greatly increase his
total package. If New Orleans could give him its entire rookie
pool, he would earn $1,479,185 in base pay this season. The 25
Percent Rule addition for Year 2 would be another $369,796.20, for
a second-year total of $1,848,981.20. Now comes the big money.
Under the repetitive-effect rule, Williams would then have
$369,796.25 added to his base pay each year for the remainder of
the contract.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, by accepting all salary and no bonus, Williams's base pay
in years 3-7 would be: $2,218,774.40, $2,588,570.60, $2,958,366.80,
$3,328,163.00 and $3,697,959.20 for a total package without a bonus
of $18,120,000.00, a yearly average of $2,588,571.40.
</P>
<P>
   That would mean a difference with no bonus of $6,749,984 against
a $9 million signing bonus and $3,749,985 if he took a $5 million
bonus before the hefty tax hit he would take on any bonus is
figured in.
</P>
<P>
   As Blank points out, ``Williams is hurt by being the only
drafted player for New Orleans because when there is a full
complement of draftees, the top guy can basically steal money from
the lower draftees. There ends up being a much larger cash pool and
the No. 1 choice usually gets most of it. Williams can't do that
because he's all alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams's agents, who were hired after he first fired Woolf
Associates and who have never done an NFL deal, must understand the
financial implications of the 25 Percent Rule and then persuade the
Saints to carry huge base salaries, which they might try to avoid.
But the upside for New Orleans is that it would make the contract
far easier to trade because there would be no automatic
acceleration onto its salary cap because no pro-rated bonus money
would be hanging over the team.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, Williams would have little else to bargain about
except salary guarantees. Blank says a smart agent would want the
latter years, where the most money is earned, guaranteed while the
first years would not be because Williams would be in little danger
of being released.
</P>
<P>
   Williams's leverage comes only from being the Saints' sole pick
and the guy Mike Ditka has staked his reptuation and future on. A
protracted holdout would cost the Saints dearly.
</P>
<P>
   So if Williams has the strength to continue on the odd road his
career began on _ by asking for no signing bonus _ he will maximize
his income in a most unusual way.
</P>
<P>
   There is, of course, another way Williams could make more money.
He could save the agent's cut by negotiating the deal himself,
because in his odd case there's not much to talk about.
</P>

   Patriots vice president for personnel Bobby Grier was shocked
when he saw Bruce Armstrong at the team's offices recently. ``Bruce
is down to 290,'' Grier said, indicating a drop of nearly 15
pounds. ``Bruce is a prideful guy and he's taken the right
approach. He's doing what Lomas Brown did. When Lomas got into the
latter part of his careeer, he realized he had to play at a little
bit lighter weight and he dropped some pounds. When I saw Bruce, I
didn't recognize him at first, his face was so thin.'' Armstrong
struggled with speed rushers last year because he played with a
stress fracture in his leg all season. His leg was never right from
the start of training camp but Armstrong never used the injury as
an excuse, refusing even to admit to its existence once the regular
season began. With his weight reduction and a return to health, the
Patriots are hopeful that he will return to the dominant play that
made him a six-time Pro Bowl selection . . . Grier has an
interesting point of view on rookie running back Kevin Faulk.
``He's not small, he's just short,'' Grier said of his No. 2 pick.
``Kevin goes over 200 pounds, and some of the best backs in the
league _ Emmitt Smith, Barry Sanders, and Thurman Thomas _ are no
more than an inch taller than he is. I believe this kid is going to
end up being our (regular) back.'' . . . The Patriots continue to
look at former Redskin running back Terry Allen, who was recently
released after two injury-marred seasons, but they are concerned
about his durability and asking price. The nine-year veteran rushed
for more than 1,000 yards in 1992, 1994, 1995, and 1996, but
slipped to 724 and 700 the past two seasons. His playing time also
fell and his carries dropped from a career-high 347 in 1996 to 210
and then 148 because of injury. In '98, Allen still averaged 4.7
yards a carry before his season was cut short for the second
straight year, and the concern is that his 208-pound body is
starting to turn brittle after 1,684 career carries . . . The early
assessment in Foxborough on Andy Katzenmoyer is that weak-side
plugger, the position Todd Collins played, is better-suited to his
talents than middle linebacker, but to play it effectively,
Katzenmoyer will have to learn how to better use his hands to keep
blockers off him. If he does, he starts Sept. 12 . . . By the way,
unless your name is Jamal Anderson, it was much ado about nothing
that his name came up on draft day in a potential trade with the
Patriots. You'd have to be an idiot to make such a deal for a
player in the final year of his contract on short notice, which is
what the Falcons gave the Patriots. Anderson is asking to be paid
like Sanders and Terrell Davis and in fact may have already taken
more hits than you'd like. Fans forget that despite his brilliant
season, Anderson was backing up Byron Hanspard until Hanspard was
lost early in the season.

   Patriots cornerback Ty Law continues to pay the price to achieve
greatness. He has been working out regularly at Bob Kersee's speed
and conditioning camp in Los Angeles, along with Steelers running
back Jerome Bettis. Law returned home for Mother's Day Saturday but
will fly back to LA this week and stay in Kersee's program until
the Patriots' June mini-camp. After that, he is scheduled to return
to Los Angeles and work at the UCLA track until the end of June,
then take a short break before training camp. That is called paying
the price, something not enough Patriots understood the past two
years. Law was never one of them, which is why he's a Pro Bowl
cornerback today while others with great talent have languished
below their potential . . . Daniel Snyder may have finally come up
with an $800 million deal to buy the Redskins that the NFL owners
will approve at the end of the month, but the league hasn't seen
the end of spurned suitor Howard Milstein. When Milstein withdrew
his own $800 million offer (in which the 34-year-old Snyder was a
minority partner) after becoming convinced he could never muster
the number of votes needed for approval, the owners thought they
had gotten him to agree not to sue them, even though his offer had
been accepted by the trust selling the Redskins. Well, maybe not.
Milstein has retained noted Washington litagator David Boies, who
earns $600 an hour just for taking your phone call. Boies led the
government's lawsuit against Microsoft and Bill Gates, while also
opening up a private practice that has grown to include 34 lawyers
in just 13 months. According to his publicity sheet, the
57-year-old Boies spent 30 years as a corporate lawyer at the Wall
Street firm of Cravath Swaine &AMP; Moore and lost only one of more
than 45 cases. He represented the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
in its insider-trading litigation that ended with junk bond king
Michael Milken paying a $1.1 billion settlement. More than a few
folks have written to ask how a guy could offer $800 million for
the Redskins and have his application rejected. The factors were
many, but Milstein has been a disaster as owner of the NHL's New
York Islanders and it was feared he would soon be pushing alongside
Jerry Jones to break up the lucrative agreement that allocates most
NFL Properties revenue equally among the league's 31 teams, despite
the fact that some _ such as the Cowboys and Raiders _ account for
the bulk of the sales. Many also were fearful about his not putting
up much cash or risking personal assets. Now they may have a
disastrous situation of another kind if Boies gets into things . .
. Meanwhile, one of the men who had opposed Milstein now says he
will vote in favor of Snyder at the owners' meeting in Atlanta. New
Cleveland owner Al Lerner was among the four who led the
anti-Milstein forces, and his opposition may very well have been
personal. Milstein and Lerner duked it out when the Cleveland
Indians were for sale, and it cost each of them a lot of money. The
Browns were joined most vocally by Denver, Pittsburgh, and New
Orleans . . . Michael Huyghue, the Jaguars' senior vice president
of football operations, is famous for signing draft choices
quickly, but he outdid himself when he signed second-rounder Larry
Smith, a defensive tackle from Florida State, to a four-year deal
worth more than $8 million a week after the draft. Smith is only
the second drafted player to sign. Overall No. 1 choice Tim Couch
was the first.

Trainers keeping their options wide open before Preakness Stakes
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By ALAN TRUEX &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To a horse racing purist _ is that an oxymoron or what? _ the
125th Kentucky Derby was an eyesore. The Run for the Roses
certainly didn't smell like one. Too many horses, no speed, no
viable strategy.
</P>
<P>
   You've seen the analogies: stampede, rodeo, Roller Derby,
Oklahoma Land Rush, bumper cars, ping-pong, crapshoot, lottery. So
enough of that. Bring on the Preakness!
</P>
<P>
   But will next Saturday's Second Jewel of the Triple Crown be
much better? One thing's for sure: The field will be smaller, cut
from 19 to a maximum of 14.
</P>
<P>
   That in itself, however, is no reason to celebrate. The Pimlico
Race Course of Baltimore is narrower than Churchill Downs and has
sharper turns. A horse in the 14th hole may not feel much different
from the 19th Derby starter. Getting hung wide on the turn can be
fatal in the Preakness Stakes.
</P>
<P>
   That's why Carl Nafzger, trainer of Fountain of Youth and
Florida Derby winner Vicar, said he'll scratch his horse if stuck
with an outside post in Wednesday's draw. Bob Baffert threatened
the same with superfilly Silverbulletday.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Baffert, who won last year's Derby and Preakness with
Real Quiet, is considering bypassing the Second Jewel altogether.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the large field and all, there's no reason for going up
there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Baffert is ``on the fence'' with the Derby's fourth-place
finisher, Prime Timber. ``He was tired coming out of the Derby, and
he's lost weight,'' the trainer explained, saying he would decide
Monday whether to send the colt in the Preakness.
</P>
<P>
   He's also straddling with Silverbulletday, who has won 10 of 11
races. She is cross-entered in the Preakness and the Black-Eyed
Susan Stakes for fillies only. ``I'll see how she draws, then
decide,'' Baffert said.
</P>
<P>
   Silverbulletday, who skipped the Kentucky Derby, would be a key
newcomer to the Triple Crown campaign. She could be the second or
third pick in the morning line.
</P>
<P>
   Another key addition could be Torrid Sand, a front-runner who
finished third in the Arkansas Derby and was promoted to second
when the winner, Valhol, was disqualified because jockey Billy
Patin allegedly carried an illegal battery.
</P>
<P>
   Trainer Randy Morse tried to enter Torrid Sand in the Kentucky
Derby but failed to make the cut because of insufficient
graded-stakes earnings. With the purses from the Arkansas Derby
redistributed, Torrid Sand makes the field of the 124th Preakness.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Valhol's owner, Jim Jackson of Rockdale, intends to
run his gelding in the Preakness despite his 15th-place Derby fade
and the cloud of scandal and disputed money.
</P>
<P>
   Without the purse from Arkansas, Valhol doesn't have enough
career earnings to qualify for the Preakness if more than 14
attempt to enter, which appears to be the case.
</P>
<P>
   Valhol was admitted to the Derby only because of a court order,
and it may take another judicial ruling to put him in the
Preakness.
</P>
<P>
   If this is going to be a good, clean race, early speed is
essential. The Derby was sabotaged by a combination of too many
horses and no leadership to string out the field. The half mile of
47 seconds was the slowest in 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   The filly Three Ring was supposed to provide pace, but her
saddle slipped as she burst out of the gate, and she was never a
factor. She won't run in the Preakness, but Torrid Sand, who has
been training sharply, should prove an adequate front-end
replacement.
</P>
<P>
   While many horses were battered and bruised, the Derby's top
three finishers emerged unscathed.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Lukas, trainer of 30-1 long-shot winner Charismatic and
the show horse Cat Thief, goes for his fifth Preakness victory with
two horses he said he ``cannot separate'' in ability.
</P>
<P>
   Cat Thief ran near the front throughout the Derby and had the
lead early in the stretch before fading slightly, as he tends to
do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been working all spring with him trying to get him to
blow by horses,'' said Lukas, who observed that the colt takes
after his grandfather, Alydar, runner-up to Affirmed throughout the
1978 Triple Crown campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Cat Thief has been in the money 12 straight times but lacks a
killer instinct. ``He has a little Alydar in him,'' Lukas said.
``He hangs.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Charismatic, he's had an exceptionally hard career: 15
starts already. This will be his third race in six weeks. But
Lukas, who has won 11 Triple Crown events, insisted, ``He's that
come-back-in-two-weeks kind of horse.''
</P>
<P>
   Menifee was perhaps the most impressive horse in the Derby,
driving to second from far off the pace in a race that had no pace.
He's the likely Preakness favorite, but he may need to run closer
to the front on a track famous for early speed holding.
</P>
<P>
   Also dangerous in the Preakness is Worldly Manner, the Arabian
import who battled for the lead at the top of the lengthy Churchill
stretch before tiring and finishing seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Because he had not competed in any prep races, Worldly Manner
was not expected to last. But the Derby may have conditioned him
for the Preakness, which is half a furlong shorter.
</P>
<P>
   Some horses who flopped in Louisville will try again, excused
because of the unusual circumstances of their last race. Thus, Nick
Zito will start Stephen Got Even and Adonis, who finished 14th and
17th, respectively, in the Derby.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both horses had excuses, and we've got to go forward,'' Zito
said. ``Stephen was one of my biggest disappointments in racing. He
trained like Man o' War. And I thought Adonis was going to be right
there. I've never had two horses train up to the race like these.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Got Even was slammed hard shortly after his release from
the gate. He suffered minor cuts and never found his stride. Adonis
was jammed on the rail and was forever searching for a lane; he
ended up running about 10-wide, all alone, on the far turn.
</P>
<P>
   Now they get a second chance in the Second Jewel. It's an
opportunity for the sport as a whole to redeem itself.

MEDITATION HELPS SNYDER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It is the most California of cliches and the rowdy
fans of the Chicago White Sox could not be happier.
</P>
<P>
   Yoga and meditation. John Snyder will tell you they are the two
elements that transformed him from a 13th-round draft choice in
1992 out of Westlake High into one of the American League's
brightest young right-handers.
</P>
<P>
   Snyder had all the pitches climbing through the minor leagues
with the Angels and later the White Sox, but something was missing.
His low 90s fastball rarely translated into more than a .500
record.
</P>
<P>
   ``I needed a way to keep me focused and away from making those
one or two bad pitches that can cost you a game,'' Snyder said last
Monday after pitching an 8-1 complete-game victory over the Angels
at Edison Field. ``I was very intense and easily distracted.
Meditation helped me find that focus.''
</P>
<P>
   The result is an 11-3 record since joining the White Sox in the
middle of last season. After a 7-2 rookie season, he raised his
record to 4-1 last Monday and pitched Saturday night against
Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   ``That clearly was the best-pitched game we've seen,'' Angels
Hall of Fame hitting instructor Rod Carew said. ``We had no answer
for him.''
</P>
<P>
   It can be difficult to find the required 20 minutes for solitude
and stretching in a raucous clubhouse of rap music and television
cameras. It was never more true than on Monday, when a dozen close
friends and family from the Valley, including his high school coach
John Castellanos, came to watch Snyder pitch.
</P>
<P>
   He also was facing the team that drafted him seven years ago,
then included him in the 1995 trade that sent left-hander Jim
Abbott back to the Angels.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was exactly the kind of situation where I had trouble in
the past,'' Snyder said. ``All those people I knew coming to the
game. My old team and wanting to beat them so bad. All I would have
thought about was where people were sitting and if they were taken
care of. Now it's like I know they are there, but I have a job to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Snyder, 24, learned about meditation and yoga in 1994 at a
Pierce College baseball camp run by Alan Jaguar of Woodland Hills.
While Snyder was learning to work quickly and get ahead in the
count, he also was being taught how to relax, focus and visualize
success.
</P>
<P>
   The results weren't immediate. His minor-league record was
37-43, but in the four starts before Saturday, he limited the
Angels, Tampa Bay, Seattle and Boston to two runs and 19 hits in 30
innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way he's pitching, you have to consider him one of the
elite pitchers in the league,'' White Sox manager Jerry Manuel
said. ``He has basically dominated the last four times out against
some pretty good hitting clubs.''

RANFORD LATEST EXAMPLE OF BOWMAN'S DEEP THINKING 
</HEADLINE>
 NOTEBOOK-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It's a safe bet that Bill Ranford won't win another
Conn Smythe trophy this spring as the playoff MVP, but the former
Bruins goalie put on a pretty remarkable performance Friday night,
stepping in to backstop Detroit's 3-2 win over Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   Ranford was last seen here when the Bruins said farewell to
their Grumpiest Old Men, beaten out of town with fellow oldsters
Adam Oates and Rick Tocchet, essentially identifying them as the
unholy trio that led the Bruins to last place overall. They took
the hit for a lot of bad deal-making, payroll decisions, and
coaching inexperience, but, hey, who remembers all that in these
heady times, right?
</P>
<P>
   Now on his third team since Boston, Ranford hadn't played a game
since April 14 before getting the surprise start ahead of Chris
Osgood, who was hobbled by a knee injury earlier in the week. After
falling into a 2-1 hole at 12:34 of the first period, Ranford kept
his cage clean for the next 51:44, until Kirk Maltby banged home
the winner for the Winged Wheels.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fatigue factor was my big concern,'' said the 32-year-old
Ranford, ``but I just tried to shut that out.'' As the game got
along, he shut everything out.
</P>
<P>
   Don't you love how the Wings win? Ranford subs for Osgood and
there isn't an inch of give in net. Maltby bangs home the winner,
and of course the key helper goes to Kris Draper, another of the
no-name Detroit diggers.
</P>
<P>
   The Wings, two Stanley Cups rich, have a lot of things going for
them, not the least of which is the brilliant Scotty Bowman behind
their bench. But most impressive of all is the premium they put on
depth, which translates directly into owner Mike Ilitch's desire to
win, to be the best.
</P>
<P>
   When the March trade deadline came around, they didn't flinch at
the millions it would take to add to their foundation, bringing in
the likes of Chris Chelios, Ulf Samuelsson, Wendel Clark, and
Ranford, who was deemed as a throw-in but immediately was labled an
``insurance policy'' by Bowman.
</P>
<P>
   Are the Wings going to win it? Check this space in coming weeks.
Even if they don't, however, give them credit for taking the
calculated, and costly, risks necessary to attempt to win it.
They've come to expect excellence, they strive for it, and they've
been rewarded for it. Sometimes it does work that way.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Word circulated late last week that former Bruin Craig Janney
was ready to call it a career. Not so, says his agent, Rick
Scimone. ``Craig's got some medical issues that need attention,''
said Scimone. ``As of right now, though, he's planning to be back
playing next season.'' Janney had a strong start in Tampa Bay last
October, but ultimately was dealt to the Islanders (the Kings had
interest, too). He exited the Uniondale lineup in March when blood
clots in his leg required him to be hospitalized. Janney will be 32
in September and is an unrestricted free agent as of July 1 . . .
After getting dismissed again in the first round of the playoffs
following a highly successful regular season, the Devils won't
offer new deals to Bob Carpenter or Dave Andreychuk (a former Pat
Burns favorite in Toronto). Robbie Ftorek's job as coach also
didn't sound so safe when owner John McMullen said of Pittsburgh's
Kevin Constantine, ``He's a pretty good coach. It's not the first
time he's done this, beating a favored team. He did it in San Jose,
too, when they beat Detroit in the seventh game. He might have been
the difference in the series.'' The sight of the Devils, on the
bench with their heads down every time the Penguins scored in the
clincher, was chilling. Bad body language. Basic execution was
poor, too. Example: the botched line change that led to Jaromir
Jagr and Martin Straka bolting out on a two-on-none for a goal
against the defenseless _ and very mediocre _ Martin Brodeur . . .
Vancouver general manager Brian Burke has said that longtime
assistant coaches Stan Smyl and Glen Hanlon have jobs next year if
they want them, but both are scouting around. Smyl might have an
offer in Europe. Hanlon, the former goalie, would like to land a
head coaching job in the NHL or the minors. Marc Crawford, brought
in to replace Mike Keenan as head coach last season, will bring in
Andy Murray as his top aide next season . . . Jeff Norton, formerly
of Acton and Cushing Academy, didn't score a goal for the Sharks in
their first-round loss to Colorado, but he did lead all San Jose
point-getters with seven assists. An excellent skater, Norton has
been overbilled as a high-powered scorer at times during his
career, but his skating and sense for moving the puck make him a
valuable asset.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With tongue in cheek, coach Jim Schoenfeld staked his job on the
Coyotes beating the Blues in Game 7 of their first-round series. It
went to double OT before Pierre Turgeon won it for the Blues, 1-0,
and Schoenfeld followed the crushing defeat by saying he was only
trying to take the heat off his players. Noble. But the bet here is
that Schoenfeld gets the gate. Yes, they were banged up, and they
would have had even more guys out if they had made it past the
Blues. Nonetheless, they're 0 for 3 in their three springs in the
desert, and this isn't a team with a poor player mix. ESPN reported
over a month ago that Jeremy Roenick won't be back, but ditching JR
would be a harder sell than offing Schoenfeld, especially after
Roenick's valiant return for Game 7 vs. the Blues . . . The final
pennies haven't been counted, but the average NHL salary in 1998-99
was just a few bucks shy of $1.3 million . . . Look for the Flyers
to shop defenseman Luke Richardson. He didn't dress for a single
game against the Leafs; coach Roger Neilson believed he was just
too slow. Look for GM Bob Clarke to tap into his favorite pipeline
and send Richardson to the Lightning, perhaps for Rob Zamuner . . .
A couple of former Bruins, defenseman Jamie Huscroft and checking
forward Mike Sullivan, are among Phoenix's five unrestricted free
agents. Huscroft wouldn't fit the plan in the Hub, but the
31-year-old Sullivan, lost in the Nashville expansion draft (and
later dealt to the Coyotes), still has the skills to contribute.
Remember, too, there's no guarantee the Bruins will pay to keep Tim
Taylor, who is free to walk in July because he's a 10-year pro
making less than the $1.3 million average. Don't forget the Bruins
let the likes of Dave Poulin and Dave Reid walk when their tabs got
too high . . . The scouting report on Robyn Regehr, destined to be
on the Flames' blue line next year, is that he'll be another Adam
Foote, a big, tough defenseman. If you lost track, the Flames
plucked him from the Avalanche in the Theo Fleury swap, after
Colorado drafted Regehr No. 19 overall last June with the
first-round pick it acquired from Boston in the Landon Wilson deal
. . . No knowing yet whether Brian Sutter will be back as Flames
coach. GM Al Coates is on record as saying he'll recommend to the
owners that Sutter be brought back (the club holds the option), but
there's no guarantee that Coates will keep his job, either . . .
The water only gets murkier in Pittsburgh, where unresolved
bankruptcy proceedings leave the league not knowing how to proceed
with scheduling and a litany of other key issues (player contracts,
etc.). Another possible new suitor, Mark Cuban, entered the picture
last week. Cuban is the founder of Broadcast.com and grew up in
suburban Pittsburgh. Former superstar Mario Lemieux submitted a
plan, endorsed by the NHL, to bankruptcy court, and Cuban might
join the Lemieux group. At least one other group, headed by
investment banker Chip Gesner, formerly of Connecticut, is
considering a bid. Cuban has the deep pockets preferred by the NHL.
Last month, Yahoo agreed to buy Broadcast.com for $5.7 billion, and
Cuban's cut was approximately $1.2 billion. There will be an
emergency court hearing Tuesday in Pittsburgh, but there is no
guarantee that anything will get resolved before early this summer
. . . The Rangers could make offseason bids for Fleury and/or
Vincent Damphousse, both of whom are unrestricted free agents.
Coach John Muckler has scouted both of them during the playoffs.
Meanwhile, Damphousse and the Sharks didn't make it out of the
first round _ they were losers to Fleury's Avalanche _ which means
the Habs must settle for a second-round pick in 2000 as
compensation for sending Damphousse to San Jose. The deal had the
Habs getting a first-rounder this year if the Sharks made it to
Round 2.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim GM Pierre Gauthier sounds like an easy mark when he
says, ``My philosophy is, whether it's Paul (Kariya) or anyone
else, it's a business deal that shouldn't be a fight.'' Kariya's
contract is up and his new pact undoubtedly will bring him upwards
of $10 million a year, if not more. In the Disney regime, that's
just another guy making Mo Vaughn kind of money, but it could be
more of a tussle than Gauthier is fashioning. The price of Disney
stock is down, following disappointing earnings the last quarter.
Kariya is a great talent, but you can bet Uncle Walt's bean
counters are going to look at the franchise's abysmal postseason
record (4-11 in just three series over six seasons) and consider
ways to run a leaner (i.e. more profitable) operation . . . Alexei
Yashin, last seen as the centerpiece of a Senators foldup against
the Sabres, is playing for Russia in the World Championships. He
has one more year on his deal, worth more than $3 million for next
season, but it's a good bet GM Rick Dudley and Yashin's agent, Mark
Gandler, will get to work on a new long-term deal this summer. The
Senators were at the bottom of the league with a $20 million
payroll in '98-99. Yashin projects to about $10 million a year on
his new pact, which would boost the payroll to about $27 million .
. . Paul Rebillard, formerly of Concord, just finished up his
fourth season of officiating pro hockey in Switzerland and one day
would like to work on this side of the Atlantic. ``I'd love to be
in the International League or the American League, or NCAA
Division 1,'' said the 34-year-old Rebillard, reached by phone just
outside Geneva.The difference between the North American game and
the European brand? ``Stick work,'' said Rebillard, a linesman.
``There's more passing and playmaking, too, but here if you really
nail a guy, it's pretty much a guarantee he'll come back and knife
you with the stick.'' . . . Please, no more backslapping over the
local NFL entry staying in Foxborough. Someone on Beacon Hill or in
City Hall must have the smarts to bring the Patriots and Red Sox to
the table and get them both in downtown arenas. Instead, we're
supposed to feel good about $70 million-plus being spent on highway
infrastructure (hey, wow, look at those guardrails). The Vault is
by no means the best of the new buildings, but it is downtown, and
the basic law of real estate holds true: Location is everything. It
can't be this hard to get things right in Our Town. The fact that
it is so difficult, especially with the economy so robust, should
tell all of us that those at the wheel only keep screwing it up,
then saving it, as a pathetic plot to keep their jobs.

NOTHING WRONG WITH CALLING 'EM AS YOU SEE 'EM 
</HEADLINE>
 NOTEBOOK-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM McCABE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Players don't particularly like the situation, but they
had best get used to the golfing public calling in rules violations
to tournament authorities. Not that tournament officials like it
either, but, said Charlie Lanzetta, the head pro at Rockland Golf
Club, ``We're living with it now; it's been accepted.''
</P>
<P>
   Lanzetta, one of the top rules officials with the PGA of
America, did not see the recent incident involving Seve
Ballesteros, but he has been in the middle of enough decisions to
know how it played out. At the Spanish Open, Ballesteros hooked his
drive on a par-5 and then tried to hit a long fade around trees. He
lost his second shot in trees left of the green, returned to the
original spot, and re-hit. To be diplomatic, one would say that
Ballesteros took a questionable drop; many of his competitors _ and
those from the TV audience who called in _ were far less forgiving,
saying Ballesteros illegally dropped closer to the hole and away
from the tree that had been his obstacle to begin with.
</P>
<P>
   The tournament's chief referee heard Ballesteros's argument _
that he tried to find his original spot and asked spectators for
help _ and ruled that there was no penalty. Ballesteros, said the
referee, had dropped closer to the hole, but since the distance was
great (230 yards) there was no ``serious breach.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Ballesteros was not penalized (shame on him; he
was guilty and should have been DQ'd) overshadows the larger issue:
He never would have been forced to explain himself had TV viewers
not called in to complain.
</P>
<P>
   Should TV viewers, or spectators at an event, be allowed to get
that involved?
</P>
<P>
   ``If the phones are manned and the video is rolling, we'll
listen,'' said Lanzetta. ``There are mixed emotions on both sides,
but until all bodies (PGA Tour, PGA of America, US Golf
Association, Royal &AMP; Ancient) agree, whether it is right or wrong,
we'll keep doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Why shouldn't viewers or spectators be allowed a voice? The
Rules of Golf, while arguably tedious at times, are not that
complex; an awful lot of people who don't play for millions of
dollars know them well and follow them faithfully. They expect
nothing less from the professionals. Just ask Craig Stadler, Paul
Azinger, Nick Faldo, Jesper Parnevik, and Lee Janzen, all of whom
in recent years have been caught in rules violations thanks to TV
viewers or spectators.
</P>
<P>
   If the idea is to make sure that the rules are followed, who
cares who discovers the wrongdoing? Perhaps this situation will get
the players to start paying closer attention to the rules so that
they don't give each other bad advice, as happened to Esteban
Toledo last week. He hit into a lateral water hazard and after
taking his drop, he was standing on a railway tie. So he wanted
relief, which playing partner Eric Booker said he was entitled to.
Toledo took a second drop, played his shot, and was quickly
penalized by a Tour official. You don't get relief in a hazard.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are so engulfed in their game, a lot of times it's not
that they don't know the rules, but they're not that aware of it,''
said Lanzetta.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, many people are aware. And tournament officials are
listening.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Combined, they have won 74 PGA Tour events, 10 majors, and
enough cash to live comfortably the rest of their lives. But Tom
Kite, Lanny Wadkins, and Tom Watson are like anxious folks in a
waiting room _ just trying to keep busy until the door opens. In
this case, the door opens onto the Senior PGA Tour. Watson turns 50
Sept. 4, Wadkins Dec. 5, Kite Dec. 9, and their current playing
status indicates that it can't come soon enough. In 1999, this
once-great trio has combined to miss the cut in 18 of 27 tournament
appearances.
</P>
<P>
   Kite and Wadkins have made just two cuts apiece in 10 and nine
starts, respectively. Watson has made five of eight, but only in
Hawaii (T-16) has he finished in the Top 25, and he missed the cut
at Augusta, stretching to six the number of consecutive majors in
which he has failed to reach weekend play.
</P>
<P>
   Add up their scores and they are 118 over par in 1999, so it is
no surprise that Kite (73.19) and Wadkins (72.96) rank toward the
bottom in scoring average. This is truly frustrating for Kite, who
can point to one main problem: putting. The 1992 US Open winner has
had no problem reaching greens in regulation (he ranks seventh on
Tour), but once he gets there, the woes multiply. He ranks
next-to-last in putts per hole, 1.879.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming they choose to head to the Senior Tour, it will be
interesting to see how they do. Hale Irwin is struggling _ at least
by his standards _ Gil Morgan has been inconsistent, and Ray Floyd,
closing in on his 57th birthday, hasn't visited the winner's circle
since 1996. Larry Nelson, who won last week, is steady, but the the
older circuit these days is being dominated by fellows who hardly
ever stepped into the pro spotlight _ people like Bruce Fleisher,
Allen Doyle, Dana Quigley, Bob Duval. No longer are such players
out there to round out fields so that marquee names can collect big
paychecks.
</P>
<P>
   If Kite, Wadkins, and Watson expect to win on the Senior Tour,
they had best polish their games a little and get hungrier, because
if there is a common denominator among Fleisher, Doyle, Quigley,
and Duval, it is their unquenchable appetite to play. They know the
window of opportunity is small, that those aged 50-55 win most of
the events, and they are prepared to tee it up every week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to drive all over New England for $5,000 purses,''
Quigley will tell you, ``so do you think I'm going to miss a
million-dollar event?''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This week's LPGA stop, the Titleholders, is one of the tour's
oldest and most honored events, but until Mercury stepped in a few
weeks ago, it did not have a sponsor. It also is being played
without last year's star attraction, Se Ri Pak, who is collecting
appearance money to play in Japan. She has taken some heat, but to
be fair, another Tour standout, Liselotte Neumann, also is in
Japan. Unfortunate, but this is what happens when money, not the
game, becomes the overriding issue. Pak and Neumann are just
further examples of how loyalty can't match greed. In a few weeks,
the Colonial MasterCard will be contested while Tiger Woods and
Mark O'Meara are playing in Germany. The bronze statue of Ben Hogan
outside stately Colonial may shed a few tears over that sad reality
. . . Speaking of Woods, after a blazing start as a pro, he has
continued to make money by the bucketful, but without the predicted
pile of victories. He has just two wins in his last 30 events,
though honestly he is a threat to run away and hide every time he
tees it up. While his putting has been suspect (he has hit nearly
70 percent of his greens to rank fourth, but is 98th in putting),
most glaring has been his poor final-round scoring: 71.78, ranked
44th . . . More stats: Phil Mickelson has come back with the putter
(he's ranked 20th; he was 80th last year), but he tends to take
Sundays off (152d with a 74.33 average) . . . O'Meara's final-round
average is a surprisingly poor 73.33 . . . Corey Pavin is the only
ranked Tour player with a driving average under 250 yards (249.4) .
. . Chip Beck made the cut this past week in New Orleans, but there
is a good reason why he has had a tough time getting past Friday:
Of 187 players who have played enough to be ranked, Beck is 186th
in three crucial categories _ scoring average, all-around, and
greens in regulation (51.9 percent) . . . John Daly is cruising
along with an average drive of 307.8 yards, with Woods a distant
second (290.0) . . . Brad Faxon deserves his reputation for putting
prowess (he's ranked second), but his driving accuracy (60 percent)
and greens in regulation (57.3) rank 166th and 173d, respectively .
. . And if the US Open is described as fairways and greens, how is
it that two-time winner Lee Janzen is hitting greens at just a 59.7
clip this year to rank 145th?

DIRK BOGARDE, 78, MATINEE IDOL TURNED SERIOUS ACTOR 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By ALJEAN HARMETZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dirk Bogarde, who transformed himself from Britain's top matinee
idol into a serious actor at the age of 40 and became an
international star, died Saturday at his home in London. He was 78.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was a heart attack, The Associated Press reported,
quoting a nephew, Brock Van den Bogaerde. The actor, who was
knighted in 1992, suffered a stroke in 1996 and had been under
24-hour nursing care since last May, AP said.
</P>
<P>
   Nicknamed the British Rock Hudson, Bogarde was Britain's leading
movie star during the 1950s, when he starred in adventure films and
lightweight comedies, among them an immensely popular series that
included ``Doctor in the House'' (1954), ``Doctor at Sea'' (1956),
``Doctor at Large'' (1957) and ``Doctor in Distress'' (1963).
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s, Bogarde gave a series of brilliant performances as
intelligent, complex and often morally compromised men in such
movies as ``The Servant,'' ``King and Country,'' ``Darling'' and
``Accident.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1961, Bogarde celebrated his freedom after 14 years as a
contract player with the Rank Organization by starring as a
repressed homosexual lawyer who defies a gang of blackmailers in
Basil Dearden's ``Victim.'' Excluding an early bit part, ``Victim''
was his 34th film.
</P>
<P>
   Homosexuality was then a taboo subject and a criminal offense,
but his performance brought acclaim to the handsome, debonair actor
_ who had been known in England as ``the idol of the Odeons,'' the
chain of theaters owned by Rank.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time I was playing my own age,'' he told a
reporter in 1965. ``At Rank, the fixed rule was that I had to look
pretty. `Victim' ended all that nonsense.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, Bogarde found another role to match his talents
_ a sinister valet who corrupts his upper-class master in ``The
Servant'' (1963). The second of five movies that Bogarde made with
Joseph Losey, the American expatriate director, and the first of
two written for him by Harold Pinter, ``The Servant'' was a
psychologically complex portrait of malice.
</P>
<P>
   His performance as the cunning but outwardly servile servant won
Bogarde the first of two British Academy Awards.
</P>
<P>
   He won again in 1965 as a television reporter who leaves his
wife and children for a party girl, played by Julie Christie, in
John Schlesinger's ``Darling.''
</P>
<P>
   Before ``Victim,'' Bogarde had approached David Lean, the
director, in hope of being considered for one of his films. ``I
think Dirk's great,'' Lean told someone, ``but I want an actor, not
a movie star.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That hurt a little,'' Bogarde said after his success in ``The
Servant.'' ``So I decided to hell with the glamour-boy bit and got
into the field of character acting.''
</P>
<P>
   The new career that began at 40 for Bogarde led him to work with
many major European directors. For Luchino Visconti, he played the
doomed writer von Aschenbach in the film version of Thomas Mann's
novella ``Death in Venice'' (1971); for Alain Resnais, he was a
lawyer in ``Providence'' (1977); for Rainer Werner Fassbinder, he
was a Russian emigre in ``Despair'' (1978), and for Bertrand
Tavernier, he was a dying father in ``Daddy Nostalgia'' (1990), his
final film.
</P>
<P>
   Bogarde did little acting after 1978, but published five novels
and chronicled his life in seven well-received memoirs.
</P>
<P>
   He was born Derek Niven Van den Bogaerde in London on March 28,
1921. His father, who was half-Dutch, was the first art editor of
The Times of London; his mother, an actress before her marriage,
was the daughter of an artist and actor, Forrest Niven. The picture
that Bogarde painted in his first autobiography, ``A Postillion
Struck by Lightning'' (1977), was of a cloudless childhood in
Sussex and distant, elegant parents who left the rearing of young
Dirk and his sister Elizabeth to a beloved nanny.
</P>
<P>
   Reticent in print as well as shy in person, Bogarde drew a veil
over his parents until a much later memoir, ``Cleared for Take
Off'' (1995), when he revealed that his mother was an alcoholic
``with a liver like an Aegean sponge'' and his father was capable
of ruinous cruelty.
</P>
<P>
   By his mid-teens, Bogarde had decided to be an actor, although
he was a talented painter and won a scholarship at 16 to the Royal
College of Art. Instead, he put his skill to work painting sets at
a theater in suburban London. He was 19 and had graduated to
walk-ons and bit roles when World War II intervened.
</P>
<P>
   As an officer in Army Intelligence, he spent his days
interpreting aerial photographs of bombing raids and his rest
periods painting the devastation of Europe. He carried his
sketchbook up the beach on D-Day.
</P>
<P>
   Discharged as a major in 1946, Bogarde was an overnight success
when he starred as the troubled son of a working-class family in
the play ``Power Without Glory,'' in 1947.
</P>
<P>
   After signing with the Rank Organization, Bogarde was thrown
into three movies a year, often playing a criminal or someone
suspected of a crime. He won good reviews as the neurotic pianist
who commits suicide in ``Quartet'' (1949). He was to earn even
better reviews as a young killer in ``The Blue Lamp'' (1950),
directed by Dearden.
</P>
<P>
   In 1953, Bogarde made the list of Britain's top 10 box-office
stars. His willingness to play a young hoodlum befriended by a
psychiatrist (Alexander Knox) in Losey's film noir ``The Sleeping
Tiger'' (1954) gave Losey a fresh start in England after he fled a
subpoena from the House Un-American Activities Committee.
</P>
<P>
   After Bogarde's performance as the bumbling young Simon Sparrow
in ``Doctor in the House,'' he was England's top box-office star in
1955, 1957, 1958 and 1959.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his career, Bogarde resisted offers from Hollywood.
But he did go to Hollywood once, to play the composer Franz Liszt
in the mediocre ``Song Without End'' (1960).
</P>
<P>
   In 1963, in London, he starred opposite Judy Garland in her last
film, the musical ``I Could Go On Singing.'' His other American
films _ ``The Fixer'' (1968) and ``Justine'' (1969) _ were made
abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Waylaid by fame and often resenting it, Bogarde retreated from
the stage, from easy stardom and, finally, from England.
</P>
<P>
   In 1969, he bought a house in the south of France and lived
there with his manager and companion Anthony Forward. Forward, who
was formerly married to Glynis Johns, the actress, shared Bogarde's
life for 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   After Forward's death, Bogarde lived quietly in a small London
apartment. Information on survivors was not immediately available.

SOSA'S SEASON LACKS BUZZ OF '98
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ When Sammy Sosa hit 66 home runs and won the
National League Most Valuable Player Award last season, he enjoyed
his place behind Mark McGwire in the chase for Roger Maris' home
run record and the overall resurrection of baseball.
</P>
<P>
   His smile and enthusiasm breathed life into the game, but he
always deferred to McGwire by calling him ``the man'' and saying
that the most important thing was reaching the playoffs, which the
Cubs did as the wild card.
</P>
<P>
   This year is no different, although neither McGwire nor Sosa is
on last year's home-run pace. But while McGwire, who hit 70 homers
in 1998, still draws a crush of fan and media attention for every
swing, Sosa no longer seems part of the phenomenon. The Cubs are
11th in the National League in road attendance.
</P>
<P>
   When McGwire and the St. Louis Cardinals played last month at
Dodger Stadium, two of the three games drew crowds of nearly
54,000. But the advance sale for the Cubs' three-game series that
begins here Monday night is barely 30,000.
</P>
<P>
   Granted it is a weekday series and the Cardinals played on a
weekend. And the Cubs, with many fans in Los Angeles, usually pull
in an excellent walk-up crowd.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers will be opening the gates a half-hour early to let
fans watch Sosa take batting practice. But the buzz is not the
same.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't say the fans have forgotten, but they seem to follow
McGwire more,'' said Dodgers right fielder Raul Mondesi. ``In the
Dominican, though, you can't believe what Sammy means to everyone.
But things have quieted down.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs have been competitive this season despite a lack of
overall power. Sosa hit his seventh home run Saturday. He isn't
even the top home run hitter in his own country _ that honor going
to the Cardinals' Fernando Tatis, who is tied for the major-league
lead with 11.
</P>
<P>
   But one should remember that Sosa didn't get rolling last year
until June, when he hit a record 20 homers. The ivy on the outfield
walls of Wrigley Field is just starting to turn green.
</P>
<P>
   The club also is in a power shortage. After hitting a
club-record 212 last year, the team is ranked 11th in the National
League, even after hitting five in Tuesday's 13-12 win over
Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   That game was memorable for Cubs first baseman Mark Grace, who
hit his first grand slam in his 1,630th big-league game. But there
is another drought as well.
</P>
<P>
   Before that game, the Cubs had failed to homer in eight
consecutive games (April 25-Monday). No other major-league team has
gone more than six games without a homer this year.
</P>
<P>
   During those eight games, however, the Cubs went 6-2 and remain
close to Houston and St. Louis in the National League Central.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, we went eight games without a home run, but we got six
wins,'' Sosa said. ``Sometimes you don't need a home run to win a
game.'' &QL;

U.S. TRIES TO LIMIT POLICY DAMAGE FROM BOMBING OF CHINA EMBASSY

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration struggled Saturday to
prevent the accidental bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade
from either hobbling NATO's air campaign or stifling the nascent
diplomatic search for a way to end the war over Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The White House said the American ambassador in Beijing, James
Sasser, had apologized to the Chinese government and would continue
to provide Chinese officials with information on how the accident
happened.
</P>
<P>
   In an attempt to show sympathy with China, administration
officials said NATO would guarantee safe passage for a Chinese
plane being sent to Belgrade to evacuate embassy staff members who
survived the bombing. But there was no suggestion of any letup in
the airstrikes, a step urged by both China and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The attack against the Chinese Embassy came just as the
diplomatic process to end the Kosovo war had begun to gather steam,
raising concerns that the efforts could stall, particularly at the
U.N. Security Council, where China and Russia are both permanent
members and denounced the attack overnight as a flagrant affront to
international order.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, speaking to reporters in Del City, Okla.,
where he inspected tornado damage, described the embassy bombing as
a ``tragic mistake.'' But he insisted that the alliance's
airstrikes would continue until President Slobodan Milosevic of
Yugoslavia accepted NATO's terms, including a NATO military
presence to enforce a peace in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Russian denunciations of the bombing as barbaric,
Clinton replied: ``Well, it isn't barbaric. What is barbaric is
what Mr. Milosevic has done. What is barbaric is the intentional
ethnic cleansing that he has provoked for a decade now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that Russia recognizes that, which is why they have
shown so much leadership on the diplomatic front,'' he said. ``And
I would encourage them to stay on that course.''
</P>
<P>
   The Russian envoy, ViktorChernomyrdin, was in Germany Saturday
for talks with Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and was expected to
move on to Belgrade on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Western allies are banking on Russia's and China's support
for a Security Council resolution to authorize an international
security force in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Administration and NATO officials expressed confidence that the
emotional outpourings in Beijing, in Moscow and at the United
Nations, where China called an emergency session that lasted hours
past midnight Saturday, would be short-lived. They even suggested
that the accident might actually add urgency to the diplomatic
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will just have to ride it out,'' a senior administration
official said. ``Everyone recognizes this is an unfortunate
development.''
</P>
<P>
   The official said the administration had prepared itself for
more civilian casualties and mistaken hits as the price of a more
expanded air campaign, but had not counted on hitting the embassy
of a key Security Council member. There was little doubt that the
NATO military planners would take extreme caution in the coming
days about their targeting, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from the United States and other NATO countries said
they were prepared for some days of anger over the incident but
argued that since a U.N. resolution on the security force was at
least some weeks away, the accident need not affect the final vote.
It was unlikely, they said, that if Russia backed a resolution,
China would stand alone and veto it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe there is broad agreement to the contours of a
settlement and that the Chinese would not block it,'' a spokesman
for the National security Council, David Leavy, said.
</P>
<P>
   National Security Adviser Sandy Berger met with U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan at the White House on Saturday. Leavy
said Berger had expressed regret but had vowed that the air
campaign would go on. Before the meeting, Annan, speaking to
reporters briefly in Washington before addressing graduates at the
Howard University commencement, said he was ``rather shocked''
about the damage to the embassy.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a reason for continuing peace talks,'' he said. ``I
hope it will not unduly complicate our search for peace.''
</P>
<P>
   But he added, ``Obviously it is not going to make matters
easy.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon said Saturday that the accidental bombing of the
embassy would not affect the basic direction of its air campaign.
There will be no pauses in the bombing, said Pentagon spokesman
Kenneth H. Bacon, nor will NATO give advance warning of its targets
to neutral parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``NATO is determined to continue this campaign and to intensify
the campaign,'' Bacon said. ``I don't anticipate there will be a
pause. In fact, I see that there will be broadening attacks as NATO
continues to work toward its goals.''
</P>
<P>
   The round-the-clock air campaign has grown to include around 600
missions daily.
</P>
<P>
   In a step toward a diplomatic solution, the Russians agreed with
the Western allies on Thursday that a security force was necessary
in Kosovo to guarantee the return of the ethnic Albanian refugees.
</P>
<P>
   There are still considerable gaps between Russia and the allies
on the composition of the force, and Saturday administration
officials said they doubted that the embassy incident would
fundamentally affect those discussions.
</P>
<P>
   It was possible, a NATO official said, that the attack could
weaken the hand of the allies a little as they bargained with the
Russians on the composition of the force, which presumably will
enter Kosovo with the assent of Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   But overall, this official said, the attack should ``encourage
the Russians to be more forthright in sorting out the problems and
encourage the Russians to lean on Milosevic.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana called the bombing of the
embassy ``a tragic mistake.'' Apparently determined to show that it
would not deflect attention from the military campaign, NATO and
administration officials stressed Saturday the successful hits in
Belgrade on Friday night, including a bunker complex they said was
used by Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Solana said in a statement in Brussels that NATO would continue
its military campaign and at the same time back the diplomatic
track.
</P>
<P>
   ``NATO is prepared to suspend its airstrikes once Belgrade has
unequivocally accepted the five key conditions set down by the
North Atlantic Council for a peaceful settlement of the conflict,''
Solana said. ``NATO will continue to support all attempts at a
diplomatic solution which respect these conditions.''

CLINTON TOURS AREAS HIT BY TORNADOES
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Houston Chronicle &QL;
</P>
<P>
   DEL CITY, Okla. _ Calling it the worst tornado devastation he
has ever seen, President Clinton toured hard hit areas Saturday and
tried to encourage Oklahomans to rebuild strong, safe
neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   State and federal officials still are adding up the damage from
the massive tornadoes that hit Oklahoma and Kansas last Monday but
various counts have placed the number of homes destroyed at 3,400
with more than 10,000 buildings damaged.
</P>
<P>
   The death toll stood at 41 Saturday, although four people remain
missing. More than 750 people were injured and many remain
hospitalized.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to give some measure of comfort and hope to victims of
the devastating storms, Clinton spent several hours listening to
stories of heroic survival and heart-wrenching loss, as Oklahomans
recounted their horrific ordeals for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been going to these (disaster) sites for 20 years and
this is the most devastating tornado I have ever seen,'' Clinton
told several hundred residents of the Del Air neighborhood, where
dozens of homes were ripped from their foundations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never seen so much complete destruction of homes over
so wide an area,''' he said, following a tour by helicopter of one
tornado path that cleared a swath a half-mile wide in some places
and nearly 60 miles long.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton addressed the Del Air residents amid piles of debris.
Furniture, clothing, bent and twisted bicycles, damaged cars and
splintered timbers were resting where they were dropped by the
winds. As he spoke, some families continued to pick through the
remnants of their lives, trying to clean up what was left. For
some, there was nothing left to sort through.
</P>
<P>
   One middle-aged couple planted an American flag atop what was
left of their home, a pile of rubble, as Clinton approached the
area accompanied by Oklahoma Gov. Frank Keating.
</P>
<P>
   They were miffed at Clinton's visit here, not because they
dislike him, but because it interrupted the cleanup efforts their
community had organized.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to get on with it, and rebuild in a new place,''
said Robert Sieger.
</P>
<P>
   But while the Siegers were frustrated by Clinton's visit, dozens
of their neighbors said they were glad to see the president on hand
to witness what they'd been through.
</P>
<P>
   ``How else can our leaders know the kind of pain people have
been through unless they see it for themselves,'' said one young
woman whose home was destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   She cried when Clinton told the crowd, ``Our hearts go out to
those who have lost so much and especially to the families of those
people who lost their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Preliminary assessments indicate the tornadoes also destroyed
hundreds of small businesses, a high school, an entire shopping
mall and other commercial and public facilities. The storms,
officials said, left behind more than 220 million cubic yards of
debris, most of it unsalvageable. In all, they said the damage is
likely to exceed $250 million just in the Oklahoma City-Del City
area.
</P>
<P>
   Before his arrival here, Clinton announced in his weekly radio
address that the federal government would provide $12 million in
assistance to help create an estimated 3,500 jobs across 11
counties that were hardest hit by the storms. The money will be
used to put people who lost their jobs to the tornadoes back to
work for up to six months helping to rebuild their communities.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the temporary jobs would be primarily in
construction and relief efforts aimed at making sure people are
supplied with food, shelter and other necessities.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the employment aid, Clinton also said he plans to
ask Congress for an additional $372 million to help replenish the
nation's disaster relief fund, which is administered by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency.
</P>
<P>
   He encouraged the crowd to take advantage of the federal loan
programs being offered by FEMA and build what he called ``safe
closets'' in the new homes they plan to construct. ``The average
cost of these safe closets is only about $2,000,'' he said. ``If
you don't remember anything else I say today, remember this: For
goodness sake, build a safe room in your house when you rebuild.
</P>
<P>
   ``The federal government has a responsibility to provide
individuals with the tools they need to improve their own lives,''
Clinton in his radio address. ``That's what we're doing in Oklahoma
this week. Natural disasters test our faith, but they also show us
that the old-fashioned American values of neighborly care and
concern are still very much alive. And they remind us of the
enduring power of the American people to emerge from calamities
even stronger.''
</P>
<P>
   The American Red Cross was scheduled to open service centers
today in Moore, Guthrie, Dover, Tuttle, Del City and Mulhall.
</P>
<P>
   At least three FEMA service centers, where storm victims can
pursue requests for federal financial assistance, including some
lost income, are expected to open early this week.
</P>
<P>
   While FEMA normally requires storm victims to register within
days for possible financial aid, Clinton on Saturday extended the
deadline by 30 days for victims of Oklahoma's storms.
</P>
<P>
   After touching down at Tinker Air Force Base in Air Force One,
Clinton took to the skies again by helicopter for a tour of several
areas that were reduced to rubble when one tornado cut a path a
half-mile wide and at least 12 miles long.
</P>
<P>
   The tornadoes that ripped through Oklahoma, Kansas and parts of
Texas were part of a swarm that the National Weather Service
reported Monday across the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   The list of missing increased from three to four between Friday
and Saturday, a spokesman for the Oklahoma chief medical examiner's
office said.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Edward Nelson, 40, was on the missing list on Thursday but
was removed after a friend called the medical examiner's office and
said he'd been seen after Monday's tornado. The information later
was found to be inaccurate and Nelson was placed back on the list
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson was believed to be in Midwest City when the storm struck.
</P>
<P>
   For thousands of children in tornado-stricken areas, the school
year is essentially over, said Sandy Garrett, Oklahoma
superintendent of public schools. Some schools can't reopen and
others will reopen only briefly, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Garrett said most school records survived the storm. Only
records at a high school destroyed in Moore will be hard to
re-create, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Amazingly, the list of dead from the nighttime storm included no
school-age children.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it had been in the day time, I fear we would have had many
more fatalities, particularly because of the fact that Kelly
Elementary in Moore was totally destroyed,'' Garrett said. ``The
hallway is where we usually tell them to go in tornado evacuations
and that hallway is no longer there.''
</P>
<P>
   Two area schools were destroyed and five damaged beyond repair
for this school year, Garrett said.

   While publicly confident that the attack on the embassy would
not have a lasting impact on their diplomatic efforts, the
administration appeared to be doing what it could to mollify the
Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright was trying to call the
Chinese foreign minister, Tang Jiaxuan, to express her sympathy, a
State Department spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, the State Department said it deeply regretted
the loss of life in the bombing, in which at least three people
were killed. The United States still looks forward to working with
China on matters of mutual concern, including the Kosovo crisis,
the statement added.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, inspecting tornado damage in Oklahoma, has
not been involved in talking to the Chinese, a White House
spokesman said. He was expected, however, to comment on the bombing
later Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the outward confidence, the strike against the Chinese
Embassy comes as relations between Washington and Beijing have
soured over a number of issues. The Chinese have been very critical
of the NATO assaults against Yugoslavia, largely because they fear
that a precedent is being set that could allow interference in
Tibet. Trade disputes and allegations of Chinese espionage have
complicated relations further.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese showed earlier this year how they can wield their
diplomatic weight when they vetoed a Security Council resolution to
extend the mandate for a United Nations peacekeeping operation in
Macedonia. The veto was an expression of China's anger at
Macedonia's diplomatic recognition of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   At an emergency session of the Security Council called by the
Chinese at midnight on Friday night, emotions ran high. After hours
in closed-door session, the council expressed ``shock and concern''
over casualties at the embassy. In an open session, China and
Russia condemned NATO.
</P>
<P>
   China called the strike a ``war crime.'' The Russian delegate to
the United Nations, Sergei V. Lavrov, accused NATO of trying to
``destroy world order.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States has not had an chief delegate ambassador to
the United Nations since last summer. Its representative, Peter
Burleigh, apologized to the council for the mistaken attack and
urged council members to keep `the big picture' in mind as the
United Nations became a forum for seeking a diplomatic end to the
war.
</P>
<P>
   In Moscow, President Boris Yeltsin called on NATO to end the
bombing and said the attack on the embassy was a ``gross violation
of international law.''
</P>

<P>
   He ordered his foreign minister, Igor S. Ivanov, to cancel a
long-planned trip to visit the British foreign minister, Robin
Cook, at his country home over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   But after speaking with Ivanov by telephone, Cook played down
the cancellation, saying the Russian minister remained supportive
of the principles set out on Thursday in Germany by the Western
allies and Russia to end the war.
</P>
<P>
   As the NATO allies expressed regret, there was heightened
criticism of NATO in other parts of the world. In New Delhi, the
Indian government said the continued air campaign contributed to
greater instability in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   Emotions ran high at a Security Council session called by China
on Friday night. China called the strike a ``war crime.'' The
Russian delegate to the United Nations, Sergey Lavrov, accused NATO
of trying to ``destroy world order.''

SUNS STUMBLE DOWN STRETCH IN LOSS TO BLAZERS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. _ Experience in the postseason was supposed to be
the Suns' ace in the hole during their first-round playoff series
against the youthful Portland Trail Blazers.
</P>
<P>
   But it was the Suns who lost their poise, made mental mistakes
on the defensive end and rushed too many shots during the crucial
final minutes of Game 1 Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The Trail Blazers exploited those blunders and Portland guard
Isaiah Rider, who may not show up for shootarounds but didn't miss
much else, scored 25 points to lead the Trail blazers past Phoenix,
95-85, at the Rose Garden.
</P>
<P>
   With the victory, the Trail Blazers placed pressure on the Suns
to win Game 2 Monday night in the best-of-five series that will
return to Phoenix for Game 3 and, if necessary, Game 4.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was right there,'' said Suns guard Jason Kidd, wincing at
the thought of an opportunity lost. ``We got kind of quick
offensively. We have to be more patient. We knew we were close, and
I still think this was a good game for us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Suns led, 73-72, with 7:34 to play after Danny Manning's
18-foot shot, and they got there on a day when Rex Chapman was
again struggling to hit shots, center Luc Longley had been eclipsed
by Portland's Arvydas Sabonis and Kidd was playing only like an
All-Star instead of a Most Valuable Player.
</P>
<P>
   They were ahead despite getting pounded in the paint by the
Trail Blazers and seemingly having no way to stop Rider.
</P>
<P>
   But just as they had in three regular-season losses to Portland,
the Suns crumbled in the final minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their defense disrupted us down the stretch,'' Suns Coach
Danny Ainge said. ``We lost our poise offensively, and we had two
breakdowns defensively on two three-point baskets that were mental
lapses. Those were backbreakers at a crucial time of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   With Manning and George McCloud combining to score 29 points off
the bench, the Suns were in position to steal the first game and
put some serious doubt in the minds of a Portland team that had
lost four of its last five regular-season games. And the Trail
Blazers are attempting to exorcise the demons of six consecutive
first-round exits from the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   But after Manning's shot, the Trail Blazers went on a 13-2 run.
The Suns played as if they had rarely been in the postseason,
turning the ball over five times and making just one of six shots
during the decisive stretch.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's more pressure on you when you're the home team,'' said
Portland guard Greg Anthony, whose defense on Kidd was a critical
factor in the outcome. ``If they get a win, then that changes the
whole way the series is going to be played. We were fortunate to do
what we had to do. Nothing has been accomplished yet. We were
supposed to win at home and we did. They probably feel a little bit
better about themselves because they did some good things in this
game as well.''
</P>
<P>
   The Suns agreed with that point.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know they know we can beat them,'' said McCloud, who scored
15 points and had six rebounds. ``Without a doubt, we know we can
beat them. It's up to us to go out and make them play bad Monday.''
</P>
<P>
   The Suns were beaten on the boards, 46-34, but didn't feel as if
they lost that battle. They had seven second-chance points off of
six offensive rebounds and the Trail Blazers had only four off of
seven offensive boards.
</P>
<P>
   Ainge said he'd have taken those numbers before tip-off.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a focus for us,'' he said. ``They outrebounded us,
but a lot of that was our bad shooting. I believe we can win Game
2, and if we do it will still be a successful trip to Portland.''
</P>
<P>
   The end came abruptly for the Suns as they got impatient when it
mattered most.
</P>
<P>
   Kidd turned the ball over and Jimmy Jackson converted for a
74-73 Portland lead with 6:58 to go. McCloud, who had shot the Suns
into the lead, missed an open three-pointer from the corner and
Rider scored at the other end.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson forced a three-point shot, Gugliotta turned it over,
Kidd finally scored, but McCloud missed another three-pointer and
Rider scored again at the other end. When Kidd forced yet another
three-point shot from 24 feet, and Gugliotta put up another that
missed from long range, the Suns were forced to foul.
</P>
<P>
   And the Trail Blazers made 14 of 16 free-throw attempts in the
final 2:57 to seal the win. &QL;

MORE QUESTIONS THAN ANSWERS AS COYOTES HEAD INTO OFFSEASON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 Analysis 
 By BOB MCMANAMAN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - They were two minutes and one second away from a
second chance, another life. Just 121 ticks from a second overtime
and maybe, just maybe, the second round of the Stanley Cup
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   But it all came screeching to a halt for the Coyotes with one
redirected shot in a scoreless game. A fluke, really. Scott Young's
shot somehow clipped the stick of Pierre Turgeon and the deflection
was too quick for Nikolai Khabibulin. Bing, bang, boom and lose.
Game 7 and the first-round series went to the St. Louis Blues.
</P>
<P>
   They came close, but another early playoff exit _ the team's
eighth straight _ once again has spurred questions about the
Coyotes. Where did they go wrong? How much did injuries really play
a factor? Was there enough depth? Enough chemistry? Did they make
the right trades?
</P>
<P>
   Is the head coach safe? Is the general manager safe? Will the
team payroll, which ranks among the bottom third in the NHL, be
further slashed by an owner who already is claiming losses of $5
million annually?
</P>
<P>
   Everyone's asking questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the club we have right now,'' forward Rick Tocchet said,
``are we good enough to go to the Stanley Cup Finals? Have we
improved? Do we just need to keep everybody together, add a few
people, a couple free agents? We can do it. Everybody believes it.
Of course, it's easy to say that the next day after you get blown
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Jim Schoenfeld will learn within the next two weeks
whether he will get blown out. The players want him back for a
third season, but it's now out of their control. Had the Coyotes
eliminated St. Louis, however, it probably wouldn't be an issue. It
never has been for Schoenfeld.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing that matters to me, and I've said this before,
is while I do it, I give everything I can for them to perform at
their highest level,'' he said before the playoffs began. ``If it
isn't good enough, make the (coaching) change. Or if it's not
deemed good enough, make the change. I have the Stanley Cup dreams
of my players, and that is so much more important than my future in
the organization.''
</P>
<P>
   What about the future of General Manager Bobby Smith? Owner
Richard Burke secretly signed him to a three-year contract
extension earlier in the season, but Smith has said his job should
come under scrutiny if the Coyotes continue to falter in the first
round.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, Smith's name has been linked to persistent rumors
concerning a top front office position with the expansion Minnesota
Wild, which begins play in the 2000-2001 season. But if the Wild
wants Smith, it will want him sooner rather than later to help
shape team strategy and make key hires.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a contract, and I've said it before, as long as
Richard's here with this team, I'll be here if he wants me,'' said
Smith, who spent nine of his 15 NHL seasons as a player with the
North Stars, who made him the first overall pick in the 1978 draft.
</P>
<P>
   It's conceivable that Schoenfeld ``and'' Smith could be gone. If
Burke and the Coyotes lose the stadium district vote May 18, so
could a star player or two in order to pare the budget.
</P>
<P>
   But one of them won't be star center Jeremy Roenick, who made a
dramatic return in Game 7 of the playoffs despite a surgically
repaired broken jaw and a fractured thumb that wasn't completely
healed. According to team sources, Roenick, 29, has been assured he
won't be traded during the off-season.
</P>
<P>
   The popular Roenick has put a face on Burke's team, has given it
an image to howl about. Dealing him away in a cost-cutting move
could be even more desperate than cutting off one's nose to spite
his face.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very confident I'll finish my career in Phoenix,'' said
Roenick, the team's leading scorer this past season, who has two
years remaining on a five-year, $20 million contract.
</P>
<P>
   Not having JR for the first six games of the Blues series,
thanks to Derian Hatcher of the Dallas Stars, was critical. So was
the loss of hard-working Finnish forward Juha Ylonen, who suffered
a fractured foot at the hands of an Al MacInnis slap shot in Game
1. Additionally, the Coyotes were without left wings Greg Adams and
Mike Sullivan for much of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we have a healthy team to start the playoffs,'' Roenick
said, ``we're playing Dallas right now in the second round. No
question.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe. But the Coyotes have went to the injury card all three
years now since relocating from Winnipeg. In 1997, they blamed
losing Roenick to a knee in jury in Game 6 for getting eliminated
in seven games by Anaheim. In 1998, it was groin pulls to
Khabibulin and defenseman Teppo Numminen that hurt their chances in
a six-game series with Detroit. And now this.
</P>
<P>
   But don't forget, the Coyotes had a 3-1 series lead against
Blues. Without Roenick. Without Ylonen. And for the most part,
without Adams.
</P>
<P>
   Some detractors might say they also were without Robert Reichel,
the skillful center from the Czech Republic who virtually
disappeared in the postseason. He had three assists but only one
goal, and he looked nothing like he did the first two weeks after
Smith acquired him from the New York Islanders just before the
trading deadline for Brad Isbister and a swap of draft picks.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem was Reichel's refusal to carry the puck
through neutral ice and create. Too often, he simply stopped at the
blue line and dumped the puck in and let others chase after it.
Schoenfeld tried having Reichel operate behind the net, but that
didn't solve the problem.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Reichel's linemates struggled just as badly. Keith
Tkachuk had one goal. Tocchet had none. And now Reichel, who
becomes a restricted Group II free agent on July 1, will demand to
have his $1.7 million salary almost doubled or he will return to
the Czech Republic permanently.
</P>
<P>
   If that happens, the team would be wise to go after a
second-line center on the free agent market such as Vincent
Damphousse, whom they liked almost every bit as much as Reichel.
Damphousse, who wound up with the San Jose Sharks, will go into the
corners to bang for a puck.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the Coyotes already had a pretty good No. 2 center
behind Roenick in veteran Cliff Ronning, who had seven points in
the team's first seven games. But then he was dealt to Nashville
for future considerations as a way to dump some salary and give the
ice time to rookie Daniel Briere. It didn't work. Though incredibly
gifted, Briere wasn't ready. From an offensive standpoint, neither
was Ylonen.
</P>
<P>
   But that problem was cloaked by the Coyotes' 17-5-3 record in
the 25 games after the Ronning trade on Halloween. The first line
dominated during the stretch, Khabibulin was on fire, and the
defense was holding opponents to two goals or less almost every
game.
</P>
<P>
   The blue liners, though, eventually broke down. A shoulder
injury to newcomer Jyrki Lumme affected the Finnish defenseman for
the entire second half of the season. It was so bad that he could
barely fire a shot from the point. But he kept playing anyway
because he could weave through traffic and pass.
</P>
<P>
   Numminen, the Iron Finn who has appeared in 297 consecutive
regular season games, the second-longest active streak in the NHL,
also could have used rest late in the year. He had tired legs as
the playoffs wore on, and many, including a handful of players,
thought he _ or Schoenfeld _ should have ended the streak for the
good of the team.
</P>
<P>
   And where was Oleg Tverdovsky? Two seasons removed from an
All-Star appearance, when he finished fourth among NHL defensemen
with 55 points, the 22-year-old Russian took a major slide. The
fifth-year pro never got it going and was ridiculed throughout much
of the season. It got so bad that Schoenfeld benched him for Game 7
against the Blues.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got to be a better player,'' Tocchet said. ``His heart is
there, he's just got to find his focus.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith said he intends to re-sign the restricted free agent, but
many NHL insiders expect Tverdovsky to be dealt this summer.
Depending on where the Coyotes are next March, Tocchet could be
history as well. The Coyotes hold a one-year option on him for next
season, but he easily could be trading deadline fodder because
Smith likely won't sign the 35-year-old to an extension.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like our team,'' Tkachuk said, ``and I want everybody back.
. . . I feel confident this team is going to make a big jump next
year. We're getting better and better, and we've built a solid
base.'' &QL;

SUITES NO LONGER A LUXURY FOR STADIUM BUILDERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LES POLK  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Back in the late 1980s, luxury suites became all the
rage in professional sports as the National Basketball Association
kicked off a building boom in new sports facilities across America.
</P>
<P>
   Now, a suite is just a suite. It's no longer a luxury. You can't
put up a major new sports building anymore without them.
</P>
<P>
   Those luxury suites and premium club seats that came on the
scene as splendid new hangouts for corporate America and fans with
cash to burn gave the first wave of smart team owners the momentum
to generate the money to build new facilities and ratchet up
revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, for one season, 1992-93, the Phoenix Suns led the
National Basketball Assocation in revenue, playing at America West
Arena in just the 19th-largest market and with the eighth-highest
ticket prices.
</P>
<P>
   Now suites, club seats and the occasional personal seat licenses
that go with them are an absolute necessity for survival, a
permanent part of the sports scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important because the other teams have these streams of
revenue available to sign free agents and stay competitive,'' said
Michael Bidwill, vice president and general counsel of the
Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   From high schools to universities to professional sports, suites
and premium seats have become the sweet road to financial success
for pro teams and amateur athletics programs.
</P>
<P>
   And if you think the Cardinals and Coyotes should be content
with what's available to them at Sun Devil Stadium and America West
Arena, respectively, think again. It's simple: The pot is bigger if
you play in your own building, and the revenue is all yours.
</P>
<P>
   That means better players, better revenue, and if the team is
successful, a better bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   From Ravenna (Ohio) High School's ongoing campaign to sell seat
licenses for construction of a new football stadium to more than
two dozen major universities with luxury suites to every big-league
sports facility being built, suites and their sidekicks are the
cash cow that drives the buildings and helps owners and athletic
departments keep up with their competitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the only vehicle given today's NFL economic structure
that separates the haves from the have-nots,'' said Rick Horrow,
facility development consultant for the NFL and a visiting expert
on sports law at Harvard University who has worked closely with the
Cardinals on the stadium component of Rio Salado Crossing. ``Suites
are an absolutely critical component of the modern-day sports
facility,''
</P>
<P>
   NFL teams share a lucrative TV pot to the tune of $70 million
for each team this season, but they don't have to share the revenue
from suites, club seats, signage, stadium naming rights, parking
and other cash sources.
</P>
<P>
   With that much TV revenue _ double the amount just two years ago
_ suites may be less important to the NFL than to other sports,
particularly the NHL, where teams get only $4 million to $5 million
a year in TV revenue. But they're still a key component.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Dorsey, executive director of the Cincinnati-based
Association of Luxury Suites Directors, said suites have become the
driving force for arenas and stadiums in the '90s.
</P>
<P>
   The organization has grown to 700 members representing
facilities in North America, Australia and England.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suites are what get the buildings built,'' he said. ``Banks
will not accept if's, then's and possibilities based on projected
attendance. Suites represent guaranteed leases and revenue. They're
a funding tool to plan debt service.''
</P>
<P>
   Suite revenue also provides teams with more money to sign
players.
</P>
<P>
   The Dallas Cowboys, for example, have 378 suites.
</P>
<P>
   ``That gives them a huge advantage,'' Dorsey said. ``It's one of
the reasons they can sign a lot of players.''
</P>
<P>
   Another moneymaker is personal seat licenses, where you pay a
sum for the right to purchase tickets to games for your seats.
</P>
<P>
   At the Toronto Maple Leafs' new Air Canada Centre, 1,500 PSLs
were sold for $15,000 each _ in addition to the building's 150
suites.
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes and Cardinals have no plans for selling seat
licenses should they get new facilities built.
</P>
<P>
   For the Coyotes' president, Shawn Hunter, the new building
itself _ holding about 18,000 unobstructed-view seats for hockey,
20,000 seats for other events such as concerts, 1,500 to 2,000 club
seats and 65 to 70 suites _ would provide enough revenue
opportunities to turn the franchise around.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teams with new venues and revenue streams have been able to go
out and spend new money on players, both for the cream of the crop
and to add depth,'' Hunter said.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter said the Coyotes' total player salaries ranked 19th of 27
teams in the NHL, and that their other expenses _ front office,
marketing, etc. _ ranked 24th.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like we're running a good, tight ship,'' Hunter said.
``But we underachieve at the bottom line.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the Coyotes were losing $6 million to $10 million a year
playing at America West Arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to run a viable business,'' Hunter said. ``This is a
very exciting business, but it is a business. Staying at America
West is a formula for disaster for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the National Football League, the NHL has no cap on
salaries.
</P>
<P>
   But the Coyotes said they'd reached a cap on revenue at America
West Arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's as good as it gets right now,'' Hunter said.
</P>
<P>
   Because of its lease, the hockey club is only allowed to use
about 5 to 6 percent of the total signage in the building and has
access to 72 of 84 suites, although that might grow next year,
Hunter said.
</P>
<P>
   They sell 58 to 60 suites for the season at $45,000, and the
rest go for individual games or partial-season tickets. And Hunter
said the team got a ``competitive share of concessions.''
</P>
<P>
   The difference at the new building _ for which the Coyotes would
pay 100 percent of the estimated $140 million to $150 million in
construction costs _ is controlling all revenues (receipts,
marketing, suites, concessions).
</P>
<P>
   ``All the things we really don't have access to now,'' Hunter
said.
</P>
<P>
   Hockey and baseball have similar financial pressures because
neither has a player salary cap.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll never see a building without (suites) again,'' said
Jerry Colangelo, Diamondbacks managing general partner and Suns
president. ``That's just a fact of life.
</P>
<P>
   ``In baseball, you need to generate all you can out of the
building.'' Bank One Ballpark has 69 suites in eight different
styles, ranging in price from $95,000 to $125,000 a year, at lease
options of seven or 10 years. For certain suites, a half-season
package is available. There also are six party suites, the swimming
pool and four kinds of premium seating.
</P>
<P>
   More than 90 percent of the suites are leased for the season
this year, and the rest are sold on a per-game basis.
</P>
<P>
   At America West Arena, the Suns' 88 suites are sold out for
five- or eight-year leases, priced at $100,000 or $110,000. There
also are six party suites available on a game-by-game basis.
</P>
<P>
   Another important revenue producer is concessions, especially at
Bank One Ballpark, where the Diamondbacks retain all
baseball-related revenue.
</P>
<P>
   To help generate concession revenue, the Diamondbacks had $30
million in upgrades done to the kitchens and concession facilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the largest investment ever made in a ballpark for
kitchens and concessions,'' Colangelo said.
</P>
<P>
   Why would a ballpark kitchen be important?
</P>
<P>
   Dorsey, the suites' organization director, said that although
people sitting in regular seats spend an estimated $6 to $8 on
concessions at a game, people in suites, where the food is fancier
and more expensive, spend about $30 each.
</P>
<P>
   And that's just one piece of the revenue pie.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is extreme pressure on teams and municipalities on these
building that you build into them all of these opportunities for
revenue streams,'' Colangelo said.
</P>
<P>
   Horrow, the NFL consultant assisting the Cardinals, said that if
Rio Salado were approved, the Cardinals would face ``extreme
pressure'' to sell their suites and club seats because of the
revenue demands.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cardinals have a lion's share of the risk,'' he said. ``If
the Cards' commitments don't materialize, the project ceases. Their
income sources are based on the ability to market.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals would be marketing 70 to 75 suites and 7,500 club
seats in a new stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Bidwill and Hunter both said that with the possibility of four
major league sports venues in the Valley, marketing and competitive
teams would become even more important.
</P>
<P>
   At Sun Devil Stadium, the Cardinals' original 10-year license
agreement for suites expired this year and was reworked.
</P>
<P>
   The original deal called for 60 skyboxes to be built and sold by
the Cardinals, and that for the $40,000 purchase price, holders
would have the suites for Cardinals and Arizona State University
games, plus the Fiesta Bowl
</P>
<P>
   Under the new deal, the license is split, and both ASU and the
Cardinals can sell the suites for their own games.
</P>
<P>
   The suites are being remodeled and renovated this season. There
will be 54 suites this season and two larger hospitality suites
built out of the space occupied by six regular suites.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals last year sold out their suites at $45,000 to
$65,000 a year, and sold out 5,000 club seats at $75 to $200 a
seat.
</P>
<P>
   ASU has an opportunity to increase its revenue by about $850,000
to $1 million this season because of the suite deal, assistant
athletic director Tom Collins said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody is trying to find new revenue streams,'' Collins
said.
</P>
<P>
   ASU has sold about 30 of the suites so far for prices ranging
from $19,000 to $23,000.
</P>
<P>
   Sun Devil fans can purchse the rights to a loge seat for a gift
premium of $350 to $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   With more, higher-priced suites in a modern stadium, and their
own deals on all the other revenue producers, the Cardinals would
have an opportunity to boost their revenue significantly.
</P>
<P>
   But they also will have at least a $75 million upfront
contribution to Rio Salado to pay off, and salaries that are
growing higher.
</P>
<P>
   The team has forged ahead with efforts to become more
competitive by shelling out high salaries for stars such as
quarterback Jake Plummer - not knowing whether they will have a new
facility generating more revenue or not.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cardinals are banking on the future without the business
certainty that other teams have,'' Horrow said. ``Usually a team
will not enter into long-term commitments without a stadium. That's
a very important perspective for fans to understand.''
</P>
<P>
   The Milwaukee Brewers, for example, have signed several key
players to long-term deals, banking on their new ballpark, Miller
Park, set to open next season, to help provide the additional
revenue needed to lift one of baseball's have-nots into the a
competitive situation.
</P>
<P>
   The park will have 70 suites available for $75,000 to $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   The Minnesota Twins, another have-not, have a proposed new
stadium with 52 suites, three party suites and 4,300 club seats. If
it's not built, the Twins are likely to leave for a sweeter venue
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Even successful teams with their own venues are looking for
suite deals. The St. Louis Cardinals have proposed a new $240
million baseball stadium just south of historic Busch Stadium. Why?
</P>
<P>
   Because other than raising ticket prices, revenue sources at
Busch are limited. The new park would expand concession stands,
make luxury boxes more luxurious, and add ``premium seating''
packages.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, stadiums and arenas across the country are adding
suites at a feverish pace:
</P>
<P>
   In the NFL, the Washington Redskins' new home, Jack Kent Cooke
Stadium, has 199 luxury suites, 1,506 loge seats and 14,958 club
seats.
</P>
<P>
   The Charlotte Hornets want to move from their 24,000 seat
Charlotte Coliseum built in 1988 to a new building because the
Coliseum doesn't have enough suites.
</P>
<P>
   Boston's FleetCenter, which opened in 1995, has 104 luxury boxes
that go for $158,000 to $258,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA Atlanta Hawks and expansion NHL Thrashers have already
sold out the 90 suites at Philips Arena, which opens in the fall,
at $145,000 to $225,000, and close to half the 1,800 club seats,
priced at $8,000 to $9,500.
</P>
<P>
   At the college level, Clemson University's football stadium has
100 suites that lease for $22,000 each. The University of Iowa has
17 suites which leased for 10 years at $120,000 to $180,000 a year.
The University of Wisconsin's $76.4 million Kohl Center basketball
arena has 36 luxury suites which were leased at $35,000 per season,
and Ohio State University's Schottenstein Center has 46 suites
which lease from $45,000 to $65,000.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it's a four-sport major league city such as Phoenix or a
college town, the demand for suites appears to be unprecedented.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no indication that any city has ever hit a saturation
point,'' Dorsey said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing, but there are usually sellouts at different
stadiums for different sports, especially with the economy as it
is.''

RIDER REALLY SHOWS UP FOR THIS GAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORM FRAUENHEIM  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. _ On the Trail Blazers roster, he's Isaiah. His
teammates call him J.R. There are a lot of names for Rider. But
only one fits.
</P>
<P>
   Call him wild.
</P>
<P>
   Wild Rider.
</P>
<P>
   He is a volatile mix of self-destructive elements and talent.
Handle with care.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, the Suns couldn't handle him at all. Before the
Blazers' 95-85 victory in a playoff opener, an anxious Portland fan
behind the Blazers bench held up a sign that included Rider's face
and a bomb.
</P>
<P>
   Tick-tick-tick.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the fan nor Riders' teammates knew whether to duck or
cheer. This isn't exactly a smart bomb. But, on this afternoon,
there was no implosion. Rider exploded for 25 points. He led the
Blazers to a key playoff win just a few days after it looked as if
he were leading them into a self-designed ambush.
</P>
<P>
   After scoring almost at will against Rex Chapman, George McCloud
and anybody else in a Phoenix uniform, Rider offered no apologies
for last week's misadventures. He showed up late for practices. He
was benched. He left the bench during a game.
</P>
<P>
   But he did talk. He talked the way he scored _ constantly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't feel like an apology was really necessary,'' said
Rider, who had 16 of his points in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   But an explanation was.
</P>
<P>
   Rider said he met a few days ago with Blazers General Manager
Bob Whitsitt, Coach Mike Dunleavy and his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my conversation with Whitsitt, he told me `We need you to
win,' '' said Rider, who began to exploit a mismatch with Chapman
in the game's opening moments. ``He said: `If you don't do what we
need you to do, there will be consequences. So, what are you going
to do?'
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, today was my answer.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, Rider said he spoke to his teammates, who were hearing
speculation that their late-season skid was rooted in a locker room
that had begun to boil over with angry impatience at his
unpredictability.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a good, healthy talk,'' said Rider, who has been in and
out of trouble and, a couple of years ago, offended the city of
Portland with comments that painted the entire community as racist.
``It was nothing too serious.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anyone was distracted, I'm sorry for that. But if we're
friends, I told them to pick me up, watch my back, let me play my
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get down on myself sometimes. I said: `You know, if I miss
three shots in a row, I get down.' I told `em, `When I do, tap me
on the shoulder. Let me know. Tell me to just keep playing.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Rider said his playing problems were not the result of
distractions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are your distractions, not mine,'' he said. ``Look, I
don't read the newspapers. I don't watch channel
whatever-whatever-whatever.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sensitive. I don't want all that stuff getting into my
head. If things are going on around me, I can feel the vibes. But I
just want to focus on playing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Truth is, I haven't been playing well since March 11, the day
before my birthday. It's just good to get into a rhythm. It's
gut-check time. Time for me to step up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying to be assertive.''
</P>
<P>
   Rider boldly predicted that he would be that and more a few days
ago when he flatly said the Suns could not stop the Blazers from
scoring. Above all, they couldn't stop him.
</P>
<P>
   Exploitation of the Rider-Chapman mismatch was a key to
Portland's game plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chap is a small cat,'' Rasheed Wallace said. `J.R. is a true
big guard. It's definitely a mismatch.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can see it just by looking at it. Once J.R. gets going, it
time to just feed him. Treat him like a pig.''
</P>
<P>
   And just hope the other guy gets slaughtered. &QL;

AINGE FACES TOUGH DECISIONS ON CHAPMAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB YOUNG  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. _ Suns Coach Danny Ainge admits he faces some
tough choices with the Suns down 0-1 in their best-of-five
first-round series with Portland.
</P>
<P>
   Does he stick with guard Rex Chapman, whose regular-season
shooting woes carried into a Game 1 loss as he hit three of 12
shots? Portland guard Isaiah Rider is a tough defensive matchup for
the smaller Chapman, and he scored 25 points to lead the Blazers to
victory.
</P>
<P>
   Or does Ainge go to George McCloud or Chris Morris, who at
6-foot-8 are big enough to guard Rider when he tries to post-up
low? Both are good shooters, but a good portion of the Suns'
offense is designed for Chapman coming off screens.
</P>
<P>
   Or does Ainge just try to adjust defensively, send a second
defender more quickly to help Chapman and hope that doesn't create
opportunities for the rest of the Blazers?
</P>
<P>
   ``George is a better defender against Rider,'' Ainge said. ``If
Rex doesn't make enough shots to warrant his presence on the court,
that's the dilemma we have.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a lot of confidence in Rex, and we knew that was going
to be a tough (defensive) matchup for us. I will say this: It
wasn't just Rex not defending (Rider). Our plan was for Rex to
force him to certain places on the floor. Our help was late getting
there, or nonexistent.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There were times when Rex did his job and other guys didn't do
theirs.''
</P>
<P>
   The Suns will live with the defensive shortcomings if Chapman
starts hitting shots, and when he confidently knocked in a
17-footer on his first attempt, they figured he was off and
running.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' Chapman said flatly. ``I don't think making the first
one means much. I felt good. There aren't any excuses, I just need
to make open shots. I had a few that bobbled in and out. It happens
sometime.''
</P>
<P>
   It happened too often for Ainge, who went with McCloud at the
start of the fourth quarter and stuck with him until the final
minutes when the Suns trailed and he put all his three-point
shooters on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   McCloud hit a couple of big three-point shots in a
fourth-quarter run that gave the Suns the lead, but he missed two
down the stretch as Portland mounted a 13-2 run and took control.
</P>
<P>
   Controlling Rider isn't easy. Just ask Portland Coach Mike
Dunleavy. But the Suns have to adjust for Game 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just have to guard his (butt),'' McCloud said. ``There's
not much you can do when the guy gets it going. He gets confidence,
and then they're going to stay with him and keep going to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Ainge said the Suns needed to ``mix it up'' defensively against
Rider to keep him from getting comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's definitely a tough matchup for us, and he made us pay,''
Ainge said. ``When he's taking those fade-aways that start at eight
feet and end up at 20, there isn't anything you can do about that.
He was making those on George, too. But we can do a better job on
(him.)''
</P>
<P>
   A quick double-team is a possibility, or at least that's what
Rider said he was anticipating when he got the ball in the low
post.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the post,'' he said. ``Obviously, that's my bread and
butter. Just like Jason Kidd or Gary Payton when they get the
little point guards on them, they eat them up. When I get
(shooting) guards on me that weight 20 pounds less, I can outpower
them, period. They're going to come on the pass now and double-team
me right away.''
</P>
<P>
   And Ainge will have to make a quick decision on whether Chapman
can carry the load in the Phoenix backcourt against Rider.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike during the regular season when he could wait for Chapman
to emerge from his shooting slump, there is immediacy in the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely,'' Ainge said. ``We can't wait as long.'' &QL;

ROBINSON BEAT DEMONS, NOT THE BLAZERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORM FRAUENHEIM  
 and BOB YOUNG  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND - Before tipoff, Suns forward Clifford Robinson
dismissed questions about his history for playoff futility.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have any demons to exorcise,'' said Robinson, whose
playoff reputation has its roots in his eight years with the Trail
Blazers.
</P>
<P>
   No demons, perhaps, but the questions remain.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson continued to struggle Saturday in the Suns' 95-85 loss
to the Blazers in a playoff opener. He had 9 points on 4-for-9
shooting and four rebounds before he fouled out with 34.2 seconds
left.
</P>
<P>
   ``J.R. (Rider) hit a lot of good shots, and they got into a
comfortable groove in their offense,'' said Robinson, who also drew
the primary defensive assignment on Rasheed Wallace. ``We have to
do a better job of not letting those offensive spurts happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have another game Monday. That give us a chance to make
some adjustments.'' &QL; 
Old look
</P>
<P>
   It looked as if Rex Chapman put an end to goggle-gate by
smashing the offending specs at a Suns practice the other day.
</P>
<P>
   But appearances aren't always what they seem.
</P>
<P>
   Chapman didn't wear goggles in Saturday's playoff opener at
Portland.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not because he eliminated them with a well-placed
heel. The Suns, in fact, packed three spares, just in case Chapman
relented and decided he would wear a pair as protection against
further injury of a fractured eye socket.
</P>
<P>
   But don't bet on it. Given Chapman's antipathy toward the
eyewear, there's a better chance he would show up at tipoff with a
snorkel. Besides, you don't need a pair of goggles to see he can't
stop Isaiah Rider. &QL; 
How about some pingpong?
</P>
<P>
   Might as well.
</P>
<P>
   Not only couldn't the Suns beat Portland, they couldn't win a
coin flip either.
</P>
<P>
   They lost a flip Friday with Boston for the number of chances _
represented by pingpong balls _ in the upcoming lottery for draft
picks.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns own Dallas' first-round pick, which they acquired in a
draft deal last summer. Boston and Dallas finished with the same
record.
</P>
<P>
   By winning the flip, Boston will get the seventh-highest number
of balls in the hopper. The Suns will get the highest number.
</P>
<P>
   Translation: The Suns will have no worse than the No. 11 pick in
the next draft. With a lot of luck, they could have the No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   They also will get the No. 16 pick. They had the same record as
New York and Sacramento, whose first-round pick belongs to Atlanta.
In another series of coin flips, New York got the 15th pick and
Atlanta got the 17th with the Suns landing between the two. &QL; 
Jam session
</P>
<P>
   With 5:05 left in the first half, Suns forward Tom Gugliotta
suffered a dislocation of the ring finger on his right hand in a
collision with Kelvin Cato.
</P>
<P>
   Suns trainer Joe Proski got the call to do some emergency work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe was looking at it,'' Gugliotta said. ``I said: `Joe, just
pull it. It hurts.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The injury wasn't serious.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little swollen, but I've done it before,'' he said.
``My golf game might struggle.'' &QL; 
Briefly
</P>
<P>
   The Blazers announced a crowd Saturday of 20,040, their 15th
sellout of the year. But there were plenty of empty seats. It is
NBA policy not to announce the no-show count.
</P>
<P>
   With Saturday's victory, the Blazers lead the Suns in their
overall playoff history, 12-11.
</P>
<P>
   The Blazers have been eliminated in the playoff's first round
six straight times. Saturday's win was a good sign. They have won
12 of the 13 series in which they've won the opener. &QL;

COLANGELO: IT'S TIME TO CLEAN UP GAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB YOUNG  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Suns President  &UR; Jerry Colangelo has seen enough ugly basketball,
and now that the NBA is through its lockout-marred season, he said
it was time to address the game itself.
</P>
<P>
   Colangelo joined the Suns in Portland on Saturday after
attending an NBA owners meeting and said Commissioner  &UR; David Stern
and Director of Operations  &UR; Rod Thorn will put together a committee
to address the scoring drought that has seen scoring slowly dry up
over the past 10 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   The league scoring average dropped from 95.6 points a game last
season to just over 91 points a game this season. Shooting
percentages also were down, with no team shooting 47 percent. It's
a downward scoring spiral that has continued through the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast with the Rules and Competition committee, made up of
29 members, Colangelo said a six- to eight-person committee _ of
which he'll be a member _ will try to find ways to return the flow
and tempo to a professional game that has become nothing but a
post-up contest.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality is the trending for 10 years is toward lower
scoring and shooting percentages,'' Colangelo said. ``We have to
take a look at the basic ingredients of the game itself. I'm not
going to go into specifics, but the changes will fall into certain
categories.
</P>
<P>
   ``One is the clock, and not necessarily the 24-second clock.
Defense is another area. Some are proponents of going to any kind
of defense. Another is widening the lane.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to talk about where we are and how we got here. The
mentality of coaching now is a half-court game and post-up game.
That dictates how many shots are taken, and that even goes down to
the colleges.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somehow, someway, we have gone away from the athleticism. We
need to clean up the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Colangelo said players and coaches will have input, but the
committee wants changes implemented by next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the time to do it,'' he said. ``You're going to see a
different game next year, and that's exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   There has been resistance in the past to dramatic changes, in
part because the Rules and Competition committee has become so
large _ 29 members.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was unwieldy,'' Colangelo said. ``There are too many
opinions, too many self-serving interests. Some have coaches who
want to coach a certain style, some have big guys and they want
advantages.
</P>
<P>
   ``The overriding thing is we have a great game. But we have to
be guardians of the game. We have to be watching over the game. It
has to be fixed. You can feel it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a trend over the last 10 years, and the statistics
bear it out. We have to adjust. In my opinion, we'll have a
stronger game if we adapt.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lockout magnified some of it, but the fact is if you look
at the trends, it tracks it about to a `T.' We don't have
continuity in the game. We don't have the flow.
</P>
<P>
   ``The committee will be working on this big time. If we change
the rules, players will adjust and officials will adjust.
</P>
<P>
   ``We even looked at what some of our players have been saying.
You read their comments, and they talk about how it was an ugly
game or a lousy game. You don't want your players saying things
like that. They've got to feel good about the game. It's a great
game, but it's time to give it a little shot.'' &QL; 
He was right &QL; 
Miami's  &UR; Pat Riley contended before the playoffs that anybody in
the Eastern Conference field could lose a first-round series.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the East, it's very equal, a lot of parity from teams 1
through 8. I think anybody can beat anybody if you're not on top of
your game,'' he said. ``Indiana is the one team I think that has
everything. Experience. Depth. Talent. All of that. They've
struggled at times, but they have the package. I think we're close
to that.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe not. The Knicks spanked Miami in Game 1 of their series in
Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the West, the changing of the guard is maybe a year away,''
Riley said. ``Maybe next year, San Antonio could be the team for a
long period of time, as long as  &UR; (David) Robinson and  &UR; (Tim) Duncan
stay together.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Confident &QL; 
Atlanta's  &UR; Steve Smith is apparently convinced the Hawks are going
to make noise in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care who we play or where we play,'' he said. ``Bring
'em on, and we'll go to work.''
</P>
<P>
   Of himself, Smith added, ``I'm pretty much there (as the best 2
guard in the league). I do everything. And I don't need to score to
help my team. There are some good players out there, but I just
might be the best.''
</P>
<P>
   Head start &QL; 
Boston Coach  &UR; Rick Pitino isn't wasting any time, even if the
Celtics are out of the playoffs. He held a two-day minicamp this
week.
</P>
<P>
   Pitino might want to include a current events segment. Before
the team's last game, rookie  &UR; Paul Pierce found a cap in front of
his locker with  &UR; ``Bill Bradley'' inscribed on the front.
</P>
<P>
   Asked by a reporter if he'd vote for the former Knick for
president, Pierce replied, ``I don't even know who he is.''
</P>
<P>
   Teammate  &UR; Ron Mercer said: ``He's a rookie. He isn't ready for
the tough questions.'' &QL; 
Eye of the beholder &QL; 
In Denver, the Nuggets held a ceremony in honor of the final game
played at McNichols Sports Arena. The club is ready to move into
the new Pepsi Center next season, and Denver's  &UR; Antonio McDyess
wasn't exactly nostalgic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great memories for some people,'' McDyess said. ``For
some people, it ain't.'' &QL;

GREETING CARD FROM AN ORPHAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By E.J. MONTINI  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When I was a boy my mother used to tell me that, someday, if God
and the Blessed Virgin Mary paid attention to her prayers, my
brother and I would become orphans.
</P>
<P>
   It would take a little luck, she believed, as heaven was a busy
place and very far from our house at 121 Third Ave. in a western
Pennsylvania steel town.
</P>
<P>
   But, that was her wish.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the way it should be,'' she said, always adding, ``God
willing.''
</P>
<P>
   I'm not sure how the subject came up. Or exactly why.
</P>
<P>
   But I know in the weeks before Mother's Day, the nuns at St.
Titus Grade School, where I was a student, made certain we included
in our daily invocations a prayer for the world's orphans.
</P>
<P>
   We'd spent a portion of each afternoon fashioning homemade
Mother's Day cards out of construction paper, glitter and glue,
while the Sisters of St. Joseph reminded us how fortunate we were
to have someone to present with such a gift.
</P>
<P>
   I must have told my mother about the prayers (though not the
cards, which we all presumed would come as a complete surprise,
despite coming home for days with glue on our fingers and glitter
on our shoes.) &QL; 
PAIN OF DYING CHILDREN
</P>
<P>
   This was about the same time my mother and her sister became
orphans.
</P>
<P>
   Their elderly parents died within six months of each other, one
from a heart condition, one from a broken heart.
</P>
<P>
   My grandparents came to the United States as young people,
leaving behind everything and everyone they knew in order to
scratch out a living in the coal mining and steel producing towns
of the East Coast.
</P>
<P>
   They'd hoped for a big family, but each time a boy was born to
them, he turned blue and died within a day. They had no money for
doctors who might explain to them the complexities of genetics, and
no treatment in those days to fix it.
</P>
<P>
   So, only their two daughters survived.
</P>
<P>
   It was not the way it was supposed to be, my grandmother told
her girls.
</P>
<P>
   A parent should never outlive a child. It's too difficult. Too
painful. It's the parents who should go first, and only after their
children have become adults with children of their own.
</P>
<P>
   My mother believed this with all her heart. She believed we must
pray long and hard for it to happen, heaven being so far away. And
she believed as well that we needed good fortune.
</P>
<P>
   It worked. &QL; 
KIDS GET LUCKY
</P>
<P>
   About a month and a half ago, my brother and I got lucky.
</P>
<P>
   We became orphans.
</P>
<P>
   Our father died quietly in a hospital bed, staring at the
ceiling, at something beyond the ceiling, at my mother, who had
passed away about a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   By then she'd had plenty of time and plenty of opportunity to
cash in all the prayers she'd so carefully deposited, heaven no
longer being far away for her.
</P>
<P>
   She'd gotten her wish.
</P>
<P>
   Her children were grown, with children of their own. Everything
happened in the order she hoped it would, which is good and the way
it should be except it's Mother's Day and I've got nowhere to send
a greeting card.
</P>
<P>
   And no gift to buy.
</P>
<P>
   And no phone call to make.
</P>
<P>
   When you're a child praying for the orphans of the world you
sympathize for them, and relate to them, as children.
</P>
<P>
   What you can't know at the time is that it doesn't change when
you become an orphan at 44. Or any other age.
</P>
<P>
   We spent last Mother's Day trying to keep my father occupied,
not realizing it worked as well on us as it did on him. My mother
knew, though.
</P>
<P>
   When you hope and pray for your children someday to be orphans _
and we all should _ you've got to leave behind a memory to help
them through difficult days.
</P>
<P>
   A few years back on Mother's Day, I couldn't reach my parents'
house by phone because the lines were jammed. My mother was in bed
before I finally got through.
</P>
<P>
   I told her I'd been trying to call all day when she stopped me
and laughed and said, ``Hey, I know. I know.'' &QL;

ANGRY PROTESTS IN SEVERAL CHINESE CITIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS to update and reorganize.) 
 (lh) 
 By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Large, angry protests erupted around U.S. government
offices in several cities on Saturday as Chinese learned that NATO
bombs had hit their embassy in Belgrade, killing at least three
people sleeping inside.
</P>
<P>
   In Beijing, thousands of well-organized university students,
cheered on by other Beijing residents, held tense noisy protests on
the streets surrounding the U.S. Embassy, as police looked on. But
the initially peaceful march quickly turned violent, as small
groups of students and residents threw rocks through embassy
windows, pummeled cars belonging to embassy employees and burned
American flags.
</P>
<P>
   It was the by far the largest anti-American demonstration in
China since well before President Nixon's historic visit to China
in 1972 and the largest political protest since the student rallies
in Tiananmen Square 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we hate America,'' said Ma Zhang Lu, a 20-year-old male
student with shoulder-length dyed hair, who had just hurled a rock
at the embassy. ``China has been especially friendly to the
American people. But we have been rebuffed, and now the Americans
have broken international law.''
</P>
<P>
   The protests marked an extraordinary moment in a controlled
country where such outbursts are normally forbidden and almost
never occur, though Saturday's demonstrations clearly had some
measure of government approval.
</P>
<P>
   The protests also comes just two weeks after Buddhist Law, a
spiritual group seeking official recognition, held another huge
rally in the city center.
</P>
<P>
   In Shanghai, a large, chanting crowd threw rocks and bottles at
the U.S. Consulate. Similar demonstrations were reported in
Guangzhou. And in the southern city of Chengdu, protesters set a
fire at the U.S. consulate early Sunday, but it was put out. A
Chinese guard was reported hurt.
</P>
<P>
   In Beijing after nightfall on Saturday, large unruly throngs
roamed the embassy district, defying police requests to go home.
Several times crowds pushed against lines of police officers,
linked arm in arm, who held them away from the U.S. and British
embassies.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, a group of 50 demonstrators burst through police
lines, only to be stopped by a row of police five deep about 50
yards from the U.S. Embassy compound. The police, who did not carry
weapons, made no arrests.
</P>
<P>
   Late on Saturday afternoon, the U.S. Embassy ``strongly
protested'' inadequate police protection, after students were
allowed to press up against the embassy's street-side gates and
throw rocks through windows of an office building still holding 15
to 20 embassy staff members, including James Sasser, the U.S.
ambassador.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually all protesters said they thought the bombing was
intentional.
</P>
<P>
   The protests began early Saturday afternoon when angry people
started gathering on the tree-lined streets in front of the embassy
in Beijing. Around 4 p.m., they were joined by thousands of angry,
chanting students, not die hard Communist Party cadres but
thoroughly Westernized youths, wearing baseball caps and Nike sweat
pants.
</P>
<P>
   The Beijing students marched in groups of several hundred behind
their university banners carrying hand-painted signs, some in
English, like ``USA Nazi Killers'' and chanting slogans like ``The
blood of Chinese must be repaid.''
</P>
<P>
   Each group paused in front of the iron gate at the embassy, just
15 feet from its front door, to chant, sing patriotic songs and
deliver a variety of petitions.
</P>
<P>
   At first, an officer from the embassy's political section came
out solemnly to accept the papers. But the protests quickly turned
violent, as students from several universities pelted the embassy
with rocks and water bottles. Each broken light and window was
greeted with thunderous cheers.
</P>
<P>
   Although most students returned to their campuses around
nightfall, many remained in the embassy district, and by 9 p.m.
raucous students and other demonstrators had regrouped near the
embassy, smashing cars with U.S. Embassy plates, identifiable by
the red character for embassy, followed by the number 224. An
American flag was burned outside Sasser's residence.

BUFFALO, HASEK MIGHT PART WAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MCMANAMAN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   There was some intense speculation out of New York that
all-world goalie  &UR; Dominik Hasek could be on his last tour of duty
with the Buffalo Sabres, who are hurting for money and must pay the
``Dominator'' an average of $8 million a year over the next three
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   They have a top goalie prospect  &UR; (Martin Biron) ready but would
have to protect both in the expansion draft, thereby exposing more
precious position players. If they protect only one goalie, they're
going to lose the other. And as good as two-time Hart Trophy winner
Hasek is, he's getting up in age and the Sabres can't afford to
lose a youngster like Biron.
</P>
<P>
   ``Darcy told me it's a complete lie and I believe what he
says,'' Hasek said, referring to Buffalo General Manager  &UR; Darcy
Regier. ``I don't think it's true at all.''
</P>
<P>
   We shall see. But don't be shocked if the Sabres move Hasek in a
blockbuster deal this summer. &QL; 
Yashin in rumors, too &QL; 
He's a finalist for the Hart Trophy. He scored 44 goals and 94
points. And he could be on the move, too, because the Ottawa
Senators won't be able to afford the $8 million to $10 million that
superstar &UR; Alexei Yashin wants.
</P>
<P>
   Yashin has one year left on his current deal, which pays him
$3.3 million, but he wants to renegotiate for a multiyear pact. If
the Senators don't do something, they'll lose him to an offer sheet
in another year. Bank on it.
</P>
<P>
   Which means the most likely scenario is a trade. The New Jersey
Devils are said to be interested and reports are that they would
part with  &UR; Bobby Holik, Jason Arnott, Lyle Odelein and a
first-round pick to get Yashin. That might be too much for Ottawa
to pass. &QL; 
Protected Coyotes? &QL; 
The expansion Atlanta Thrashers will get to pluck at least one
player from each of the existing 27 clubs next month a day before
the draft in Boston. Most teams will protect one goalie, along with
five defensemen and nine forwards.
</P>
<P>
   The catch is that each team must expose one defenseman who is
under contract for next season and two forwards who also have
deals. What will the Coyotes do?
</P>
<P>
   For starters, they will protect  &UR; Nikolai Khabibulin, exposing
both backup  &UR; Mikhail Shtalenkov and free agent  &UR; Jimmy Waite, the
latter whom they don't want back but may have to re-sign if
Shtalenkov gets picked up by Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The five defensemen expected to be protected are  &UR; Teppo
 &UR; Numminen, Jyrki Lumme, Keith Carney, Oleg Tverdovsky and probably
 &UR; Stan
 &UR; Neckar. Deron Quint is most likely to be claimed.
</P>
<P>
   Among the forwards, the protected list likely will include
 &UR; Keith Tkachuk, Jeremy Roenick, Rick Tocchet, Robert Reichel, Dallas
 &UR; Drake, Shane Doan, Daniel Briere, Juha Ylonen and/or  &UR; Bob Corkum
and
 &UR; Greg Adams. They could lose  &UR; Mike Stapleton, Mike Sullivan, Louie
 &UR; DeBrusk or  &UR; Stephen Leach. &QL; 
Flyers fallout &QL; 
 &UR; Ed Snider, controversial chairman of the Philadelphia Flyers, said
a whole lot more the other day than just questioning the integrity
of officiating, which brought about a $50,000 fine after his team's
first-round ouster from the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Snider made a few remarks that had many speculating he might be
done running the organization. He even went so far as to say  &UR; Pat
 &UR; Croce, colorful president of the NBA's Philadelphia 76ers, could be
his replacement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't rule it out and I don't rule it in,'' Snider said.
</P>
<P>
   Croce said his commitment is to the basketball team, but he
added: ``I'm not going to lie to you, it has crossed my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happens, General Manager  &UR; Bobby Clarke is keeping his
job for at least another year. &QL; 
Draft lottery &QL; 
The NHL's weighted draft lottery for the 11 non-playoff teams (or
those clubs that now hold their draft choices) and the expansion
Thrashers shouldn't make a whole lot of difference when it comes to
who gets the No. 1 overall pick.
</P>
<P>
   It still likely will be the Tampa Bay Lightning, which has a 26
percent chance to get the top pick.
</P>
<P>
   The odds for the rest: Atlanta and Vancouver (16.9 percent), the
Islanders (10.8), Nashville (8.3), Washington (6.4), Los Angeles
(4.8), Chicago (3.7), Calgary (2.7), Montreal (1.9), the Rangers
(1.1) and Florida (0.5). &QL; 
Slap shots &QL; 
Detroit defenseman  &UR; Niklas Lidstrom continues to warn that he and
family may move back to his native Sweden rather than accept a
long-term deal from the club this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know eventually we're going back to Sweden,'' Lidstrom
said. ``It's just when's the right time? When's the right time for
the kids to go to Swedish schools? When's the right time to have
them grow up with their extended families?''
</P>
<P>
   After he signs and honors a three- to five-year deal worth $5
million to $6 million _ which he will _ that's when.
</P>
<P>
   How's this for a golf foursome:  &UR; Michael Jordan,
 &UR; John Elway, Wayne Gretzky and  &UR; Mario Lemieux? It's probably going
to happen, too, at Lemieux's charity tournament June 10-13 near
Pittsburgh. Jordan and Elway have committed and Gretzky will, too,
the minute he is asked.
</P>
<P>
   Sources in Pittsburgh said Lemieux's reorganization plan for the
Penguins will be approved, without haste, and that the league's
backup plan to either sell and move the team or terminate the
franchise and hold a dispersal draft will never see the light of
day. Here's hoping.
</P>
<P>
   A record number of close games were played in the first round of
the playoffs _ the most since the league went to a best-of-seven
format for openers in 1987. Of the 44 games, 23 were decided by one
goal (52.3 percent) and 35 by two goals or fewer (79.6)
Additionally, 11 games went to overtime, the most since 14 in
1993. &QL;

 BEIJING: Sasser's residence.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Although police presence was heavy, the officers, generally
equipped at most with cell phones, at first did little to stop the
rock throwing. The Embassy warned Americans living in Beijing to
increase personal security and to avoid any protests.
</P>
<P>
   As the fever pitch increased, reinforcements were brought in and
made some serious efforts, though often with little effect. Police
stood by as hundreds of protesters burned an American flag.
</P>
<P>
   The well-planned afternoon march was clearly condoned by the
government. Official student organizations arranged for buses, and
students said that the Beijing Municipal government had approved
the protest.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign reporters, who are generally shooed away by public
security officers from even minor car accidents, were given freedom
to interview and photograph protesters on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   But the anger was deep and genuine both from the students and
the thousands of Beijing residents who apparently gathered
spontaneously, many with children, after they had found out about
the protest from friends or on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a young Chinese I've always felt a very friendly attitude
toward the U.S. and its people,'' said Wang Bin, an interpreter,
who decided early Saturday afternoon to stand peacefully outside
the embassy in protest. ``But now I feel a deep internal disgust
and anger.''
</P>
<P>
   Chinese public opinion has been violently opposed to the NATO
war over Kosovo since the start of the bombing, in some part
because the government-controlled press did not report on the
Serbian purge of Kosovo Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   But most also agree with their government that Kovoso's internal
ethnic conflicts should not be solved by ``a foreign bully''
wielding bombs. Thanks to the bombing, they now regard President
Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia as a hero for standing up to NATO
and the Serbs as an oppressed people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd always thought that Kosovo should be considered an
internal affair and that NATO shouldn't be there,'' said Guo
Qionghu, a student at the National Minorities University. ``But
today this issue has fallen directly on the heads of the Chinese
people, and that's why our emotions are so aroused.''
</P>
<P>
   The evening television news carried China's official
condemnations of the attack as ``barbarian'' and a ``gross
violation of China's sovereignty'' and featured the students'
demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   The three known Chinese killed in the Belgrade attack were
identified as Shao Yunhuan, a 40-year-old woman who was a reporter
for the New China News Agency; Xu Xinghu, the resident
correspondent in Belgrade for the newspaper Guangming Daily, and
Xu's wife, Zhu Yin, an employee in the advertising section of the
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   In a bitter interview on national television, the chief of the
New China News Agency praised Ms. Shao as a ``good comrade and
outstanding reporter.'' The editor of the Guangming Daily said the
dead couple had only been married a year and that Xu's final report
had appeared in Saturday's newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Before being trapped in the embassy compound, Sasser had been
called in to the Chinese Foreign Ministry to receive its strong
protest.
</P>
<P>
   In a country where there is often a huge divide between official
pronouncements and public opinion, China now appeared to react as
one.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did it on purpose,'' said Yu He, a bank employee in
Shanghai, adding. ``Of course I'm angry now they're attacking us
too.''
</P>
<P>
   Even before the protests, a Chinese Internet chat room about
Kosovo that has been popular in recent weeks was deluged with
vituperative messages, including ``Tonight, let's lay siege to the
U.S. Embassy.''
</P>
<P>
   Liberal Chinese who have supported engagement with the United
States called reporters with a deep sense of disbelief and
betrayal, looking for explanations. Students at the Beijing
demonstration, some of whom had welcomed President Clinton to China
a year ago, said they also felt betrayed.
</P>
<P>
   Kicking off the protest, student delegations from China's most
prominent universities _ Beijing University, Qinghua University and
People's University _ marched in lines, waving red flags and
banners, chanting slogans like ``Down with Imperialism'' and
singing patriotic songs.
</P>
<P>
   Some students carried hand-painted signs condemning NATO or the
United States and wore targets like those worn in protest by
civilians in Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd turned violent when the group of 200 students from
Beijing Polytechnic turned onto the road that bisects the two
grassy office compounds of the U.S. Embassy. Piles of rocks and
cement squares lined the sidewalks, which are being re-laid as part
of the campaign to dress up Beijing for the 50th anniversary this
fall.
</P>
<P>
   The building material along the narrow street provided ample
weaponry for the students in the dense crowd, who hurled the rocks
through the windows of the U.S. Embassy's visa office and an
administrative building just behind the fence.
</P>
<P>
   The embassy is a hodgepodge of older buildings in three
different sites, all within 15 to 20 feet of the road. The street
that divides the two main office sites, home to the day's protests,
has been closed to nonembassy automotive traffic since the bombings
in Africa last summer.
</P>
<P>
   Police had clearly been girding since early in the day, when
they closed a nearby popular outdoor market, Silk Alley, where
tourists flock to buy Beanie Babies, Chinese qipao dresses and fake
Prada bags.
</P>
<P>
   But they were certainly unprepared for the outpouring of anger
that gathered throughout the day and into the late evening, when
thousands of angry protesters moved from the U.S. Embassy to the
nearby British Embassy and on to the U.S. Ambassador's house.

<P>
   Former Cardinals running back  &UR; LeShon Johnson never will forget
May 5, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   That was the day he was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma,
putting his NFL career in doubt.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson had joined the Giants earlier in the spring, two months
before a routine chest X-ray revealed he had a malignant tumor in
his chest.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, Johnson has been cleared by Giants doctors to
resume workouts with the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't wait to run out on the field in that blue uniform,''
Johnson said. ``Then I will have completed my mission.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson will be back on the field this week when the Giants
begin their off-season conditioning program and minicamp. His
doctor,  &UR; David
 &UR; Wolf, said Johnson's white blood count is high enough for him to
participate.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt about it _ I will be back,'' Johnson said
last week. ``I feel good. This is the first time I've felt so
confident.''
</P>
<P>
   He isn't guaranteed a job, however. The Giants drafted two
running backs _  &UR; Joe Montgomery of Ohio State in the second round
and  &UR; Sean
 &UR; Bennett of Northwestern in the fourth _ to go along with veterans
 &UR; Gary
 &UR; Brown and  &UR; Tiki Barber.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson isn't worried about the competition. He's just glad to
be practicing again.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy is amazing,'' said Giants Coach  &UR; Jim Fassel, former
offensive coordinator of the Cardinals. ``He always has a smile on
his face when you see him in the locker room. He's an inspiration
to the other guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson still needs to gain weight. He's down to 202, 10 under
his playing weight.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants plan to use him as a third-down back and a kickoff
returner. After what he has been through, he'll accept any role.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm on a mission,'' he said. ``My speed is still there. My
heart is still there. And by me sitting on the sidelines, I got to
sit back and watch, and now I feel like I know how to use my
ability _ when to use my speed and when not to.''
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals coaches thought Johnson used to try to hit the holes
too quickly. They joked that he was a kamikaze runner who often
took huge hits.
</P>
<P>
   His former coaches and teammates are just glad he has regained
his health and is back on the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, `Cowboy' is a good guy,'' Cardinals safety  &UR; Kwamie
Lassiter said of Johnson, also a rodeo cowboy. ``For somebody like
him to go through that and come back, he'll appreciate the game
even more. We're pulling for him.'' &QL; 
Talk isn't cheap &QL; 
The agent for New Orleans Saints first-round pick  &UR; Ricky Williams
and team official  &UR; Terry O'Neil have found a new and fun way to
negotiate.
</P>
<P>
   They talk business on golf courses in the mid-South, playing 18
holes every day while trying to agree on a contract.
</P>
<P>
   The two plan to keep playing daily until they come to terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of it, I love the game,'' agent  &UR; Leland Hardy said. ``I'm
not revealing anything about the nature of our discussions, but
Terry has the slight upper hand on the golf course so far.'' &QL; 
Crystal ball &QL; 
Arizona State running back  &UR; J.R. Redmond is projected by one mock
draft to be the No. 1 overall pick in the 2000 draft.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Brian Stevenson Draft Notebook'' has Redmond going to
Philadelphia with the first pick.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals are projected to pick 22nd and take University of
Arizona running back  &UR; Trung Canidate, the Camelback High School
graduate. &QL; 
Dumb move &QL; 
The Vikings didn't help themselves in their quest to get a new
stadium by forcing out  &UR; Jeff Diamond, the senior vice president of
football operations who recently was named ``Sporting News'' NFL
Executive of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   Diamond, who has worked for the team for 24 years, was pushed
out after losing a power struggle to Coach  &UR; Dennis Green and
General Manager  &UR; Tim Connolly.
</P>
<P>
   It was Diamond who kept the team in business last season when it
didn't have an owner. He still was able to re-sign running back
 &UR; Robert
 &UR; Smith, defensive lineman  &UR; John Randle and offensive tackles  &UR; Todd
 &UR; Steussie and  &UR; Korey Stringer, all of whom helped the Vikings finish
15-1 last season, the best regular season mark in the league. &QL; 
Set him free &QL; 
Don't be surprised if the Rams release safety  &UR; Toby Wright, the
Mesa Dobson High School graduate who has been bothered by knee and
hamstring problems for much of the past three seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``The waiting game is treacherous,'' Wright said.
</P>
<P>
   He thinks he's going to be cut after June 1, and one team he is
interested in joining is the Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been in the league long enough to see the writing's on
the wall,'' Wright said. ``It's pretty obvious.''
</P>
<P>
   Wright is expendable because the Rams signed free agent safety
 &UR; Devin Bush from Atlanta in the off-season for $7.2 million over
four years.
</P>
<P>
   ``You bring in a safety, and you pay him like a starter, that's
your man,'' Wright said. `Politically, you've got to go with
him.'' &QL; 
Short shots &QL; 
Kansas City Chiefs Coach  &UR; Gunther Cunningham, on rookie free agent
running back  &UR; Brian Shay, who set an NCAA record 6,958 yards at
NCAA Division II Emporia (Kan.) State last season: ``I don't care
what level he gained those yards at. If it was Pop Warner, I don't
care. He accelerated a couple of times, and I was in awe.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pittsburgh Steelers signed  &UR; Kordell Stewart to a three-year,
$27 million contract extension because they think he's better than
the Cardinals'  &UR; Jake Plummer.
</P>
<P>
   Happy 100th birthday to  &UR; Marguerite Lambeau, the wife of former
Packers founder and Coach  &UR; Curley Lambeau, who also coached the
Cardinals in 1950 and '51.
</P>
<P>
   Jets rookie guard  &UR; David Loverne, on playing with a torn
pectoral muscle in the East-West Shrine All-Star Game: ``Anything
other than death is a minor injury.'' &QL;

OHIO HIGH SCHOOL GETS INTO LUXURY ACT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LES POLK  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When you think of luxury suites, club seats and seat licenses,
it's only natural to think of wealthy professional sports teams and
their corporate clients.
</P>
<P>
   Think again. Not only do suites help finance pro sports
buildings, but they've permeated the college scene, and now an Ohio
high school is building a football stadium by selling seat
licenses.
</P>
<P>
   Ravenna High School is building a $5 million
athletic/recreational facility with a 5,000-seat football/soccer
stadium funded by personal seat licenses and community
fund-raising. No bond elections, no taxes, no stadium districts,
just an old-fashioned community effort with a newfangled twist.
</P>
<P>
   And the effort has attracted attention from school districts
across the nation, Ravenna Superintendent Phil Warner said.
</P>
<P>
   The blue-collar town of about 25,000, just east of Akron,
decided a few years ago to replace the football stadium, part of
which had to be closed off last year because it was falling apart.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than ask voters for an athletic bond issue, the school
board decided to try something different.
</P>
<P>
   ``We decided to explore private funding, thinking the community
might like it because we also need a bond election to build a new
high school,'' Warner said.
</P>
<P>
   Up-front funding was provided by a bank in a lease-purchase
agreement, and ground broke on the stadium in March. The board must
make payments over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   An alumni campaign, school employees campaign, corporate
donations and the seat licenses have helped the board raise more
than $800,000 this year.
</P>
<P>
   About 1,200 seats in the stadium carry seat licenses ranging
from $1,000 to $1,500. More than $200,000 has been raised via
licenses, which give the holders first rights to tickets.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an opportunity to rally the community to support
itself and its kids,'' Warner said.
</P>
<P>
   The complex will include an outdoor education area, baseball and
softball diamonds and a cross country trail.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters can contribute to everything from engraved bricks at
the stadium entry walkway for $500 to a baseball backstop for
$20,000 to $100 for benches in the outdoor recreation area.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way we're doing this gives people a choice,'' Warner said.
``If they support athletics, great. If they don't, they don't pay
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   The stadium opens Aug. 27 for the football team's first game.
</P>
<P>
   But the campaign won't end there.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a long way to go,'' Warner said. ``It's a struggle, no
different than a bond election. But I really do feel that overall,
the community is behind it.'' &QL;

CLINTON PROMISES AID FOR OKLAHOMA VICTIMS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JACK DOUGLAS Jr. 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEL CITY, Okla. _ Standing outside their demolished homes
Saturday, hundreds of tornado victims greeted President Clinton and
were told that $12 million more in federal aid will be available to
help them rebuild their homes _ and their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton called the view ``frightening'' as he flew over the
swath of destruction left by the killer tornadoes that cut through
11 Oklahoma counties Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In the suburban community of Del City, where five people died,
Clinton told survivors: ``This is the most devastating tornado I
have ever seen ... I'm sorry. Our hearts are with you. We will be
with you throughout the rebuilding.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came into this neighborhood today and I saw all these
American flags sticking up, all the people rooting around in the
rubble of their houses, looking for those family photos and the
marriage licenses and the other records of family life ... It was
profoundly moving to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton pledged $12 million from the U.S. Department of Labor,
which he said will be used to hire 3,500 people left jobless by the
storms.
</P>
<P>
   That pleased many in the crowd, including some who had said they
were not happy that they had to stop cleanup efforts so that Secret
Service agents could sweep the neighborhood before the president's
visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't really looking for relief, but I found some,'' said
Randy Reed, whose family lost their home in Del City. ``I think
people found more hope for tomorrow than they had before he came,''
Reed said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also encouraged victims to include a heavily fortified
space known as a ``safe room'' or ``safe closet'' when they rebuild
their homes, so they will have a place to go in the event of
another tornado. Government assistance will be available to defray
the costs for the indoor shelters, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd applauded when Clinton said his proposed budget
includes several million dollars to work on improving the Doppler
radar warning system for dangerous weather.
</P>
<P>
   He also said he supports the creation of a National Weather
Center at the University of Oklahoma to work on improving warning
systems and to find scientific ways to weaken a potentially
dangerous tornado before it hits the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll put Oklahoma at the center of that'' research, Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
   As the president spoke, authorities continued to search for
people who have been unaccounted for since the tornadoes struck.
The list of the missing grew by one name Saturday when the Oklahoma
Medical Examiner's Office said a man identified as Mark Edward
Nelson, 40, was mistakenly taken off the list last week.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson was last seen Monday night in a 1997 Chevrolet Lumina,
traveling in the path of a tornado in Midwest City, the medical
examiner's office said.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities also continued to look for John and Barbara Potton,
a British couple traveling in a motor home, and Tram Bui, a
23-year-old woman who was trying to take cover under a bridge on
Interstate 35 when the storm hit.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the Pottons, who are believed to be in their 60s, nor
Bui have been heard from since the tornadoes.
</P>
<P>
   The death toll yesterday remained at 41 people, including two
infants and a 6-year-old girl.
</P>
<P>
   As he flew over the path of the tornadoes, Clinton said it is a
miracle that more people did not die.
</P>
<P>
   Some questioned the president's sincerity, and said his
appearance was an inconvenience in a time of urgency.
</P>
<P>
   ``His coming into our neighborhood is just slowing us up in
getting our stuff out,'' said Tom Holder, a Del City resident who
lost everything. ``I think it's a photo op,'' Holder said of
Clinton's visit.
</P>
<P>
   But Tammy Clymer, another resident whose home was destroyed,
said Clinton's appearance will help.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as he's here, more people will know about it and that
will bring more help for all of us who need it,'' Clymer said.
</P>
<P>
   As she waited under the hot sun for the president, Toni
Maldonado said she is skeptical of the president because of his
highly publicized extramarital affair with a former White House
intern.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he wants to redeem himself, he should get down and work and
get his hands dirty,'' Maldonado said. She added, ``I think Hillary
(Rodham Clinton) should be here, really.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, however, Maldonado said she liked what the president had
to say.

NEW DEPUTY SETS PRIORITIES IN PLACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BARRY BURKHART  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Steve Ferrell, a 20-year employee of the Arizona Game
and Fish Department, has been named to the second-highest position
in the department by Director Duane Shroufe.
</P>
<P>
   As deputy director, Ferrell will basically address problem areas
and run the day-to-day operation of the department.
</P>
<P>
   He replaced veteran Tom Spalding, who retired last fall.
Spalding will be a tough act to follow. He was both tough at times
but also fair. He served the department well.
</P>
<P>
   Ferrell is well-grounded in administration. He was assistant
director in charge of field operations before being promoted. In
that position, he was the chief administrator for all of Arizona's
regional offices. Before that, he was regional supervisor in the
Kingman area.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if I'm running day-to-day operations,'' he said.
``But I do have some areas that I want to work with.''
</P>
<P>
   Here are some of them:
</P>
<P>
   For wildlife particularly, there are diverse customers, some
with competing interests. The challenge, he said, is to try to meet
all their needs, if possible.
</P>
<P>
   Conflict resolution. Ferrell said Game and Fish already is doing
a good job of that but wants it to be even better.
</P>
<P>
   Better marketing. The agency is beginning to address that issue,
he said. The public needs to know what the agency is doing and what
it is.
</P>
<P>
   Ferrell, who has been a leader in developing quality management
practices for both the public and employees of the agency, said
that practice must continue.
</P>
<P>
   Funding must be produced to do all these things, he said.
``We've had no license fee increase in 10 years,'' he said. ``The
cost of business is continually rising.''
</P>
<P>
   Income has become stagnant, particularly because big-game permit
numbers have gone down, a result of the decrease in animals because
of drought conditions.
</P>
<P>
   That problem was eased week before last, when both the state
Senate and House approved a bill that allows the agency to raise
license fees by 30 percent. Shroufe said new fees won't come at
once.
</P>
<P>
   Salaries for veteran professionals is embarrassingly low.
Because of state hiring practices, some new employees come in
making more than veterans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to get that problem solved,'' Ferrell said.
</P>
<P>
   He also wants to tweak the department's off-highway vehicle
program. He believes the agency must increase education and
information efforts in that area and better integrate the law
enforcement aspects into day-to-day field operations.
</P>
<P>
   It appears the new deputy director is a ball of fire. Here's
hoping he doesn't flame out. &QL; 
Try the Net &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Copies of hunting regulations for 1999-2000 will be delivered to
vendors sometime this week.
</P>
<P>
   But if you want an early peek, you can find the regulations on
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Game and Fish is trying to streamline the process of giving the
public a quicker look at the seasons. After new hunting seasons
were approved by Game and Fish commissioners in April, the
department had them on the Net not too long after.
</P>
<P>
   That allows hunters to survey the seasons and start applying
whenever they wish.
</P>
<P>
   The new application form is on the department's home page. Old
hunt forms should be tossed. This year's form requires (by new
state law) that Social Security numbers be listed on all forms for
governmental agencies.
</P>
<P>
   For early application, call up the home page at
www.gf.state.az.us and remember it also can be obtained by fax at
(602) 530-2210. &QL;

D-BACKS SEND ANDERSON TO TRIPLE-A TUCSON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PEDRO GOMEZ  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Pitcher  &UR; Brian Anderson, the first player selected in
the November 1997 expansion draft, was sent to Triple-A Tucson on
Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson's demotion opened up a roster spot for reliever  &UR; Amaury
 &UR; Telemaco, whose 30-day rehabilitation assignment ended Friday
night. Because Telemaco is out of options, he needed to be placed
on the big-league roster or the club would have faced losing him
via waivers.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, who has struggled in his role as a reliever, will
start three games for Tucson and then return to the major league
roster, Manager  &UR; Buck Showalter said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brian is going down to pitch so that he can get back to where
he needs to be so he can come back here and help the major league
club,'' Showalter said. ``This is nothing he has created.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson had just 10 innings pitched in eight appearances while
being used primarily in mop-up situations when a game is usually
out of hand. It's the first time in his career he has been used
exclusively as a reliever and it seemed Anderson, who relies
heavily on his change-up, never could make the adjustment to the
bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   ``As much as I didn't want to believe it, I almost saw this
coming,'' said Anderson, who is scheduled to start the Sidewinders
game Monday at Iowa. ``I'm in a role I've never been in. Basically,
I'm insurance right now in case there's a doubleheader, a spot
start is needed or there's an injury.''
</P>
<P>
   By stretching Anderson out _ he is scheduled to go from about 45
pitches Monday to 70 on May 15 and 90 on May 20 _ the left-hander
who won 12 games in 32 starts last season, might also be part of a
bigger plan.
</P>
<P>
   Two major league general managers believe the Diamondbacks may
be making this move in order to make a trade. Anderson's trade
value as a reliever is basically negligible. However, another
scenario might have another trade being made and Anderson slipping
back into the rotation.
</P>
<P>
   One possibility could include dealing  &UR; Andy Benes, whose name at
least one National League general manager has heard come up in the
form of a trade. Benes, however, would have to approve any trade
since he has a complete no-trade clause in his contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``Buck said he couldn't guarantee what I'd be doing when I
return,'' Anderson said. ``I might be coming back in the same
role.'' &QL; 
Snake bites &QL; 
Outfielder  &UR; Luis Gonzalez extended his hitting streak to 21 games,
but not before going hitless in his first three plate appearances.
Gonzalez lined a soft single to right field in the bottom of the
ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Reliever  &UR; Byung-Hyun Kim, who has caught the attention of most
everyone in the organization, is scheduled to be promoted from
Double-A El Paso to Tucson today. Kim entered Saturday's action
with a 2.08 ERA in 17 innings. &QL;

IF IT AIN'T BROKE . . .  
 RETALIATION SHOULD BE LEFT IN THE GAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   At what point exactly did baseball decide to put restraints on
its players and no longer allow them to play the game the way it
has been played for decades?
</P>
<P>
   Last week's incident between the Atlanta Braves and St. Louis
Cardinals demonstrates how baseball's umpires, possibly at the
urging of the commissioner's office, are taking a step backward
rather than forward.
</P>
<P>
   This is a touchy subject to most casual baseball fans because
they believe any form of violence is wrong. So when Braves starter
 &UR; Greg
 &UR; Maddux drilled St. Louis'  &UR; Ray Lankford two pitches after Mark
McGwire hit a grand slam, the Cardinals rightly took exception.
</P>
<P>
   But when home plate umpire  &UR; Larry Poncino warned Cardinals
pitcher
 &UR; Kent Mercker before the start of the next inning not to throw at
any Braves players, he basically took away the one way St. Louis
could retaliate, which is to have its pitcher plunk a Braves player
and square things.
</P>
<P>
   It may sound barbaric, but it's the way the game has been played
since the start of the century _ you hit one of our guys on
purpose, we're going to do the same to one of yours.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not one of the problems baseball has,'' said Cincinnati
Manager  &UR; Jack McKeon, who has been involved in major league ball as
a player, coach, manager or general manager for 50 years. ``To me,
that's the way you play the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing now is that hitters don't think a pitcher can
come inside at all. They get an inside pitch, and they're ready to
charge the mound. I'd love to see one of these guys charge someone
like  &UR; Bob
 &UR; Gibson,  &UR; Sal Maglie or  &UR; Don Drysdale. Those pitchers would kill
these hitters. But today, there's a different breed of player.''
</P>
<P>
   It's just the way the game is played. The one time players
should take exception to being hit is when a ball comes in toward
the head, where serious damage can occur. But pitchers such as
Drysdale would drill a hitter in the ribs _ a spot that would hurt
for weeks, causing that hitter to curse Drysdale for weeks.
Drysdale hit 154 batters during his career.
</P>
<P>
   Retaliation should never be taken away in the game of baseball.
But now it has gotten to the point where the first club to strike
gets away with it because they simply plead innocence. In fact,
rarely are such instances innocent.
</P>
<P>
   They'll never admit it, but every single major league manager
has ordered one of his pitchers to hit an opposing batter at some
point in his career. It's truly an inside part of the game of
baseball. &QL; 
Trivial question &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Who holds the club record for home runs by an Atlanta Braves
player? &QL;

   Toronto assistant general manager  &UR; Dave Stewart, one of the
fiercest competitors of the last quarter-century and one of the
most stand-up men in the game, is still quarreling with former Blue
Jays pitcher  &UR; Roger Clemens, who basically demanded to be traded
away from Toronto because he didn't deem the Blue Jays capable of
competing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our club as a whole feels we're a better club without Roger,''
Stewart said. ``I don't believe Roger is conducive to winning. He's
more of a guy that's good at accomplishing individual goals, but I
don't believe he's capable of bringing a team to a championship.
The proof is in the pudding.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not done it in Boston. He came to Toronto, and he didn't
do it there. The situation in New York _ it's not that he would
bring a championship there, but he'd be riding the coattails of a
club that can do it without him.''
</P>
<P>
   It should be noted that Clemens signed with Toronto two winters
ago after the Blue Jays made the highest offer for his services
and, at the time, he said he was there to help bring back glory to
the franchise.
</P>
<P>
   It should also be noted that in 10 career meetings between
Clemens and Stewart (which includes the playoffs), Clemens never
once beat Stewart, who was 7-0 in those match-ups against Clemens.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Blue Jays do not appear to be the dregs of the
league, which is how some interpreted Clemens' painting of the
club. &QL; 
Credit where it's due &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Just how good are the Cleveland Indians, owners of the best
record in baseball entering this weekend's series? Consider who
they have let go as a barometer of where they are at.
</P>
<P>
   Since the middle of the 1996 season, the Indians have seen
several top players leave either via trade or free agency, yet they
remain perched near the top of the 30 clubs in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a list of former Indians and where they are:  &UR; Albert
Belle, Baltimore's cleanup hitter;  &UR; Matt Williams, Arizona's
cleanup hitter;
 &UR; Jeromy Burnitz, Milwaukee's cleanup hitter;  &UR; Jeff Kent, San
Francisco's cleanup hitter;  &UR; Brian Giles, Pittsburgh's No. 3
hitter;  &UR; Sean Casey, Cincinnati's No. 3 hitter; and  &UR; Marquis
Grissom, Milwaukee's No. 7 hitter.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to pitching, the list is also somewhat impressive.
It includes  &UR; Gregg Olson, Arizona's closer;  &UR; Jose Mesa, Seattle's
closer;
 &UR; Danny Graves, Cincinnati's closer; and  &UR; Chad Ogea, Philadelphia's
No. 3 starter.
</P>
<P>
   What did the Indians receive in exchange? Three players on their
current roster: third baseman  &UR; Travis Fryman and pitchers  &UR; Dave
Burba and  &UR; Steve Reed.
</P>
<P>
   Reliever  &UR; Ricky Rincon (he no longer wishes to be called
Ricardo) was also acquired in a trade, but he remains on the
disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   All of these moves are courtesy of General Manager  &UR; John Hart.
Say whatever you want about him or his ego, but Hart remains one of
the very best at his craft. &QL; 
Bleacher creatures &QL;

<P>
   Chicago Cubs management is promising a strict crackdown after
fans in the most famous bleachers in baseball inundated Wrigley
Field with half-filled beer cups, glass flasks of booze and full
cans of soda. The protests came about after a bad umpire's call
last Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are reviewing all of our options, including more security,
stationing personnel in different places, alcohol limits and other
opportunities available to us,'' said  &UR; Mark McGuire, the team's
executive vice president. ``I would suspect we will do some things
differently.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Cubs officials are caught in a tough spot because
they do not want to ruin the Wrigley Field bleachers for what they
are _ a great place to watch a ballgame. Yet, they realize they
must maintain some form of control.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's arguably the highest-demand seat in baseball,'' McGuire
said. ``We're caught trying to figure out the right way to do it.
Unfortunately, some of (the littering) is becoming part of the
tradition or culture of Wrigley Field, and it's one we would like
to lose quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Cubs reliever  &UR; Rod Beck, known for indulging from time to time,
offered this opinion:
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm all for having a good time myself and having a few pops,
but not for wasting beer by throwing it onto the field. I'd rather
drink it than throw it.
</P>
<P>
   ``(But) they were throwing bottles and full pop cans and
baseballs. You're talking a guy's livelihood. What happens if
someone gets an eye put out?'' &QL; 
Trivial answer &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Before you jump to the presumably obvious, think about how the
questions was phrased. It asked the Atlanta Braves player with the
most home runs.
</P>
<P>
   The answer is  &UR; Dale Murphy, who had 371 career home runs in an
Atlanta uniform.  &UR; Hank Aaron hit 335 for Atlanta but is the
all-time Braves franchise leader with 733 home runs. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   THE HIT LIST &QL; 
 &UR; Canning his emotions: Detroit's  &UR; Bobby Higginson was so frustrated
after a game last weekend that he took his bat and whacked the
toilet repeatededly. The next day, he hit two doubles and a single
in his first three at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The newest member of the Jack Lord Fan Club: Pittsburgh catcher
 &UR; Jason Kendall became only the seventh player since 1970 (as far
back as they can check) to have a box score line of 5-0-5-0. He had
five hits in five at-bats and nothing else.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Flashback: Mackey Sasser.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; And now, your Montreal EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEExpos!: Teammates, and
brothers,  &UR; Vladimir and  &UR; Wilton Guerrero have combined for 16
errors this season, nine by right fielder Vladimir.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Milestone week for managers: Three managers reached significant
victories in the past week. Los Angeles'  &UR; Davey Johnson got victory
No. 1,000, Cincinnati's  &UR; Jack McKeon notched No. 600 and Anaheim's
 &UR; Terry Collins got No. 400. &QL; 
EXTRA BASES &QL; 
Giants second baseman  &UR; Jeff Kent became just the second player ever
to hit for the cycle (single, double, triple and home run in the
same game) at Pittsburgh's Three Rivers Stadium last week. The
other was  &UR; Joe Torre, who accomplished the feat in 1973 as a member
of the St. Louis Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Rafael Palmeiro of the Texas Rangers is at opposite ends of the
spectrum when it comes to batting against left-handers and
right-handers, entering the weekend series. His .441 (30 for 68)
average against right-handers is the best in the American League.
Conversely, his .083 (2 for 24) average against left-handers is the
worst.
</P>
<P>
   It's pretty early for such projections, but Atlanta's  &UR; Bret
Boone, who has five home runs and 18 RBIs, is on pace to become the
first Braves second baseman ever to have 30 home runs and 100 RBIs
in a season.
</P>
<P>
   The experiment in Pittsburgh is over, and catcher
 &UR; Jason Kendall has returned to the middle of the lineup. After
becoming one of the few catchers ever to lead off, Kendall was
dropped to fifth in the order. While in the top spot, though,
Kendall distinguished himself, batting .274 with seven stolen bases
in eight attempts. His .366 on-base percentage wasn't bad, either.
 &UR; Al Martin is the new leadoff hitter.
</P>
<P>
   The two pitchers tied for the most complete games in the
National League with two come from the Diamondbacks and Phillies.
As expected,  &UR; Randy Johnson is the name from Arizona. The one from
Philadelphia, however, might be surprising since it is  &UR; Carlton
Loewer, not  &UR; Curt Shilling, who mopped up in the category last
season with 15.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's  &UR; John Smoltz, who is 5-0 with a 1.69 ERA, won the
second Pitcher of the Month award of his career. Coincidentally,
the other time he won was also in April. The year was 1996, when he
won the league's Cy Young Award. &QL; 
THE RUMOR MILL &QL; 
Minnesota closer  &UR; Rick Aguilera continues to be closely monitored
by Atlanta scouts. Word is that Aguilera will waive his no-trade
clause if a deal is stuck with Atlanta. Giving more credence to
this is the fact that a Twins scout spent all of last weekend
checking out Braves games.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland teammates appear to be growing a bit weary of  &UR; David
Justice's minor injuries. Justice has gone into Manager  &UR; Mike
 &UR; Hargrove's office moments before games and asked out of the lineup.
Justice, who is signed through 2002, has three home runs and eight
RBIs. He has played left field in 27 of the 188 games since the
start of last season.
</P>
<P>
   Former World Series hero and rumored Diamondbacks expansion pick
draftee  &UR; Craig Counsell is being shopped by the Florida Marlins. He
has been completely buried by the Marlins, who are committed to
starting  &UR; Luis Castillo at second base.
</P>
<P>
   In what is probably a precursor to a move in 2000, San Francisco
called up  &UR; Dave Righetti to assume the role of pitching coach when
 &UR; Ron Perranoski was forced to leave the club to attend to his
ailing mother. Several people within the organization are very high
on Righetti.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland's Gold Glove shortstop,  &UR; Omar Vizquel, is nursing a
pulled quadriceps that he hurt on April 10. The club refuses to
place him on the disabled list, even though his uncharacteristic
six errors (one more than all of last year) have been directly
related to the injury.
</P>
<P>
   Expect Chicago Cubs Manager  &UR; Jim Riggleman to be a part of
 &UR; Bruce Bochy's All-Star Game coaching staff. Bochy, a member of
Riggleman's staff when he managed in San Diego, wound up replacing
Riggleman. The two remain close friends. &QL; 
THE RANKINGS &QL; 
 &UR; TOP OF THE ORDER &QL; 
 &QL; 
1. Cleveland &QL; 28-5 in games delayed by rain since
the start of 1996. &QL; 
 &QL; 
2. NY Yankees &QL; The record is not an indication of several problems
on this club. &QL; 
 &QL; 
3. Atlanta &QL; Does not appear to missing  &UR; Andres Galarraga's bat at
all. &QL; 
 &QL; 
4. NY Mets &QL; Have the best bullpen in the game, which tends to lead
to contending. &QL; 
 &QL; 
5. Houston &QL; Astros are talking about moving  &UR; Scott Elarton into the
rotation. &QL; 
 &QL; 
6. Los Angeles &QL; Dodgers are only 3-3 in games  &UR; Kevin Brown starts. &QL; 
 &QL; 
7. St. Louis &QL;  &UR; Fernando Tatis is looking mahvelous. Simply
mahvelous. &QL; 
 &QL; 
8. San Francisco &QL; Barely clinging to first place as the weekend
series started. &QL; 
 &QL; 
9. Texas &QL; May miss President  &UR; Tom Schieffer more than they want to
lead on. &QL; 
 &UR; BOTTOM OF THE ORDER &QL; 
 &QL; 
30. Florida &QL; Had two smallest home crowds ever last
week. &QL; 
 &QL; 
29. Montreal &QL; Does anyone really follow this club? Even in
Quebec? &QL; 
 &QL; 
28. Minnesota &QL; Wake us when all this stadium garbage finally gets
resolved. &QL; 
 &QL; 
27. Baltimore &QL; A little winning streak is a start, but problems
persist here. &QL; 
 &QL; 
26. Kansas City &QL; Royals are hoping pitcher  &UR; Jose Rosado only misses
one start. &QL; 
 &QL; 
25. San Diego &QL; Will the Padres go from first to worst to first to
worst? &QL; 
 &QL; 
24. Cincinnati &QL; Has won two in a row three times, but never three
in a row. &QL; 
 &QL; 
23. Boston &QL; That 6-1 start seems like it took place years ago. &QL; 
 &QL; 
22. Anaheim &QL;  &UR; Tim Belcher has not survived the fifth inning in five
of six starts. &QL; 
ON THE RISE &QL; 
 &UR; Oakland Athletics: Manager  &UR; Art Howe has these young A's playing
like they're ready to make a nuisance of themselves in the AL West,
a division where they were supposed to clearly be the underbelly.
But a little more than a month into the season, Oakland is looking
the part of a club with some interesting parts. Offensively, this
club can stack up with the best of them in the AL. The middle of
the lineup, which features  &UR; Jason Giambi,  &UR; Matt Stairs and
surprising  &UR; Olmedo Saenz, is more than respectable. Shortstop
 &UR; Miguel Tejada is showing the ability that led many in the
organization to compare him to a young
 &UR; Barry Larkin, and it may not be long until minor league pitching
sensation  &UR; Mark Mulder arrives in the Bay area. This is one of the
hottest clubs in baseball. &QL; 
GOING SOUTH &QL; 
 &UR; Toronto Blue Jays: The Blue Jays lost at home last Tuesday, their
first loss at SkyDome in 10 games. They then lost again Wednesday
and Thursday, being swept by Oakland. All the good feelings that
were with this club in the middle of April seem to be disappearing.
Injured starter  &UR; Joey Hamilton is not expected to return before May
20, and the offense, which produced big scores during the past two
weeks, is getting little help from a pitching staff that is having
trouble keepng opponents under 10 runs. &QL; 
OVERHEARD &QL; 
Cincinnati, ahem, outfielder  &UR; Dmitri Young crashed into the
outfield wall at Turner Field last weekend while chasing a deep fly
hit by Atlanta's  &UR; John Smoltz. Young missed the next four games
because of soreness in his left side. Young said after that
particular game: ``I fought the wall and the wall won. Tomorrow,
I'm going to the &UR; Andruw Jones School of Wall-Climbing.'' &QL; 
OUT OF LEFT FIELD &QL; 
Texas Rangers reliever  &UR; Jeff Zimmerman can put to rest any tags
about being a castoff from the independent Northern League, the
same place that produced Atlanta's  &UR; Kerry Ligtenberg. Zimmerman
entered the weekend series at Toronto with a 0.93 ERA in 19
innings. In 10 games he has walked two and struck out 14. Texas
Manager  &UR; Johnny Oates is calling on Zimmerman in the toughest of
situations. Opponents are batting only .109 against the
hard-throwing right-hander, a figure that drops to .091 when
runners are on base. Not bad for a kid who was trying to latch on
to whatever Northern League club would take a look at him two years
ago. &QL;

NATO SAYS IT THOUGHT EMBASSY WAS ARMS AGENCY 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS to update and reorganize.)  
(lh) 
 By MICHAEL R. GORDON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ A NATO aircraft bombed the Chinese Embassy
in Belgrade Friday night because the military command mistakenly
believed it was a headquarters for a Yugoslav arms agency, allied
officials said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The plane carried out its mission correctly and struck its
assigned building. But the aircraft was given faulty target
information, the officials explained.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials said that the Central Intelligence Agency had
picked the target, but stressed that the episode is being
investigated. One possibility, they said, is that intelligence
officials used out-of-date maps, although the site of the embassy
building was well known in the Yugoslav capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hit what we were aiming for,'' a NATO official said. ``But
we did not mean to hit the Chinese Embassy.''
</P>
<P>
   A military spokesman for NATO said a single aircraft was
involved and three bombs were dropped. While allied officials
declined to provide further details, the air raid may have been
carried out by a U.S. B-2 ``stealth'' bomber.
</P>
<P>
   The accidental bombing of the Chinese Embassy, which killed at
least three people and wounded about 20, has stirred up a political
storm for NATO, which has been anxious to secure China's
cooperation in fashioning a peace settlement for Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Javier Solana, NATO's secretary general, insisted Saturday,
however, that airstrikes would not end until President Slobodan
Milosevic of Yugoslavia stopped his attacks on ethnic Albanians and
agreed to NATO's terms. ``The attacks will continue,'' Solana said.
</P>
<P>
   The accidental attack comes on the heels of other notable
mistakes in the alliance's air campaign, including the bombing of a
hospital complex this week.
</P>
<P>
   Given that the alliance has launched more than 5,000 bombing
missions and used more than 15,000 missiles and bombs, its mistakes
have been relatively few. But they have been politically costly,
and now there is a risk that they will interfere with diplomatic
efforts on Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The latest accident revealed a glaring limitation of
high-technology warfare. Even in an age of precision-guided bombs,
an air campaign, which the alliance has relied on exclusively, can
be no better than the intelligence on which it is based.
</P>
<P>
   Before Friday's strike against the Chinese Embassy, NATO's
accidents stemmed from mistakes by the pilots, weapons failures
and, sometimes, plain bad luck.
</P>
<P>
   In the attack on the hospital, for example, an F-16 was trying
to drop an unguided cluster bomb on an airfield a mile away. A NATO
official said it was not clear if the pilot dropped the bomb too
soon or if there was a technical problem.
</P>
<P>
   The embassy episode was different. In this case the pilot
successfully hit the target he was told to strike.
</P>
<P>
   People in Belgrade said that it was difficult to confuse the
Chinese Embassy with the intended target, the federal Directorate
for Supply and Procurement, known by the Serbian initials SDPR. The
Chinese Embassy is a marble structure with blue mirrored glass and
flies the Chinese flag. It is one of the few embassies in Belgrade
that houses some staff members and other Chinese residents.
</P>
<P>
   The directorate, which coordinates Yugoslavia's weapons imports
and exports, is housed in a white office building. That building is
several hundred yards away, on the other side of a major
thoroughfare, Lenjinov Bulevar. Both structures are several years
old.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The accidental bombing of the embassy recalled the American
strike on the Al Firdos bunker in Baghdad during the Persian Gulf
war in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   In that case the pilot also accurately carried out his
instructions. He bombed an underground bunker used by Iraqi
intelligence officers. But as a result of an intelligence failure,
the CIA had overlooked indications that civilians were also using
the shelter.
</P>
<P>
   The uproar over the Al Firdos attack prompted Gen. Colin Powell,
then the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, to restrict attacks
against targets in downtown Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   Since NATO's airstrikes more than six weeks ago, allied
officials have made extensive use of laser-guided bombs and
satellite-guided munitions.
</P>
<P>
   A major aim has been to take the war home to the Yugoslav
leadership in Belgrade while avoiding civilian casualties.
</P>
<P>
   The strike against the Chinese Embassy was part of a broader
series of high-technology attacks against the Yugoslav capital.
Friday's strikes in Belgrade, in fact, were the heaviest so far.
</P>
<P>
   They included strikes against the Dobanovci Command Complex, a
residence of the Yugoslav president, Slobodan Milosevic, which
includes a bunker for his high command.
</P>
<P>
   The Hotel Jugoslavia was also pounded. Allied officials say it
houses a barracks and command center for Zeljko Raznjatovic, the
paramilitary leader knows as Arkan who has been charged with war
crimes for his attacks in Bosnia. His gang, ``Arkan's Tigers,'' has
been accused of attacking ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Other targets struck in Belgrade include various Defense
Ministry buildings, an Interior Ministry headquarters and a
building used by the Yugoslav general staff, which has a satellite
antenna for military communications.
</P>
<P>
   Electrical transformers in Belgrade and Obrenovac were also
attacked. Along with additional attacks Saturday, the strikes
disrupted Serb's command and control, NATO spokesman insisted.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the bombing was a major political setback for NATO,
particularly since China has been a sharp critic of the bombing
attacks and holds a veto on the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance has agreed to seek the Security Council's approval
for a settlement in Kosovo and the dispatch of a security force
there to protect returning refugees.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, NATO believes it needs to keep up the military
pressure to achieve a diplomatic settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Its air commanders have sought not just to pummel Serbian
troops. By targeting military ministries, command posts and
communications center in and around Belgrade, they have also sought
to compel Milosevic to withdraw his troops from Kosovo and meet
other allied demands.
</P>
<P>
   But in pursuing their goals, NATO officials have made strenuous
efforts to limit civilian casualties. It is not just a moral
concern. Allied officials have been concerned that public support
in the West would be undermined if too many civilians are killed or
hurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``NATO did not intentionally target the Chinese Embassy in
Belgrade last night, '' said the NATO spokesman, Jamie Shea. ``The
wrong building was attacked. This was a terrible accident. NATO
deeply regrets the loss of life, and injuries to Chinese diplomatic
personnel or to any other civilians in the Embassy at the time.''

THERAPY FOR CEREBAL PALSY A LITTLE KNOWN OPTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MAUREEN WEST  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sometimes Sherry Steiner runs her fingers lightly over her
15-year-old stepson's face, just in case he has an itch that he
can't tell her about. She provides his daily care.
</P>
<P>
   Her stepson, Jeffrey Steiner Jr., who suffers from severe
cerebral palsy, is wracked by nearly continuous muscle spasms that
send his body into painful contortions. He is doing the equivalent
of a continuous high-energy, and very involuntary workout. He can't
stop, though the 65-pound teenager who lives in central Phoenix is
chronically exhausted.
</P>
<P>
   A medical device is available that might offer him a precious
fragment of a more typical life _ an implant called the Baclofen
pump, which delivers medication. Getting that pump, for which they
finally received authorization last week, had been the focus of his
parents' lives.
</P>
<P>
   While Jeffrey's parents want it for him to make him more
comfortable, other parents of children with cerebral palsy or with
head and spinal injuries see it as a way for their child to sit up,
bathe, dress and feed themselves. Or perhaps to talk or walk.
</P>
<P>
   But the pump is a well-kept secret in Arizona, medical
professionals say. Even though thousands use it across the country,
only four children use it in the Valley out of an estimated 2,000
possible cerebral palsy patients and many others with spinal
injuries.
</P>
<P>
   That's because many doctors don't offer the pump as an option,
pushing instead extensive and permanent surgeries, doctors say.
</P>
<P>
   And it's because getting funding for the pump, estimated to cost
$15,000 to $20,000 the first year, can mean treading the medical
insurance slippery slope.
</P>
<P>
   The state-funded Children's Rehabilitative Services doesn't
offer it to patients because they are still evaluating it, though
the FDA gave the approval for cerebral palsy patients in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Their concerns include stories of pump failures and infections.
Others have expressed concerns about the use of the pump in
children younger than 8. The size of the pump, comparable to a
hockey puck, is a problem for smaller bodies, even a smaller model
designed specifically for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Children's bodies are still growing _ putting something into
an adult is different than putting something into a child,'' said
Dr. Theodore Tarby of CRS.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors who advocate the pump say it may not be the solution for
every child with cerebral palsy or brain damage. But it should at
least be considered one of the options.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, there have been problems with it, but all surgical
procedures have potential complications, including those that are
commonly used for children with cerebral palsy,'' said Dr. David
Hirsch, who treats a 16-year-old patient who for two years has been
successfully using the pump. &QL; 
`AN EXCITING OPTION'
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Linda Krach of Gillette Children's Specialty Health Care in
St. Paul, Minn., treats 150 children who have the pump. About 100
of those have cerebral palsy. One teenager who once needed help to
even get into his wheelchair can now dress herself, and is planning
the day when she will live on her own.
</P>
<P>
   ```We have others who now have more endurance for walking, can
dial a phone or feed themselves,'' Krach said.
</P>
<P>
   She acknowledged that the pump has caused infections, and some
have experienced tube malfunctions. But most choose to correct the
complications and keep the pump.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an exciting option not without risks, but I hope it
becomes more available for children,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Only four children in the Valley have the pump. Jeffrey will be
the fifth. Three other families have approached their insurance
companies asking for them to pay for an evaluation to see whether
they would be candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The conventional treatment in Arizona for severely spastic
patients like Jeffrey include orally administered muscle relaxants,
expensive physical therapy, and periodic surgeries to cut and
reattach muscles and tendons, reducing their tension.
</P>
<P>
   Another surgery commonly done and of comparable expense as
having a Baclofen pump involves selectively cutting nerves as they
exit the spinal cord. It is helpful to many children, but those
cuts are permanent.
</P>
<P>
   If there are problems with the pump, you can just take it out,
doctors say. &QL; 
HOW IT WORKS
</P>
<P>
   The Baclofen pump chemically relaxes the muscles without surgery
and without many of the side effects of oral medication. Because
the pump places the medicine directly along the spine, the entire
body and brain do not have to be flooded with relaxants. The disk
is implanted in the abdomen where it pumps tiny amounts of Baclofen
around the spinal cord. It is refilled four or five times a year by
needle injection into the pump.
</P>
<P>
   In most cases, parents are not told about it unless they happen
across information on the Internet or in health magazines,
according to several parents in the Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey, who was born prematurely at 31 weeks, weighing 2{
pounds, has severe cerebral palsy. He isn't able to talk or express
emotions in a way visitors can understand, but his parents know his
language of grunts and ``ah''s. When a phone call arrives from
out-of-state relatives, excitement fights its way, muscle by
muscle, to his face.
</P>
<P>
   ``Judging by his responses, there is a lot going on in his
mind,'' Sherry Steiner says. Someday she and Jeffrey's father,
Jeffrey Sr., hope to discover more of what's locked inside him.
</P>
<P>
   On April 12, he responded favorably to trial doses of Baclofen,
injected into his spinal fluid. That positive test meant that an
implanted Baclofen pump would likely work for him.
</P>
<P>
   But then the Steiners had to get the implant surgery authorized
by their insurance company, which came through last week. The pump
has been around for eight years and has been approved by the FDA
for cerebral palsy treatment since 1996. Many believe it isn't more
expensive that the present routine of pills, muscle surgeries, and
painful recoveries and therapy, and that, ultimately, it may
decrease other medical costs such as surgeries.
</P>
<P>
   The Baclofen pump, according to its manufacturer, Medtronics,
could work for about two-thirds of cerebral palsy patients
suffering severe spasticity. Other health experts say 10 to 50
percent is a better estimate. It also is useful for patients with
spasticity caused by other disorders, such as spinal cord and brain
injuries, multiple sclerosis, and transverse myelitis.
</P>
<P>
   The implanted pump costs about $15,000 to $20,000 for the first
year, including the $9,000 pump and surgery to install it.
Recharging the pump with fresh supplies of Baclofen costs about
$1,000 to $1,500 a year and then there is physical therapy. The
pump itself lasts five to seven years. Pumps lasting 10 years are
in development. &QL; 
MORE SHOULD BE TOLD
</P>
<P>
   Dr. John Porter, a Valley rehabilitation specialist, and Dr.
Martin Burnett, a Valley anesthesiologist who has done the Baclofen
pump implant surgeries on the four Valley patients who have them,
say more Arizona cerebral palsy patients should be told about the
pump. They are trying to spread the word.
</P>
<P>
   Other advocates are Guy Collison, executive director of United
Cerebral Palsy in the Valley, and William Timmons, CEO of Los Nin
os Hospital in Phoenix, which treats children with cerebral palsy,
head and spinal cord injuries.
</P>
<P>
   The same kind of implanted pump, filled with morphine instead of
Baclofen, is now used routinely for terminal cancer patients to
eliminate or reduce pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not allowing younger people to have them is like sentencing
them to 60 years in bed,'' Burnett said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Acupuncture took 4,000 years to prove itself. I hope we don't
have to wait that long for this procedure,'' Porter added.
</P>
<P>
   Children's Rehabilitative Services, which is under contract with
AHCCCS (the state's medical insurance system for lower income
families and some disabled), sees most of Arizona's cerebral palsy
patients. CRS does not endorse the pump nor do doctors there
educate the clients about its availability.
</P>
<P>
   They are evaluating it and discussing informing patients about
it, said Dr. Theodore Tarby, medical director for CRS. The CRS
medical board has discussed the pump at three of the four most
recent meetings.
</P>
<P>
   While he has visited clinics in other states that use the pump,
there is no formal study under way by CRS, nor has a time line for
a decision been set.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will continue to evaluate it on a quarterly basis until we
either accept it as an alternative or eliminate it completely,'' he
said. But he suspects the board will likely add the pump as an
option.
</P>
<P>
   Tarby is also concerned that once patients turn 21, and they
leave CRS care, there is no guarantee from an agency or insurance
company to continue maintaining the pumps. &QL; 
CAUGHT IN RED TAPE
</P>
<P>
   Some suspicious parents, including Sherry Charlot, believe that
the doctors who make a living doing surgery to relieve muscle
tension have a financial incentive to discourage the new
technology. She has filed a grievance to get a Baclofen evaluation
for her 9-year-old daughter, Kara, who has a moderate case of
cerebral palsy. She is not asking for a new pump but to see if her
daughter could likely benefit from one.
</P>
<P>
   Charlot and others say they are being caught between CRS and
their insurance companies because neither will pay for the
evaluations.
</P>
<P>
   Charlot said CRS told her that it was her insurance company's
responsibility. But her insurance company told her it was CRS's.
</P>
<P>
   For legal advice, she went to Ed Myers, assisted technology
lawyer for the Center for Law and Disabilities. He is disturbed by
CRS's position toward the pump, considering what he has read about
the research and anecdotes that are showing how it helps children
with cerebral palsy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why kids in this state aren't getting the evaluations is
beyond me,'' Myers said. ``If they are good candidates they should
be getting this kind of treatment. When it comes to assisted
technology, two things are common: one is lack of knowledge and the
other is the fear of cost.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fear is that everyone will come running to AHCCCS asking
for this. That's not true because not all kids will be good
candidates for this.''
</P>
<P>
   Tarby, of CRS, called invalid the claim that doctors are holding
back the pump because it would hurt their practices. Most want to
find anything that would help their patients, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Of the five children in the Valley known to have at one time
received Baclofen pumps, one had the pump removed because the
child's body rejected it.
</P>
<P>
   But there are success stories. Car accident victim Sara Smith,
now 10, suffered painful spasms that stiffened her body, according
to her mother. She had to stay in bed most of the time. She
couldn't even be put into a wheelchair. Since receiving the pump,
Sara now uses a wheelchair, has re-learned how to speak and is back
in school.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. David Hirsch, Jeffrey's pediatrician, has another young
patient with a pump, a 16-year-old-boy who is doing very well with
it after two years. His spasticity is the result of an accident and
subsequent brain damage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to see it done more,'' Hirsch said. ``But it is
important for people to be carefully evaluated first.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like it because it is another alternative in terms of
therapy and to improve function and quality of life. Ultimately it
may decrease other medical costs if it reduces other
complications'' such as surgeries and medications.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey's parents were delighted that their insurance company
approved the evaluation and trial. During the past three weeks, the
Steiners and their doctors made many long phone calls to Cigna
HealthCare of Arizona, their insurance company, to explain the
medical benefits and how money would be saved in the long run. On
Friday, Cigna authorized the pump for Jeffrey.
</P>
<P>
   Timmons, CEO of Los Ninos, was delighted: ``I would hope that
other health care plans will follow Cigna's lead, and that more
children are evaluated for the Baclofen therapy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey could receive the pump within a couple of weeks, but not
until the family weighs whether there are other medical risks to
the boy. &QL; 
MEDICINE VS. INSURERS
</P>
<P>
   The Baclofen pump is one example of a new technology aggravating
the relationships between insurers, doctors and patients, according
to health care experts. Sales of new medical devices in the United
States rose 30 percent over the past five years, outpacing the 22
percent general rise in health care spending, according to a recent
``New York Times'' story. Insurance companies balk at paying the
initial high costs for the pump and other new devices, even though
they may save money in the long run.
</P>
<P>
   Porter and Myers both commented that they believe any changes in
policy involving new technologies will have to be consumer-driven.
If insurance companies, CRS or AHCCCS hear from 100 or more upset
parents who can't get their children evaluated, that in itself
could help change the policy, Myers said.
</P>
<P>
   Krach says that generally insurance companies approve it, after
she makes the case that it isn't experimental and that it is FDA
approved.
</P>
<P>
   Being frustrated and persistent helped Alice Wilson of Kingman
get help for her daughter, Danah, 24. She only wishes her daughter,
who has had cerebral palsy since birth, had received the implanted
pump when she was younger. After two years and a mountain of
paperwork, her daughter underwent implant surgery in December.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is communicating and enjoying life more,'' Wilson said.
Danah then spoke for herself, agreeing that she now feels much
better. So much better, in fact, that a previously scheduled back
surgery has been canceled.
</P>
<P>
   Six months ago Danah couldn't speak in a way that strangers
could understand. She was taking three different muscle relaxants,
and was undermedicated or overmedicated at various times.
</P>
<P>
   Danah tells her mother she hopes to live on her own someday. Her
mother prays she is able to do that. They believe in good breaks
now. &QL; 
PUMP RAISES HOPES
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Steiner Jr. was able to get a temporary break in life on
April 12, as the drug Baclofen was injected into his spinal canal
and his muscles relaxed. But it was temporary; eight hours later
the effects of the medicine wore off.
</P>
<P>
   With the Baclofen pump, there is hope that, once his muscles
relax, he might be able to breathe normally and not require his
oxygen bottle. He might be able to swallow, or eat solid foods.
</P>
<P>
   Could he walk and talk again? His parents don't dream for that
right now. Most say that will probably never happen in his case.
But for Sara Smith, it's a possibility.
</P>
<P>
   A more realistic dream for Jeffrey is that he be spared the
torture of his constant involuntary workout and the total
dependence it causes.
</P>
<P>
   At age 3, Jeffrey's parents were told it might be better to
institutionalize him and then move on with their own lives. That's
a necessary choice for many. But Jeffrey Sr. couldn't do that,
believing it would have been like signing a death sentence for his
son.
</P>
<P>
   Things are looking up now, he believes. &QL;

EL DUQUE FINDS THAT LIFE IN BIG CITY CAN BE BRUTAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By JACK CURRY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Orlando Hernandez ambled toward the dugout after his
miserable day had ended Saturday, resembling a wayward tourist lost
in Central Park. He pulled off his New York Yankee cap, rubbed his
bald head and looked as if he did not belong. When the fans gave
the bruised Hernandez a rousing ovation, the scene seemed even more
incongruous.
</P>
<P>
   Give Hideki Irabu a reprieve following Friday night's
masterpiece. But what about El Duque? What is wrong with El Duque?
The usually cool pitcher could not last beyond a disaster of a
fifth inning and was pummeled during an ugly 14-5 loss to the
Seattle Mariners at Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   As the Yankees have won 12 of their last 17 games and rumbled
along in first place, their winning has often obscured some
problems. One problem that has evolved is Hernandez, who has
allowed 26 earned runs in his last 28 2/3 innings to fatten his
earned run average from a puny 2.51 to a portly 6.28. Saturday was
no mirage because El Duque has pitched poorly in three of five
starts since opening up 2-0.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the Yankees insisted that Hernandez simply lost his
rhythm and did not throw crisp breaking pitches in a six-run fifth
inning, the pitcher was so upset that he bolted the clubhouse
without addressing reporters. Hernandez's locker was barren, but
the first-base coach Jose Cardenal, the pitcher's interpreter, sat
in front of the empty locker and playfully asked and answered
questions by himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``El Duque, they want to know why you left,'' Cardenal said.
</P>
<P>
   Then Cardenal made his voice deeper and explained that Hernandez
was perturbed with himself.
</P>
<P>
   That was obvious. Usually, Hernandez is engaging and it was very
surprising that he was unavailable. Perhaps he did not want to
recapitulate the details of the fifth, an inning in which the
Mariners scored all six runs with two out. Hernandez was torched
for seven runs and 10 hits in four and two-thirds innings, the
third time this season he has allowed seven runs in a start.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apparently, he was disgusted with the way the game went,''
said Mel Stottlemyre, the pitching coach. ``I didn't talk to him
after the game. I can't tell you any more than that. I have to wait
until tomorrow to talk to him myself.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   On a lazy, gray afternoon on which umbrellas were almost always
poised, Hernandez sputtered while Freddy Garcia survived. Garcia, a
22-year-old right-hander who was sent to Seattle last year as part
of the Randy Johnson trade with Houston, left with a 9-1 cushion in
the sixth after Chili Davis hit a line drive off his right
shoulder. The rookie was charged with three runs in five and
two-thirds innings, which is ordinary, yet Garcia was the most
impressive pitcher of the day.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez was close to duplicating's Garcia performance as the
Yankees trailed by only 1-0 in the the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   But with two outs and no one on base, Hernandez allowed Brian
Hunter's single, and that started a frustrating procession of six
straight Mariners reaching base against him. All six scored as
David Bell, Ken Griffey Jr. and David Segui singled in runs, John
Mabry had a run-scoring double and Tom Lampkin looped a two-run
double off Tony Fossas. It was 7-0. It was not a pretty sight,
especially for Hernandez.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he had a good rhythm for a while, and then he lost it
and got disgusted and didn't regroup,'' Stottlemyre said. ``He had
good stuff. I think he let things bother him and things got out of
control.''
</P>
<P>
   Very out of control. But the Yankees, who have watched Hernandez
baffle teams with his array of pitches and his high leg kick and
funky delivery, refused to concede that anything is wrong.
</P>
<P>
   They said that Saturday was a bad day, ignoring the fact that it
has been a bad three weeks for Hernandez.
</P>
<P>
   ``They hit some of his breaking stuff,'' said Don Zimmer, the
interim manager. ``I'm not going to worry about that. The next time
he's liable to pitch a shutout.''
</P>
<P>
   After Hernandez departed, the game disintegrated into a display
of pathetic middle relief. The Yankees sliced their deficit to 9-4
with three runs in the sixth, but Jay Tessmer, who was blitzed for
six runs in two innings, could not stop the Mariners, and the game
took almost four hours to complete. By then, Hernandez was
showered, dressed and had his car keys ready. He knew his way to
the parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looked pretty disappointed,'' David Cone said. ``He wasn't
happy about it.''

TONE DEAF? LAKERS WILL HEAR O'NEAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD _ It won't take long for the Lakers to gauge their
chances in today's opener of their first-round playoff series. Just
look to the big fella.
</P>
<P>
   Shaquille O'Neal is at his best, his most focused, his meanest
when the playoffs arrive. You can usually see it in his face, and
in his scoring totals. O'Neal's intensity was noticeably ratched up
two weeks ago against Portland, and with the Lakers following his
lead, they routed the Blazers to start a four-game winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shaq sets that tone,'' Derek Fisher said. ``If he comes out
with an aggressive mentality on both ends, then he sets the tone
for everybody.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you can look at games over the years that we've lost
and look at Shaquille's play and how he starts a game, you can kind
of determine how we play from there. He's gonna score 30 with his
eyes closed, but if he scores 30 and he's blocking shots and he's
rebounding and he's being a presence in the middle, then that's the
Shaquille we can win with.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Shaquille that just averages 30 points just because he has
that ability doesn't do us a lot of good. We need the dominant
Shaquille, the one that plays defense, blocks shots, helps us
rotate on defense and is basically captain of the ship.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Kurt Rambis said it's O'Neal's responsibility to set the
tone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still firmly believe that as he goes, our team goes,''
Rambis said. ``We put a lot of pressure on him as the leader of
this ballclub, and the hub of this team to deliver for us at both
ends of the court. That's what superstars do, they step it up in
the playoffs because they know they have to. I think those last few
ballgames we played are an indication, he's ready to go and he's
ready to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Daily dose of Chuck: From the mouth of the NBA's reigning
talker, Houston's Charles Barkley, came these highlights Saturday:
</P>
<P>
   On the presumption he has little time left to win a
championship: ``I wish everybody would quit telling me what I think
and I feel. I would love to win the championship, but you can be
rest assured, I'm not gonna kill myself if I don't win.''
</P>
<P>
   On the early hype surrounding the Lakers: ``I didn't think they
were the favorites, they're not the favorites.... They obviously
felt they were overrated if they made all those changes.... The
team they started the season with, you all were swinging on their
vines like you L.A. people have a tendency to do. They've got a lot
of talent, but they weren't the best team in the West.''
</P>
<P>
   On the trade that brought Glen Rice to L.A.: ``I think they
really do miss Elden Campbell and Eddie Jones. I think they've
proven that. We knew they were gonna miss Elden Campbell. I think
they missed him all season.''
</P>
<P>
   Jewelry challenged: O'Neal isn't concerned that the Rockets'
Scottie Pippen has six championship rings and Hakeem Olajuwon two.
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' the ring-less O'Neal said, ``I'm on the same page with
Barkley.''
</P>
<P>
   No Dionne Warwick: Rambis bristled when a reporter asked if
Houston's recent 22-point victory over the Lakers would give the
Rockets an edge in confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ask them, I've got no idea what they're thinking,'' he said.
``If I could know what people are thinking, I'd be in Vegas right
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Ouch report: Both teams enter today's game without significant
injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher said his left shoulder, wrenched in practice on Friday,
felt fine and he was able to practice without limitations, making
him probable for today's game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's better. I got some treatment (Friday), iced it a couple
times, took some anti-inflammatories, it felt a lot better,'' he
said.

NAVAJO SHEEP CAMP FOREVER PART OF WRITER'S LIFE 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   BODAWAY, Ariz. _ My view is breathtaking.
</P>
<P>
   Outside my window, red buttes and deep purple mesas sweep
skyward to the sapphire heavens.
</P>
<P>
   The Kaibab mountains snake across the horizon before ducking
into the Grand Canyon. Behind me salmon-colored Echo Cliffs perch
on high desert.
</P>
<P>
   The silent land is interrupted only by a meadowlark's song.
</P>
<P>
   Vacation? Nope, this is Navajo sheepherding _ urban style.
</P>
<P>
   My view is from the seat of my 4X4 truck, parked on a hill near
Bodaway, 80 miles north of Flagstaff. I'm overlooking a gully that
empties into the Little Colorado River. My mother, Dorothy Reed,
and Aunt Jeanette's tiny herd of 17 goats and three sheep, graze
below.
</P>
<P>
   It tickles my non-Navajo friends in Phoenix to think I tend
sheep some weekends. What they don't know, and I can't describe for
them, is how much the sheep are still part of me and have been the
focus of Navajo life for generations.
</P>
<P>
   My journey to sheep camp usually begins on a Saturday morning
from the big city. I fill up the truck with gas and leave behind
the Valley _ the screaming ambulances, churning dishwasher,
chattering newscasts and people in a hurry.
</P>
<P>
   When I reach my mother's home in Tuba City four hours later,
life has gotten slower, quieter.
</P>
<P>
   The community of 10,000 in northern Arizona is a miniversion of
city life _ with schools, hospitals, tourist joints, government
buildings, fast food and neighborhoods. But it has just two traffic
lights and fewer than a dozen stop signs.
</P>
<P>
   My two daughters and I check in with my mother, who usually has
our schedule for Sunday mapped out. While we tend their herd, the
women, both in their 70s, take care of chores such as trips to the
laundry or the grocery store.
</P>
<P>
   My mother and aunt divide their time between Tuba City and sheep
camps in Bodaway, 31 miles west. &QL; 
LEAVING SHEEP BEHIND
</P>
<P>
   &UR; They are armed with an oral legacy of how the Reeds, of the
Bitter Water and Many Goats clans, ran sheep on sprawling land east
of the roaring Colorado River.
</P>
<P>
   Their story is changing with my generation of Navajos.
</P>
<P>
   We attended school and learned modern ways. Our lives quickly
changed in the 1970s and '80s and continue changing today.
</P>
<P>
   Our jobs took us away from the sheep. Asphalt, air pollution and
the American Dream replaced the wide views, sage-scented air and
nomadic ways.
</P>
<P>
   Herds of sheep and goats still criss-cross the range but are
fewer because of tribal livestock restrictions or simply the age of
their owners.
</P>
<P>
   Where large herds once gathered, stone corrals stand empty. The
hardened green dung dotting the dirt hints at their former use.
</P>
<P>
   Some elderly Navajos, physically unable to tend their animals,
have sold flocks that once would have gone to the next generation.
</P>
<P>
   Some of their children and grandchildren now live different
lives, both on the reservation and off, and rely on a wage economy.
</P>
<P>
   I am one of the Navajo children who joined the mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   Sadness overwhelms me when my mother says, in Navajo, ``I
imagine my life and that of the sheep will end soon.''
</P>
<P>
   ````Ha'atishdoo ya ahal yaa'doo?'''' ``Who will take care of the
sheep?''
</P>
<P>
   She could be speaking for Navajos everywhere who worry about the
vanishing tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Will it disappear along with my mother's generation?
</P>
<P>
   Sheep are life to the women. Each morning the language of their
prayers to the Holy People is laced with homages to the flock.
</P>
<P>
   ``We take care of sheep, they take care of us,'' is their motto.
The women own the sheep and goat herds, which were gifts from their
mothers before starting a family of their own.
</P>
<P>
   They can trade a sheep for a truckload of wood for the winter.
Or they can donate a sheep or goat to a relative for a curing
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   And when my mother has a ceremony of her own, those relatives
return the favor by bringing their own sheep for food.
</P>
<P>
   Or they can sell a sheep for $60 to $70 to Navajos with a mutton
craving. The money can be stretched a month or more, buying
groceries, gas or truck repairs.
</P>
<P>
   Two decades ago, when we had more sheep, my Aunt Jeanette used
the wool to weave pretty rugs. Now she buys her wool at the Tuba
City Trading Post. &QL; 
ARMED WITH INSTRUCTIONS
</P>
<P>
   Sheep placed the extended family on a seasonal schedule.
</P>
<P>
   In the spring, lambs and kids were born. My family came together
for shearing in late spring and sold burlap sacks of wool at the
now-defunct Cedar Ridge Trading Post.
</P>
<P>
   In late summer, lambs were sold to the traders. In the cold
winters, baby animals often froze to death.
</P>
<P>
   It turned into a survival of the fittest. My mother believes
that lambs born in the dead of winter are more adaptable, healthier
and sold for more at the trading post.
</P>
<P>
   She and my aunt still rely on the help of their family to run
their sheep.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes they hire sheepherders for $10 a day. Or they enlist
my brother William, a biology instructor at Tuba City High, on the
weekends and holidays to help with the herd.
</P>
<P>
   When my daughters, Jaylene, 16, and Ninabah, 4, and I visit, my
mother volunteers us to care for her flock.
</P>
<P>
   Before she dispatches us, she issues orders:
</P>
<P>
   Take the sheep south where there is plenty of greasewood on the
sunny side of the gray butte. Then take the flock to the earthen
dam east of Red Butte.
</P>
<P>
   Make sure the straggler goat (the one with the cow bell) stays
with the herd.
</P>
<P>
   Feed the two cats and three dogs and be sure the food is divided
evenly among them. Watch the red dog; he's a pig.
</P>
<P>
   Before we leave for sheep camp, we stop at the Tuba City Bashas'
grocery store for bottled water, bagels, cheddar cheese, crackers,
Lunchables, granola bars, apples, chips and soda. We also stop for
gas, as this will be an expedition into territory far from any
services.
</P>
<P>
   Although five electric transmission lines snake through the
reservation to major cities around the West, the homes near Bodaway
lack electricity and running water.
</P>
<P>
   Outhouses, cast-iron stoves, kerosene lamps and flashlights are
everyday necessities. The only signs of progress are pickup trucks
and framed hogans.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike yesteryear, when my family and I guided sheep on foot, my
daughters and I tend sheep city-slicker style. On this cold
December Sunday, we pile into my red Toyota (which has an air
conditioner and heater).
</P>
<P>
   We have goosedown jackets, wool socks, thick sweaters,
sunglasses, fleece-lined jeans, caps, gloves, Nike hiking boots,
sun block, lip balm and a CD player with headphones. Tracy Chapman,
Violent Femmes, Grateful Dead, Fleetwood Mac and Sharon Burch are
ready to entertain us.
</P>
<P>
   My teenage daughter brings along ``Gone With the Wind,'' and my
toddler lugs a bag of coloring books and paper for doodling. Winnie
the Pooh, a snoring Ernie and a bear named ``Sniff'' climb in with
her.
</P>
<P>
   My mother notices the load and jokes, ``Moving somewhere?'' &QL; 
CHANGING TIMES
</P>
<P>
   When I was a young girl, a sheepherder wore a thin shirt, a
jacket, canvas sneakers, jeans and a simple scarf. He or she
carried a rusty can loaded with pebbles attached to bailing wire.
The noisy container came in handy when sheep or goats turned
stubborn and refused to follow the main herd.
</P>
<P>
   Rusty old cans now dot the landscape.
</P>
<P>
   And yesterday's sheepherder took one slice of day-old ash bread
or cold frybread to nibble on. I recall many times my then-young
brothers and cousins survived on two meals a day as their little
legs carried them far away from the main camp.
</P>
<P>
   And when the sheep and dogs drank the muddy water behind the
earthen dam, we also quenched our thirst from cupped hands.
</P>
<P>
   My late grandmother Edith would throw a fit when she caught her
grandsons and sheep dogs taking a dip together in the sheep's
water.
</P>
<P>
   I drank from behind the dam for the last time as a teenager. We
were camped at Missing Tooth Hill in north Bodaway.
</P>
<P>
   I knelt by the water under a cloudless summer day. Sweating from
the day's work, I drank from a clear spot on the water's edge. At
least I did until I noticed movement to my left and watched a
black-and-yellow snake skinny-dipping an arm's length away. I never
forgot my canteen after that.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s and '70s, my mother and aunt had 400 head of sheep.
Even a decade ago their flock numbered 250.
</P>
<P>
   In the warmer months, they roamed the remote land around Bodaway
near Twin Hills, The Place Where The Mesas Come Together, Pillow
Hill, The Place Where the Light Earthen Dam Is, or The Watering
Hole Where the Horses Go In Reverse.
</P>
<P>
   Come winter, the flock moved west to The Place Among The Sage
Brush, closer to the confluence of the Colorado and Little Colorado
rivers. &QL; 
Not so simple &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Today, on the dirt road to Red Butte, Ninabah is entertained by
the dust snaking behind the truck. She complains when the bouncing
truck ruins a straight line in her coloring book.
</P>
<P>
   We reach sheep &UR; camp just below Red Butte where the goats and
sheep are penned in a haphazard fence of wire and wooden boards.
The dogs meet us with their barks and the goats perk up their ears.
</P>
<P>
   On this trip it's just the three of us and the herd.
</P>
<P>
   I detangle the rusted bed spring that serves as a corral gate.
The goats rush for the entrance and I turn them south toward the
giant gully.
</P>
<P>
   Some of my non-Navajo friends guess that herding sheep is like
taking a great hike. You walk and check out the landscape.
</P>
<P>
   It's not quite that simple. Once the sheepherder decides where
to go, the next chore is to make sure the wooly creatures stay
together and move in a similar path.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, a few pesky goats decide where they will graze and
move to places you don't want them to.
</P>
<P>
   As a youngster herding sheep near the Grand Canyon rim, I recall
goats would wander near the sheer walled areas. My mother warned me
to stay away from the edge because the Wind People lived there and
might pull me into the canyon.
</P>
<P>
   Running a smaller herd on flat rolling land is easier. And with
a vehicle, a sheepherder can park on top of the tallest nearby
butte and keep tabs on the herd.
</P>
<P>
   And it's on top of a butte overlooking a snarling gully that we
park the Toyota. Jaylene pulls out the headphones and begins to tap
the window.
</P>
<P>
   Ninabah whines, ``Let's go home and watch TV. I miss my
cartoons.'' &QL; 
SLOWLY GRAZING
</P>
<P>
   In the distance, my mother's tiny herd moves slowly as they
graze. That means there's plenty to eat. When vegetation is sparse,
the herd moves quickly.
</P>
<P>
   It's quiet out here and occasionally a jet will tow a contrail
across the sky.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes I hear a sheep's bleating or the clang of the cow bell
as that slow goat moves. Or dog barks at a jackrabbit hiding
beneath a boulder.
</P>
<P>
   At noon, we drop the tailgate and break out the cheese, crackers
and Lunchables.
</P>
<P>
   At day's end, the goats and sheep wander back to Red Butte. They
stop to drink behind the earthen dam before reaching the corral.
</P>
<P>
   When we drive into camp after them, my mother waits by the
corral. Jeanette had dropped her off so she could check on the
herd.
</P>
<P>
   The last task of the day is Jaylene's, who pairs the mother
goats to the kids, with the help of colored strings identifying the
pairs.
</P>
<P>
   While Jaylene does that, another goat gives birth to twins. My
mother tenderly picks up one bleating kid goat, soaked in yellowish
birth fluid.
</P>
<P>
   This one we take back to Tuba City. Its mother has already
abandoned it, licking and nuzzling its sibling.
</P>
<P>
   My mother places the goat inside an empty cardboard box lined
with rags.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the truck, we head to Tuba City. She sits with the box
on her lap and asks me to turn up the heater.
</P>
<P>
   Jaylene wants a bath to wash off the dust. Ninabah demands a
Happy Meal at McDonald's.
</P>
<P>
   In Tuba City, my mother buys a Gerber baby bottle and fixes warm
milk in Jeanette's hogan to feed the kid goat.
</P>
<P>
   ````Ya'di'ladinii?'''' (``What are you saying?'') she asks the
goat softly as though speaking to an irritated infant.
</P>
<P>
   She gently places it on a rag in her lap and props up its wobbly
head. Her arthritic hand holds the bottle.
</P>
<P>
   She pries open its mouth, inserts the bottle's nipple and gently
presses down on the little goat's nostrils. She repeats the gesture
until the animal tastes the milk and begins to suck.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yucky!'' shouts my niece Veronica Yellowhair, watching sticky
stuff slide off the goat's hide.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's stinky, huh?'' chimes in my 4-year-old. ``It needs a
tissue to wipe its nose.''
</P>
<P>
   Little Veronica lives in Salt Lake City, and my daughter lives
with me in the Valley.
</P>
<P>
   I translate their words for my mother, who chuckles and looks at
me.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't understand my lifestyle, do they?''
</P>
<P>
   Then she asks me a favor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would you explain to the little ``sanis'' (women) &UR; here that
sheep and goats have always been and will be a part of my life
during my time on Earth?
</P>
<P>
   ``And add that their parents were raised caring for sheep and
goats until they ran off to the big cities?''
</P>
<P>
   I'll tell them. &QL;

SABONIS BECOMES BIG OBSTACLE FOR SUNS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID CASSTEVENS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND - If he yelled the instruction once he yelled it a
half-dozen times. Danny Ainge shouted, ``Thumb up Sabonis!''
</P>
<P>
   I'm not sure what that means, but I wouldn't do it.
</P>
<P>
   Why make the big guy mad?
</P>
<P>
   Arvydas Sabonis is a huge man. He is not to be trifled with. If
the Portland center appears on TV to be bigger than other players
you should see him in person and Luc Longley and the Suns got a
close-up look at the Portland's aging giant.
</P>
<P>
   There he was, big as Eastern Europe, loping ponderously up and
down the court.
</P>
<P>
   The man with the bad haircut and soft hands dropped a baby hook
gently into the net. He moved outside and swished a jumper. More
than once he deftly flipped the ball off to a teammate with a quick
no-look Globetrotter pass.
</P>
<P>
   When the Trail Blazers' 7-foot-3, 300- pound post man pinned a
Suns' missed shot against the glass and seized the ball with one
hand, as if picking grapefruit, the Rose Garden crowd ooooooohhhhed
and aaaaahed and celebrated the impressive feat with an
oh-my-goodness grin.
</P>
<P>
   Big man.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's as big as Shaq,'' said Joe Kleine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, bigger,'' Ainge said.
</P>
<P>
   And the visitors who haven't beaten the Blazers in four tries
had no answer for him. The Suns hired Longley to match up with
other teams' big men but he didn't in Game 1 of the first-round
playoff series, which the Trail Blazers won, 95-85, after a late
scoring run, led by Isaiah Rider.
</P>
<P>
   Sabonis scored 12 points and grabbed eight rebounds. He posted
career-playoffs highs in assists (8) and steals (3). He blocked
three shots.
</P>
<P>
   Longley took six shots, made one and scored two points. The Suns
finally gave up on him in the fourth quarter when they went to a
smaller lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Sabonis is an interesting story. He was born Dec. 19-20-21, 1964
in Lithuania. The son of a tailor, Arvydas divided his time as a
youth learning five languages and growing. Some days he did both at
once.
</P>
<P>
   Sabonis became one of the biggest names in international
basketball. He was the best player in Europe in the mid-1980s. The
Trail Blazers drafted Sabonis in 1986 but it wasn't until four
years ago, when he was past his prime, that he joined the team as a
31-year-old NBA rookie.
</P>
<P>
   Blazer fans always will wonder what if. What if Sabonis had been
the center when Portland reached the NBA finals in 1990 and 1992.
The Blazers lost both series with center Kevin Duckworth, which
produced the philosophical question that sounds like a Groucho Marx
joke.
</P>
<P>
   What's a Duckworth? Answer: not much.
</P>
<P>
   Sabonis isn't comfortable in the limelight. He hid in the
training room after the game, leaving his teammates to put their
spin on a game the Suns had a chance to win even though they didn't
shoot well (Rex Chapman 3-for-12) and were playing in an arena
where the Blazers lost only three times this year.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns were right there. They led by one with 7{ minutes left.
Then Rider went to work, leading Portland on a 13-2 run. The
Blazers fed off the energy of their temperamental star. Unable to
answer, the Suns had to sense it was over when Sabonis put up a
hook shot. The ball rolled lazily off the rim, but Brian Grant's
tip-in increased the lead to 10.
</P>
<P>
   Portland presents a big problem. The Trail Blazers are young and
athletic and have what seems to be an inexhaustable supply of
players. If it's not Sabonis it's Rider. If not Rider it's Grant or
Rasheed Wallace or Walt Williams or Jim Jackson who scored a 12
points as a reserve, 10 in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Is there no end? Where do they keep coming from? The bench? The
stands?
</P>
<P>
   Before tipoff, Ainge looked around the arena. When his eyes fell
on a fellow sitting in a section behind the Suns bench, Danny
grinned.
</P>
<P>
   He was a Blazers fan, but he looked like a refugee from the Age
of Aquarius _ long beard, shoulder-length hair, headband, tie-dyed
T-shirt.
</P>
<P>
   Ainge didn't think the guy would get into the game but he looked
so familiar, so much like a former Blazer did years ago, he had to
ask.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is that Bill Walton?'' &QL;

CHINA PROBE FOCUSES ON CASH FOR VISAS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY KAMMER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Johnny Chung, the Chinese-American at the center of a Democratic
fund-raising scandal, has told congressional investigators that a
former U.S. Embassy official in Beijing received a bag of cash from
a Chinese beer company executive.
</P>
<P>
   Chung is expected to tell a House committee Tuesday that he saw
an executive of the Haomen Group Co. hand the money to Charles
Parish, who ran the embassy's visa section from 1994 to 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Chung's testimony before the House Committee on Government
Reform and Oversight is expected to center on Chinese attempts to
funnel money to the 1996 Clinton-Gore campaign.
</P>
<P>
   A source close to the investigation said that Chung's
information about Parish, as well as other revelations about Parish
in ``The Arizona Republic,'' have triggered a separate
investigation into the former State Department officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The State Department has received a subpoena for materials
relating to Mr. Parish,'' said the source, who spoke on condition
of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republic'' reported in March that Parish, who served at
the embassy from 1994 to 1996, repeatedly violated State Department
rules by accepting favors from the Chinese-government-owned
corporation that owns the COFCO Chinese Cultural Center in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Parish acknowledged that he accepted free lodging at corporate
apartments in Las Vegas and Norwalk, Calif., during the time he was
providing visa assistance to COFCO executive Elizabeth Mann.
</P>
<P>
   Mann, a Chinese-born American citizen, is the top executive in
Phoenix for COFCO, a corporate giant that is based in Beijing and
is directed by the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Trade.
</P>
<P>
   A 1997 ``Los Angeles Times'' story about Chung's emergence as
one of the biggest contributors to the Democratic Party quoted
Parish as saying he was ``a good friend of Johnny's.''
</P>
<P>
   Between 1994 and 1996, Chung visited the White House at least 49
times, often leading groups of Chinese businessmen. He also
contributed $366,000 to the Democratic National Committee, which
helped him arrange the visits.
</P>
<P>
   Now congressional investigators suspect that Parish accepted
cash in return for his influence in issuing visas to Chinese
businessmen allied to Chung.
</P>
<P>
   ``The committee views with great concern the ease with which
Johnny Chung was able to manipulate the system to obtain visas for
foreign nationals,'' the House Committee reported last year. The
report did not mention Parish.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1995 and 1996 Chung formed seven companies in Los Angeles
with seven Chinese nationals,'' the report says. ``All of them
attended DNC and Clinton/Gore fund-raisers with Chung at which the
president made appearances. Most of them sent Chung large sums of
money.''
</P>
<P>
   Chung has informed investigators that Parish attended a 1995
fund-raiser in California as Chung's guest.
</P>
<P>
   Parish's father, speaking Friday from his Las Vegas home, said
his son is traveling on the East Coast and could not be reached for
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Parish, 52, who attended Arizona State University from 1968 to
1974 and earned a degree from Chapman College in Orange, Calif.,
insisted in March that the favors he received from Mann did not
affect his visa decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did I ever abuse my position? No,'' said Parish, who retired
last year from the State Department. ``I'm very emphatic about
that. I'm very clear about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Chung has been cooperating with federal investigators under a
plea agreement. He has admitted making $30,000 in illegal
contributions to Democrats, including $20,000 to the Clinton-Gore
re-election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   He has also told federal investigators that he received $300,000
from China's chief military intelligence officer to give to the
Democratic Party for the Clinton re-election campaign. But Chung
said he gave only $35,000 of the money to the DNC and put the rest
into a bank account.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional and Justice Department investigators are trying to
determine whether the Chinese government secretly funneled campaign
contributions to the United States as part of an effort to gain
political influence.
</P>
<P>
   The House committee has reported that Chung escorted Haomen
executives Shi Zeng Chen and Yei Jun He to a 1994 White House
reception and that the executives had their photographs taken with
President Clinton and first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton. Haomen is
China's second-largest beer producer.
</P>
<P>
   According to the ``Washington Post,'' Chung has told Senate
investigators that one of the photos was used in an ad to sell
Haomen beer in China and that the publicity generated by that ad
gave Chung ``a formidable reputation in China as being
well-connected in U.S. political circles.''
</P>
<P>
   The Haomen Group wired $150,000 to Chung from a Bank of China
account in March 1995, three days before Chung wrote a $50,000
check to the DNC. Two days after that, he went to the White House
and presented the check to Hillary Clinton's chief of staff,
Margaret Williams. &QL;

YOSHII'S MOVE HAS METS BACK ON TRACK 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Seventeen inches may not sound like much. But it has
made all the difference in Masato Yoshii's season.
</P>
<P>
   Yoshii has been near perfect almost from the moment he moved
that far on the pitching rubber two starts ago, throwing 12 innings
without surrendering a run. But even though Yoshii tossed six
scoreless innings Saturday, the New York Mets still needed Armando
Benitez to relieve John Franco in the ninth inning before they
could close out a 4-2 victory over the Arizona Diamondbacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I was the manager, I would have brought him in today,
too,'' said Franco, who waited on the mound to literally _ and
perhaps symbolically _ hand the ball over to Benitez in what could
be a precursor to an eventual shift in roles.
</P>
<P>
   Benitez recorded the final two outs _ both on hard-hit fly balls
_ to strand the tying runs on first and second for his first save
with the Mets. And then Franco, who had allowed a two-run home run
to Jay Bell in the ninth in a nonsave situation, said that Benitez
told him, ``You pick me up, I pick you up.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the biggest pickup of the day, however, was provided by
Yoshii, considering that the Mets (18-12) had lost three straight
games, including a 14-7 setback here Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Under the retractable Bank One Ballpark dome, Yoshii (2-3)
extended his scoreless string to 12 innings _ all coinciding with
his move on the rubber _ while allowing only two singles Saturday
before he left the game with a cracked nail on his right middle
finger.
</P>
<P>
   Gone was the wildness that Yoshii had experienced before he
changed the starting position of his motion from the first-base
side of the rubber to the third-base side. Of his 77 pitches
Saturday, 53 went for strikes. And Yoshii left in style, retiring
the last 12 batters he faced, quashing _ for now _ talk of his
being replaced in the rotation any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   In his last two starts, Yoshii has lowered his earned run
average from 7.52 to 4.73. He said he could not explain the rapid
turnaround. Catcher Mike Piazza said that Yoshii was just being
more aggressive.
</P>
<P>
   But ever since Yoshii shifted on the rubber, he has become a
different pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it makes a big difference in the angle of his
pitches,'' said Manager Bobby Valentine, who had asked Yoshii to
move to the first-base side in spring training.

   Valentine noticed that Yoshii's position on the rubber might
have been causing his shuto _ the Japanese word for a shooting
fastball _ to sail out of the strike zone, and asked him to move
back to the third-base side 10 days ago. Since then, the
34-year-old Japanese right-hander has been almost unhittable.
</P>
<P>
   In Yoshii's previous outing _ with his spot in the rotation in
jeopardy _ he allowed three hits and two walks in six scoreless
innings. Saturday Yoshii was even more precise. The only walk he
allowed was to Bell in the first inning.
</P>
<P>
   The only runner to advance past first against Yoshii was Damian
Miller, who was sacrificed to second by pitcher Andy Benes after he
singled to lead off the third.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for Yoshii, Roger Cedeno was in right field
Saturday, not the limping Bobby Bonilla, because Miller was held at
second thanks to a tremendous diving, tumbling catch by Cedeno in
short right-center field on a ball hit by Tony Womack.
</P>
<P>
   The catch preserved the 1-0 lead that John Olerud had given
Yoshii in the first with his sixth homer of the season. The Mets
added an unearned run in the fifth, and Matt Franco drilled his
first homer of the year in the sixth to give Yoshii a 3-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he was pitching at home with the guillotines sharpened,
Masato came up big,'' Valentine said, referring to Yoshii's last
start. ``And today we had lost three in a row and were going up
against a team that had banged out a thousand hits the night
before, and he gave up two hits. He's a pretty good pitcher. And,
yes, I think the move has made a big difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if it could be measured with a ruler.

FRIEND HELPS FLOWERS BLOOM
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Time reveals everything, making it our greatest
friend and worst enemy. Given enough time, heroes can become
villains while the scorned come to be admired.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of John Flowers and Joshua Hay, two unlikely friends
introduced by tragedy and linked together by courage and love, time
has indeed been a true friend.
</P>
<P>
   Flowers, a former Cal State Northridge basketball recruit who
lost his legs in a car accident in 1992 before ever playing a game
for the Matadors, receives the Camp Chesed Humanitarian award
tonight at 7 p.m. at the Warner Center Marriott in Woodland Hills.
Flowers also is doing something he hasn't been able to do since the
accident _ he will walk on stage to accept the award.
</P>
<P>
   Walking alongside Flowers, as he has been in one sense for the
last seven years, will be Hay, whose perseverance helped raise the
money for the artificial legs Flowers uses today.
</P>
<P>
   The two first met when Northridge held a fund-raiser on Flower's
behalf not long after his accident. Hay, an 11-year-old ballboy for
the Matadors at the time, was stunned and saddened when the event
reaped a meager $400. He promised Flowers that night he would find
a way to raise the money to purchase the artificial legs Flowers
needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just remember feeling so bad that they had flown John out
here and all they were able to raise was $400,'' said Hay, now an
18-year-old college freshman. ``I told my dad that there must be
something we could do.''
</P>
<P>
   There certainly was. Hay enlisted the help of his father
Jacques, who had been active in fund-raising events dating back to
his college days at the University of Maryland. First they put
together a small-scale celebrity free-throw shooting contest at
halftime of a Northridge game. Channel 2 sportscaster Jim Hill and
former Laker Tony Smith participated, and more than $10,000 was
raised. Later that year, Hay and his father organized another
fund-raiser at a Clippers game. In all, Hay's efforts produced more
than $25,000.
</P>
<P>
   A startled and appreciative Flowers still can't find words to
adequately express his gratitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was almost like Joshua was born just for me,'' Flowers
said. ``I can't even begin to show my appreciation for what he's
done for me. It would be impossible. All I know is that he is like
my little brother now. I love him to death for the things he has
done.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitting bottom
</P>
<P>
   Six years ago, Flowers was the first out-of-state recruit in Cal
State Northridge basketball history, a 6-foot-4 guard from Arizona
whose dream it was to prove he could play on the Division I level.
</P>
<P>
   Tragically, that dream ended in Kansas City on Aug. 10, 1992,
when the sedan driven by Flowers' brother, Tony, collided with a
van and ended up wrapped around a concrete power pole.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Flowers and his girlfriend, seated in the front passenger
seat, were killed. John, seated in the back seat, had his legs
crushed.
</P>
<P>
   It was a nightmare of deplorable proportions. In a matter of
seconds, Flowers lost his brother and his life's passion.
</P>
<P>
   The news got worse before it got better. Most of Flowers' right
foot was gone, and his right leg had to be cut just above the knee.
In addition, his left leg did not respond to treatment and had to
be cut above the knee as well. Flowers spent 38 days in the
hospital, grieving alternately about the loss of his brother, the
end of his basketball dreams and the uncertain future he faced.
</P>
<P>
   Looking back, Flowers wonders if he even fully grasped the
magnitude of the horrible event.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never had time to dwell on the death of my brother and his
girlfriend because of what I was going through,'' Flowers said.
``It's only been within the last three years or so that I've been
able to think about him and get over that initial shock.''
</P>
<P>
   Flowers channeled his pain into rehabilitation. Any anger he
felt, any despair, became the fuel he would need to make the most
of his new life.
</P>
<P>
   The money that Hay helped raise purchased artificial legs four
years ago. It's been a long, frustrating process, but Flowers is
now able to walk with them relatively pain free.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's getting better and better every day,'' said Flowers, who
lives in Arizona and works for a company that builds Web pages.
``At first, I thought about everything that happened to me, and I
basically just took a long look at myself and asked what I wanted
to do with my life. Did I want to sit at home and cry about things,
or did I want to work hard and make the most of the situation? That
was an easy decision for me, because I still wanted to live.''
</P>
<P>
   Hay believed
</P>
<P>
   Joshua Hay never got a chance to see John Flowers play
basketball, but Hay is certain Flowers would have gone far if he
hadn't been involved in the accident.
</P>
<P>
   The assumption has nothing to do with talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's such a great example for anyone because he kept going, he
never gave in,'' Hay said. ``Unfortunately he never got to take it
to the next level like he always wanted, but he would have
succeeded.''
</P>
<P>
   Hay graduated last year from Valley Torah High School and is a
freshman at Shaarei Jerusalem University in Israel. He is neither
boastful about what he's done for Flowers nor particularly
surprised.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just sort of happened,'' Hay said. ``I really felt bad for
John and his situation and I realized this was a good cause,
something to be involved in. The least I could do was help.''
</P>
<P>
   Fitting the pieces
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the saddest part of John Flower's tragedy is that he
didn't have basketball to help get him through the worst times.
Growing up, the sport was his passion, his friend and his tonic.
</P>
<P>
   He wonders now what would have happened, how far he would have
gone, if an accident hadn't robbed him of his legs.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's all I wanted to do. That's all I wanted to be,''
Flowers said. ``I'd see guys I played with on TV and think that
could be me out there, and there probably isn't a day that goes by
that I don't think about `What if?'''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Flowers does play basketball. Over the last year, he's
been involved in wheelchair basketball. He was skeptical at first,
but in time he's grown to appreciate the talent and precision.
Earlier this year, he played on a team that reached the Sweet 16 of
a national tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's become a really big part of my life and I am starting to
excel at it now,'' Flowers said.
</P>
<P>
   He thinks a lot about Hay, his guardian angel who has gone from
an 11-year-old boy to a young man. Because of their hectic
schedules and where they live, the two friends don't spend as much
time together as they'd like. But they both know the other is just
a phone call away. It's a relationship both say will last forever.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember the first time I met him he was this little kid who
told me he was going to help me,'' Flowers said. ``I knew that he
was just a kid being a kid. But he meant what he said, even though
I never knew he'd be able to do all of the things he has done. And
I tell him that all the time.'' &QL;

ANGRY PROTESTS IN SEVERAL CHINESE CITIES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to update; 3rd graf is new.) (lh) 
 By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Large, angry protests erupted around U.S. government
offices in several cities on Saturday as Chinese learned that NATO
bombs had hit their embassy in Belgrade, killing at least three
people sleeping inside.
</P>
<P>
   In Beijing, thousands of well-organized university students,
cheered on by other Beijing residents, held tense noisy protests on
the streets surrounding the U.S. Embassy, as police looked on. But
the initially peaceful march quickly turned violent, as small
groups of students and residents threw rocks through embassy
windows, pummeled cars belonging to embassy employees and burned
American flags.
</P>
<P>
   By dawn Sunday, the streets, guarded by thousands of police
officers, were quiet. But by 9 a.m., students by the tens of
thousands were streaming toward the U.S. Embassy, by bus, by subway
and on foot, to resume their impassioned march.
</P>
<P>
   It was the by far the largest anti-American demonstration in
China since well before President Nixon's historic visit to China
in 1972 and the largest political protest since the student rallies
in Tiananmen Square 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we hate America,'' said Ma Zhang Lu, a 20-year-old male
student with shoulder-length dyed hair, who had just hurled a rock
at the embassy. ``China has been especially friendly to the
American people. But we have been rebuffed, and now the Americans
have broken international law.''
</P>
<P>
   The protests marked an extraordinary moment in a controlled
country where such outbursts are normally forbidden and almost
never occur, though Saturday's demonstrations clearly had some
measure of government approval.
</P>
<P>
   The protests also comes just two weeks after Buddhist Law, a
spiritual group seeking official recognition, held another huge
rally in the city center.
</P>
<P>
   In Shanghai, a large, chanting crowd threw rocks and bottles at
the U.S. Consulate. Similar demonstrations were reported in
Guangzhou. And in the southern city of Chengdu, protesters set a
fire at the U.S. consulate early Sunday, but it was put out. A
Chinese guard was reported hurt.
</P>
<P>
   In Beijing after nightfall on Saturday, large unruly throngs
roamed the embassy district, defying police requests to go home.
Several times crowds pushed against lines of police officers,
linked arm in arm, who held them away from the U.S. and British
embassies.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, a group of 50 demonstrators burst through police
lines, only to be stopped by a row of police five deep about 50
yards from the U.S. Embassy compound. The police, who did not carry
weapons, made no arrests.
</P>
<P>
   Late on Saturday afternoon, the U.S. Embassy ``strongly
protested'' inadequate police protection, after students were
allowed to press up against the embassy's street-side gates and
throw rocks through windows of an office building still holding 15
to 20 embassy staff members, including James Sasser, the U.S.
ambassador.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually all protesters said they thought the bombing was
intentional.
</P>
<P>
   The protests began early Saturday afternoon when angry people
started gathering on the tree-lined streets in front of the embassy
in Beijing. Around 4 p.m., they were joined by thousands of angry,
chanting students, not die hard Communist Party cadres but
thoroughly Westernized youths, wearing baseball caps and Nike sweat
pants.
</P>
<P>
   The Beijing students marched in groups of several hundred behind
their university banners carrying hand-painted signs, some in
English, like ``USA Nazi Killers'' and chanting slogans like ``The
blood of Chinese must be repaid.''
</P>
<P>
   Each group paused in front of the iron gate at the embassy, just
15 feet from its front door, to chant, sing patriotic songs and
deliver a variety of petitions.
</P>
<P>
   At first, an officer from the embassy's political section came
out solemnly to accept the papers. But the protests quickly turned
violent, as students from several universities pelted the embassy
with rocks and water bottles. Each broken light and window was
greeted with thunderous cheers.
</P>
<P>
   Although most students returned to their campuses around
nightfall, many remained in the embassy district, and by 9 p.m.
raucous students and other demonstrators had regrouped near the
embassy, smashing cars with U.S. Embassy plates, identifiable by
the red character for embassy, followed by the number 224. An
American flag was burned outside Sasser's residence.
</P>

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Although police presence was heavy, the officers, generally
equipped at most with cell phones, at first did little to stop the
rock throwing. The Embassy warned Americans living in Beijing to
increase personal security and to avoid any protests.
</P>
<P>
   As the fever pitch increased, reinforcements were brought in and
made some serious efforts, though often with little effect. Police
stood by as hundreds of protesters burned an American flag.
</P>
<P>
   The well-planned afternoon march was clearly condoned by the
government. Official student organizations arranged for buses, and
students said that the Beijing Municipal government had approved
the protest.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign reporters, who are generally shooed away by public
security officers from even minor car accidents, were given freedom
to interview and photograph protesters on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   But the anger was deep and genuine both from the students and
the thousands of Beijing residents who apparently gathered
spontaneously, many with children, after they had found out about
the protest from friends or on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a young Chinese I've always felt a very friendly attitude
toward the U.S. and its people,'' said Wang Bin, an interpreter,
who decided early Saturday afternoon to stand peacefully outside
the embassy in protest. ``But now I feel a deep internal disgust
and anger.''
</P>
<P>
   Chinese public opinion has been violently opposed to the NATO
war over Kosovo since the start of the bombing, in some part
because the government-controlled press did not report on the
Serbian purge of Kosovo Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   But most also agree with their government that Kovoso's internal
ethnic conflicts should not be solved by ``a foreign bully''
wielding bombs. Thanks to the bombing, they now regard President
Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia as a hero for standing up to NATO
and the Serbs as an oppressed people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd always thought that Kosovo should be considered an
internal affair and that NATO shouldn't be there,'' said Guo
Qionghu, a student at the National Minorities University. ``But
today this issue has fallen directly on the heads of the Chinese
people, and that's why our emotions are so aroused.''
</P>
<P>
   The evening television news carried China's official
condemnations of the attack as ``barbarian'' and a ``gross
violation of China's sovereignty'' and featured the students'
demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   The three known Chinese killed in the Belgrade attack were
identified as Shao Yunhuan, a 40-year-old woman who was a reporter
for the New China News Agency; Xu Xinghu, the resident
correspondent in Belgrade for the newspaper Guangming Daily, and
Xu's wife, Zhu Yin, an employee in the advertising section of the
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   In a bitter interview on national television, the chief of the
New China News Agency praised Ms. Shao as a ``good comrade and
outstanding reporter.'' The editor of the Guangming Daily said the
dead couple had only been married a year and that Xu's final report
had appeared in Saturday's newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Before being trapped in the embassy compound, Sasser had been
called in to the Chinese Foreign Ministry to receive its strong
protest.
</P>
<P>
   In a country where there is often a huge divide between official
pronouncements and public opinion, China now appeared to react as
one.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did it on purpose,'' said Yu He, a bank employee in
Shanghai, adding. ``Of course I'm angry now they're attacking us
too.''
</P>
<P>
   Even before the protests, a Chinese Internet chat room about
Kosovo that has been popular in recent weeks was deluged with
vituperative messages, including ``Tonight, let's lay siege to the
U.S. Embassy.''
</P>
<P>
   Liberal Chinese who have supported engagement with the United
States called reporters with a deep sense of disbelief and
betrayal, looking for explanations. Students at the Beijing
demonstration, some of whom had welcomed President Clinton to China
a year ago, said they also felt betrayed.
</P>
<P>
   Kicking off the protest, student delegations from China's most
prominent universities _ Beijing University, Qinghua University and
People's University _ marched in lines, waving red flags and
banners, chanting slogans like ``Down with Imperialism'' and
singing patriotic songs.
</P>
<P>
   Some students carried hand-painted signs condemning NATO or the
United States and wore targets like those worn in protest by
civilians in Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd turned violent when the group of 200 students from
Beijing Polytechnic turned onto the road that bisects the two
grassy office compounds of the U.S. Embassy. Piles of rocks and
cement squares lined the sidewalks, which are being re-laid as part
of the campaign to dress up Beijing for the 50th anniversary this
fall.
</P>
<P>
   The building material along the narrow street provided ample
weaponry for the students in the dense crowd, who hurled the rocks
through the windows of the U.S. Embassy's visa office and an
administrative building just behind the fence.
</P>
<P>
   The embassy is a hodgepodge of older buildings in three
different sites, all within 15 to 20 feet of the road. The street
that divides the two main office sites, home to the day's protests,
has been closed to nonembassy automotive traffic since the bombings
in Africa last summer.
</P>
<P>
   Police had clearly been girding since early in the day, when
they closed a nearby popular outdoor market, Silk Alley, where
tourists flock to buy Beanie Babies, Chinese qipao dresses and fake
Prada bags.
</P>
<P>
   But they were certainly unprepared for the outpouring of anger
that gathered throughout the day and into the late evening, when
thousands of angry protesters moved from the U.S. Embassy to the
nearby British Embassy and on to the U.S. Ambassador's house.

RANGERS' RELIEVER ZIMMERMAN STIFLES TORONTO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ Toronto's Jim Fregosi did not attempt to feign
disinterest when the discussion shifted to Rangers right-hander
Jeff Zimmerman.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the Blue Jays manager fulfilled his obligation to
the Canadian media and their local-boy-makes-good slant after he
was informed that Zimmerman hails from Kelowna, British Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, and he plays hockey? Well, the way he pitched today,''
Fregosi said, ``I wished the hell he'd go play hockey.''
</P>
<P>
   Zimmerman, the Canadian-turned-Rangers' savior, once again stood
on his head, to use hockey vernacular, in a 4-3 victory yesterday
at SkyDome.
</P>
<P>
   He protected the Rangers' one-run lead _ built on Rafael
Palmeiro's seventh-inning, run-scoring double _ with two scoreless
innings before manager Johnny Oates summoned closer John Wetteland
to record his 10th save.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Ziminator,'' as Rangers right-hander Tim Crabtree refers
to the former TCU pitcher, greeted the media afterward with an 0.84
earned-run average.
</P>
<P>
   ``There can't be anyone in baseball pitching more quality
innings in crunch time than he has this year,'' said Oates, who
appears willing to stitch the letter ``S'' on Zimmerman's chest and
hang a blue cape from the reliever's shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   Why not?
</P>
<P>
   American League batters are hitting .114 (8-for-70) with 16
strikeouts through 21 1/3 innings against Zimmerman.
</P>
<P>
   Oates demonstrated his faith by letting Zimmerman pitch to three
left-handed hitters _ Shawn Green, Carlos Delgado and Willie Greene
_ in the eighth inning, while left-hander Mike Munoz continued to
warm in the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ain't taking any chances,'' Oates said. ``He hasn't done
anything to deserve to be taken out of that game. I don't know how
any manager could have any more confidence in anyone right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Zimmerman induced an infield popup from Green before issuing a
two-out walk to Delgado on a 3-2 pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's poise,'' Crabtree said of the walk. ``He knew he didn't
want to let Delgado beat him there. That's my protege. He's
everything I wanted to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Delgado advanced 90 feet and moved into scoring position when
Mark Dalesandro's weak ground ball rolled into right field for a
seeing-eye single, but Zimmerman retired Greene on strikes to
``Ziminate'' the threat.
</P>
<P>
   Eight Canadian media reporters waited almost an hour after the
contest to speak with Zimmerman, who went for his postgame workout
almost immediately after the final pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I appreciate you guys waiting around for me,'' Zimmerman said.
``I'm sorry I kept you waiting.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Zimmerman's first response's revealed his level-headed
approach to his early success.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day I pinch myself and thank the Lord for giving me this
opportunity,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Zimmerman, too, wondered whether Oates would let him face the
Blue Jays' left-handed hitters in the crucial eighth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was definitely on my mind, but I wanted to stay in there,''
Zimmerman admitted. ``I knew I could get them out.''
</P>
<P>
   Zimmerman's performance overshadowed right-hander Mike Morgan's
six-inning start, the defensive play of reserve Jon Shave at
shortstop and the three runs batted in by left fielder Rusty Greer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there are enough adequate words,'' Oates said,
``to describe what Jeff has done for our club this year.''

Tuinei remembered for big heart, smile (For use by NYTimes News
Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
ADDISON, Texas _ According to his closest friends, former Cowboys
offensive tackle Mark Tuinei lived a life full of smiles and
laughter.
<TEXT>
<P>
   And that's how he was remembered at a 11/2-hour private memorial
service yesterday at Trinity Christian Academy attended by about
450 former teammates, coaches, friends and family members.
</P>
<P>
   Tuinei, 39, was found dead early Thursday in his car outside his
Plano home. The cause of death is unknown.
</P>
<P>
   His life was celebrated by four former teammates: Cowboys
quarterback Jason Garrett, Cowboys fullback Daryl Johnston, Cowboys
deep snapper Dale Hellestrae and Dolphins guard Kevin Gogan.
Cowboys team chaplain John Webber gave the eulogy.
</P>
<P>
   Interspersed by tears, the players shared jokes and stories
about Tuinei, at times filling the auditorium with laughter. The
unifying theme was that the heart of the 6-foot-5, 320-pound Tuinei
was as big as his body.
</P>

   ``You couldn't have found a better friend,'' Johnston said. ``He
was always there for you. You think of the big man, the big heart,
the big head, the big smile and the big laugh. This is a void that
is not going to be filled. He is irreplaceable. But we got our
memories.''
</P>
<P>
   Garrett said Tuinei, known as the team's chief practical
jokester, was special because he related to all teammates.
Free-agent rookies, all-pro players, blacks, whites, coaches,
trainers and equipment managers were touched by Tuinei's friendship
and pranks, Garrett said.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one crammed more life than Tuinei in 39 years,'' Garrett
said. ``Thank God for letting me cross paths with the guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Gogan, who played alongside Tuinei from 1987 through 1993, said:
``It's not how Tuinei died but how he lived. I'm privileged that my
children knew him. But I feel cheated that they didn't know him
longer.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the Cowboys players at the service were Troy Aikman,
Emmitt Smith, Kevin Smith, Eric Bjornson and Leon Lett, as well as
owner Jerry Jones. Among the former Cowboys attending were Everson
Walls, Drew Pearson, John Dutton, Tom Rafferty, Nate Newton and
Tony Tolbert, and former coach Barry Switzer.
</P>
<P>
   Pictures of Tuinei with a variety of friends and former
teammates were displayed in the foyer. Four framed items surrounded
the casket inside the auditorium, including one of his Cowboys
jerseys.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Pulemau Tuinei was born March 31, 1960, in Oceanside,
Calif., to Ane and Tumuauatasi Tuinei Sr. Mark Tuinei grew up in
Hawaii on Oahu, where he starred in football, basketball and track
at Punahou High School. He was selected Hawaii prep lineman of the
year and was the state's shot put champion as a senior.
</P>
<P>
   Tuinei played his first two college seasons at UCLA before
transferring to the University of Hawaii. He married Ponolani
Pavich on Feb. 19, 1984. They did not have children.
</P>
<P>
   Tuinei joined the Cowboys in 1983 as a rookie free agent. After
playing various positions on offense and defense for much of his
first four seasons, Tuinei settled at left tackle midway through
the 1986 season. He was a mainstay at left tackle for 11 seasons,
which included Super Bowl titles in 1992, 1993 and 1995.
</P>
<P>
   His career came to an end after the 1997 season as a result of
chronic knee problems. He was released by the Cowboys in April
1998.
</P>
<P>
   Tuinei, however, was a frequent visitor to Valley Ranch and
remained friends with several players.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife; his mother and father; four sisters,
Louise, Frances, Katherine and Julia; one brother, Tom; and 26
nieces and nephews.
</P>
<P>
   Collin County medical examiner William Rohr is awaiting results
of toxicology tests, which could be done by tomorrow, on the cause
of death.

   The family plans to take Tuinei's body to Hawaii for burial next

FORMER COWBOYS COACH LANDRY HOSPITALIZED WITH LEUKEMIA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL WEISSENSTEIN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Legendary Cowboys coach Tom Landry has been hospitalized and is
undergoing chemotherapy after he was found to have leukemia,
friends said yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Landry, 74, who led the team to a record 20 consecutive winning
seasons in his 29 years as head coach, recently had suffered from
fatigue and a bout with pneumonia, former Cowboys players and staff
said.
</P>
<P>
   Blood tests revealed leukemia, a cancer that affects blood and
bone-marrow cells, and Landry was admitted to a Dallas-area
hospital on Tuesday, friends said.
</P>
<P>
   Former Cowboys quarterback Roger Staubach said he learned Monday
night from Landry's wife, Alicia, that his former coach had been
found to have the disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had been feeling tired lately. Now they have it diagnosed
early, and they're real positive about it,'' Staubach said
yesterday. ``He's getting treatment right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Cowboys president and general manager Tex Schramm learned
of Landry's illness yesterday at his home in Key West, Fla., he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a terrible thing, but he's a tough guy, he'll fight it
out,'' Schramm said.
</P>
<P>
   Leukemia strikes about 29,000 people each year. The cancer
causes blood cells to reproduce uncontrollably and accumulate in
the bone marrow, preventing a sufficient number of normal blood
cells from being produced.
</P>
<P>
   Leukemia is typically treated with chemotherapy, and 47 percent
of patients survive five years after a diagnosis.
</P>
<P>
   The prognosis for Landry is good, Staubach said. He said the
former coach is expected to leave the hospital ``soon,'' but
declined to specify when Landry might be released.
</P>
<P>
   There are four major types of leukemia, but friends did not say
which type was affecting Landry. Older adults make up the highest
proportion of leukemia patients, with more than half of all cases
occurring in people over 60.
</P>
<P>
   Symptoms include fatigue, frequent infections, weakness and
shortness of breath resulting from anemia.
</P>
<P>
   Landry, third all-time in NFL victories, began as the Cowboys
head coach with the franchise's initial season in 1960 and
continued through 1988. He ended his career with a 270-178-6
record, including playoffs, and led his team to a record 20
consecutive winning seasons from 1966 through 1985. Under Landry,
the Cowboys went to the Super Bowl five times, winning Super Bowl
VI and XII.
</P>
<P>
   Landry was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1990
and was included in the Cowboys' Ring of Honor in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Since being fired by Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, Landry has
devoted his time to speaking engagements, appearances on behalf of
the Fellowship of Christian Athletes and evangelist Billy Graham,
and business interests with his son.
</P>
<P>
   Schramm, who hired Landry as coach, called the news shocking.
</P>
<P>
   ``But in a way, I knew that something was wrong,'' he said. ``I
saw Tom two weeks ago at his golf tournament and, in fact, I
introduced him at a dinner, and he didn't look good.''
</P>
<P>
   Landry played college football at the University of Texas, where
he met his wife. They had three children, Tom Jr., Kitty Landry
Phillips and the late Lisa Landry Childress. \Ntagtop:Michael

   LEUKEMIA Leukemia, a cancer that affects the bone marrow and
blood cells, strikes approximately 29,000 people in the United
States each year. The malignant disease causes a patient's blood
cells to reproduce uncontrollably. Immature, useless cells
accumulate in the marrow, which cannot produce a sufficient number
of normal red and white blood cells and platelets.
</P>
<P>
   The cancerous cells can also invade the liver, spleen, lymph
nodes, kidneys and brain.
</P>
<P>
   The disease affects men, women and children of all ages. But
older adults make up the highest proportion of leukemia patients,
with more than half of all cases occurring in people over 60.
</P>
<P>
   It is typically treated with chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   There are about 140,000 leukemia patients in the United States.
Approximately 21,600 Americans die from the disease each year.
</P>
<P>
   Signs and symptoms include easy bleeding or bruising, paleness,
fatigue, frequent minor infections and poor healing of minor
scrapes and cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone displaying these symptoms warrant medical examination,
including blood tests to diagnose leukemia.
</P>
<P>
   The causes of the disease are unknown.

IN NEW ORLEANS, DEVELOPERS RUSH TO ADD HOTELS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By SHAWN G. KENNEDY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ The enduring allure of the French Quarter coupled
with the city's role as host to such spirited street parties as
Mardi Gras and the annual New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival
have secured its place as a top vacation spot. But increasingly
travelers are in town on business _ at least for part of their
stay.
</P>
<P>
   The result has been a strong demand for hotel rooms by travelers
to conventions and trade shows. To meet that demand, 13 hotel
projects are in various stages of construction, 10 of them new
hotels and the rest expansions of existing hotels. Half a dozen
additional projects are in the preconstruction development phase.
All this activity follows the opening of a dozen new hotels over
the last three years.
</P>
<P>
   The New Orleans Metropolitan Convention and Visitors Bureau puts
the annual average occupancy rate at 75 percent, compared with 73
percent five years ago. In that time, 7,000 hotel rooms have been
added for a total of 28,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``People think of New Orleans as a tourist town,'' said John
Keeling, a hotel specialist in the Houston office of PKF
Consulting, a real estate consulting company. ``But now, first and
foremost, it is a convention town.''
</P>
<P>
   The new hotels include the independently owned and operated
International House and the St. James Hotel and franchise
operations _ Holiday Inn, Sheraton, Marriott, and Promus Hotel
Corp., whose brands in New Orleans are Hampton Inn and Embassy
Suites.
</P>
<P>
   A major catalyst for the sustained growth, hotel operators and
developers say, has been the 360,000-square-foot expansion of the
city's riverfront convention center. The third phase of the Ernest
N. Morial Convention Center, completed earlier this year, brought
its space to 1.1 million square feet. Built on the riverfront more
than 15 years ago as the Lousiana State Pavilion for the 1984
World's Fair, which rose in what is now the Warehouse District, the
center has been host to more than one million out-of-town people
each year.
</P>
<P>
   As an event the World's Fair did not draw as many visitors as
the city had hoped, said William Langkopp, executive vice president
of the Louisiana Hotel and Motel Association. But it did open up
the riverfront and drew people into the warehouse area, which had
never been considered for hotels, restaurants and shops.
</P>
<P>
   The recent hotel development trend here has been different from
development in other prominent convention destinations, such as Las
Vegas or Orlando, Fla. With few exceptions, the new hotels are
opening in the central business district or in the warehouse area.
Both neighborhoods are within walking distance of the French
Quarter and the riverfront.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, a majority of the new hotels are small to mid-sized
projects _ 150 to 350 rooms. Statistics gathered by the New Orleans
Metropolitan Visitors and Convention Bureau show that over the next
two years about 2,350 rooms will be added to the present inventory.
</P>
<P>
   The lodgings are usually five to 15 stories high, a modest scale
dictated almost entirely by city policies that have simultaneously
limited the number of available sites for new construction and
spurred the redevelopment of underutilized properties that the city
has deemed worth saving.
</P>
<P>
   ``The city realized that there were many neighborhoods and
buildings worth preserving beyond those in our traditional historic
areas like the French Quarter and the Garden District,'' said John
Williams, an architect who has been involved in the designs of
several gut-renovation projects, including the Ritz-Carlton Hotel.
``So you have projects like the Queen &AMP; Crescent hotel, which
preserves the city's first high rise and gives the business
district a new hotel.''
</P>
<P>
   The City Council reviews every demolition petition in historic
districts, which now include most of the warehouse and central
business districts. Most buildings 50 years or older qualify for
protection. But to encourage development in these areas, the city
provides a restoration tax abatement that freezes the assessment to
the predevelopment level for at least five years.
</P>
<P>
   Potentially of even more value to developers taking on gut
renovations of these properties is the federal historic
rehabilitation tax credit, which allows developers of qualified
properties to recover up to 20 percent of the redevelopment costs.

</P>
<P>
   Marriott International's recent expansion in New Orleans
illustrates some aspects of the current hotel development trend.
Until 1997 the only hotel in the central part of the city operated
by Marriott was the 54-story, 1,290-room Marriott New Orleans, a
convention hotel on Canal Street. But changes in the city's guest
profile encouraged Marriott to expand its presence here.
</P>
<P>
   With New Orleans-based TVG Group, whose partners are Steve
Manshel and Henry O'Connor, serving as the builder and owner,
Marriott has opened two Courtyards in the last two years. A
Residence Inn by Marriott, an extended-stay hotel, opened in 1997
and a Marriott Renaissance, a moderate-rate hotel, is scheduled to
open in the middle of 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our Courtyard product has been a successful suburban hotel
concept,'' said Craig E. Lambert, senior vice president for
moderate and economy brands for Marriott Corp., based in Bethesda,
Md. ``But we discovered that in New Orleans people wanted the
Courtyard brand in the urban area where there are exciting and fun
things going on.''
</P>
<P>
   The Marriott Courtyard that opened last December went into a
building that included the gut renovation of a molasses factory and
a newly built section. The new 202-room Courtyard is on Julia
Street in the heart of the Warehouse District.
</P>
<P>
   Lambert said that it was usually difficult to justify the cost
of a newly built Courtyard in urban areas. The tax incentives offer
a way of doing it in New Orleans at the price point people will
pay, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In New Orleans Marriott Courtyard nightly room rates range from
$100 to $150 depending on the season, which is well below the rate
range for the company's full-service hotel on Canal Street where
rooms range between $180 and $225.
</P>
<P>
   By far the largest and most ambitious of the gut-renovation
projects is on Canal Street, where the landmarked Maison Blanche
department store is being transformed into a Ritz-Carlton hotel.
The $200-million project, which will include the renovation of the
adjacent Kress building and Maison Blanche annex, is being
developed by White House LLC, based in Baton Rouge, which owns the
buildings. The development partnership includes Bernard Mason,
William Hindman and Stewart Juneau, who is the managing partner.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years the 530,000-square-foot building has been less
and less profitable as a department store. But Juneau was convinced
of its potential as a luxury hotel because of its location on the
western boundary of the French Quarter and because of the city's
strong hotel market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Occupancy is improving, and room rates are rising,'' said
Juneau. But historic rehabilitation tax credits were an essential
component of this project.
</P>
<P>
   The hotel, scheduled to open next fall, will have 452 rooms,
25,000 square feet of meeting space, including a 10,000-square-foot
column free ballroom; a mezzanine level spa and street level
shopping arcade. Room rates will range from $305 to $335, said
Mason, one of the developers.
</P>
<P>
   The project will also include an all-suite hotel, to be known as
the Quarter Suites, also managed by the Ritz-Carlton. Room rates
have yet to be set.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the pace of hotel development, industry analysts do not
see a potential glut of rooms in the foreseeable future. The main
reason is a shortage of available sites or redevelopable buildings
in the areas where hotel operators need to be.
</P>
<P>
   While the national chains have entered the New Orleans market,
there are limits, Keeling believes, to their willingness to expand.
``This will help bring about an equilibrium,'' he said. ``And the
shortage of rooms may continue for an extended period.''

UNDERACHIEVERS MEET IN THE WEST 
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News

<P>
   INGLEWOOD _ If the NBA needed, for posterity, a snapshot of what
a thrown-together, raggedy-edged, lockout-shortened season looks
like, the commissioner might want a group portrait of today's
playoff opponents at the Forum.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers and Houston Rockets are the perfect poster children
for a season gone horribly wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Remember when the Lakers were the darlings of the Western
Conference? Remember when the Rockets put together a
Hall-of-Fame-credentialed trio and inspired championship dreams in
Houston?
</P>
<P>
   That was 50 games ago. A really quick 50 games. And neither the
Lakers nor the Rockets, who begin their first-round playoff series
this afternoon, held up under the frenetic pace.
</P>
<P>
   It took time for Scottie Pippen to find his way in the Rockets
offense. It took time for Houston's rookie guards, Cuttino Mobley
and Michael Dickerson, to adjust to the NBA and to their legendary
frontcourt mates.
</P>
<P>
   It took time for the Lakers to adjust to a coaching change, to
the addition of Dennis Rodman, to life with Rodman, and then to
life without Rodman. Not to mention a blockbuster trade that
removed two key pieces (Eddie Jones and Elden Campbell) and added
two new faces in Glen Rice and J.R. Reid.
</P>
<P>
   Time? Who had time? Not in a 90-day season short on practices
and off-days. So two teams labeled ``underachievers'' and seeded in
the middle of the pack with 31-19 records meet to see which is
closer to forging a cohesive unit out of this mess.
</P>
<P>
   If the playoffs are the ``second season,'' brimming with new
opportunities, these are two teams eager to start over.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now,'' Houston coach Rudy Tomjanovich said, ``we're wiping the
slate clean.''
</P>
<P>
   And making no excuses for how they got here.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we could have started two rookies and made a trade for
another guy who played a different style of basketball and just ran
through the league and wound up kicking everybody's butt, I
wouldn't have a lot of respect for the league,'' Tomjanovich said.
``The league has established teams. We've had our moments, but it's
not realistic to say you're gonna put seven (new) guys on this team
and two of the rookies are gonna start and just kick everybody's
butts. I like this team, but something like that is just
unrealistic.''
</P>
<P>
   The same, of course, could be said for the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``In that respect, we're similar,'' coach Kurt Rambis said.
``They've had lineup changes like us, they've added a bunch of new
ballplayers like us.... Anytime you make changes with a ballclub,
the teams have to be allowed time to grow and develop together.
When you make a lot of changes, especially in the season we just
had, it wasn't conducive to making changes.''
</P>
<P>
   So you have the Rockets losing twice to the lowly Mavericks and
once to the Clippers in the final weeks of the season. And you have
the Lakers getting routed by 20-plus in San Antonio, Portland and
Houston in April.
</P>
<P>
   But both teams have also shown signs of righting themselves. The
Lakers won their last four games of the season in impressive
fashion, routing Portland twice. The Rockets, 22-point winners over
the Lakers on April 26, closed out with victories over the
Clippers, Minnesota and Denver.
</P>
<P>
   Rice found his way in the Lakers offense, scoring 62 points over
the last two games, and the Lakers, who used 13 starting lineups,
managed to stick with one for the final 10 games. Pippen got more
comfortable in the Rockets' sets, and rookies Mobley (37 starts)
and Dickerson (50 starts) have come on strong in the last two
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   But as both teams have proven, you can't judge future
performances based on the past. Their outlooks change almost daily.
So throw out the Lakers' two defeats of Houston in February and
forget, too, the Rockets' pasting of the Lakers two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of that is kind of for naught, because (now) we're 0-0,''
the Lakers' Derek Fisher said.
</P>
<P>
   And the only question left is which Lakers and Rockets teams
decide to attend the series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the team that you'll see (today) will be the real
one,'' Fisher said. ``I don't really feel like the way we we played
to start the season, or the way we played in the middle or even the
way we played last week will determine how we play. I really feel
like how we come out (today) will set the tone in Game 1. We
understand the importance of home-court advantage. Right now, we're
really confident, and I feel like the team that comes out (today)
will be the one that you'll see in the playoffs.''

CHOOSING THE HOUSE OVER THE ZIP CODE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By LISA PREVOST   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Brently L. Frey made the usual Westchester and Connecticut
stop-offs when he began looking for a home with a feeling of
history two years ago. He toured houses in Danbury, Ridgefield,
Yorktown Heights and Bronxville, but nothing fit his criteria.
</P>
<P>
   Frey, a marketing consultant who works at home, wanted a
property that was truly distinct. And while he could have spent
well over $400,000, the house had to be priced low enough to give
him the option of renovating the interior in his own style.
</P>
<P>
   Flipping through real estate magazines, he noticed a number of
interesting homes for sale in a place he hadn't previously
considered _ Mount Vernon, the city separating the Bronx from
Bronxville. More urban melting pot than sheltered suburbia, what
Mount Vernon lacked in exclusivity it made up for in proximity to
the city (25 minutes by train) and competitive housing prices.
</P>
<P>
   It was in the city's Fleetwood section, a neighborhood of
closely spaced houses and tree-lined streets butting up against the
border of high-priced Bronxville, that Frey found his home _ a
1920s brick colonial with a grand center hall, French doors,
Palladian windows and a tiled solarium with the original wall
fountain. He closed on the house last May at a price that he said
was ``between $350,000 and $400,000.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Like many old gems, this one needed to be dusted off,'' said
the 35-year-old Frey. ``It's like a diamond in the rough. For me,
where I live is not an issue of prestige. It's an issue of my
house, and I want my house to be what I want.''
</P>
<P>
   While so many home buyers studiously heed the cardinal rule of
real estate and elevate location above all other considerations,
Frey represents a different breed of buyer, one for whom house
matters much more than address.
</P>
<P>
   These are the people who are either unwilling or unable to pay
the price for their ideal house in the most sought-after ZIP codes.
So they happily drift across the borders of prime neighborhoods to
lay claim to similar properties in less lofty surroundings. Some
purposely seek out these border communities because they tend to
offer more diversity.
</P>
<P>
   As home prices have soared in the last few years, these buyers
have become all the more evident as they fuel demand in less
prestigious neighborhoods bordering communities where similar homes
carry significantly higher price tags. Some examples of such
communities in Westchester are Fleetwood and the Armour Villa,
Lawrence Park West, Beech Hill, Cedar Knolls and Park Hill
neighborhoods of Yonkers.
</P>
<P>
   In Connecticut, the Black Rock and Brooklawn neighborhoods of
Bridgeport, bordering Fairfield, offer good value for prime
properties. In Norwalk, price differentials still exist in the
Cranbury and Wolfpit neighborhoods of the city along the Westport
border, but the price gap between Norwalk and surrounding towns has
closed considerably, brokers say.
</P>
<P>
   The same is also true on the North Shore of Long Island, where
one-time factory towns like Glen Cove used to offer waterfront
properties at prices much lower than the more exclusive areas, said
Lee E. Koppelman, executive director of the Center for Regional
Policy Studies at the State University of New York at Stony Brook.
The tight real estate market has narrowed price differentials in
Nassau County considerably as ``the areas that would have served as
a contrast have been gentrified,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In New Jersey, South Orange, adjacent to Short Hills, offers
some ``wonderful old housing stock,'' as does the Sleepy Hollow
section of Plainfield, bordering Edison Township, according to
James Hughes, dean of the Rutgers University School of Planning and
Public Policy. In addition, the Montclair Heights neighborhood of
Clifton is an increasingly popular alternative for buyers attracted
to higher-priced Montclair, said Ken Hauser, a sales associate with
Weichert Realtors in Clifton.
</P>
<P>
   In many of these areas, historic or architecturally detailed
homes can cost hundreds of thousands less than their counterparts
just blocks away across community borders. And property taxes, too,
can be thousands of dollars lower. The trade-off for a smaller
mortgage and lower property taxes, however, is often a school
district that compares unfavorably with adjoining towns and perhaps
a higher crime rate.
</P>
<P>
   One factor motivating some of the more venturesome buyers in
these areas, said Dr. Hughes, may be that thanks to the stock
market runup of recent years, the role of the house as the dominant
investment has diminished for more families. ``Their stock holdings
could potentially dwarf their house,'' he said. ``These areas may
appeal to people who aren't so housing-dependent for their nest
egg.''
</P>
<P>
   And it's possible that once the real-estate market slows again,
some who invested heavily in improving homes in secondary areas may
find it difficult to get their money out, noted Julie Garton-Good,
a real estate lecturer and author of ``The Frugal Homeowner's Guide
to Buying, Selling and Improving Your Home'' (Dearborn, 1999).
``There's nothing wrong with people going in and losing money on a
house,'' she said. ``But they need to be aware of it ahead of
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Then again, observed John Clapp, a professor of finance and real
estate at the University of Connecticut's Center for Real Estate in
Storrs, a less predictable degree of risk can also lead to a higher
return. Over the last five years in Norwalk, for example,
condominium prices appreciated an average of 9.2 percent annually,
while condominium prices in Stamford, a lower-risk market than
Norwalk by Clapp's measurements, appreciated an average 3.5 percent
annually, he said.

   Even if buyers consider their house less of an investment than
simply a home, they should still sit down and weigh other
considerations before they begin looking, advises Martin Shenkman,
a New York City real estate lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Private or public schools, commute time _ whatever the most
important amenities _ all those things have to be thought
through,'' Shenkman said. ``People have to sit down and rank their
priorities before they fall all over a house. Then whatever they
decide is fine, once they've made that personal choice.''

   Frey has long since stopped worrying about how much money he's
spending on his house. He is having his prominent corner lot
landscaped, a project that includes adding a garden off the
solarium. He has also paid for installation of a central
air-conditioning system, restoration of some of the French doors,
interior repainting and refinishing of the oak floors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a lot of friends who are real estate agents and, in the
beginning when I was making renovations, I was always asking them,
`Am I spending too much?''' he said. ``And they would say, `You
can't put a dollar value on it. It's not a dollar value, it's a
love value.'''
</P>
<P>
   The average sale price of a house in the Fleetwood area last
year was about one-third of that in Bronxville, said Elizabeth
Lindsey, owner of Lindsey Real Estate in Mount Vernon. For many
buyers who wind up in Fleetwood the cost of renovating a house
there still puts them ahead of what their neighbors in Bronxville
are paying.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you can stand in one of our houses, and it looks the same,
the air smells the same,'' she said. ``And the termites don't stop
at the Bronxville border.''
</P>
<P>
   Sabina Grochowski, 39, and her husband Peter Wyrwinski, 37, both
physicians, scouted out Bronxville, Mamaroneck, Scarsdale,
Larchmont and New Rochelle before friends convinced them to look in
Mount Vernon. Ready to move out of their co-op in Woodmere on Long
Island, they wanted an impressive historic home in good repair with
high ceilings and at least four bedrooms.
</P>
<P>
   They came close to buying a $699,000 Tudor on a tiny lot in
Larchmont. But last December, they found a 1913 Mediterranean-style
home on an acre on Gramatan Avenue in Fleetwood with such lavish
details as stained-glass windows, relief ceilings, mahogany
paneling and an elaborately carved central staircase. They snatched
it up for $648,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think Mount Vernon is one of the few underrated spots in
Westchester,'' Grochowski said.
</P>
<P>
   At about $18,000 a year, the taxes on the property are about the
same as those on other houses they considered, Grochowski said. But
the price is considerably better, she added, even after figuring in
the $40,000 they spent on renovations before moving in last month.
And since the couple have no children, schools were not a
consideration, she said.
</P>
<P>
   As a rule, lower housing prices are partly a reflection of the
perceived quality of the community's schools. Several economic
studies have tried to measure just how much a good school is worth
on the real estate market.
</P>
<P>
   In a summary of those studies published last fall in a report
titled, ``House Prices and the Quality of Public Schools,'' in
Business Review, a Federal Reserve publication, Theodore Crone,
head of the regional economics section of the Federal Reserve Bank
of Philadelphia, noted that because housing prices were affected by
so many other neighborhood characteristics, it's difficult to
separate out the absolute value of a school district. But such a
``school premium'' clearly exists, Crone said, and is often linked
to districts with higher per-pupil expenditures and higher test
scores.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1997 study titled ``Do Better Schools Matter?'' Sandra E.
Black, an economist with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York,
found that even when parents were already paying for a better
school district in the Boston suburbs, they would pay an additional
2.5 percent for a house linked to an elementary school that had
test scores just 5 percent above the others in that district.
</P>
<P>
   Parents who can afford to pay this housing premium, but choose
not to do so, generally make the choice quite consciously. ``A
number of people don't even ask about schools anymore because
they've done the research and they know what they're doing with
their kids,'' said Jane McAfee, a Yonkers sales agent for
Prudential Ragette.
</P>
<P>
   In Yonkers, residents may choose from a variety of magnet
schools in the public school system, or send their children to one
of the many nearby parochial and private schools. Some even pay to
have their children attend public schools in Pelham or Ardsley. The
Beech Hill neighborhood near Scarsdale and the Armour Villa and
Lawrence Park neighborhoods bordering Bronxville have long been
popular with buyers wanting large homes at lower prices. And they
both offer the added bonus of a Scarsdale or Bronxville ZIP code.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people I deal with certainly have looked around and they
know the prices of houses in Scarsdale,'' said Kathleen Kuhnel, an
associate broker at Cardinal Realty in Ardsley. ``Some of them have
kids in private schools anyway, so they figure, `Why pay those
taxes?'''
</P>
<P>
   The differences can be dramatic: A five-bedroom colonial in the
Beech Hill neighborhood with a Scarsdale ZIP code was recently
listed at $385,000 with taxes of $7,700 while in Scarsdale a
colonial of the same size and age was priced at $675,000 with taxes
of almost $14,000.
</P>
<P>
   Prices are even higher in Bronxville, where a 50-year-old,
four-bedroom colonial was recently listed at $699,000 with taxes of
more than $17,000. Just over the border in the Cedar Knolls
neighborhood of Yonkers a similar colonial was listed at $399,000
with taxes of $6,100.

   The Yonkers neighborhood of Park Hill, though not on the border
of Bronxville or Scarsdale, has also caught on in the last few
years. One of the first planned residential suburbs around New
York, Park Hill is a mix of about 200 19th- and early 20th-century
homes on a 300-foot plateau overlooking the Hudson River.
</P>
<P>
   Though the neighborhood has long been popular with artists and
entertainers, its proximity to blighted areas had previously made
it a hard sell with less venturesome spirits. Now, Ms. McAfee has a
list of 25 buyers waiting for houses in Park Hill, where homeowners
say they are united in their determination to restore the
neighborhood to its former glory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was invited to a party by a neighbor before I even moved
in,'' said Mary Jerome, 54, chairwoman of the English as a second
language program for international students at Columbia University.
``People have asked me over to dinner. I've been asked to join the
Park Hill Conservancy. It's really a nice mix of people _ kind
people.''
</P>
<P>
   In January, Ms. Jerome moved into a 100-year-old,
7,000-square-foot Georgian with a view of the Hudson and space for
a garden, exactly the kind of magnificent home she had long dreamed
of owning. Having lived in Manhattan for 27 years, she knew little
about Westchester and nothing of Park Hill when she began looking
at houses. She estimates that the $780,000 sale price on the house
would undoubtedly have been double in Hastings-on-Hudson or
Bronxville, the other communities she had looked into.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never even considered whether I'd be able to get my money
out because I knew this was it,'' she said. ``My daughter's grown,
and this is where I'll stay. Just this morning I went outside and
looked at all the stupid little things I planted, which are just
pathetic. But I love having the green space.''
</P>
<P>
   Empty-nesters are, of course, among the buyers most likely to
trade off a prime address for lower taxes and a better deal. In
Connecticut, for example, Wendy Tremaglio and her husband, Ralph, a
golf pro, opted for Norwalk about two years ago as a money-wise
alternative to Westport, where they raised their daughter. As they
shopped around for a house, their biggest priority was one-level
living to make it easier for their two aging bichon frises to get
around.
</P>
<P>
   By crossing the Westport border into Norwalk's quiet Cranbury
neighborhood the couple were able to get a large two-bedroom ranch
with an attached garage on a third of an acre for just under
$190,000. Taxes are $3,400 a year. They spent about $30,000 on
renovations, including redoing the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   ``But this house in Westport would have probably been about
$400,000 or $500,000,'' said Mrs. Tremaglio, 44. And it's still
only minutes away from her two places of employment _ her family's
store, Dining In, in Norwalk and Riverside-Shavell Realty in
Westport.
</P>
<P>
   More up-and-coming is the Black Rock neighborhood of Bridgeport,
a waterfront community along Black Rock Harbor. ``I've heard of
three or four instances now where people have sold their homes in
Westport and moved to Black Rock,'' said Ken Scala, owner of
Century 21 Scala and Clark in Bridgeport. ``This is a trend now,
it's really happening.''
</P>
<P>
   While Black Rock has most of Bridgeport's highest-priced homes,
prices are still significantly less than the beach neighborhoods of
Fairfield and Westport. For example, a four-bedroom, 1920s Cape Cod
with a view of Long Island Sound recently sold in Black Rock for
$211,500, with estimated taxes of $3,478. A similar-sized 1920's
colonial on a slightly smaller lot in the beach area of Fairfield
recently sold for $400,000, with estimated taxes of $3,500.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, Nikita and Maiko Cheremeteff moved to Black Rock
after 23 years in Westport. Cheremeteff, 66, had just retired as
vice president for manufacturing at Loctite Corp. in Hartford, a
chemical company, and the couple's four children were all living on
their own. So the Cheremeteffs settled into a five-bedroom 1920s
colonial in Black Rock on a hill overlooking the Sound. They paid
$370,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to move to a cheaper house, but a better house, a
nicer house,'' Cheremeteff said. ``And we wanted to be on the
Metro-North line, so the children could come visit easily. We still
do all of our shopping in Westport _ it's only seven minutes away.
There are a lot of people around us who have moved here from
Westport, basically for the same reason.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty years ago, we would have stayed in Westport because the
school system is much better. But now, school is no longer a
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Buyer interest in Black Rock is such that prices have
appreciated more there in the last 12 months than in any other area
of Bridgeport, said Scala, the brokerage owner. ``There's a real
sense of community there,'' he said. ``Neighbors gather at the
Harbor View Market _ it's kind of the local meeting place.''
</P>
<P>
   To a great extent, the empty-nesters moving downmarket are
encouraged to to so by a strong market and a seemingly endless
supply of another breed of buyers, those willing to pay top dollar
for the most desirable addresses. Indeed, it was a developer who
bought the Cheremeteffs' 1970s split-level on two acres in
Westport. He promptly razed the house to make way for a $2.6
million mansion.
